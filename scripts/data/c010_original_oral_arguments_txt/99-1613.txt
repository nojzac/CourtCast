Kevin Murphy.          Mr. Ohler.              ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID L. OHLER               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MR. OHLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleasethe Court:          This case presents the question of whether aninmate has a freestanding right to provide legalassistance to another inmate which entitles correspondencefrom that inmate to special protection under the First1011121314    Amendment.15              With respect to the facts of this case, the16    question may be phrased --17              QUESTION:  There's some discussion in the briefs18    about the penalties that were imposed on the prisoner by19    virtue of his writing the letter that he wrote.  I guess20    those are not at issue here?21              MR. OHLER:  I don't believe they are, Your22    Honor.  In fact, I believe the respondent in his brief at23    page 10 indicated that Mr. Murphy did not seek expungement24    of the disciplinary action that was taken against him.25              We believe, and with respect to the facts of31 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425this case, the question may be whether an inmate can evadecensorship of communication and discipline for insolentlanguage contained in a letter to another inmate whichalso contains legal advice.          If an inmate does not have a free --          QUESTION:  Can we take it as a given that thiswas insolent language, because, you know, I'm somewhatdubious whether this was insolent language, but that's agiven in this case?          MR. OHLER:  We believe it's a given.  We don'tbelieve that Mr. Murphy contested whether or not there wassufficient evidence to find that he was insolent, and infact --          QUESTION:  He had the opportunity to contestthat?  He could --          MR. OHLER:  He did, Your Honor, and as Iindicated to the question from Justice O'Connor, he hasnot sought expungement of that disciplinary infraction.          If an inmate does not have a freestanding rightto receive legal assistance, as this Court stated in Lewisv. Casey, then the corollary must be true, an inmate doesnot have a freestanding right to render legal assistance.          It is petitioners' position that legal advice isentitled to no greater protection than speech in generalin a prison context.4 1              QUESTION:  Mr. Ohler, may I ask if -- at least I 2    understood that the position of the United States is not 3    the same as the one that you are telling us about, nothing 4    else being at issue but the insolence and the other 5    charge.  I thought that the position of the United States 6    was that this should be remanded for consideration of 7    those factors of that part of the case in light of Turner 8    v. Safley.  Is that wrong? 9              MR. OHLER:  That is the position of the United10    States, and that is a position that we disagree with.11    It's our position that once the cloak of special12    protection is removed from the legal advice, the legal13    advice privilege as we termed it in the brief, the14    question is whether or not legal advice under the Turner15    analysis, or whether or not the prison's disciplinary16    policy under the Turner analysis is reasonably related to17    a legitimate penalogical interest, and we believe it is.18              Once that determination has been made, that the19    policy is valid and, in fact, the respondent has conceded20    that, he's not contested the facial validity of that21    policy, but once the validity of that policy under Turner22    is determined, then the only question, we believe, is23    whether or not Mr. Murphy in fact violated the policy and,24    as I mentioned to Justice Scalia's question, he has not25    raised that question, and that's a due process question5 1    that was not raised below. 2              In Turner itself the court did not distinguish 3    between legal communications and other types of 4    communication between inmates, and there is no logical 5    reason why legal communication should be entitled to any 6    different standard of review than other types of speech, 7    including political speech. 8              QUESTION:  Well, suppose you have a prison 9    where, in a disciplinary proceeding, not a criminal charge10    but a disciplinary proceeding, one inmate, as the custom,11    often represents another.  Do you think then the so-called12    inmate law clerk would have a privilege to communicate13    with the inmate that he's representing?14              It's maybe a little hard for you to answer,15    because we have to assume a lot of regulations and stuff16    that are not in play, but just to flat out say that17    there's never this right is somewhat -- goes somewhat far,18 I think.19              MR. OHLER:  Well, in this case, and this case is20    an example, perhaps, of the hypothetical you pose, but21    Mr. Murphy had the opportunity in this case to communicate22    to the Inmate Tracy.  He could have provided the legal23    advice that was contained in the letter, don't plead24    guilty, have your attorney get a hold of me, I've got some25    information.  Inmate Murphy went beyond that and --6 1              QUESTION:  No, but my question is, does he have 2    a right to send the communication?  You say there's no 3    right at all, we don't have to get into insolence or 4    interpretation of the letter, there's just simply no 5    right, but I'm suggesting that in some instances there6 might be. 7              MR. OHLER:  With respect to inmate-to-inmate 8    communications it's our position, no, that there is no 9    right for inmate-to-inmate communications.10              QUESTION:  Even when one inmate's representing11    another in, say, a grievance proceeding, or, pardon me, a12    disciplinary proceeding?13              MR. OHLER:  Not with respect to communication14    under the Turner opinion, Your Honor.15              QUESTION:  Well, if -- are you answering your16    question limited simply to sending letters, or are you17    saying that one inmate can be assigned to defend another,18    and the prison may preclude all communication between them19    of any sort whatsoever?  Are you saying that?2021    that.22232425    written -- your answer to Justice Kennedy is limited7MR. OHLER:  No, Your Honor, we're not sayingQUESTION:  Okay.MR. OHLER:  No.QUESTION:  So you're limiting it simply to 1    simply to written statements? 2              MR. OHLER:  Correct. 3              QUESTION:  And you take the position, then, that 4    if an inmate were, by the prison, assigned to provide 5    legal assistance to another prisoner, that no written 6    communication could be sent from the one providing the 7    assistance to the other prisoner? 8              MR. OHLER:  Under Turner, I believe Turner can 9    be read that way.  Under the facts of this case, the only10    thing that the prison was punishing was the insolent11    language contained in the communication, and the prison in12    this case did permit that communication to occur between13    Inmate Murphy, who is a law clerk, and Inmate Tracy.14              QUESTION:  What possible interest would the15    prison have in prohibiting -- assuming you allowed an16    inmate to provide legal services to another, which17    sometimes I understand happens, what interest of the18    prison is there in making sure that it is never done in19    written form, which the prison can then read?20              MR. OHLER:  With respect to an inmate law clerk21    program, as occurred here --22              QUESTION:  Yes.23              MR. OHLER:  -- we permitted, the prison24    permitted communications between --25              QUESTION:  But you just told me that you would8 1    not allow any written communication, even though a law 2    clerk assignment had been made. 3              MR. OHLER:  I'm sorry, I may have -- I misspoke 4    or misunderstood.  I was simply saying that Turner seemed 5    to imply that with respect to inmate-to-inmate 6    correspondence, that communications could be prohibited by 7    a prison and, in Turner, in fact, the regulation at issue, 8    which was at the Lorenz Correctional Facility in Missouri, 9    as practiced at that particular prison, precluded legal10    communications, and --11              QUESTION:  Well, you don't have to go that far12    in this case, nor do we.13              I mean, really, all you're asserting in this14    case is that normal prison regulations, including those15    against displaying insolence towards the prison guards, do16    not become suspended when there are communications17    involving legal representation.  Isn't that as far as we18    would have to go in order to give you all that you're19    interested in here?20              MR. OHLER:  That is correct, Justice Scalia.21              QUESTION:  Well, I'm slightly mixed up, because22    I thought, suppose that Inmate A wants to represent Inmate23    B, but he isn't.  I thought you were saying that's this24    case, and there's no special right to be a lawyer.  You25    don't have a constitutional right to get to be a lawyer,91 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425any more than you get to be an architect, right?          MR. OHLER:  Correct.          QUESTION:  But there's a different situation.  Ais representing B.  In that case, B, not A, has a right tolegal representation, which may involve sending letters.Is that right?          MR. OHLER:  If we're going to term thecommunication that occurred here as representation --          QUESTION:  This has nothing to do with that, Ithought.  Am I not right that A is not representing B inthis case, he'd just like to?          MR. OHLER:  That's correct, yes.          QUESTION:  All right.  So if we're writing anopinion, I guess, shouldn't I be careful, drawing on yourpersonal view, not some case but your view as a lawyer, tomake certain that we don't say, we don't talk about thesituation where B, who is the person who needs a lawyer,he may well have a right to get communications from hislawyer that is different from the ordinary right just tospeak.  Am I right?          MR. OHLER:  Yes, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Okay.  Now, what about the case wherewe have an association of people who help to providelawyers to inmates?          I'm obviously thinking of NAACP v. Button, for                            10 1    example, and maybe that association of lawyers, or people 2    who want to give lawyers to inmates, has a few inmates in 3    it.  Might they have a special right? 4              MR. OHLER:  Your Honor, with respect to -- 5              QUESTION:  Do you want to say we don't have to 6    get into that here? 7              MR. OHLER:  I don't think we have to get into 8    that.  I think the NAACP cases and the In re Primus line 9    of cases dealt with access to courts.10              In fact, I think this Court used that language11    in the Primus case, dealt with access to courts by free12    citizens, and providing free citizens with the tools to13    gain a foothold into the court and to advance their civil14    rights, and there is a large amount of jurisprudence from15    this Court relative to the right of access as it applies16    to inmates, and we believe that that jurisprudence17    controls, relative to the right of access by inmates in a18    prison setting.19              QUESTION:  Would it have been the same offense,20    in your view, if the -- was it Murphy, had sent the letter21    not to Tracy but to Tracy's assigned counsel?22              MR. OHLER:  That would be another matter and, in23    fact, that correspondence could have occurred, and the24    difference between that situation and the situation that's25    presented in this case is the correspondence that is going111    outside the prison, and so it's -- the confrontational2    aspect of Inmate Murphy's letter is not the same, because3    it's being sent outside the prison.4              QUESTION:  Suppose it were sent to an5    investigative reporter?6              MR. OHLER:  That would have been fine.  Once7    again, we don't have that confrontational aspect that8    occurred when this correspondence remained within the9 prison.101112131415161718    read?19          QUESTION:  Well, in both of Justice Ginsburg'shypotheticals, I assume the prison authorities would readthe letter first, or am I wrong about that?  It's ahypothetical, but I assume -- that's your regulation.Don't you read everything that goes out?          MR. OHLER:  No.  Our policy permits outgoingcorrespondence to go out, and is only --                QUESTION:  Whether or not it's read.  It's not21    types of information that would be detrimental to the22    prison, so in most cases outgoing correspondence is not23    read.24              QUESTION:  What is the confrontation that you're25    talking about?  I may not understand what you mean.12                MR. OHLER:  It's only read if there's a20    reasonable probability to believe that it contains certain1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. OHLER:  Well --          QUESTION:  You spoke about confrontationalaspect.  What do you mean by that?          MR. OHLER:  The language contained in the letterwas disparaging about Correctional Officer Galle.          QUESTION:  Yes.          MR. OHLER:  And it was a challenge to theauthority of Correctional Officer Galle in particular,but correctional staff in general, and it's that --          QUESTION:  Well, it was a challenge to hisexercise, or as the letter claimed, his abuse of101112    authority.13141516171819202122232425          MR. OHLER:  Correct, and there were also othercomments in there concerning his sexual orientation whichthis Court I believe in Thornburgh recognized as asecurity concern in the prison context.          QUESTION:  Right.  What's the confrontation?Are you talking about the confrontation between the personwho writes the letter and the prison censor who reads it?          MR. OHLER:  No.  I think the confrontationalaspect of that, and the challenge to authority, goesbetween Inmate Murphy and Officer Galle.          QUESTION:  Well, Officer Galle never saw theletter, could not have been, I take it, expected to seethe letter.  The only person who could be expected to see131    the letter, other than the recipient, was the prison2    censor.3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. OHLER:  The problem is, we don't know whathappens to the letter once it gets -- assuming that theletter was transmitted to Inmate Tracy, that letter couldhave been --          QUESTION:  Yes, but you're talking about theconfrontational aspect of the letter.          QUESTION:  I thought you meant that itencourages the recipient to become confrontational withthe guards.          MR. OHLER:  It does that also, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  It does that also?          MR. OHLER:  Yes.          QUESTION:  Oh.  But that's not what you meant byits confrontational aspect.  Then I share Justice Souter'sperplexity.  I don't understand who he's confronting.          I mean, I can understand how it's not good forprison discipline to allow prisoners to incite one anotheragainst the guards.  If that's what you're talking about,it makes sense, but how one letter from one prisoner toanother prisoner confronts the prison guards, that'sbeyond me.          MR. OHLER:  And that's one aspect of it, andthat is a concern, is that in fact this particular inmate141 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9that the letter was sent to had just recently assaulted acorrectional officer.  This letter would tend to inciteInmate Tracy.          The other concern is what this Court termed aripple effect when --          QUESTION:  More so than if his lawyer had toldhim, his lawyer said, I got this letter from a fellowinmate, what do you think of it, or if an investigativereporter asked him?  Would it be less -- would that beless of a problem?1011121314151617    prisoners.18              MR. OHLER:  That's correct.19              QUESTION:  More or less.20              MR. OHLER:  Yes, Your Honor.21              Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve my22    remaining time.          MR. OHLER:  There are -- there still areconcerns there, Justice --          QUESTION:  You have no control over the lawyers,I take it.MR. OHLER:  That's correct.QUESTION:  You do have control over the23              QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Ohler.24              MR. OHLER:  Thank you.25              QUESTION:  Ms. Millett, we'll hear from you.151 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425             ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA MILLETT     ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,                SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS          MS. MILLETT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          The court of appeals' categorical protection ofinmate legal advice from rules that reasonably regulateall other prison correspondence is inconsistent both withthis Court's precedents and with realities of prisonmanagement.  In our view prisoners -- and in this Court'sview, prisoners have a right of access to the courts topress their own grievances and claims, but this Court hasnever recognized a freestanding First Amendment right onthe part of other inmates to get involved in each others'litigation efforts.  That is particularly true when thelitigating inmate is already represented by an attorney.          In Lewis v. Casey, this Court held that whileinmates must be allowed to bring suits challenging theirown convictions and conditions of confinement, impairmentof any other litigating capacity, and that would includeserving as a legal advisor, is simply going to beincidental and perfectly constitutional consequences ofconviction and incarceration.          QUESTION:  Ms. Millett, will you clarify for uswhat the United States would remand?  What would be open16 1    to the court below to consider, assuming we accept your 2    first position that there is no right of, to represent -- 3    one inmate to another to represent each other?  There's no 4    attorney-client relationship that stems from any 5    constitutional guarantee.  Let's say we accept that.  What 6    would you remand on? 7              MS. MILLETT:  The remand would be on an as- 8    applied challenge to this particular communication.  It 9    would not be a request, as the Ninth Circuit found here,10    for categorical protection of all inmate communications of11    legal advice.  The question would be whether application12    of the insolence regulation to this particular13    communication, looking at its particular content, would be14    consistent with the First Amendment under a --15              QUESTION:  But am I wrong, or was the petitioner16    wrong in suggesting that that had not been raised?17              MS. MILLETT:  Well, our understanding is that18    what was not raised is whether or not this communication19    fell within the definition of insolence or violation of a20    due process, or interference with a due process hearing21    under the terms of the regulations, and that's not what22    we're saying should be remanded.  What we're saying should23    be remanded is whether there's an as-applied24    constitutional challenge to application of those25    regulations to this communication.17 1              QUESTION:  Which would be based on that same 2    thing.  I mean, what would an as-applied challenge be 3    based on unless it is the fact that in fact this 4    regulation wasn't violated? 5              MS. MILLETT:  No, you could have -- prisons 6    could have a regulation.  For example, they could decide 7    that insolence could includes any, for example, criticism 8    of a guard, so that -- and those might well pass facial 9    constitutionality under a Turner v. Safley analysis, but10    you could still find that a comment to a guard that, you11    know, that's a bad hair cut, would fall within the meaning12    of insolence, and so would fall within the regulation, but13    would not survive a Turner v. Safley as-applied analysis14    because it would not be a security --15              QUESTION:  Are you suggesting that there are two16    levels of application of Turner, that even if a regulation17    on its face, so to speak, is valid under Turner, it could18    be invalid as applied?19              MS. MILLETT:  Absolutely, and I think that's20    what -- for example, in Thornburgh v. Abbott this Court21    upheld regulations as applied to the public generally --22    I'm sorry, not as applied, facially, the application of a23    prison regulation limiting the types of publications and24    magazines that could come into a prison, but remanded for25    as-applied review of whether publication by publication18 1    the prison's decision to keep a particular publication out 2    violated the First Amendment, and that's all that we think 3    the remand here would need to encompass.  But the 4    important thing to keep in mind, and the main problem with 5    the Ninth Circuit -- 6              QUESTION:  Did he raise that question below? 7              MS. MILLETT:  That's our understanding of the 8    complaint, and it's based in part on the magistrate 9    judge's analysis which is in the petition appendix, where10    they talk about the failure of the State to come forward11    at that stage with information showing why this particular12    communication was a threat to security.13              QUESTION:  Well, I take it --14              QUESTION:  So in your view there is --15              QUESTION:  -- that is going to whether the16    regulation was violated, whether this particular17    communication was, indeed, insolence towards the guard.18    Isn't that perfectly explicable as raising the issue of19    whether the regulation was violated?20              MS. MILLETT:  Well, we understood that argument21    in the complaint, that analysis by the magistrate judge22    and respondent's, including respondent's arguments here23    about whether, you know, how this particular communication24    does or does not challenge security interests as an as-25    applied challenge, but we're not here because we have a19 1    strong interest on that.  If we've misunderstood the 2    record, and there is no as-applied challenge in the case, 3    then there would be no basis for a remand. 4              QUESTION:  Is another way of saying what you're 5    trying -- maybe I don't quite get it, that even though he 6    doesn't have a First Amendment right to act as a lawyer 7    and practice law in the prison context, he had a First 8    Amendment right to write this particular letter? 9              MS. MILLETT:  Yes.  Well, our position is that10    there's no special First Amendment status accorded to this11    communication because it was legal advice.12              QUESTION:  Right, but just under ordinary First13    Amendment review --14              MS. MILLETT:  Exactly.  Exactly.  That -- the15    crux of our point is that Turner v. Safley is a sufficient16    test to review all prison regulations, and --17              QUESTION:  In your view there's a First18    Amendment right for prisoners to communicate with each19    other?  I mean, does -- that has to be the beginning20    point, based on my understanding of your argument.21              MS. MILLETT:  Well, our position is that inmates22    could always claim that and then the burden would be on23    the prison to show in the circumstances that there is or24 is not.25For most of the time there's a lot of prisoner                  201    communication that goes on that does not affect prison2    security.3              QUESTION:  But that's a very substantial4    holding.5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  Yes.          QUESTION:  You're asking us to have afoundational proposition that there's a First Amendmentright for prisoners to communicate.          QUESTION:  We've never held that.          MS. MILLETT:  The -- I think the premise of therecognition that you read would be reviewed under Turnerv. Safley, and I think a regulation that said, prisonersshall never, under all circumstances shall never speak toanother inmate, no inmate shall ever speak to anotherinmate, would have to be reviewed under Turner v. Safley,and the Government would have to come in and show why anycommunication at all between inmates is a threat to101112131415161718    security.19              QUESTION:  There's another point, too, that if20    the prison regulations do permit communication, there is21    still -- there arguably could be a First Amendment right22    to say certain things in those communications without --23    in other words, they say, we'll let you write letters, but24    we're going to tell you exactly what you can say.  That's25    a rather strange view.  Well, anyway --21 1              MS. MILLETT:  I'm sorry if I misunderstood your 2    question.  Our only position is that there certainly may 3    be circumstances, in fact, in which it would be 4    appropriate for a prison to say, there shall be no 5    communications at all between inmates, either curfew 6    times, or lockdown situations, or high security -- 7              QUESTION:  Well, I thought this involved such a 8    situation.  The person to whom respondent wanted to 9    communicate was in a maximum security section.10              MS. MILLETT:  He was.11              QUESTION:  And I had understood the prison did12    not permit communication from prisoners in other parts of13    the prison with lesser restrictions to prisoners in the14    maximum security.  Am I wrong?15              MS. MILLETT:  Our understanding is that he was16    allowed to write a letter to this inmate, so there was not17    a complete ban on communication between people, inmates in18    respondent's category and this high risk, or this maximum19    security unit.  There was not a complete ban on20    communications.  It was just the content of this letter.21              Clearly, any communication that is written22    between prisoners must be consistent with valid23    penalogical limitations on those, and those would include24    that communications not be insolent or incite one inmate25    against another, inmate against another or against guards22 1    or prison staff. 2              The important thing, we think, to keep in mind 3    with respect to the Ninth Circuit's rule is that the 4    Turner v. Safley test is sufficient for purposes of 5    analyzing any First Amendment claims to speech or other 6    rights invoked by prisoners and that beyond that, prison 7    correspondence involving legal advice does not have any 8    special exemption from those rules, should not be analyzed 9    under any separate standard and, in fact, can present the10    exact same dangers that routine correspondence does.11              They can -- according special status, as the12    Ninth Circuit has done, to inmate correspondence could13    allow that type of correspondence to become a ready14    vehicle for secretly coded communications and other15    illicit communications.  Jailhouse lawyers are frequently16    a menace to prison discipline, and they could be allowed17    through special treatment to set up an order or a18    hierarchy that would compete with the prison order system.19              In addition, the circulation among inmates of20    potentially volatile allegations and accusations can, in21    the judgment of prison officials, exacerbate the already22    extremely tense relations between prison officials and23    inmates and that, much like in Jones v. North Carolina24    Prisoners Labor Union, where this Court held that prisoner25    communications, prisoner assertions of First Amendment23 1    speech and association rights that are focused on 2    encouraging an increase in adversarial relations between 3    prison and staff can be regulated and restricted 4    consistent with legitimate penalogical objectives. 5              And finally, it's important to keep in mind that 6    there are ample alternative channels for inmates to 7    communicate information bearing on a case. They can 8    communicate with attorneys, Government officials, courts 9    and other members of the public.  They may bring their own10    grievances or lawsuits.  The appropriate analysis, we11    think, is Turner v. Safley and, beyond that, the -- to the12    extent someone is concerned about information getting into13    courts.  Thank you.14              QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Millett.15              Mr. Renz, we'll hear from you.16                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY T. RENZ17                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT18              MR. RENZ:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may19    it please the Court:20              It appears to me that the State prison here is21    proposing a change in the Turner rule which the Turner22    opinion does not accommodate.  As I understand the State's23    position, so long as their rules are neutrally drawn, and24    so long as the rules on their face satisfy Turner, then25    they are free to apply them in any manner in which they24 1    deem fit.  I don't think that Turner says that.  I don't 2    think that Turner nor Abbott contemplate that. 3              This is an as-applied case, it was an as- 4    applied case, and it always has been an as-applied case, 5    with the single exception that Mr. Murphy challenged the 6    rules on their face as vague, and the vagueness issue, the 7    facial vagueness issue is not before this Court.  This 8    case is strictly about punishment of content of speech. 9              I think there are several issues here that are10    not in dispute.  First, this is speech that, if uttered11    outside the prison, is without question protected by the12    First Amendment.  Second, this communication was permitted13    within the prison.  That is, Mr. Murphy was permitted14    under the prison's regulations to write to Mr. Tracy.  And15    third, if these two things are true, as they are, then16    Turner and Abbott provide the analytical framework for17 this case.18              QUESTION:  Well, I thought the Ninth Circuit19    articulated at least some freestanding First Amendment20    right of a fellow prisoner to offer legal advice to21    another prisoner.  At least there's language to that22    effect in its opinion.23              MR. RENZ:  I think that the language in the24    Ninth Circuit's opinion --25              QUESTION:  Do you defend that as a proposition251 here? 23 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. RENZ:  Well, I would contend, Your Honor,that the Ninth Circuit was being somewhat circular whenthey said that the prison's emphasis is at a low edge, ebbwhen the language is legal advice.          QUESTION:  No, but --          QUESTION:  Well, do you contend -- excuse me.Do you contend that the prisoner has a freestanding FirstAmendment right to offer legal advice to another prisoner?          MR. RENZ:  No.  No, we do not contend that.          QUESTION:  But that's the only --          QUESTION:  The question presented.          QUESTION:  That's the question that waspresented.  Justice O'Connor put the question to you.That's the question in the blue brief.  That's the end ofthe case.          MR. RENZ:  That's not the end of the case, YourHonor.  I'm the respondent, and this Court may affirm thejudgment of the Ninth Circuit on any grounds that appearin the record.          QUESTION:  Well, but I mean, this is thequestion that we're interested in.          MR. RENZ:  Yes, but this in my view is astraightforward Turner application.          QUESTION:  Well, but do you have an answer?  Are                            26 1    you saying that you agree that the question presented, 2    does the First Amendment of the United States Constitution 3    grant a State prison inmate an independent right to assist 4    another State prison inmate, do you agree that that is not 5    a correct statement of the law? 6              MR. RENZ:  I would agree with that, yes, but 7    what we have here is, we have a communication permitted by 8    the prison that contained information and contained legal 9    advice, and Mr. Murphy was punished for what he said.  He10    was punished for what he said and the prison has never,11    ever stated why that punishment advanced the interests it12    articulates.  It has never shown the connection between13    its articulated interests and the punishment of14    Mr. Murphy, and that is exactly what Turner and Abbott15    require.  That has never happened here.16              QUESTION:  Mr. Renz, would you clarify -- what17    we were told before was that you had waived all of that,18    that you were not contesting the disciplinary action that19    was taken against him.  I think that's what we were told20    was your position.21              MR. RENZ:  I'm not sure --22              QUESTION:  We were told that you were not23    contesting the disciplinary action that was taken.24              MR. RENZ:  If the question is whether we are25    seeking relief to purge the discipline, that's right.271 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  Well then, what sort of relief areyou seeking?          MR. RENZ:  We're seeking declaratory relief,Your Honor, that says the prison may not do this withoutdemonstrating some sort of connection between itsinterests and what it has done.  Remember, it has punishedMr. Murphy.          QUESTION:  But you said you're not challengingthe punishment.  That's what's so odd about this.  Thereference -- Murphy does not seek expungement of hisrecord, the record, I take it, being the record of his101112    discipline.1314151617    case.18              MR. RENZ:  Well, Mr. Murphy continues to be19    imprisoned.  He continues to give legal advice for the20    prisoners.  He's seeking, and sought in this lawsuit21    prospective relief.22              QUESTION:  But that's -- I think what's23    bothering us is, we understand that there very well may24    properly be requests for declaratory relief of a general25    sort, but what you're seeking here apparently isn't28MR. RENZ:  That's correct, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Well, if you're not challenging that,then I don't understand what interest you have in anabstract statement of what the law should be in another 1    declaratory relief as a general sort.  It's a declaration 2    that an as-applied challenge, this challenge, this 3    communication, this instance only, is valid because 4    there's a First Amendment violation, and yet with respect 5    to this specific instance you're not asking for any 6    relief.  It doesn't seem to fit into any of our recognized 7    categories of litigable issues. 8              MR. RENZ:  I think I understand the question. 9    Mr. Murphy wants to continue giving legal advice without10    the fear of sanctions, and a declaration that the prison11    may not do this without demonstrating some connection12    between its punishment and the interests it articulates --13              QUESTION:  Okay, but is -- I'm sorry.  I was14    going to say, as a general proposition, you've already got15    that in Turner and Safley, and you either want something16    specific to this case, though without any relief in this17    particular case, or you want something broader, and when18    you state what the broader relief is that you might want,19    it seems to be about the same level of generality as20    Turner and Safley itself, so we're stuck as to what we can21    do for you --22              MR. RENZ:  I see.23              QUESTION:  -- even if we accept your position.24              MR. RENZ:  The -- let me catch up.  The -- Mr.25    Murphy wrote this letter.  He said these words.  He wants29 1    to continue to be able to say these words without fear of 2    sanction.  Saying to the prison that you may not punish 3    these words without showing us more means that he is armed 4    with something in the future when the prison comes to him5 and says -- 6              QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Renz, you say he wants to 7    continue to say these words, but I take it you don't mean 8    exactly these words.  I mean, he's not going to report 9    exactly the same incidents if he wants to write to another10    inmate.  You mean, a letter like this?11              MR. RENZ:  A letter like this.  Remember, the12    prison has acted to apply its rules in a certain way.13    It's extended the scope of its rule to encompass this kind14    of speech.  Now, the prison is free to do that so long as15    they show a connection between its interests and the16    extension of the rule and the punishment of Mr. Murphy,17    but they haven't done that here.18              QUESTION:  Well, if you say that you're in19    agreement that there's no special right to render legal20    advice, then all this is is a question whether or not this21    communication, or other communications like them, can, for22    general purposes be suppressed, and the fact that he wants23    to give legal advice, he doesn't have a right to do that.24              MR. RENZ:  I think that's --25              QUESTION:  I just don't know what -- this is30 1    just a routine prison disciplinary case once you concede 2    the main proposition on which we granted the case. 3              MR. RENZ:  Well, he certainly has no special 4    right.  I mean, he was hired and retained as a legal 5    clerk.  He was under the practices of the prison permitted 6    to communicate and assist Mr. Murphy, even though 7    Mr. Murphy may have had counsel. 8              But the question here is whether he can be 9    punished by the prison for his communication, and the10    prison has taken a rule, expanded its scope to encompass11    Mr. Murphy's speech, and they've not articulated a basis12 for it.13              QUESTION:  Turner v. Safley dealt with a14    constitutional right, I mean, you know, the right to15    marry, and you know, rested on the proposition that it is16    settled that a prison inmate retains those constitutional17    rights that are not inconsistent with his status as a18    prisoner.  Once you've acknowledged that there is no19    constitutional right to provide legal advice to another20    prisoner, which was the question presented, how does21    Turner v. Safley come into play?22              MR. RENZ:  Well, I disagree with your statement,23    Justice Scalia.  There is a constitutional right to24    provide advice to another prisoner.  The question is25    whether it survives a Turner analysis.  In this case, it311 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425survives the Turner analysis.          QUESTION:  Now you have me confused.  I thoughtyou acknowledged, in response to Justice O'Connor, thatthere is no constitutional right to assist another Stateprison inmate with a pending court case.          MR. RENZ:  As I understood Justice O'Connor'squestion, it was whether or not there was a special, sortof elevated right, and I would have to agree --          QUESTION:  A freestanding First Amendment rightto represent another prisoner, and I thought you told meno, there is not, that you did not defend --          MR. RENZ:  Then --          QUESTION:  -- what it was the Ninth Circuitpanel said.          MR. RENZ:  Then, Justice O'Connor, I apologize,because I misunderstood your question.  If --          QUESTION:  Well, are you defending the NinthCircuit, or are you not?  Do you adopt their reasoning,and are you prepared to defend it?          MR. RENZ:  I'm prepared to defend it.  If we --          QUESTION:  Let's rephrase that, because I readthe question to you before and I thought I got a differentanswer.  Let's make absolutely sure where you stand onthis thing.          The question presented is, does the First                            321 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Amendment to the United States Constitution grant a Stateprison inmate an independent and freestanding right toassist another State prison inmate with a pending courtcase even if the State supplies other forms of legalassistance to the prison inmate?          Now, is that a correct statement of the law oran incorrect statement of the law?          MR. RENZ:  I -- as I construe it, I think it's afair statement, and that is that were Mr. Murphy outsidethe prison, he would have an independent and freestandingright --          QUESTION:  But he's inside the prison.          MR. RENZ:  That's correct, and once he is insidethe prison we then engage in the Turner analysis.  I'm notsure if --          QUESTION:  I'm at a loss to --          MR. RENZ:  I'm at a loss, too.  If we take --what I'm saying is that we don't have an independentfreestanding right that survives, or stands outside ofTurner.  I think that is a correct statement.          QUESTION:  Well then you really don't defend theNinth Circuit's decision.          MR. RENZ:  To the extent that they create aright outside of Turner --QUESTION:  Okay.33 1              MR. RENZ:  -- but they didn't do that.  They 2    engaged in a straightforward Turner analysis. 3              QUESTION:  They did have a whole paragraph 4    where -- I thought a whole paragraph where the Ninth 5    Circuit says there's a special right that every prisoner 6    has to represent other prisoners.  I mean, it's on -- it's 7    appendix page 9 here.  It says, the prison discipline of 8    Murphy implicates the First Amendment right recognized by 9    this Court in Rizzo, where we held the provision of legal10    assistance to fellow inmates is an activity protected by11    the First Amendment.  And then they said, several of our12    sister circuits have refused to recognize a constitutional13    right to assist others.14              MR. RENZ:  Yes.15              QUESTION:  It's not a right to get assistance.16    It's a right to assist others.  Everybody has a17    constitutional right to be a lawyer.18              MR. RENZ:  Justice Breyer, that's right.19              QUESTION:  That's how I read it.20              MR. RENZ:  That's right.21              QUESTION:  I didn't know you had that right, and22    I haven't seen it.23              MR. RENZ:  But the holding in Rizzo was, Rizzo24    was a retaliation case decided at the pleadings stage, and25    in that case the prisoner was free to assist other341 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425prisoners in his particular prison.          QUESTION:  Do you think there is a separate,freestanding right to assist others in pressing legalclaims?  That's where A wants to represent B.  I'm nottalking about B's right to get assistance.  I'm talkingabout A's right to go to somebody and say, I want torepresent you.  Do you think there's a special,freestanding, First Amendment right to do that?          MR. RENZ:  To provide assistance?          QUESTION:  Yes.          MR. RENZ:  Not outside of Turner.          QUESTION:  Oh, I mean -- all right.  I didn'tread Turner recently, so don't say not outside of Turner.Just say yes or no.          MR. RENZ:  Well, yes, there is in the sense thatwe have the same kind of right outside of prison.          QUESTION:  Is there?  I didn't know there was.I mean, everyone has a right to go assist other people asa lawyer?          MR. RENZ:  Not as a lawyer, Your Honor, but ofcourse --          QUESTION:  Do you have -- what is there, aspecial First Amendment right to be a lawyer?  I don'tknow what it is.          MR. RENZ:  Well, if --                            351              QUESTION:  I'm not saying there isn't one.2              MR. RENZ:  Oh, no, I understand.3              QUESTION:  I'm just saying I'm not familiar with4 it. 56789          MR. RENZ:  If the Brotherhood of Trainmen cansend a union secretary to another trainman and say, don'tsettle this case, go see this lawyer, and that isprotected under the First Amendment --          QUESTION:  You mean, there's a special FirstAmendment right to do that?  I mean, maybe there is.   Ijust haven't seen it.  I don't know.  I'm not familiarwith it.  What case -- is there a case that says that?101112131415161718192021222324    association?25              QUESTION:  Right.          MR. RENZ:  It's the Brotherhood of Trainmen,Your Honor.          QUESTION:  And there you have a special right togive somebody legal assistance that's different from yourordinary First Amendment right?          MR. RENZ:  No, not different from the ordinaryFirst Amendment.          QUESTION:  You don't think that stemmed fromsome labor union contract dealing with discipline ofemployees and union members?MR. RENZ:  I -- in terms of the right of36 1              MR. RENZ:  I don't think necessarily because of 2    Primus and -- 3              QUESTION:  In the private world, outside the 4    labor contract, no labor union agreement, and you just 5    have a nonlawyer who wants to give legal advice to 6    somebody else.  Is there some freestanding First Amendment 7    right to give legal advice?  You don't have to be a 8    lawyer.  You have some right to go give legal advice to9 somebody?10              MR. RENZ:  I would suggest, Your Honor, that11    the -- it depends upon what we call legal advice.  Someone12    on the street can say, gee, you know, this car ran over13    you, your case is worth a lot of money, you should go see14    a lawyer.  That's legal advice, but it certainly isn't the15    sort of legal advice that we'd consider in terms of what16    lawyers give.17              This is much the same character of the advice18    that Murphy gave.  Gee, I know about these things about19    Mr. Galle.  You should have your lawyer get a hold of me20 on this.21              QUESTION:  That sounds like somebody saying, I'm22    a witness, a potential witness for you, but not that I23    have a right to give you legal advice.24              MR. RENZ:  And part of that communication from25    Mr. Murphy said that exactly, Justice Ginsburg.  He said,37 1    this happened to me, and that makes him a competent 2    witness. 3              QUESTION:  Well, it seems to me that you're 4    arguing for some kind of a right for somebody with 5    relevant information to convey it to someone who's in 6    trouble, but that's not the theory that the Ninth 7    Amendment, Ninth Circuit proceeded on, and I'm wondering 8    where they got it from.  Was it in your briefs?  Did you 9    argue that theory to the Ninth Circuit, that there is a10    right of one person to represent another?11              MR. RENZ:  I suspect that it may have come from12    our argument in which we articulated that the prison has13    no legitimate interest in regulating a communication that14    is intended for a court outside the prison.  I can't say.15    I don't see that specifically in the Ninth Circuit's16 opinion.17              QUESTION:  Would you object to an opinion from18    us that says the following?  There are passages in the19    Ninth Circuit's opinion that suggests there exists a20    special, separate, freestanding right of a prisoner to21    represent someone else, even if he doesn't want it, or22    whatever.  We are not aware of any such right.  Of course,23    the First Amendment applies to prisons as anywhere else,24    and so we've written about that, so go back and consider25 it.381 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. RENZ:  I think that's a fair statement ofthe law, Justice Breyer.          QUESTION:  That's what you'd like?          MR. RENZ:  Yes.          QUESTION:  What about adding, and we're notcertain how you happen to be in Court, because there mightbe a problem here of declaratory relief.  What you askedfor in your complaint was a declaration that Rule 009 and022 are too vague, and that this violated -- and that youcan't have a policy in a prison which says content of aletter is relevant to discipline.          MR. RENZ:  Well, now we're talking aboutfashioning relief --          QUESTION:  Yes.          MR. RENZ:  -- and I think that's for the lower          QUESTION:  But you'd be happy to be thrown backinto the briar patch, essentially, right?(Laughter.)          MR. RENZ:  I would not be objecting to beingthrown into the briar patch.  I think it's fair to saythat the crafting of relief is something that needs to bedone.  We haven't done that yet.          QUESTION:  Well, there are many otherimaginative solutions of this case that can be devised, I3910111213141516    court.1718192021222324251 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425suppose, and this would knock off one of them, anyway.          MR. RENZ:  I think so.  I mean, we're sort ofjumping down the road here when we talk about the form ofrelief.  I mean, the form of relief hasn't been craftedyet, and I think that we can do that.          QUESTION:  Mr. Renz, I don't want to invade yourattorney-client privilege or anything like that, so don'tanswer the question if you think it's improper, but I'mjust very puzzled, how is it that you're not challengingthe discipline to your client, when you're challenging thebasis for the discipline?          MR. RENZ:  Well, as we read Edwards -- well,Edwards hadn't been decided yet.  As we read Heck andplayed Heck out it was argued that we were not in aposition to purge the sanction against him.  To the extentthat --          QUESTION:  But the sanction must have adverseconsequences for his future status in prison, doesn't it?          MR. RENZ:  That would be true, but an opinionfrom the district court order of the Ninth Circuit thatsaid he was -- what he had done was protected by theConstitution would certainly vitiate that.          QUESTION:  Not if you're not asking to have itexpunged.  It would still be on his record.          MR. RENZ:  It would be on his record, but --                            40 1              QUESTION:  I'm very puzzled.  I just don't 2    understand. 3              MR. RENZ:  -- the holding of the Court that what 4    he had done was protected by the Constitution and was 5    legal and permitted would also be before the parole board 6    or whoever might see that information. 7              QUESTION:  You could get it expunged later.  I 8    mean, this is a strange manner of litigating, that you 9    bring a declaratory judgment that something that's been10    done to you was unlawful, and then bring a second suit to11    undo what was done to you because it has been declared to12    be unlawful.  I don't understand it.  I'm not sure that13    the conditions for a declaratory judgment exist when it14    is -- I mean, it is equitable relief, and I'm not sure a15    court should provide it --16              MR. RENZ:  Well, we also --17              QUESTION:  -- when there is available to you18    legal relief that will give full satisfaction to your19    client.20212223242541          MR. RENZ:  We do seek conjunctive relief in thiscase, Judge -- Justice --          QUESTION:  Well, I understand that.  That'sequitable, but --MR. RENZ:  Yes.QUESTION:  -- I don't think that a court ought 1    to give that if you don't care enough about what's 2    happened to you to seek to have that undone.  I don't 3    understand that. 4              QUESTION:  Several years ago we held in a habeas 5    corpus case where the person sought declaratory relief, 6    also from the Ninth Circuit, incidentally, that when 7    there's a specific remedy provided you can't impose a 8    declaratory judgment on top of it. 9              MR. RENZ:  Uh-huh, but this Court also held in10    Edwards v. Ballistock, and that was a prison discipline11    case, that the correction of that prison discipline was12    not something that was cognizable under section 1983.13              If there are no further questions, I'll submit14 the case.15              QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Renz.16              Mr. Ohler, you have 4 minutes remaining.17                REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID L. OHLER18                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS19              MR. OHLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, I don't have any20    rebuttal, but I would be happy to answer any questions.21              QUESTION:  Would you respond to the last point?22    Was there any manner in which this litigant could have23    gotten the allegedly unlawful imposition of discipline24    undone through the courts?  Was there no means by which25    that could have been done?421234567    gone.8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. OHLER:  He could have gone to the Statecourt, yes.          QUESTION:  And what about Federal court?          MR. OHLER:  It seems to me that he could haveraised that in this particular case, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  What if he were now to go back to thedistrict court and ask to amend the complaint and say,under my prayer for any other relief, or whatever thelanguage is, I would like to have this order expunged frommy record?  Would that be untimely?          MR. OHLER:  It seems to me it would be untimely,Your Honor, but I don't have a firm answer with respect tothe law.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Ohler.          The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 11:46 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)43          MR. OHLER:  I believe that he could have soughtexpungement of the disciplinary infraction.          QUESTION:  How would that proceed?  He'dchallenge it before the prison administration and, if itwas rejected by the prison administration, then he wouldgo where?  Surely the State court, I assume he could have
