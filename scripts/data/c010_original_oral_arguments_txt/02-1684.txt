Michael Alvarado.Ms. Chuang.ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEBORAH J. CHUANGON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMS. CHUANG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:For nearly 4 decades, the ultimate inquiry as towhether aarrest orassociated with formal arrest.person is in custody is whether there is formal restraint in freedom of movement to the degree￼The Ninth Circuit acknowledged that the State court had identified the correct legal standard for determining custody, that no Supreme Court case had addressed whether age and experience needed to be considered for that determination, and that it was borrowing legal principles from another area of jurisprudence. Yet, it held that it was objectively unreasonable for the State court to have abstained from innovating such a new role.This case illustrates why Federal habeas relief cannot be granted under 28 U.S.C., section 2254(d), when a3Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 200051 State court decision does not extend Supreme Court2 precedent to a new context. Such relief is incompatible3 with the provisions of section 2254(d) for three reasons.4 First, to require a State court to extrapolate5 Supreme Court precedents from the voluntariness context to6 the custody context cannot be fairly characterized as7 applying this Court's custody precedents.8 QUESTION: Ms. Chuang, there are two questions9 presented in the petition for certiorari. One is what I10 took it to be -- is the rule that the Ninth Circuit11 announced correct under our precedents, and the second,12 under AEDPA, was it objectively unreasonable for the State13 court to rule otherwise. Are you going to address both14 those questions?15 MS. CHUANG: Yes, Your Honor.16 QUESTION: Thank you.17 MS. CHUANG: The Ninth Circuit fundamentally18 changed the rule for resolving custody claims by juveniles19 and, second, Federal law as determined by the Supreme20 Court refers -- is limited to the Supreme Court's21 holdings. The Ninth Circuit substituted its holding for22 that of this Court when it recognized that this Court had23 never held so in the custody context.24 And third, to say that an extension of Supreme25 Court precedent to a new context is clearly established4Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 law would define clearly established at such a high --2 QUESTION: But how is it a new context? I mean,3 the -- the rule was how a reasonable man in the suspect's4 position would have understood his situation. So is it5 newtosayyou--Imean,itmightbenewifinfactthere6 was blind person and the agent who was holding him wrote7 on a note, you are free to leave. You know, he can't read8 it. Now, would you need a new, special Supreme Court case9 to say that's ridiculous?10 MS. CHUANG: No, Your Honor. You -- you would11 not. What --12 QUESTION: Then why do you need a new, special13 Supreme Court to say a very young person might feel very14 differently about whether he's in custody from a person15 who's a -- not -- not a child and not a minor?16 MS. CHUANG: Well, because this Court's17 precedence as for custody determination has only18 considered the circumstances encountered by the person --19 QUESTION: Well, we haven't considered blind20 people either. We haven't considered deaf people whom21 someone might whisper, you're free to go. I mean, the22 point is it's so obvious that -- that being a child or a23 juvenile would make a difference, that you don't have to24 write it in all the cases. So my question is, why isn't25 that obvious?5Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

CHUANG: I believe that the answer is that the ultimate inquiry for custody determinations is whether there is a formal arrest or restraint in freedom of movement.QUESTION: How old was the respondent in this case? 17-and-a-half, wasn't he?MS. CHUANG: Yes, Your Honor. He was 17-and-a- half years old during the interview.QUESTION: And I suppose, in the view of the Ninth Circuit, he would have had to be treated quite differently if he were 6 months older, if he were 18.MS. CHUANG: Yes, Your Honor.QUESTION: I thought --QUESTION: What -- what if he were 6? Would --would you acknowledge that -- that that factor should be taken into account?MS. CHUANG: No, Your Honor, I don't believe that a 6-year-old -- that age and experience should be considered because the test -- the ultimate inquiry is whether there is a formal arrest or restraint in freedom of movement.QUESTION: No, but that depends upon what a reasonable person in the circumstances would understand to be his situation whether a reasonable person would believe he was being detained. Isn't that the test? So, I mean,6Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 it doesn't -- it doesn't help to simply say that, you2 know, the3 there is.45 arrest is6 he believe he was arrested? Which gets you right back7 into the determination of what a person would believe.8 Now, would we take into account the fact that9 somebody is 6 years old?10 MS. CHUANG: We don't deny that a 6-year-old11 would certainly be more vulnerable to overall coercion.12 Yet, that is -- overall coercion is addressed by the13 voluntariness test and really the custody question is only14 concerned with one aspect of coercion and that is custody.15 And to --16 QUESTION: Why -- why isn't it? Look, I'm not17 -- I guess let me try again because I can understand you'd18 say there's only 6 months difference here. So in this19 case, being a juvenile didn't matter. But that's not what20 you're talking about.21 You're talking about the standard that says the22 nature of a person as a child or an adult is something23 that can make a difference. All right? To custody. You24 agreed being blind could make a difference to custody.25 You agree being deaf could make a difference to custody.7Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005question is whether there's an arrest. Yes, That is the question.But our standard for whether there has been an what would a reasonable person believe. Would￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Why can't being a child in principle make a difference to custody? That's the question. And it has only to do with whether the first part of your argument, not the second.MS. CHUANG: Well, Your Honor, I suppose that a blind person, if you hand the blind person a note saying, you are free to leave, would not -- you could not use that note as an indication that he was free to leave. You couldn't use that as a circumstance to show that he was free to leave.QUESTION: Well, isn't what you're objecting to in the Ninth Circuit's decision the idea that there is some sort of a bright line cutoff date when the person turns 18? You don't deny that a person 6 -- 6 years old would be treated differently than a 17-year-old, I suppose, for determining the objective test.MS. CHUANG: That's correct, Your Honor.QUESTION: Is that -- I thought you said age is irrelevant.MS. CHUANG: Yes.QUESTION: That age is -- you -- you said age is irrelevant to the custody determination.MS. CHUANG: That's correct. Age --QUESTION: Other things like language is -- language is relevant if the person doesn't -- is not conversant with English.8Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MS. CHUANG: Language might not be relevant,2 Your Honor, because -- or -- or it might relevant because3 if the person did not understand English and the officer4 said, you are free to leave, that is -- that is a5 circumstance that the person encountered that is within6 the officer's control that the -- and the person doesn't7 understand English, that would be something that could not8 be relied upon later on to show that he was -- he9 understood that he was free to leave. But then again,10 that might not mean that he could use it to show that he11 was in custody as well.12 QUESTION: Let -- let me ask you about two facts13 in -- in this particular case. The first one is this.14 And correct me if I'm wrong. I think I'm right on these.15 When the -- when the sheriff's department wanted16 to question this -- this young man, they went to his17 parents and the parents said, in effect, yes, we will --18 we will bring him down or take him down with us, and they19 took him to the station, so that as I understand it, the20 sheriff's department didn't ask him to make a choice as to21 whether they would go down to the headquarters and talk22 with him. The parents did that.23 The second fact I want you to comment on is that24 when they got down there, the parents said, in the boy's25 hearing, can't we go in with him or can we go in with him?9Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425They -- they made it clear that they would like to go into this interrogation. And the deputy sheriff said no, kept them out. The sheriff and the boy disappeared.Are those two facts relevant in making the determination of whether he would reasonably understand that he was being under -- held under conditions equivalent to a formal arrest?MS. CHUANG: No, Your Honor, I don't believe they are relevant.QUESTION: Why -- why not? Why not?MS. CHUANG: Because once -- again, if his -- if his parents were asked for permission to interview, the detective had asked the parents for permission to interview him, and his parents said yes, the meaning of that question was that he could have said no, and --QUESTION: Wait a minute. You just lost me. How -- how is it that he could have said no?MS. CHUANG: He could have refused to have submitted to the interview, and there's no indication in the record --QUESTION: Well, but he -- but he -- he didn't. His parents said, yes, you can interview him. We will bring him down, and the boy came along. That's all we know.MS. CHUANG: That's correct, Your Honor. That's10Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 -- that's what we know.2 QUESTION: And why is that? And that is3 irrelevant you say because the boy might have said, well,4 I won't go?5 MS. CHUANG: That -- yes, Your Honor. It's --6 QUESTION: You don't know whether he would have7 felt free to say that or not, do you? Do we have anything8 in the record on that?9 MS. CHUANG: There's no indication one way or10 the other. But there was no indication that he was not11 voluntarily being interviewed.12 QUESTION: Well, there is an indication. I--I13 mean, that's what I'm trying to get at. The -- the14 indication is that he was taken down to the station house15 by his parents. He didn't make the choice. And when they16 got down there, the parents, who wanted to be present17 during the interrogation, were told that they couldn't.18 The -- the -- it seems to me that the objective19 appearance of -- of these two facts is, number one, the20 boy appears to be under the control of his parents and his21 parents appear to be under the control of the sheriff's22 department when they get down to headquarters. And on23 those two facts, I would think it would be difficult --24 standing alone, those two facts, it would be difficult to25 infer that this boy would have felt that he was free to11Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425turn around and -- and walk out of the interview and leave. And -- and I don't understand why those facts are not relevant.MS. CHUANG: Well, Your Honor, I -- I -- there's no indication, though, that he was at the station involuntarily. Certainly he came with his parents, but --QUESTION: Well, the indication is that his parents brought him. That's all we know.MS. CHUANG: Well, Your Honor, Mr. Alvarado -- it indicated in the record that Mr. Alvarado lived at home with his parents and that he did not have a car.QUESTION: He's a minor, isn't he?MS. CHUANG: Yes, Your Honor.QUESTION: He has to go where his parents tellhim to, doesn't he? Isn't that what being in the status of -- of a minor means, that if your parents tell you stay at home, you're grounded, you're grounded? Isn't that essentially the disability of being a minor?So I guess maybe the proper inquiry is whether his parents thought that they could let him leave if they wanted to. Either that's the proper inquiry or perhaps no minor can be interrogated in -- in a police station because it always requires the consent of the parents, and when the parents tells him, you know, you go be interrogated, he thinks he can't leave. It's a terrible12Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 problem, isn't it?2 MS. CHUANG: Well, Your Honor, I -- I believe3 that custody by -- custody in the sense of a parental and4 juvenile situation is not the same as custody as you are5 under formal arrest or restrained in freedom of movement6 to the same degree --7 QUESTION: Well, then that's the whole point.8 That's why I think Justice Souter asked that question,9 saying, look, you're -- you're used to your parents10 telling you what to do and maybe even sometimes you do it.11 All right?12 (Laughter.)13 QUESTION: So the parents bring them down --14 bring him down. He doesn't think he has any choice. He15 then asks Ms. Comstock, I guess, who was the arresting16 officer that brought him in there, can I take my parents17 in this room. The parents say we want to go in the room.18 And the policewoman -- I think it was a woman, wasn't it?19 I think she said no. And they, who desperately -- or20 certainly want to get into the room, can't. So he's21 sitting there and that, together with all the other things22 that are going on -- and there are quite a few -- would23 lead a reasonable person, who's used to being under the --24 the rule of his parents, to think, my goodness, this25 police woman controls the situation. Of course, I have to13Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 do what she says, and of course, I can't leave until, as2 she said, I've finished answering the question and she can3 -- tells me I can leave. I'm in custody. Now, maybe an4 adult wouldn't be thinking that. Maybe he would. But5 that's a reasonable question.6 But our standard here is, you know, not whether7 they were right in the State but whether they were8 reasonable. But a juvenile certainly would be thinking9 that. That's -- that's I think what the point is.10 Now, I'd like to hear sort of a full-blown11 response to that.12 MS. CHUANG: Yes, Your Honor. Well, first a --13 QUESTION: Just as full-blown as the question.14 QUESTION: I mean, not just yes or no.15 (Laughter.)16 MS. CHUANG: Yes, Your Honor.17 A juvenile -- unless the Court is willing to say18 that the parents in this case operated as agents of law19 enforcement by bringing him into the sheriff's station and￼20 that when the officer -- the21 -- if the parents would give22 really wasn't an option that23 Alvarado was not in custody.24 QUESTION: What I -- what I can't understand --25 and this was Justice Souter's question. Forget how these14Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005detective had asked him if he permission, that somehow that the detective was giving, Mr.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425factors play out one way or the other. Are these factors -- the circumstance that the parents brought the juvenile to the station; two, that the parents wanted to go in or asked someone -- asked to go in and they couldn't -- are those objective factors that the Court can consider in the custody determination?MS. CHUANG: No, Your Honor, because --QUESTION: So -- so if -- if the defense counsel bring this up, the judge rules that it's to be excluded. It's irrelevant.MS. CHUANG: Yes, Your Honor.QUESTION: All right.MS. CHUANG: Because as this Court alluded to inColorado v. Connolly what the Fifth Amendment is concernedwith is government coercion, and to the extent that the parents brought Mr. Alvarado to the station, that is not government coercion.And as far as the parents not being allowed in the interview room, there -- Mr. Alvarado actually did not present any evidence that his parents were not permitted into the interview room. And indeed, the interview room door was open, as indicated at joint appendix page 150.QUESTION: Well, would yo just correct me on the facts? I thought the -- the record indicated that the parents had asked to go in, and as Justice Breyer pointed15Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 out, that2 I have to3 are -- is45 testimony6 attorney,7 the interview.8 QUESTION: This was at the suppression hearing.9 MS. CHUANG: Yes, Your Honor.10 QUESTION: Okay.11 MS. CHUANG: And --12 QUESTION: Did -- did the State object to those13 facts as being untrue and not in evidence?14 MS. CHUANG: Well, the State didn't -- no, Your15 Honor. The State did not, but the -- the State was16 relying on the fact that it was the interview transcript17 that Mr. Alvarado's counsel was using, and indeed, at the18 trial when Mr. Alvarado testified, he never stated that he19 asked for his parents to be in there, and he had testified20 that he didn't feel coerced or --21 QUESTION: May I --22 QUESTION: Where -- where did this fact come23 from? It's in the interview transcript?24 MS. CHUANG: I'm sorry?25 QUESTION: Where did this fact or factoid come16Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005in fact the boy at one point said, you know, do go alone? Isn't anybody coming with me? Are -- there testimony to that effect in the record? MS. CHUANG: No, Your Honor. There is noto that. Indeed, it was only argued by his but his attorney relied upon the transcript of￼1 from that2 go in but3 from?4-- you know, that -- that his parents wanted to they were told they couldn't? Where did it comeMS. CHUANG: His -- it came from his attorney's 5 argument during the suppression hearing.6 QUESTION: It's not in any evidence.7 MS. CHUANG: No, Your Honor. It's not in any8 evidence. And to say that -- to require the State court9 to extrapolate from this Court's voluntariness precedents10 that predated Miranda to decide what types of individual11 characteristics needed to be considered for a Miranda12 custody, is not what section 2254(d) requires. Section13 2254(d) --14 QUESTION: May -- may I ask this one question?15 I thought you conceded that if he were only 6 years old,16 that would be relevant. And the question presented is17 whether age is ever relevant. What -- what is your18 position exactly? Is it it's okay to consider it if he's￼19 6 but not 2021 yet -- we22 still be irrelevant. It might be relevant for the23 voluntariness as to overall coercion.24 QUESTION: But not as to whether he thinks he's25 free to leave.17Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005if he's 17-and-a-half?MS. CHUANG: No. Actually, Your Honor, it -- -- my position is that a 6-year-old age would1 MS. CHUANG: That's correct. The California2 court of --3 QUESTION: Do you know any other category where4 age is ever and always irrelevant, any other category in5 the law?6 MS. CHUANG: Yes, Your Honor. In the Fourth7 Amendment seizure area, this Court has held that it's a8 reasonable person, and indeed in Hodari D. v. California,9 this Court used the -- the reasonable person standard10 without considering age. While this Court did mention age11 in the Kaupp case, which was cited by Mr. Alvarado, it's12 uncertain to what degree age actually was relevant for the13 seizure question, whether a person felt free to leave.1415 Court may16 defendant17 accompanying the officers to the station, as this Court18 indicated with a citation of Royer v. -- Royer and also19 Schneckloth. Both of those cases indicate that age does20 go to the voluntariness of consenting to go with officers.21 The California Court of Appeal in this case22 identified the correct standard for making a custody23 determination, and it engaged in a reasonable application24 of existing custody precedent. The Ninth Circuit25 recognized no Supreme Court case has required age and18Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

ELWOOD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:The Ninth Circuit erred when it held that a juvenile's age and experience must be considered in determining whether or not he is in custody for purposes of the Miranda test.QUESTION: Do you agree that the fact that the parents brought the person to the station and that they were -- requested to be in the room it -- are -- are not relevant to the custody determination?MR. ELWOOD: I think that they can be considered by the court in determining the -- the circumstances surrounding the interrogation, just as in Oregon v. Mathiason they considered the fact the -- the person came to the station on his own power.QUESTION: So that they are relevant to the objective inquiry whether or not a reasonable person thought he was under custody in these circumstances.19Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. ELWOOD: I think that they are facts that2 can be considered by a -- under the reasonable person3 standard to determine whether a reasonable person would4 have felt that he was not free to leave or rather that he5 was under formal arrest at that point.6 QUESTION: So you disagree with the State on7 that point.8 MR. ELWOOD: I -- I think it's a -- it's a9 slightly different viewpoint because I -- I don't think10 that's what the Ninth Circuit was getting at. What the11 Ninth Circuit was basically saying is that you don't12 employ the reasonable person standard. You, rather,13 employ a reasonable juvenile standard, and you view all14 the circumstances differently.15 I think, though, that you can consider the fact16 that he -- particularly the alleged fact that he -- his17 parents were excluded from the interview in determining18 what a reasonable person would have felt from that.19 Unfortunately, because it was simply argued by his20 attorney at the suppression hearing and there were no21 findings on it, we don't know exactly how that happened.22 If--23 QUESTION: But it is true there was testimony on24 it, is it not?25 MR.

She said there was nothing in the record. You say there are just no findings on it.MR. ELWOOD: That's correct, that there are no findings on it and that we have the lawyer's assertion and￼we may have -- I -- I don't recall --the defendant's ownwith respect to theQUESTION: But do you think the child whose parents were denied permission to come into the room would21Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005testimonyat the -- the trial itself. But in any event, our point is you have to look at whatexclusionperson would view that, not necessarily a reasonable juvenile, but a reasonable person. And if the ---- how a reasonable1 draw any inference about whether he could leave at --2 anytime he wanted to?3 MR. ELWOOD: Again, I think it depends on how it4 was put because if they just say, no, you may not come in,5 I think a reasonable person could conclude from that that6 they're exercising control over the interrogation and that7 they -- that might extend to whether or not he's free to8 go. However, if it -- the officer says something more9 along the lines of, no, we'd rather you not because he'll10 -- he'll be able to be more candid if there's no one else11 in there with you, I think that that would express a very12 different --13 QUESTION: Do you think it would make a14 difference in that inquiry if the person being15 interrogated was 35 years old, on the one hand, and 1016 years old on the other hand?17 MR. ELWOOD: I think that it doesn't make a18 legal difference for Miranda purposes, and that's our19 basic argument, is that Miranda doesn't -- didn't develop20 a rule that provides protection tailored for the specific21 circumstances of -- of the person who's under22 interrogation. Rather, it's a uniform rule that provides23 the same level of protection for all people, regardless of24 whether they're very experienced of inexperienced. And I25 think --22Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: And you're telling me that the 35-2 year-old example and the 10-year-old example should be3 treated precisely the same.4 MR. ELWOOD: I think that they should be treated5 the same for purposes of the Miranda prophylactic rule.6 They should not be treated differently for voluntariness.7 QUESTION: For the purposes of determining8 whether he thinks he's in custody.9 MR. ELWOOD: Yes, that is correct. And I think10 that traditionally what the Court has done is it has11 viewed the circumstances that you look to, the totality of12 the circumstances, as being external to the reasonable13 person. I think that's the inference you get from14 Thompson v. Keohane.15 QUESTION: A person of borderline competency who16 doesn't speak the language is -- we don't consider that17 a--18 MR. ELWOOD: You don't consider that for19 purposes of the -- of the altering the reasonable person20 view. You don't say a reasonable person of borderline21 competency. You can, I think, consider it for different22 purposes like in Justice Breyer's example of the blind23 person. One of the very important things to figure out24 before you apply the reasonable person standard and our25 basic objection to the Ninth Circuit's rule is it altered23Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

So your point is instead of having a standard of a reasonable blind person, you have a standard of a reasonable person and one -- in the circumstances and one of the circumstances is that he's blind.MR. ELWOOD: But one of the reasonable under the circumstances --QUESTION: Is that the point?MR. ELWOOD: It's not quite right, but it's getting there.QUESTION: No. And -- and then you say it so it's right.MR. ELWOOD: The point is that one -- one of the important factors to determine when you're figuring out what the totality of the circumstances is that you apply the reasonable person test to is what police officers told the person about his freedom to leave. And if you --QUESTION: I understand all that. I'm trying to get what your objection is to the standard. I'm not talking about this case now. And is the right way to say it that we don't apply a reasonable blind person test, we apply a reasonable person test in the circumstances, and one of the circumstances is that he's blind. Now, you24Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 said, no, that isn't the right way. Then what is the2 right way?3 MR. ELWOOD: I -- I think that you can consider4 -- I think we might be saying basically the same thing but5 just slightly different --what your6789 statement is.QUESTION: I want you to say it -- MR. ELWOOD: I'm trying to get -- QUESTION: -- so that I understand1011 the person -- you can consider what the police officer12 communicated to them, and when you're figuring out what13 the police officer communicated to them, the police14 officer doesn't get to, you know, pretend that a blind15 person can see. They have to take into consideration that16 when you hand them a written notice, they're not going to17 see it, just as though -- just as if you whispered it to18 them in a voice too low for them to hear. The basic point19 is that you didn't communicate anything to them.20 And our objection to the Ninth Circuit's21 standard is they're trying to make you view the entire22 world through the viewpoint of a reasonable juvenile,23 which means that we're not talking about whether or not24 the person was unable to leave the room when they wanted25 to because they couldn't reach the doorknob because they25Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005MR. ELWOOD: Is that the -- is the-- is that￼1 were short. The point is that we're trying to infer2 something about the way they view the entire world because3 they're a juvenile. Because they're a juvenile, they're4 more likely to be submissive to authority. Because5 they're a juvenile, they're more likely to feel that --6 that anything that the police officer says is a command.7 And I think that it's very different to adopt a8 whole different world view thing versus simply asking9 police officers to take notice of things that are10 objectively very plain or rather observable and very11 plain, such as a blind person cannot see the warning that12 you give him. And I think that that is the basic13 difference between what is permissible under the14 reasonable person test, as it has always been applied, and15 the Ninth Circuit's innovation of it.16 Now --17 QUESTION: On -- on your view of this case, is18 it -- suppose we say, all right, reasonable person doesn't19 mean 16. Could -- would a remand be appropriate to view20 the totality of the circumstances and see if they add up21 to in custody using the reasonable person standard?22 MR. ELWOOD: Justice Ginsburg, I think that a23 remand isn't necessary because I think that what the State24 court of appeals did is approximately right, or at least25 it's within the range of reason. So, no, I don't think26Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 that you would need to do that.2 Now, if I could get back to one -- one of the3 questions that Justice Scalia asked, which was do we apply4 the same standard for a 6-year-old. And although it may5 seem kind of intuitively wrong, yes, we would apply the6 same reasonable person standard that we would to anybody7 else, with the point being that it's a very difficult8 thing to require police officers not only to know that a9 6-year-old is more vulnerable, but also to know exactly10 where along the continuum of custody versus non-custody11 that -- that puts them because they have to take12 themselves out of their reasonable person mind-set that13 they're used to applying and figure out how it applies14 differently here.15 And I think that it doesn't make a lot of sense16 to develop this whole different kind of sideline to the17 normal Miranda reasonable person test for 6-year-olds18 because the very factors that would make them more likely19 to view themselves to be in custody would also make them20 less likely to be able to use these Miranda rules if they21 were actually -- Miranda rights if they were given them.22 If -- if a -- if a 6-year-old is going to feel too23 submissive to authority, it doesn't make a lot of sense to24 apply a lower custody threshold if then he's not going to25 be able to take advantage of it.27Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

If you seem to agree that a 6-year-old would be more likely to feel submissive to authority, is -- does it not follow inexorably he, therefore, would reasonably feel he could not leave when -- where an older person would?MR. ELWOOD: Justice Stevens, our point is that basically we don't require police officers to figure out the mind-set of 16, 17 --QUESTION: I wish you would tell me yes or no on my question.MR. ELWOOD: I -- I think the -- well, I've already forgotten what it is.(Laughter.)MR. ELWOOD: But I think the point is -- QUESTION: Let me -- let me restate it. You --you say that you -- the 6-year-old would feel more submissive to -- to an officer. Does it not, therefore, follow that he would be less likely to think he was free to leave than an older person would?MR. ELWOOD: I think if -- in generalities, yes, that's true, but I also --QUESTION: But then isn't age relevant?MR. ELWOOD: No, it's not relevant because I think Miranda -- we -- because it's a prophylactic rule, it's a supplemental protection in addition to the --28Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: No.MR. ELWOOD: -- voluntariness test.QUESTION: Just relevant to the question whetherhe's in custody. That's the only thing we're asking about, not the Miranda warning.MR. ELWOOD: Right. And our point is that --QUESTION: And if it -- if it makes a difference of his age, why doesn't that make it relevant?MR. ELWOOD: Because what we're talking about here is not just 6-year-olds. We have to have a rule that is workable for police officers with respect to 17-year- olds and people who are 17 years and 7 months and 18 years and 1 month. And when you -- when you can say with some certainty that a 6-year-old is going to be feeling more vulnerable, but you can't say with a lot of certainty that an average 16-year-old is going to be feeling more vulnerable than an average 18-year-old, and if so, by how much. So that, for example, they know that when theysay --QUESTION: But it's relevant by even a tiny, tiny bit if you've got a totality of the circumstances test. To say it isn't very much -- I don't see the difference between a 6-year-old, the 16-year-old, and the 18-year-old in your presentation.MR. ELWOOD: Justice -- Justice Stevens, our29Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

They just have to apply one reasonable person standard to the circumstances that are before them.QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Elwood. Ms. Allen, we'll hear from you.ORAL ARGUMENT OF TARA K. ALLEN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMS. ALLEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:I would first like to start by clearing up some things about the record that the Court was asking about earlier. As far as the parents' being refused permission to attend the interview, that was a finding of fact made in the Federal district court. It is contained in the magistrate's report and recommendations in this case, and it can be found at joint appendix 49 and also the petitioner's brief, appendix B3.QUESTION: Was that based on testimony presented in the district court?MS. ALLEN: There was no evidentiary hearing in30Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the district court. As far as --QUESTION: Then how -- how did the district court know to make a finding?MS. ALLEN: I believe they based it on the petition for habeas. This contention --QUESTION: Well --MS. ALLEN: I'm sorry, Your Honor.QUESTION: A written petition? And what -- whatwas the basis for the district court's finding or the magistrate's finding? There was no testimony?MS. ALLEN: No, there was no evidentiary hearing in the Federal court.QUESTION: Then --MS. ALLEN: And there was no testimony in the State court either.QUESTION: Then what is the basis for thefinding?MS. ALLEN: At the motion to suppress in the trial court, in the State court, the argument was, in both the written motion to suppress and the oral argument in front of the court, that the parents were refused permission to attend the interview. The State never objected to that. They never contested it. It was in the briefs on direct appeal and it wasn't contested there.31Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 The -- the first time it's been contested is now.2 QUESTION: So -- so you're saying it was the3 subject of evidence at one point, but in a different4 proceeding, and -- and when the record of the different5 proceeding was used here, no one objected to it.6 MS. ALLEN: No one objected to it. And the7 State has a right to object --8 QUESTION: You're saying it was -- it was the9 subject of allegation, not of evidence.10 MS. ALLEN: Yes, certainly. And when a11 magistrate files a report and recommendation, either party12 can object to any facts that are not correct, and they13 didn't do 14151617 the cite. 1819 from the motion to suppress at trial -- pretrial.20 Secondarily, there was some contention about21 whether Detective Comstock was armed. That is also found22 in the joint appendix, page 65, note 29, and it was in the23 petition for writ of habeas corpus in the district court24 as well, citing the -- Alvarado's interview, which is in25 the joint appendix.32Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005that in this case.QUESTION: Okay.MS. ALLEN: Secondarily --QUESTION: What's RT? It refers to RT 910 as￼MS. ALLEN: That was the reporter's transcript1 There was some contention about whether Mr.2 Alvarado, Michael, was referred to as a suspect. That can3 be found in the joint appendix, page 189. That was4 argument of trial counsel during the motion to suppress.5 It was not disputed at that point. It hasn't been6 disputed until now. But I would assert that in addition7 to that, even if he had not heard another officer refer to8 him as a suspect, it was obvious by Detective Comstock's9 word and deed to him during the interrogation that he --10 he indeed was a suspect.11 And the last contention is my --12 QUESTION: Well, and your -- your argument is13 that you think the fact that he thought he was a suspect14 would make him less likely to feel he was free to leave?15 MS. ALLEN: Yes. And this Court in California16 v. Stansbury found that anytime that it's communicated to17 a suspect by word or deed that he is a suspect, that that18 goes into the totality of the circumstances of whether19 that person would reasonably feel free to leave.20 Secondly, I would like -- well, one more thing21 on the facts. The fact that Michael said, can't somebody22 come in here with me, is found at the joint appendix, page23 185. That's also trial counsel's argument at the motion24 to suppress that was not disputed until now.25 But next I would like to -- to move to this idea33Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 of this being a new context. Miranda is the son of2 voluntariness and coercion. This Court found in 1948 in3 Haley v. Ohio that juveniles in general are more4 susceptible to police coercion than adults.5 QUESTION: That -- that was not a Court opinion,6 was it?7 MS. ALLEN: I don't know, Mr. Chief Justice.8 QUESTION: You're citing it and you don't know?9 MS. ALLEN: Is it a plurality?10 QUESTION: It was a plurality opinion.11 MS. ALLEN: Plurality of this Court, yes, Your12 Honor.13 In that case, it recognized that juvenile status14 be taken into consideration when determining the proper15 procedural safeguards.16 In Miranda in 1966, this Court found that those17 procedural safeguards would be the Miranda warnings.18 And then in In re Gault in 1965, the Court found19 that the greatest care must be taken to assure a minor's20 confession was voluntary not only in the sense that it was21 coerced, but also that it's not a product of ignorance of22 rights.23 It follows --24 QUESTION: What -- what good does -- does a25 Miranda -- I mean, you know -- warning -- what -- what34Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 good does it do if you -- if you recite it to a 6-year-2 old? I mean, isn't it -- isn't it really a -- a warning3 that is designed for a reasonable person, meaning a4 reasonable adult? And so that the situation is as -- as5 has been portrayed. It's just an objective thing that --6 that the police are supposed to do.7 MS. ALLEN: If you were to recite a Miranda8 warning to a 6-year-old, in the waiver determination they9 would decide whether that 6-year-old understood the waiver10 of his rights, and the evidence would come in there as11 well.12 QUESTION: Oh, so -- so that even the giving of13 a Miranda warning would not suffice.14 MS. ALLEN: The giving of a Miranda warning15 doesn't suffice. It severely cuts down the cases in which16 you can contest coercion.17 QUESTION: Well, coercion of what? I'm not18 talking about coercion, whether the statement is -- is19 coerced. They are not contesting that -- that you cannot20 get in the age of the -- of the individual when it comes21 to deciding whether the confession was voluntary or not.22 They -- they agree that you can for that.23 But just for the question of whether the person24 was in custody and therefore has to be given a Miranda25 warning. It seems to me strange to say that you take into35Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425account for that purpose the age of the individual even though you don't take it into account for the purpose of whether he can understand -- can get any benefit out of the Miranda warning at all. You recite a -- a Mirandawarning to him.warningto a 6-year-old. It's not going to mean anythingMS. ALLEN: However, if you cite a Miranda to a 17-year-old, it may.QUESTION: Well, counsel, the -- the person to whom the warning is given must be found to have waived the rights so warned and to have understood that a waiver was being made. Isn't that true?MS. ALLEN: That's correct.QUESTION: So I -- I think that's the answer, isn't it?MS. ALLEN: That's correct, Your Honor.QUESTION: So -- so that means you cannot interrogate a 6-year-old, neither in custody nor out of custody. Right? 6-year-olds just skip away. That can't be right.MS. ALLEN: Usually --(Laughter.)QUESTION: Isn't the question whether we'regoing to --MS. ALLEN: I -- I --36Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Isn't the question whether we're going to treat them and prosecute them as adults?MS. ALLEN: That's -- that's right.QUESTION: And we don't -- we don't do that with 6-year-olds.MS. ALLEN: And in most circumstances you're not prosecuting 6-year-olds. You're -- you're prosecuting teenagers.QUESTION: What is the evidence or the indication here that the State did not take account of the fact that he was a juvenile, but having taken account of it in the State proceedings, they just reached the conclusion that it didn't in this case matter that much? Now, why do we think that that isn't what happened?MS. ALLEN: When you read the California State opinion in this case, they don't mention Michael's age. They don't mention anything about the fact that he was a juvenile or how a reasonable juvenile would have assessed the situation.QUESTION: I can understand why they might not -- they would mention things that did matter, but if they thought it hadn't mattered here, why would we have expected them to mention it?MS. ALLEN: Is your question if they thought it didn't matter?37Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Well, I mean, is our only indication2 that they didn't take it into account the fact that they3 didn't mention it? Because maybe they didn't mention it4 because they thought it's only 6 months. It doesn't5 matter that much. That would be a reason for not6 mentioning it. Or maybe they didn't mention it because7 the lawyers then didn't make that much of an issue of it.8 I mean, there are a lot of reasons why, when I write an9 opinion, I don't mention things. Usually it's because I10 don't think it matters.11 MS. ALLEN: Well, the objectively unreasonable12 thing about what the California court did in this case was13 they recited the correct test for custody, yet they14 completely failed to imply it. When they were looking at15 the totality of the circumstances, they spent their entire16 time distinguishing a State case from this case and17 finding that --18 QUESTION: To -- to what extent do we require a19 State court, when we're talking about the AEDPA rules, to20 be absolutely accurate in following, say, precedent of21 this Court? I mean, I -- I thought the rule was that it22 was up to the other -- the other side to point out how23 they had departed from it.24 MS. ALLEN: As this Court has found, a totality25 means a totality.38Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Well, then you say that in any -- every single Miranda case, a court must take into account in its opinion every single circumstance that is mentioned in the record?MS. ALLEN: No, Your Honor.QUESTION: Well, then what -- why do you say totality?MS. ALLEN: Most certainly they should discuss the factors that make a difference, and in this case they didn't. They didn't discuss any of the factors that made a difference.QUESTION: Well, why should they have said that the age of a 17-and-a-half-year-old made a difference?MS. ALLEN: It's more than the age in this case. Not only is it a reasonable juvenile standard, but also it's the enlisting of the parental authority to bring him to the station, the refusing of permission for the parents to attend the interview in front of him.QUESTION: Well, that's mentioned in the court's opinion, that they brought him to the station house.MS. ALLEN: When they're talking about the facts, they take the facts from Detective Comstock'sinterview where she says, I called the parents and had them come down. She doesn't say anything about refusing them permission.39Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

ALLEN: They --their son.then they did talk about It's not correct to say theyQUESTION: It's right in the opinion.MS. ALLEN: They didn't mention that they were refused permission, and they didn't mention that Michael was 17. I guess you can infer from the fact that she called the parents that he was under the age of majority.QUESTION: Well, maybe they didn't mention that because it's not in the record. I -- I -- maybe they were being a little more precise about what -- what should be in their opinion than -- than we have been here today. I mean --MS. ALLEN: Well, part of the record were the -- the trial transcripts which included the motion to suppress hearing, and -- and the briefs cited to that and the motion itself. So it was in the record.QUESTION: I -- I didn't -- well, I -- I'm not sure that you're required -- or it's even proper to take into account allegations that are made in -- in a motion to suppress when there's been no evidentiary hearing on40Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 them. I don't --2 MS. ALLEN: Well, where they're not disputed by3 the prosecution and -- and the judge finds no contrary4 finding and they're argued in all the briefs without the5 respondent saying that that's not correct, it seems6 reasonable that the court of appeal would -- would take7 that as fact.8 QUESTION: Why should it matter in the -- in the9 -- why would a court say, oh, yes, I know that age could10 be -- could be relevant, but this was a 17 and more --11 more than 17-and-a-half-year-old, closer to 18 than 17? I12 think in this case age was irrelevant. I mean, it seems13 to me you have a rather bad case on the facts to press the14 difference in age of somebody who's almost 18.15 MS. ALLEN: I think even if Michael had been 1816 and the court had no duty to apply a reasonable juvenile17 standard, there are plenty of facts that point toward18 custody in this case not only the parental involvement,19 but the very fact that this interrogation took place in an20 interrogation room at a police station.21 QUESTION: That's the question I asked Mr.22 Elwood and he -- his answer was a remand wouldn't be23 appropriate because what the State court held was a -- was24 reasonable.25 MS. ALLEN: What the State court held was41Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 objectively unreasonable because they -- they failed to2 apply the clearly established Federal law from this Court,3 which is Thompson v. Keohane. The recited it, but4 completely failed to apply it in any meaningful way.5 QUESTION: In -- in what respect?6 MS. ALLEN: In the respect that that case says7 you need to look at all of the circumstances surrounding8 an interrogation, and once you add up those circumstances,9 you decide whether a reasonable person would have felt10 free to leave. That's a cumulative totality of the11 circumstances test.12 The California court did not look at the factors13 together cumulatively. They took two factors to14 distinguish this case, neither of which was proper: one,15 that the police did not tell him affirmatively that he16 could not leave until he told the truth, which would be a17 finding of custody straight off. You would never even get18 to the totality test. And two, that the tactics weren't19 intense and aggressive enough to prove coercion.20 And as this case said in Kaupp, interestingly,21 just as you can't require the perversity of resisting22 arrest to prove coercion, here you can't require the23 perversity of -- of this being coercive to prove custody.24 You can't use a -- say that the -- the police had to have25 enlisted intense and aggressive tactics in order for this42Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 to be custody. That's not even part of the custody2 determination. There are things like location. Here it3 was at a police station. Who initiated the contact. Here4 it was initiated by the detective. Whether the defendant5 voluntarily came. Here he was brought by his parents at6 the behest of the detective. Whether he was informed that7 he was not under arrest. Not only was he not informed of8 that, he wasn't given anything to sign to say the9 interview was voluntarily -- voluntary. The length of the10 interview. He was interrogated for over 2 hours. The11 familiarity of the surroundings. And this is where his12 inexperience may go into a -- a circumstances test. He13 had never been in a police station or an interrogation14 room. And whether it was communicated to him that he was15 a suspect, which it was certainly by Comstock --16 QUESTION: You're -- you're not meeting their17 argument, though. Their argument is it doesn't matter18 that although voluntariness of the confession later on is19 indeed a subjective inquiry, was it really voluntary on20 the part of this person, custody or not, is not a21 subjective inquiry. It is purely objective. Was this22 person in custody or not in custody? And their argument23 is that determination is to be made from the standpoint of24 what a reasonable adult would -- would deduce from the25 situation. It is objective. It has nothing to do with43Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 the subjective feelings of the particular individual,2 whether because he's too young or because he's -- he's3 mentally not -- not competent or anything else. It is an4 objective determination. Did the police have this person5 in custody?6 MS. ALLEN: That's correct, Your Honor.7 QUESTION: Now, what is -- what is your response8 to that?9 MS. ALLEN: It is an objective determination,10 and nobody is arguing that it should be subjective. The11 petitioner is the one who has created this facade that12 we're trying to turn an objective test into a subjective13 test. We're not. The Ninth Circuit is not trying to do14 that. No one is asking whether Michael Alvarado felt free15 to leave. We're asking whether a reasonable person in his16 position would have felt free to leave because of such17 factors as his age and the parental involvement.18 QUESTION: Well, every subjective inquiry uses19 objective factors. I mean, you're -- you're not making it20 non-subjective simply because you say whether it's a --21 you know, an objective 17-and-a-half-year-old who had been22 abused by his parents and who was, you know, off from23 Sunday school or whatever and put in every factor in his24 life and say, well, of course, you know. That -- that's25 subjective. That's not an objective test at that point44Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 when you're using all sorts of factors that -- that go to2 what his thinking was. When -- when you use all of that,3 you're using the subjective test.4 MS. ALLEN: There's a fine line here. Because5 the custody test asks how a reasonable person in the6 suspect's position would have felt free to leave, it's7 saying how would a reasonable person have felt, how they8 would have felt free to leave. And that sounds9 subjective, but you're using objective factors. And the10 fact of juvenile status -- it's not subjective. It's not11 a state of mind. It's a status. It's a class that this12 Court has recognized from the beginning.13 QUESTION: Yes, but not in this particular14 context.15 MS. ALLEN: In the context of custodial16 interrogations and the Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth17 Amendment. These are two sides of the same coin. Miranda18 is concerned with exactly the context that this Court has19 recognized.20 QUESTION: But up -- up to now, it's been21 concerned with respect to the custody inquiry to the22 external circumstances of -- of the person. You know, how23 would a reasonable person have reacted to these24 circumstances? Now, you're -- you're saying we don't any25 longer limit it to that. We look inside the person and45Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 try to figure out on his background how we would react,2 and that of course, is -- Justice Scalia3 is -- is not a -- an objective standard.4 MS. ALLEN: Mr. Chief Justice,5 respectfully disagree. We're not asking6 mind of the person. We're simply saying7 and other courts in the land and the police need to8 recognize what is obvious, that juveniles do not assess9 their freedom to leave the same way as adults do.10 QUESTION: Well, but you say juveniles, and11 you're saying the 17-and-a-half-year-old will not assess12 his freedom to leave in the same way an 18-year-old. That13 just doesn't make any sense at all.14 MS. ALLEN: This Court in its juvenile15 jurisprudence has drawn lines with juveniles versus16 adults. When things are close to the line, it's going to17 be fuzzy, but to say what the petitioner is arguing, that18 it never matters, that a 12-year-old would assess their19 freedom to leave the same as a 35-year-old, it can't be20 true.21 QUESTION: Well, it certainly matters for22 determining voluntariness of any statement. Was that ever23 challenged at trial?24 MS. ALLEN: No, it wasn't. The --25 QUESTION: That's kind of odd, isn't it?46Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005says I think --I--Iwhat was in the that this Court￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MS. ALLEN: It is. The main contentions at trial were, one, that the Miranda wasn't read and he was in custody, and two, that when he said, can't somebody be in here with me, that that as a request for counsel.QUESTION: But never an assertion that the statements were involuntary.MS. ALLEN: No, no.QUESTION: And all of these things would be relevant in the voluntariness inquiry, would they not?MS. ALLEN: Yes, sure.QUESTION: If juvenility must be taken into account for the custody determination, how -- how is it that it is not taken into account for the purpose of what the nature of the warning has to be, assuming custody? I mean, we have one Miranda warning that presumably I have always thought is given to everybody from the 6-year-old to the senior citizen.MS. ALLEN: And --QUESTION: Now, if -- if, indeed as you say, relevant to this whole thing is--istheageofthe person, we ought to have different Miranda warnings, an 8- year-old Miranda warning, a 17-and-a-half-year-old Miranda warning, and so forth.MS. ALLEN: I have two things to say about that, Justice Scalia. One is many States do employ a different47Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Miranda warning for juveniles in their statutes.2 Secondly, this Court in Miranda, when putting down the3 warning, I assume it applies to both juveniles and adults,4 and ignoring the -- the juvenile status is basically5 making it an adult standard. If you're applying an adult6 standard to juveniles instead of providing for the7 greatest care, you would actually be giving them less8 protection to which they're entitled under the clearly9 established Federal law.10 QUESTION: And is it also not true that in many,11 many cases, voluntariness may remain an issue, for12 example, as in Oregon against Elstad. If there's a13 preliminary question followed by Miranda warnings, you14 first have to look at the voluntariness of the first15 interrogation. So we haven't abandoned voluntariness as a16 relevant issue in these cases.17 MS. ALLEN: No, not at all, Your Honor.18 QUESTION: Does that help your case or hurt your19 case? I -- I -- I would think -- I thought that was the20 argument of the other side, that you -- you can raise all21 of this on the voluntariness point. You don't have to get22 it in on the -- on the quite objective factor of whether23 there is custody or not.24 QUESTION: Sure you can, but voluntariness is25 retrospective, and Miranda is prospective. So if you're48Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425trying to protect people's rights from the beginning, it should be taken into account at the beginning instead of waiting until the end when it's too late essentially. It's very hard to meet a voluntariness test when this could be taken care of on the front end by police giving people their 15-second Miranda warnings, particularly juveniles who they know are going to assess their freedom to leave differently than adults.So unless the Court has any other questions. CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms. Allen. The case is submitted.(Whereupon, at 11:45 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)￼49Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.
