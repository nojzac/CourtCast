PHILLIPSON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court:In 1997, this Court recognized that there is anasbestos litigation crisis confronting the Nation, and nothing in the last five years has -- done anything other than to show that that crisis is more acute now than at any other time in our history. The Rand Corporation in a report just two months ago concluded that there are now 6,000 defendants confronted with asbestos litigation claims, that the estimated value of those claims in litigation costs exceeds $200 billion.The six plaintiffs who are involved in this case, the respondents here today, are emblematic of at least a fundamental element of the problem that confronts asbestos litigation. Each of them received close to, and in some instances more than a million dollars in compensatory damages for claims of asbestosis. The basis3￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425for their claim, the primary basis for their claim was that they confronted a fear of cancer.Asbestosis does not convert into cancer --QUESTION: How do we know that? I mean, I notice that the awards there seem to grow with age, and they don't seem to vary depending upon smoking. I mean, they're inversely related to age, they don't seem to be affected by smoking, and that suggested to me that maybe it didn't play a major part, this fear of cancer. How do we know that it played a major part?MR. PHILLIPS: Well, there is a legal answer and there is a factual answer. The legal answer is that you have to assume it because the jury was instructed to include it as an element, and under West Virginia law, it is absolutely settled and respondents don't contest it.QUESTION: Well, but that, the fact that it's one element doesn't mean it's the primary element, does it? They did all suffer physical impairment as a result of the asbestosis itself, did they not?MR. PHILLIPS: They all suffered asbestosis, and they all suffered some physical elements of it.QUESTION: And how do you know that the physical impairment was not the primary ingredient in the jury verdict. I don't understand that.MR. PHILLIPS: I don't know that it's not the4￼1 primary ingredient, Justice Stevens. What I do know is2 that as a matter of law, you can't ignore the fact that3 the -- that fear of cancer was put before the jury as a4 significant component of the plaintiff's case in chief,5 that the jury was instructed to include that, and that --6 QUESTION: Yes, but you said it was the primary7 element of damages, and that's what I think Justice Breyer8 and I are wondering whether the record really9 supports that element --10 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think the record supports11 it in the sense that we know that these are asbestosis12 claims that even the respondents' expert testified were13 mild, for the most part. One or two differences about14 that, but these are still relatively mild asbestosis15 claims, and mild asbestosis claims do not typically16 generate million-dollar damages awards --17 QUESTION: Did the defendant --18 MR. PHILLIPS: -- particularly where there's no19 cost of medical care as part of the component.20 QUESTION: Mr. Phillips, did the defendant21 attempt to test this by seeking a special verdict so that22 the damages could be broken down by the jury? This was a23 general verdict, so we don't know how much they gave for24 anything.255￼MR. PHILLIPS: No, the defendants didn't -- the1 defendant did not ask for that.2 QUESTION: But it could have --3 MR. PHILLIPS: What the defendant did ask for,4 Justice Ginsburg, was to have fear-of damages eliminated5 as a component of the case in a case like this --6 QUESTION: But they could have -- if they tested7 this, isolated this, and then we'd know how much was8 actually allocated, whether it was as he initially said9 the primary, or whether it was a lesser thing. We just10 don't know.11 MR. PHILLIPS: Oh, and that's because it's the12 plaintiff's burden. If they didn't want to have -- if13 they didn't want to take the risk of a general verdict14 being set aside because there's an element of damages15 that's included that the court ultimately decides should16 be excluded as a matter of law, they then bear the risk17 and the burden of having the case sent back for a new18 trial.19 QUESTION: Oh, but the relevance of this, I20 think your overall point, in my mind, is that the other21 side would say, I think they do say that this is a case in22 which there was an impact, and as a result of the23 impact -- the thickening of the lungs -- the person does24 have a fear of getting cancer greater than most people,25 that that's -- entitles them under traditional law to some6￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425damages, and where you can get a special verdict, it's easy to see, if the jury has awarded too much damage for that, in which case you get a reversal under -- you get a reversal if they give too much for it, and -- so what's the problem here that has anything to do with there being 6,000 plaintiffs and enormous damage and problems overall?MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the problem's easy to identify, that is that if the instruction is that everyone who suffers a diagnosed case of asbestosis is entitled to go to the jury on fear of cancer claims, then the amount of damages that will be generated as a consequence of that will run completely out of sync --QUESTION: Why?MR. PHILLIPS: -- with the damages that -- QUESTION: Why would it? Why -- maybe they'reentitled to some fear. A person who has no problem in the world has a 1 in 4 chance of dying in cancer. A person who's subjected to asbestos may have a 1 in 3 chance.MR. PHILLIPS: But this Court --QUESTION: That gives them entitlement to some little amount, anyway.MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Breyer, you said, or the Court said in Buckley that you don't analyze these issues case by case. What you have to do is make a judgment about the category of cases that's based on the policies7￼1 of the Federal Employers Liability Act, and the policy --QUESTION: Mr. Phillips, under West Virginia is it -- if a plaintiff or a defendant requests verdict, is it automatically allowed, or is it23 practice,4 a special5 in the discretion of the trial court?6 MR. PHILLIPS: It's in the discretion of the7 trial court, and it is also clear under West Virginia law8 that if two theories are put before the jury with respect9 to damages and one of them is impermissible, the answer is10 you strike down and you get a new trial on damages, so11 that's -- that's clear. And I don't -- I don't hear the12 respondents as arguing anything to the contrary.QUESTION: Mr. Phillips, do we look at this case a claim for traditional pain and sufferingIs that how we should view it?MR. PHILLIPS: No. This Court said in Gottshall and suffering damages are describable as1314 as one of15 damages?1617 that pain18 sensations stemming directly from a physical injury or19 condition.20 The physical injury that -- that's identified21 here is asbestosis, and to be sure, the pain and suffering22 that an asbestotic would be allowed to recover for might23 be a fear of shortness of breath or other symptoms that24 arise out of asbestosis, but the notion that cancer that25 doesn't exist currently, may never take place, stems from8￼1 the existence of asbestosis is not a fair application of2 that rule of law, particularly when there is no evidence,3 and again, I don't think respondents challenge this, that4 asbestosis does not cause cancer, it does not lead to5 cancer.6 QUESTION: But, it sounds like you want us to7 say there is some limitation on the availability of pain8 and suffering damages in the context of an asbestosis9 case.10 MR. PHILLIPS: All -- Not --11 QUESTION: It would be something different than12 one would think of in a traditional pain and suffering13 case, wouldn't it?14 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think it's the15 respondents who are asking you to do something different16 with a pain and suffering case, and actually I'm not even17 sure that's a fair way to characterize the respondents'18 argument. I don't understand them to be arguing that this19 is a classic pain and suffering --20 QUESTION: Well, I'm trying to find out what21 you're arguing.22 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, and my argument is, this23 is not under any circumstances the kind of pain and24 suffering that we traditionally think of. It's not25 something that emanates directly out of the existing9￼1 injury. Second, it's not negligent infliction of2 emotional3 component45 presented6 emotional789 argument. 10distress, and it's not emotional injury asa of a negligence claim.QUESTION: Well, what was it -- was the case as a separate claim for negligently-caused distress?MR. PHILLIPS: No. It was --QUESTION: No. It was a pain and sufferingThat's what it was, wasn't it?MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it wasn't clear exactly11 what it was until the jury -- until we got to the jury12 instructions. At that point, the trial judge did say, I13 view these as pain and suffering.14 QUESTION: As pain and suffering.15 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes.16 QUESTION: I mean, I thought that's what we were17 confronting here.18 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, except that the traditional19 standard for pain and suffering doesn't permit the kind of20 disconnect between the fear of cancer that you're talking21 about here and asbestosis. You normally associate pain22 and suffering as sensations that emanate directly from the23 injury itself, and fear of cancer doesn't emanate at all24 from asbestosis.25 QUESTION: But it can include fright.10￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. PHILLIPS: Fright from asbestosis -- QUESTION: Yes.MR. PHILLIPS: -- to be sure.QUESTION: Is it conceded -- I think you said itwas conceded, but is it conceded that fear of cancer does not emanate from asbestosis? If it's clear that you have a greater risk of cancer if you have contracted asbestosis, why isn't the fear connected to the asbestosis?MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it's interesting, you know, the testimony itself was simply, do you have a fear because of exposure to asbestos now that you have asbestosis. They didn't even ask the question whether the fear arises out of the asbestosis.QUESTION: Did you ask questions about the causation theory that you're now espousing?MR. PHILLIPS: No. Our argument, Justice Souter, was that fear of cancer is too unrelated, as a matter of law, to be an element of pain and suffering.QUESTION: Okay, but I take it your argument is that the mere fact that there is an association between asbestosis and a higher risk of developing cancer, depending on whether you smoke and so on, is not enough of an association to support a -- in effect, a separate element of damages for fear of cancer?11￼1 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, Your Honor.2 QUESTION: What is your authority for that? In3 other words, you're saying there's got to be some kind of4 a different, or more intense causal relationship than5 simply this association that can statistically be shown.6 MR. PHILLIPS: I think --7 QUESTION: What's the basis for that?8 MR. PHILLIPS: Buckley, frankly, is as close to9 anything on that score, because Buckley says even if you10 accept as an article of faith, as I think the Court did,11 that each of those individuals who'd been exposed to12 asbestos felt that he or she would be more seriously at13 risk --14 QUESTION: Did they have asbestosis?15 MR. PHILLIPS: No, none of the --16 QUESTION: No --17 MR. PHILLIPS: No.18 QUESTION: -- they didn't, and the point here19 is that there is proof of asbestosis, and there is a20 statistical showing that you don't deny, I think, of a21 higher degree of risk, what -- however the causal chain22 works -- which associates asbestosis with fear of cancer,23 so this is not a Buckley situation, and my question is,24 why isn't that statistical association sufficient to25 ground an instruction allowing for compensation for fear12￼1 that results from this association?2 MR. PHILLIPS: There are two answers to that,3 Justice Souter. In the first place, the -- there is no4 strong common law doctrine that says that those -- that5 that kind of a disconnect between the damages is a core6 element of what the common law routinely grants for --7 QUESTION: Well, you call it disconnect, he8 calls it a connect. What it is, there is, I take it, an9 undenied statistical association between asbestosis and a10 probability of developing cancer --11 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.12 QUESTION: -- and that's the basis for the claim13 of the fear. Why is that inconsistent with a common law14 theory of 1516 suffering17 fright that emanates directly out of the particular18 condition you have, which is asbestosis.19 QUESTION: All right, if you want to use that20 kind of terminology, I don't see why you haven't got it21 here. The reason these people are worried is that they've22 got asbestosis, and people with asbestosis have a higher23 chance of developing cancer. Isn't that enough out of, in24 your terms?25 MR. PHILLIPS: No. Even if you accept thatpain and suffering damages?13￼MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the core of the pain and -- the pain and suffering theory is that it is a1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425premise, Justice Souter, you still have to confront the overall policies of the Federal Employers Liability Act, and the question of whether not allowing a recovery that might otherwise be legitimate -- and that is precisely what the Court said --QUESTION: So, are you saying that even if the common law allowed it, we should not allow it under the act, or the act doesn't allow it?MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't think the common law clearly allows it.QUESTION: Okay. Have you got any authority for that proposition --MR. PHILLIPS: No, because --QUESTION: -- that an association between thesetwo conditions is insufficient to support a damage award? MR. PHILLIPS: There are lower court -- we citethe Pennsylvania Supreme Court decisions, the Eleventh Circuit decisions -- there are decisions out there that have said we're not going to allow fear of cancer in cases involving asbestosis, but I --QUESTION: Well, there does appear to be a minority of jurisdictions that have said -- and haveheld -- that you have to show as a plaintiff in a case like this a verifiable causal nexus between cancer and the injury suffered in cases where you're dealing with14￼1 exposure to a hazardous material. That -- maybe that's a2 reasonable requirement, but it appears to be a minority3 view. Are you suggesting that we should adopt that here?4 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I'm not asking you to -- I5 don't think the answer to this case resides in the common6 law, because I think the common law is essentially a7 muddle. There are cases on both sides.8 QUESTION: Well, are you -- do you think we9 should adopt an interpretation of FELA that says there has10 to be some verifiable causal nexus?11 MR. PHILLIPS: Absolutely, Justice O'Connor, and12 the reason to do that --13 QUESTION: Do you acknowledge that that is a14 view that is generally a minority view in the country?15 MR. PHILLIPS: I -- I -- I'll concede that it is16 a minority view in the sense that there are maybe five17 cases on one side --15￼181920 other. 212223 litigated24 are.25QUESTION: Yes.MR. PHILLIPS: -- and three or four on theQUESTION: Yes.MR. PHILLIPS: This is not an area that's been sufficiently to be able to say where the trendsQUESTION: It may make sense, but I just want to1 know where we are here.2 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Well, I've only got two3 or three cases that identify it in the context -- the way4 you just did, Justice O'Connor, and my colleague on the5 other side will identify four or five cases that don't6 impose that requirement, but what remains absolutely7 critical in the analysis of this case, I think, is the8 core policy that this Court identified in Gottshall and in9 Buckley that says if you don't have a clear answer from10 the common law, you have to look to see whether or not11 this particular damages remedy creates the possibility of12 unpredictable and unlimited damages, and that's the reason13 why the Court needs to adopt a more restrictive view of14 the standard to be applied under the Federal Employers15 Liability Act.16 That may not be the rule that would be required17 as a matter of common law in any particular State, but18 under FELA, the notion that you're going to create19 unlimited liability in circumstances in which the20 plaintiffs are allowed significantly reduced requirements21 in order to prove the basis for their claim suggests that22 this Court has consistently taken the position that it23 must cut back and not allow on a category basis -- on a24 categorical basis -- not allow damages to extend to --25 QUESTION: But what -- I mean, what -- unlimited16￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425damages, I don't know what you want us to do. What if the statistical chance of your getting cancer if you have asbestosis is -- is your chances are doubled. Would that be enough to create the kind of a fear that we could allow damages for it?MR. PHILLIPS: No, I don't think so -- QUESTION: I see.MR. PHILLIPS: -- Justice Scalia.QUESTION: What if it's 90 percent certain thatif you have developed asbestosis, you will develop cancer? MR. PHILLIPS: I think that would be a differentcase. I think once you get past more likely than not -- QUESTION: Okay, so it's somewhere between 50and 90 percent?MR. PHILLIPS: I think when you get past more likely than not that you will incur cancer, there is a risk, then at that point -- but remember, the flip side of this is the two-disease rule, and that's an important element in how the Court ought to analyze this problem, because not only -- by allowing fear of cancer damages now, you essentially say to the world, the sky is the limit, inconsistent with what the Court said in Gottshall and Buckley.The flip side is, if you don't allow the fear of cancer damages now, but allow fear of -- but allow the17￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425plaintiff to come back after he or she contracts cancer and allows as a part of that recovery for fear of cancer, then the people who are most seriously injured are made whole at the appropriate time in the appropriate circumstances.QUESTION: Mr. Phillips, I know your light is on, but there's a second question and you haven't even talked about it, the joint and several liability --MR. PHILLIPS: The apportionment.QUESTION: -- the apportionment.MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Justice O'Connor. QUESTION: And I wasn't sure that there was anysupport in the statute or in the evidence at trial here for how some apportionment should have been made.MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the quick answer on apportionment is that in 1908, it was absolutely clear there was several liability. You're only liable for the injuries you cause. That's embodied, I think, in the statutory language that says that the railroad is responsible for the injuries while employed. That language has been interpreted as recognizing we only pay for the things that we cause.The Third Restatement --QUESTION: Cause in whole or in part?MR. PHILLIPS: But that goes to the question of18￼1 what you need to show a jury in order to get a negligence2 claim to the jury in the first instance. It doesn't say3 you're -- you're liable for the entirety of the damages in4 whole or in part.5 QUESTION: It could be read to say that.6 MR. PHILLIPS: It could, but I don't think7 that's the most natural reading of that particular8 language, and I don't think it's an appropriate one where9 the policies in 1908, and the policies of the law under10 the Third Restatement quite clearly say that you should11 apportion, because that is the fair way in order to ensure12 that a defendant is not -- does not -- is not forced to13 overcompensate.14 QUESTION: It's really a question of who should15 bear the burden of bringing in those other people. If16 it's joint and several, you could join other people. On17 your view, you say to the plaintiff, "Unless, plaintiff,18 you bring in all these other people, you can only get a19 small piece from any particular one."20 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, and I think the statute21 and the existing common law clearly suggest that the right22 answer is that because you've reduced the burden of the23 plaintiff in order to get into court and to be able to24 make a case, the quid pro quo for that ought to be that25 you only hold the railroad liable for the amount of the19￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425injury it caused, and here it is not contested that -- and Mr. Butler's case is the prototype example of it -- he had three months of exposure when he was with Norfolk & Western, he had 30 years of exposure with others. That is a reasonable basis on which to apportion for cause, and that -- and no one has contested that.I'd reserve the balance of my time. QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Phillips. Mr. Salmons, we'll hear from you.ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUSSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER MR. SALMONS: Mr. Chief Justice, andplease the Court:CURIAE,may it20￼Respondents may not recover damages under FELA for their anxiety about developing cancer in the future as part of their emotional injuries from the separate disease of asbestosis. The overwhelming majority of courts that have considered the relationship between asbestosis and cancer have concluded that they are separate diseases thatresult inwanted toseparate injuries to the plaintiff --QUESTION: May I ask in that --MR. SALMONS: -- and give rise to separate -- QUESTION: May I ask this question? I really ask it of Mr. Phillips, but his time was running1 out. Would you draw a distinction between a case in which2 the asbestosis actually is a cause of cancer, as opposed3 to a case like this, in which asbestos and cancer --4 asbestosis and cancer -- are the result of a common cause?5 MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I do think there would6 be a difference between those two instances. Here, the7 Court can look to the evolving tort law principles in8 cases involving asbestos, where the overwhelming majority9 of courts have concluded they are, indeed, separate10 diseases with no causal connection between them only in11 the sense 121314that they both stem from the same exposure -- QUESTION: -- that in thisMR. SALMONS: -- to asbestos.QUESTION: that in this case, then, if it were21￼15 true, which I understand it is not, that the asbestosis16 itself is a contributing cause to cancer, that then there17 would be liability?18 MR. SALMONS: Well, Your Honor, I think that --19 you know -- the Court may still need to look at what20 type -- what exactly the causal connection is -- and it21 would still need to take into account both the text and22 the purposes of FELA, and -- and in particular, the23 concern --24 QUESTION: But taking all those things into25 account, what do you do in a case in which the cancer is a1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425result of the asbestosis rather than the result of a common source?MR. SALMONS: I -- I do think, Your Honor, that if -- that if the cancer, in fact, results directly from the disease of asbestosis, then that puts you more directly in the category of pain and suffering damages that would be available traditionally in tort law, and that probably would be recoverable there, but --QUESTION: Why --QUESTION: Isn't that a jury question? Do we know for sure that the one does not lead to the other?MR. SALMONS: I do think, Your Honor, that this Court can look to the experience of courts that have considered the relationship between the two diseases, and have adopted legal rules to govern the disposition of these claims, and have concluded that they are separate diseases that result in separate injuries and give rise to separate causes of action, and I think this Court can look to that and -- and -- and can conclude that as a matter of law both because of --QUESTION: Do the respondents agree with you on that factual point?MR. SALMONS: That the majority of courts have concluded --QUESTION: No -- no, that -- that asbestosis22￼1 does not lead to cancer, but rather, is -- is produced by2 the same -- by the same cause that produces cancer?3 MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I do think that the4 respondents have taken that position in this case. On5 page 20 of their brief, they say that the relationship6 between asbestosis and cancer is two-fold.7 First, the asbestosis confirms the extent and8 severity of the initial exposure to asbestos which, of9 course, under Buckley is not a separate injury or impact10 that can give rise to liability under FELA, and second,11 that they both -- both the cancer and the asbestosis would12 result from the same negligent conduct of the defendant,13 but I do not read respondents to be alleging in this Court14 that there is any causal relationship between cancer and15 asbestosis in terms of asbestosis actually turning into16 cancer.17 There may be a correlation, but you know,18 that -- the reasonableness of the fears is really not the19 question.20 QUESTION: The question I had is, if there is a21 causal correlation, if 50 percent of the people who have22 contracted asbestosis as a result of exposure to asbestos23 will also contract cancer, why does that matter? That's24 what I didn't quite see.25 MR. SALMONS: I -- I think --23￼1 QUESTION: Because I understand -- I think you2 do correctly state their -- they agree with you on the3 facts on this.4 MR. SALMONS: Yes, Your Honor. I think that in5 terms of -- of the existing tort law principles that, as6 this Court noted in Gottshall, and even prior to that7 around the time of the enactment of FELA, that pain and8 suffering damages are limited to those damages that flow9 directly from the injury that allows you to sue, and10 that --11 QUESTION: But both of those cases were a self-12 standing claim of emotional distress. It wasn't pinned to13 any existing injuries.14 Here, the difference, and at least as portrayed15 by the judge who made it part of pain and suffering, is16 you do have an injury, you have the asbestosis, and one of17 the elements of damages is pain and suffering, and this is18 included in pain and suffering. At least that's the way19 the judge saw it, as distinguished from Buckley and20 Gottshall, which were self-standing claims of emotional21 distress not tied to any preexisting injury.22 MR. SALMONS: Yes, Your Honor, that is the way23 the court below approached the question. We think the24 problem with that is that, as the overwhelming majority of25 courts that have considered the issue of the relationship24￼1 between the diseases have concluded, they are separate2 diseases that result in separate injuries and separate3 causes of action, and the test of FELA --4 QUESTION: But doesn't it matter what form --5 I'm familiar with one of those cases, and that was the6 question --7 MR. SALMONS: Yes, Your Honor.8 QUESTION: -- when does the statute of9 limitations start to run when you get the virulent form of10 cancer? Does it begin to run when you got the asbestosis,11 because that should have tipped you off and you should12 have sued then?13 The answer in that context, and there are many14 courts that say that cancer is a separate claim, is not15 necessarily what it should be in this context.16 MR. SALMONS: We do think it is instructive,17 however, Your Honor, and that's particularly true because18 FELA provides for liability -- to any person suffering19 injury while employed -- for such injury, and we think,20 consistent with the text of that statute, which limits the21 employer's liability to the injury that's actually22 suffered, and not the fear of suffering a future -- injury23 in the future -- that the rule we are propounding today is24 the most consistent with that text and the most consistent25 with the purposes and -- and policy considerations this25￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Court articulated in both Gottshall and Buckley, and in particular --QUESTION: You did say -- you said in your brief that it's a question of not whether, but when, because when you get cancer, if you get cancer, you get the damages for past, present, and future pain and suffering, but that's not quite right, is it, because you are leaving out the category of person who has asbestosis and never gets cancer, which will be most of these people? Those people -- for them, it is a question of whether, not when, right?MR. SALMONS: It is true, Your Honor, people who now have asbestosis and fear getting the future may never get cancer. In fact, the overwhelming number of them won't get cancer --that cancer in26￼QUESTION: And then they --MR. SALMONS: But --QUESTION: -- they never -- they can nevercollect for this alleged fear.MR. SALMONS: That is true, Your Honor, andthat's also true for the snowmen of Metro-North that were at issue in Buckley. The Court -- this Court did not say, though, their fears were not reasonable. In fact, the court of appeals in that case had found that they were.What this Court said was, they didn't fit within1 the common law categories that allowed recovery because2 the exposure itself was not an impact or injury, and our3 position is that while the asbestosis gives them an4 ability to sue for their injuries related to that5 asbestosis, they cannot reach back to that initial6 exposure and recover the damages that were precluded in7 Buckley, namely --8 QUESTION: But here -- here we've got something9 more. We've got the proof that this is a serious risk,10 and that proof consists of the fact that asbestosis has,11 in fact, developed.12 MR. SALMONS: That is correct, and they can13 recover for all of their harms related directly to that14 asbestosis, but our position is they can't recover for15 their fears of the future disease of cancer --16 QUESTION: I know that that's your position, but17 once we cross that threshold, as we have in this case --18 the threshold that shows that the fear is, in fact, a19 serious one, because at least asbestosis has now20 developed, why isn't their fear of cancer just as21 reasonable whether that fear rests upon the fact that in22 10 percent of asbestosis cases, the asbestosis progresses23 to cancer -- which isn't true -- or, on the other hand, in24 the same percentage of asbestosis cases, cancer will also25 develop as a result of the common cause for which the27￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425employer is liable?Why is the fear any less reasonable in either ofthose cases?MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, with respect, we don'tthink the question is whether their fears are reasonable, but their question is whether their fears are recoverable at this time.QUESTION: Well, I know that, and one of the questions we want to know in determining whether recovery is possible is whether the fear is reasonable.MR. SALMONS: And we do not --QUESTION: One threshold test that we all agree on is, the fear has at least got to be confirmed by some physical manifestation. Okay, we've got this here.Once the physical manifestation is shown, why is reasonable fear -- why should reasonable fear -- not be enough for recovery, whether the causal connection goes from asbestosis to cancer, or common cause to cancer?MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, we think that one of the primary reasons why it should not be enough -- that reasonableness of the fear should not be enough in and of itself -- even assuming for a moment that the statistics that are at -- that were in evidence here are, in fact, sufficiently conclusive to draw those assumptions -- I mean, I do think it's important to remember that this28￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Court in Buckley referred to these same types of figures as being uncertain and controversial, and I think that that description is probably still true here.But the purposes and policies of FELA, which this Court recognized in Buckley, and in particular the fear that plaintiffs with relatively minor injuries now will come into court being drawn by the opportunity to get front-loaded, significant damages for future harms, will end up frustrating the system, and will end up hurting the plaintiffs that in fact develop cancer later, and I think that this case implicates those policies and concerns of FELA and tort law generally just as much as was the case in Buckley, that the vast majority, the number of people that will actually get cancer in the future is relatively low, and there is a significant risk --QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Salmons.MR. SALMONS: Thank you.QUESTION: Mr. Lazarus, we'll hear from you.ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD J. LAZARUS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSMR. LAZARUS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:The only issue raised by the first question presented in the cert petition is whether the trial court's jury instruction correctly described the legal29￼1 standard for when a physically injured plaintiff can2 recover for related emotional distress injury, and the3 sufficiency of the evidence and the jury's application of4 that legal standard to the evidence at trial is not one of5 the questions presented in this case, and it is quite6 clear that the --7 QUESTION: Well, the question presented doesn't8 speak in terms of the instruction, as I read it.9 MR. LAZARUS: No, but the question poses a pure10 question of law, and that is whether, when you have a11 physical injury, what the relationship has to be between12 the emotional distress and the physical injury, and our13 argument, Your Honor, is that under traditional tort law,14 it is not required that the emotional stress immediately15 accompany the physical injury; that it have its own16 physical manifestations; that it be severe.17 Tort law, as this Court explained in the Metro-18 North case, approaches the recovery for emotional distress19 injury from a categorical perspective, and tort law20 categorically distinguishes between two different21 situations.22 First, the situation where one has a stand-23 alone claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress24 where the emotional injury itself the element of the25 offense, the injury element, and second, the so-called30￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425parasitic damage context, where there is a threshold physical injury which supplies the essential element, and what many courts do is they impose very significant limitations on the recovery of emotional distress in the stand-alone context such as physical manifestations, immediacy, and severity, but --QUESTION: And you say this case is not brought on this theory?MR. LAZARUS: The jury instruction is reproduced on page 573 of the joint appendix.QUESTION: Where do we -- 573?MR. LAZARUS: 573 on the joint appendix, and that jury instruction makes it absolutely clear that respondents were entitled to recover for their reasonable fear of cancer as part of their overall damages only to the extent that that fear related to -- the Court's words -- related to proven physical injury, and there is absolutely no merit to petitioner's argument --QUESTION: Do some jurisdictions go further these days and require there be a reasonable causal nexus?MR. LAZARUS: Your Honor, almost no jurisdictions do. There are really only two cases --QUESTION: I thought there were a few that did.MR. LAZARUS: But almost all the cases go the other way, and the reason, Your Honor, is because --31￼1 there's some confusion in petitioner's argument here about2 what "pain and suffering" means. If you look at the jury3 instruction very closely on page 573, the trial judge in4 this case was very careful, knew exactly what he was5 doing.6 In the paragraph right before the "fear of7 cancer" paragraph, he refers to the entitlement of a8 physically injured plaintiff to recover for physical and9 mental pain and suffering. In the next paragraph, where10 he refers to reasonable fear of cancer, he refers only to11 mental pain and suffering, and this is a longstanding12 distinction in tort law. Physical pain and suffering is13 the kind of pain which is immediate and intimately14 associated with the bodily injury.15 QUESTION: All that is true, what you say, but I16 felt the question was open, and the reason that I thought17 it was open is because probably I once learned that this18 area of the law arose out of an English case where19 somebody is watching a coffin fall off in an accident, and20 the rule was that you can't recover unless something hits21 you, but what you were recovering for was the coffin, and22 the pain and suffering that a family member would feel.23 MR. LAZARUS: Right.24 QUESTION: That was immediate, directly related25 to the accident, and quite clearly present and measurable.32￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. LAZARUS: Right.QUESTION: This is the kind of thing that is notimmediate. It's a fear of something It is very hard to determine whether and it has no causal relation to the therefore, I thought that it's open.way in the future. it is right or wrong, physical thing, andMR. LAZARUS: Your Honor, it's really --QUESTION: You want to say -- I'll look it up, but if you were to say it's absolutely not open, I mean, they have, you know, lots of briefs where they've made a pretty good case it's at least open.MR. LAZARUS: It's open and shut.QUESTION: Oh, all right.(Laughter.)MR. LAZARUS: If one looks to the Restatement ofTorts, section 456, which ascribed -- well-settled, widely applied, and it describes the circumstances when a physically injured plaintiff can recover for related emotional distress injuries. It fits this case, and it includes in comment c, it expressly denies the validity of their physical manifestation requirements --QUESTION: No. I mean, you saw their reply brief, and their reply briefed that is that the underlined phrase -- the italicized phrase -- or from conduct which causes it, is not really what's at issue. What's issue33￼1 are the words in that called "emotional disturbance," and2 the question is, what kind of emotional --3 MR. LAZARUS: Yes.4 QUESTION: -- disturbance, and I think that5 their argument is, which if I put numbers on it is, each6 oneofusinthisroomhas1in4chancethatwewilldie7 of cancer, and the difference between us and a plaintiff8 inthiscaseisthathehasa1in--1in5--1in5--9 wait--Wehave1in5,1in5andhehas1in4,andwhat10 they're saying is, I think, that the difference between a11 1 in 5 chance of dying of cancer, and a difference of 1 in12 4 chance of dying of cancer is intangible -- hard to13 measure in anyone's psychology. Nobody really makes such14 distinctions rational, and therefore don't open this up to15 juries awarding large amounts of money.16 MR. LAZARUS: Your Honor, one really can't in17 the beginning start to entertain their evidence that18 they've introduced which wasn't part of the trial record19 in this case. The trial record --34￼2021 relevant. 222324 being put 25QUESTION: No, I don't think their evidence isMR. LAZARUS: Right.QUESTION: I would say this is a question that's to us as a matter of law.MR. LAZARUS: Right.12 numbers. 345 you, I've6 really --7 thing that was involved in the studies you cite -- it8 could be a lot less than what I say, but it's not going to9 be more.QUESTION: And it is up to us to look at theMR. LAZARUS: Right.QUESTION: And in reaching those numbers I gave assumed everything in your favor. That is, it's because you're a railroad and not the kind ofMR. LAZARUS: Well, actually, it may well be let's put that aside. What is quite clear, Your this Court explained in the Metro-North case, is because there are background risks, that doesn't one can't have a reasonable apprehension based1011 more, but12 Honor, as13 that just14 mean that15 on an increased risk.16 For instance, it is 100 percent sure, Your17 Honor, that every one of us in this room will die. We18 have a background risk. But the fact that someone through19 negligent conduct causes us a physical injury which20 increases our risk of dying sooner does not mean we can21 recover for that.22 And the place to look in the Restatement of23 Torts, Your Honor, to see that this is a classic thing24 that one can recover for, if you look to section 456, you25 look to comment c, and then it referenced comment -- it35￼1 referenced Restatement section 905, and Restatement -- and2 it says that when you have a physical injury, then it3 triggers the whole panoply of emotional distress injuries,4 and section 905 of the Restatement of Torts describes what5 is encompassed by "emotional distress," and comment e6 describes how it goes, as always, to fear, anxiety,7 apprehension of future consequences.8 QUESTION: Mr. Lazarus --9 QUESTION: Well, Mr. Lazarus, what if you put a10 physician on the stand, and the physician says, this man11 was 25 years old when he was injured, he ordinarily would12 be expected to live to be 75, but as a result of this13 injury he's only going to live to be 72? Now, is that the14 sort of thing that's compensable?15 MR. LAZARUS: Well, Your Honor, I don't know.16 I don't know -- I don't doubt, Your Honor, that in tort17 law, that there is a level of probability of risk below18 which one can say as a matter of law there's not a19 reasonable apprehension. I don't think, though, in this20 case, first of all, that there's any question that21 statistics support a reasonable apprehension, but even22 more importantly, the question whether they do or don't in23 this case is not one of the issues here. The issue is24 whether that's enough. The issue is whether you --25 QUESTION: Mr. Lazarus, may I ask you on that36￼1 point -- let's for a moment not think of ourselves as2 lawyers. Here are two people, the person in Buckley, the3 snowman, and the person who has asbestosis, both of those4 people may have a real fear of cancer, and we may find5 them credible witnesses.6 I thought in the Buckley situation that one7 concern is, it's too easy to make this up, and for some8 people facing that risk, they'll say, "Well, yeah, I might9 be run over tomorrow, it doesn't bother me." Isn't the10 real problem that the fear of something, when that fear11 doesn't have the physical manifestation, that these things12 are too easy to make up, too uncontrollable, and I frankly13 can't see the difference from the point of view of a14 sufferer between the person in Buckley and the person15 here.16 The person in the Grand Central Station case17 could say "I had the same fear that that person has. He18 hasn't proved his fear any more than I proved mine, why19 should he recover and not me?"20 MR. LAZARUS: Well, Your Honor, because as the21 Court, I think, explained quite well in Buckley, the way22 tort law approaches the question is on a categorical basis23 and distinguishes between those with physical injury,24 because if you have that threshold physical injury, that25 gives you the corroborating evidence you need that you37￼1 have, now, a legitimate plaintiff -- a legitimate2 plaintiff -- who has established their cause of action.3 You're not adding new cases to the docket, and even more4 importantly, as the court has --5 QUESTION: Well, what's more legitimate -- and6 there was no doubt about the conditions under which the7 people worked in Grand Central Station -- that they were8 exposed to asbestos, that they should have been told much9 earlier about their exposure,10 angry that they weren't told.11 MR. LAZARUS: Well,12 those who have asbestosis, as13 case referred, those with asbestosis have a statistically14 higher significance of getting the other kinds of cancers,15 because what -- it's not just a mere exposure, unimpaired,16 and what the asbestosis requirement does by requiring that17 kind of serious physical injury is, as everyone18 understood, and the rail industry argued in Metro-North,19 it dramatically limits the number of --20 QUESTION: Well, is there --21 MR. LAZARUS: -- possible plaintiffs.22 QUESTION: Mr. Lazarus, is their increased23 chance of cancer because they have asbestosis, or because24 the asbestosis originates from their exposure to asbestos,25 and it's the exposure to asbestos, not the asbestosis,and they must have been veryYour Honor, first of all, the trial record in this38￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that will cause cancer?MR. LAZARUS: Your Honor, we do not know, and noone knows, whether the asbestosis itself transforms itself into cancer.QUESTION: Well, I -- then you do challenge the statement by your opponents that asbestosis itself cannot change into cancer?MR. LAZARUS: No, Your Honor, their own experts --QUESTION: Well, no, now, wait a minute -- MR. LAZARUS: Yes. Yes. I --QUESTION: -- I asked you a question. What'sthe answer?MR. LAZARUS: -- I do. I do challenge that. QUESTION: You do challenge that?MR. LAZARUS: Their own expert, Your Honor, onpage 470 of the joint appendix, Dr. Renn -- their expert -- testified on page 470 that one could not contract lung cancer from exposure to asbestos until one had asbestosis.We're willing to admit that the science is more unclear that asbestos -- whether it actually transforms itself or not, we don't know, and we don't think as a matter of law it's necessary. It was their expert at trial who testified that actually to get lung cancer from39￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425asbestos exposure, it was a necessary prerequisite to first have asbestosis. We think --QUESTION: Well, can I ask you one other --QUESTION: That question wasn't put to the jury. I mean, the fact is that the jury was not required to find that the fear was a fear that the asbestosis would turn into cancer.MR. LAZARUS: That's absolutely right, Your Honor. We -- and we think that was not an error in the jury instructions. There's many cases out there -- let me refer to this one case, a case they cite in their reply brief on page 2 --QUESTION: Why wouldn't that be error? I mean, the instruction does say that a plaintiff who's demonstrated that he's developed a reasonable fear of cancer related to the proven physical injury from asbestos can be compensated for the fear.MR. LAZARUS: Right, and it has to be related toin this case.the samethe proven physical injury, and it was If I can give the example -- QUESTION: But it's so -- in instruction the court says, you cannotaward damages for cancer or any increased risk of cancer.MR. LAZARUS: Right, Your Honor, and that's where the court got it actually --40￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Which is so contradictory.MR. LAZARUS: No. No, it's not, Your Honor. What the court is doing here is exactly what courts do who adopt the separate disease rule which says, you can only recover for your present injuries now, and you can't recover for future injuries. The cancer itself, or the risk, is a future injury.QUESTION: I was going to ask this. What if one of these -- if you prevail, and then one of these plaintiffs develops cancer, I assume he can go in and sue again?MR. LAZARUS: That's right, yes, for the cancer.QUESTION: All right. Is there some kind of a discount now for the fear that he --MR. LAZARUS: No, no, just like there are separate causes of action for assault and battery. Those are two different injuries. The apprehension of something is a separate injury, and for these plaintiffs -- the respondents -- it is a current --QUESTION: So the fear that you're going to die of cancer is compensable before you get it, and it's compensable again after you get it?MR. LAZARUS: No. No. The fear would not be -- the cancer would be --QUESTION: Oh, I thought that the -- you can41￼1 recover for the fear in both cases under your theory.MR. LAZARUS: I -- sorry, I wasn't -- if you've once, you aren't going to be allowed to recover23 recovered4 again.567 first --89 was, you changed it from --QUESTION: So there would be a discount. MR. LAZARUS: Yes. If you'd brought theQUESTION: All right. So then your first answer10 MR. LAZARUS: I'm sorry. I thought your11 question was whether they could recover for cancer in the12 second one. I didn't understand you were referring to --13 QUESTION: Do we have cases in the law where you14 give discounts for the first verdict?15 MR. LAZARUS: Your Honor, I'm not sure. I don't16 think this issue has come up, but I don't think it's a bar17 to the recovery here.18 If I can refer to the radiation burn case that19 they referred to on page 2 of the reply brief --20 QUESTION: Well, but it indicates that maybe the21 recovery now is problematic.22 MR. LAZARUS: No, Your Honor, it's not23 problematic, because we have a present injury, and where24 you have a present physical injury and you have a present25 emotional injury, an apprehension based on that, those are42￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425two types of injuries.QUESTION: Well, don't you think that emotionalfear ought to be one that is reasonable? MR. LAZARUS: Yes.QUESTION: And a causal nexus there between the asbestosis and the fear?MR. LAZARUS: Well, Your Honor, we do think there is a causal nexus --QUESTION: There should be, shouldn't there?MR. LAZARUS: We -- but we do think there's a causal nexus here, and under the Restatement of Torts, all right, there are two different possible causal nexus under section 456 of the Restatement. We actually think both of those are met, and that is, we think that the fear is caused by the physical injury. It's also caused by the same negligent conduct, but that is also a sufficiency of the evidence question, and what they are positing here is what the legal standard should be for physically injured plaintiffs and the recovery for related emotional stress harm.An example, the Anderson case they cite on page 2 of their reply brief -- a radiation burn case -- which they say is distinct from this case. It's exactly the same as this case.QUESTION: I think you're right, and the dog43￼1 bite cases support you, and the radiation cases support2 you, and if it's cut-and-dried, as you say, then you win.3 But if, when I look at all this stuff again, and4 I come to the conclusion -- if I were to come to the5 conclusion that it wasn't cut-and-dried, then I'm much6 more at sea, and I want you to see why.78 problems,9 just likeOne was the reason I gave, which is the risk and the other, which is driving that, and I'd you to comment on this, is -- is my concern that10 if we begin to compensate people for fear of small changes11 in risks when the law doesn't -- is open on the point --12 what will happen in the asbestos cases, and that was their13 initial point, is that we will -- there's $200 billion at14 stake, and the fund will run dry.15 When the people who really get the cancer come16 into court, the cupboard will be bare, and I think that's17 a serious policy problem, and it's worrying me quite a18 lot, and that's why I keep coming back to the open nature19 of this.20 MR. LAZARUS: Your Honor, I think that the way21 to address that kind of issue is not to change decades of22 settled tort --23 QUESTION: Well, I say, is there any answer --24 MR. LAZARUS: Yes, there is.25 QUESTION: -- other than the law that is44￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425clear --MR. LAZARUS: There is. There is --QUESTION: Yes.MR. LAZARUS: -- and what can be done in a caselike that is, the defendant in that case can request a verdict form which requires the jury to allocate out, and that would allow a judge and an appellate, if appropriate, to review, and jury trials --QUESTION: Yes, but --MR. LAZARUS: -- trials, it happens all thetime.QUESTION: -- that isn't automatic in most jurisdictions, Mr. Lazarus. You can't say "I want a special verdict," and if the court says "No, I don't think I'll give you one," that's pretty much the end of it, isn't it?MR. LAZARUS: Your Honor, they didn't request one here, but that is the proper way to address the issue, and that's why you see --QUESTION: I don't understand what you're saying. What -- allocate out -- how does that -- the money is still paid to this claimant, so that when the person who actually has cancer comes into court, this company is bankrupt.MR. LAZARUS: No, but Your Honor, it addresses45￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Justice Breyer's concern, and that is, it allows you to have a record upon which one can make sure that the jury hasn't awarded a disproportionate amount based upon this one element, that you don't have the tail wagging the dog.QUESTION: But what's disproportionate? QUESTION: What's disproportionate?QUESTION: Suppose you take one plaintiff who isvery nervous, very apprehensive, and for that person this increased risk --QUESTION: Right.QUESTION: -- is going to be much more aggravated. Then, take another person who's subject to the same risk, but has a thicker skin and says, "Well, I'll take it in stride."MR. LAZARUS: Well, Your Honor, it's a reasonable apprehension. This is why there's an objective standard which applies to emotional recovery which doesn't require the physical. It has to meet an objective standard.If someone has a very, very thick skin in tort law and they, in fact, as a result of that, don't suffer damage, then they haven't suffered damage. If they have a very, very, very thin skin, and they suffer a lot of damage, then they don't recover everything --QUESTION: When the person gets cancer --46￼1 MR. LAZARUS: -- unless it's a reasonable2 apprehension.3 QUESTION: If a person gets cancer -- and I take4 it you agree with the Government that such a person could5 get past, present, and future anxiety as part of pain and6 suffering, but suppose that person had earlier had7 asbestos, and then brings his claim for lung cancer,8 couldn't -- if you prevail today -- the defendant say9 "Well, at least for the apprehension in the past, you know10 you're precluded, because you could have brought that11 claim when you got asbestosis"?12 MR. LAZARUS: Your Honor, that might be13 possible. That is not an issue which has been addressed14 here before this Court, and I haven't looked at the issue15 preclusion there between the two.What is clear is, if you have a current physical1617 injury -- 181920 which has21 have a case like this with a present physical injury, and22 you have a present emotional injury based on that, or as23 this Court has actually said in Metro-North, related to24 the physical injury, that's sufficient.25 I would like -- if -- to address the secondQUESTION: It would be claim preclusion.MR. LAZARUS: Yes, right, and it's not an issue been briefed here, because I think that when you47￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425issue, with the Court's --QUESTION: Before you do, may I ask one -- QUESTION: Let me ask one -- please. QUESTION: Just one quick question. Do youagree with Mr. Phillips' appraisal of the facts as -- we should assume that the fear of cancer was the major element of damages?MR. LAZARUS: No, Your Honor. All one has to assume here is that there was sufficient evidence that a reasonable jury could give some money based on fear of cancer, not that they had to, and not, certainly, that they gave $4.4 million, just sufficient evidence that a reasonable jury could have given a dollar, or some money. That's all that would be necessary.The second -- sorry.QUESTION: Was there testimony here that plaintiff A had heavy, or severe asbestosis and plaintiff B had mild, and was it based on any lung X-rays to show that this person's very badly infected and the other wasn't?MR. LAZARUS: Yes, Your Honor. There is -- there's lots of record evidence in this case to establish the asbestosis and how there may have been different degrees of asbestosis.QUESTION: All right, and since that's dependent48￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425on dosage, why isn't this a case in which we can apportion causation?MR. LAZARUS: Your Honor, for very simple a reason. The first reason is that we think that FELA itself on its face actually directs there to be joint and several liability when you have single injuries. That's our first argument, that FELA on its face answers the question, or that FELA provides that the railroad should be liable, quote, "for such injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of the railroad."QUESTION: Correct me if I'm wrong, is it a principle of tort law that if causation can be apportioned, that the injury is -- that there is then several liability on that tort --MR. LAZARUS: Your Honor --QUESTION: -- or am I wrong about that?MR. LAZARUS: No. The background principle ofthe common law of torts here is that there are -- if there is a single injury, then there is joint and several liability unless there's a reasonable basis for apportionment. Our threshold argument --QUESTION: And since asbestosis is peculiarly related to dosage and exposure, why isn't that a proper ground for apportionment here?MR. LAZARUS: Assuming that FELA doesn't answer49￼1 the question, let me answer it based upon the common law.2 Because the plaintiff has the burden -- sorry, the3 defendant -- petitioner has the burden in that case to4 establish 1) what the doses were, and 2) what the dose5 relationship was, and the one thing we know here, the6 prototype example that Mr. Phillips referred to is7 Mr. Butler, and the fact is that Mr. Butler apparently8 worked for three months exposed to asbestos for9 petitioner, and for many, many years exposed to asbestos10 at other workplaces.11 While we don't know what the dose relationship12 is, Your Honor, we do know for the record the one thing13 the dose relationship isn't is time. One can't compare14 one time to another. Let me tell you why we know that.15 On page 420 of the joint appendix, their expert testified16 that one is far more likely to contract asbestosis from17 high concentrations over a short period of time than low18 concentrations over a long period of time, and there's a19 reason for that.50￼As Dr. Brody explains on page 87 of the joint the lungs can naturally rid themselves of the the low concentrations. It's only at the high2021 appendix,22 fibers at23 concentrations -- the macrophages. It's only at the high24 concentrations that the lungs can't rid themselves of the25 fibers.1 While we have no idea how low the concentration2 levels were at these other workplaces, we do know how high3 the concentrations levels were at petitioner's workplace,4 because Mr. Butler testified on page 249 of the joint5 appendix that during those three months, he worked in the6 location of petitioner's workplace where the asbestos7 concentrations were at the highest. Mr. Butler testified8 that he worked in the room where the engines were stripped9 of their fibers, and more fibers were placed on.10 He testifies on page 249 he looks at these same11 pictures, which were trial exhibits -- they're reproduced12 in our brief. He looks at these pictures and he says,13 yes, that's the kind of room I worked in. This is 24914 and 250. Yes, that's the kind of exposure I faced.15 QUESTION: Well --16 MR. LAZARUS: So we know he had the very high17 concentrations --18 QUESTION: Well now, how do we know that?19 You're saying he worked in the place with the highest20 concentrations so far as the railroad is concerned, but21 how do we know how that compares with where he worked22 elsewhere?23 MR. LAZARUS: Your Honor, we have no idea, and24 they -- because they never introduced or sought to25 introduce any evidence, but what we do know is that very51￼1 low concentrations -- here we can turn to the Rand report,2 which they filed with this Court -- lodged with the3 Court --just two weeks ago. The Rand report and the4 testimony of this case makes absolutely clear that in low5 concentration employment centers, at low concentration6 exposures, one is very unlikely to have any kind of7 physical injury, asbestosis or cancer ever develop, which8 is why there are hundreds and hundreds of thousands of9 plaintiffs, many of which come from low exposure, which,10 as the Rand report makes clear, is not likely to lead to11 any kind of disease. We have no idea how low it was here.12 We know how high it was here.13 I have no doubt, Your Honor, that petitioner14 would have been very hard-pressed at trial to actually15 show what the doses were, and to show what the dose16 relationship is, but what I do know is, whatever their17 reason was at trial for never trying to introduce this18 evidence, and they never -- if you looked at their motion,19 where they made the motion for this jury instruction, they20 never even remotely suggest what the basis for21 apportionment would be, but whatever their strategic22 reason for doing that at trial, what is absolutely clear23 is they are not allowed in the first instance to come to24 the United States Supreme Court and proffer newspaper25 articles, magazine articles, selected journal articles and52￼1 try to argue that there is a reasonable basis for2 apportionment, or they're entitled to a remand to litigate3 a issue which they failed to litigate in the first4 instance.5 The simple truth, Your Honor, is that at trial6 in this case the respondents established all of their7 essential elements of their negligent cause of action.8 They established their physical injury, and they received9 a jury award which certainly, compared to the jury awards10 that I see mentioned in the amicus briefs, is a jury award11 which seems relatively modest, and certainly a jury award12 which on its face doesn't suggest that there was some13 outrageous amount given for reasonable fear of cancer.14 QUESTION: May I just ask you, you say there's15 no evidence of what the degree of exposure in other areas,16 and so forth and so on. Didn't they make any offers of17 proof with, or did they just the prove the time that they18 worked --19 MR. LAZARUS: They really just proved the time.20 They -- we know the nature of the work, but what we don't21 know, Your Honor --22 QUESTION: Well, but then that would be a23 question of the weight of that evidence, rather than24 whether they preserved the point.25 MR. LAZARUS: Well, Your Honor, I'm not -- they53￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425never offer a basis of apportionment. We'd have to know, and the evidence at trial made clear, to know the dose and dose relationship you'd have to know the air flow rates, the pathways of exposure --QUESTION: At what point in the trial did it become clear, by a ruling of the trial judge, that they could not rely on the exposure in other areas?MR. LAZARUS: Your Honor, they were not denied this opportunity at trial to introduce the evidence with respect to the non-railroad employment, and you can see that because they actually did do some cross-examination, they did try to introduce the evidence of three months, they did try to refer to the other workplaces, they could have tried to introduce more evidence.QUESTION: Well, why was that relevant if there's joint liability?MR. LAZARUS: Well, we thought it was irrelevant, Your Honor, but they were clearly thinking about the possibility of requesting an apportionment instruction, but the fact is, they never laid out a reasonable basis.If you look at the memorandum --QUESTION: Oh, but they did request an instruction, didn't they?MR. LAZARUS: They did request the instruction,54￼1 but--2 QUESTION: So the point was preserved.3 MR. LAZARUS: Right, but the trial court was4 correct in denying the instruction because they had not5 met their burden of proffering a reasonable basis for6 apportionment, and in the absence of that evidentiary7 basis, the trial court was absolutely correct in denying8 it. This was a jury verdict, Your Honor, this was9 reached.10 QUESTION: Oh, but that theory, then, is that11 several liability would have been appropriate if the12 evidence were sufficient?MR. LAZARUS: Well, no, Your Honor. Our argument is that it would not -- asbestosis, classic individual injury. There are many1314 threshold15 this is a16 courts who have talked about this, and they said, well, in17 theory, asbestosis is dose-related.18 QUESTION: With respect, Mr. Lazarus, isn't19 your -- the bottom line in this argument that this is20 simply not an issue in the case, because they didn't55￼21 provide a 222324basis?MR. LAZARUS: Yes, that's absolutely right. QUESTION: So you're saying, forget it.MR. LAZARUS: That's right. They had the burden25 and they simply didn't meet their burden.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: And they say you had the burden. MR. LAZARUS: Well, but it's quite -- QUESTION: It seems to me that argument goes tothe weight of the evidence they offered, rather than to the -- your legal position. I may be missing something.MR. LAZARUS: Well, Your Honor, no, they have to as a matter of law, right, proffer some kind, and here there's absolutely nothing --QUESTION: Well, but they did proffer -- if I remember it, they did proffer evidence as to the time that these people worked in other areas where they were exposed to asbestos, didn't they?MR. LAZARUS: There is some evidence -- QUESTION: But you're saying that's not enough. MR. LAZARUS: There's some evidence as to that,but in fact if you can look to their instruction they don't even say what -- that time is the relevant factor, and I think the evidence at trial shows that time is not even close to establishing what the dose relationship would be. This is very complicated.QUESTION: But aren't you really saying that unless there's an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial judge in refusing to send this to the jury, based on what you've just described, insufficiency of evidence on their part, that it's not in the case for us?56￼1 MR. LAZARUS: That's absolutely right, Your2 Honor.3 Thank you.4 QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Lazarus.5 Mr. Phillips, you have two minutes remaining.6 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS7 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER8 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.9 I want to be absolutely clear about the10 apportionment in this case. We put in an instruction on11 apportionment based on a reasonable basis following12 Justice Kennedy's analysis of the law, which says if13 there's a reasonable basis to apportion, you do that.14 The trial judge did not reject that on the basis15 of insufficient evidence. What he said at page 179,16 volume 9 of the transcript is, if you've got a joint tort­17 feasor, that tort-feasor is liable for all of the18 injuries. He said it as a matter of law. It's joint and19 several liability. There is no apportionment. That's the20 ruling we challenged. That's the legal issue before this21 Court.22 The second question, then, with your leave, is23 to--24 QUESTION: Well, but should we adopt your25 position if it's as difficult to show this separate57￼1 causation as your brother argues?2 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, Dean Prosser said from day3 one it's always going to be difficult to apportion, but4 that's no reason not to have the jury undertake to5 apportion. There are lots of decisions that juries make6 that are very hard to make, but the better rule is to7 apportion, because that's the fair outcome that will arise8 in these cases.9 With respect to the fear of cancer damages, the10 key to this case, it seems to me, is just how big a11 gatekeeper function the fact of asbestosis can be, and12 my -- the argument is, asbestosis is extraordinarily easy13 to diagnose. There are currently 5,500 cases under FELA14 in West Virginia. Every single one of them involves a15 claim of asbestosis. Every single one of them will be16 supported 1718 cases are19 exactly the kinds of evidence you had in this case, I'm20 afraid of cancer, give me whatever you think is the right21 number. That is the essence of unpredictable and22 unlimited damages. This Court declined to allow that23 under FELA in Buckley. It should decline to allow that24 under FELA in this case as well.25 If there are no questions, I'll reserve --by an expert.What you get is, that's not a gatekeeper. Those going to come in, and then you're going to have58￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Phillips. The case is submitted.(Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in the above-entitled matter was submitted.)59￼
