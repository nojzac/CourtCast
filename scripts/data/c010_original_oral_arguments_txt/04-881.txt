WOLFMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          Section 207 of the Social Security Act containsa broad ban on the attachment of Social Security benefitsthat may be overridden if, in doing so, Congress expresslyrefers to Section 207.  Our basic position is that theeffect of an express reference to Section 207 can go nofurther than the authority that is granted in the statutethat includes the express reference.  Therefore, here, theDebt Collection Act, the statute that contains thatexpress reference, prohibits offsets to collect claimsthat have been outstanding for more than 10 years.Therefore, the Government lacks offset authority tocollect Mr. Lockhart's older debts.          The Debt Collections Act's 10-year bar on theright of the Government to offset debt from governmentalpayments owing to debtors was enacted in 1982.  But, atthat time, the Government did not have authority to offset3Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 Social Security benefits at all. The Government's claim2 that there's no 10-year bar here relies entirely on a3 provision of the Higher Education technical amendments4 that overrode statutes of limitations for collecting5 student debts. But that was passed in 1991, 5 years6 before the -- before -- the Government had authority to7 offset Social Security benefits at all. That authority,8 as I've referred to, came only in 1996, in the Debt9 Collection Improvement Act, which did expressly refer to10 the Social Security Act's anti-attachment provision. But11 --12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did -- are -- just as an13 initial matter, are you sure that one Congress can bind a14 future Congress that way, that Congress can pass a law15 that says, you know, "In the future, no statute shall have16 X effect unless it says" -- and then it writes in a phrase17 that has to be said?18 MR. WOLFMAN: Well --19 JUSTICE SCALIA: And then you have a future20 Congress that makes its intent entirely clear in a statute21 that does not use the magic words. I thought our cases22 held that, in such a situation, the will of the future23 Congress prevails --24 MR. WOLFMAN: That --25 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- so long as it's clearly4Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425expressed.          MR. WOLFMAN:  I will say that that is somethingthat we've considered.  It's not briefed here, but I thinkthe issue is not presented here.  And here's why: becausein -- what occurred in 1996 comported with the express-reference requirement.  The problem here is that -- so, itsaid that they can offset Social Security benefits.  Butit is contained in a statute that includes the 10-yearbar.  So, even if the anti-attachment provision did notexclude the express-reference provision, it still --whatever allowed the attachment has to be, in our view,coincident with the statute in which the express reference--          JUSTICE BREYER:  It didn't contain the bar atthe time that they said, "You can collect it."  In thelater statute, which said, "You now can collect out ofSocial Security," when they passed that, did it contain a10-year bar?          MR. WOLFMAN:  Yes, it did.          JUSTICE BREYER:  I thought the Higher EducationAct said -- as of what year did the Higher Education Actsay, "No statute of limitations applies to us"?          MR. WOLFMAN:  That was 1991.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Fine.  In --          MR. WOLFMAN:  Yes.5Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- 1991, it said, "No statuteof limitations applies to us."  Then, in what year did thestatute -- was passed which said, "And you can collectmoney out of Social Security payments for highereducation"?          MR. WOLFMAN:  That occurred in 1996.  But, as I--          JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Why isn't that theend of it?  So --          MR. WOLFMAN:  The reason that's --          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- so there was no -- there wasno statute of limitations applying to the Social SecurityAct; and then, in 1996, they say, "And now go get them."          MR. WOLFMAN:  Because --          JUSTICE BREYER:  What can we do about that?          MR. WOLFMAN:  Because, with respect, that's notwhat Congress said in 1996.          JUSTICE BREYER:  What did they say?          MR. WOLFMAN:  They didn't say, "Go get them."What they did is, as an amendment to the Debt CollectionAct, in the Debt Collection Improvement Act, they insertedpermission to go -- to offset Social Security benefits ina statute that has a 10-year bar.  So --          JUSTICE BREYER:  It has a 10-year bar.  But theearlier 1991 Act says, "That doesn't apply to us."6Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. WOLFMAN: Yes, but -- but, again, getting2 back -- and I think this takes us back to Justice Scalia's3 question -- that -- the -- there is a broad anti-4 attachment provision. There is an express-reference5 requirement. Our view is that the -- that -- those6 requirements can go no -- the abrogation of the -- of the7 bar to offset Social Security benefits, or to attach8 Social Security benefits in any way, can go no further9 than the statute in which that abrogation occurs. And10 this statute has a 10-year bar.11 So, if I can explain further, the Debt12 Collection Improvement Act, and the Debt Collection Act13 before it, has a 10-year bar. It's not merely a statute14 of limitations. It says that the Government has no15 authority to offset after the 10-year period, after the16 claim has been outstanding for more than 10 years. That's17 the statute that includes the abrogation of the offset of18 Social Security benefits.19 JUSTICE BREYER: So, in other words, you're20 saying that that provision of the later statute that says,21 "Go get them on Social Security," implicitly reads into it22 the 10-year bar that's in a different part of the statute.23 MR. WOLFMAN: Well, I --24 JUSTICE BREYER: So, it's as if it said, "Go get25 them on Social Security, under 407, which is gone now, but7Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425only for 10 years."          MR. WOLFMAN:  Well --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that what your -- I'm tryingto understand this.          MR. WOLFMAN:  That is our argument.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.          MR. WOLFMAN:  That is our argument.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.          MR. WOLFMAN:  But I would only qualify it --          JUSTICE BREYER:   The only problem is, itdoesn't say that.          MR. WOLFMAN:  No, I would disagree, Your Honor. I would say that my only quarrel with your question isthat it's not implicit, it is explicit.  The statute --the Debt Collection Improvement Act, as the DebtCollection Act before it, contains a 10-year bar on theauthority of the Government to offset.  This is not a merestatute-of-limitations defense that can be waived.  Thisis a complete lack of authority to the -- in theGovernment to offset.  That's --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are --          MR. WOLFMAN:  -- the statute --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are you saying that this has apurpose other than barring stable -- stale claims?  It'ssimply designed to limit the offset provisions in order to8Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425allow other Federal programs to proceed and -- I'm lookingfor some way for you to describe (e) as being somethingother than a limitations provision.MR. WOLFMAN: Well, what it says --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because I think that would helpyou.MR. WOLFMAN: Yes, and I think -- that's exactly my point. What (e) says is that this Act does not apply -- and I'm quoting now -- "This Act does not apply when the claim has been outstanding for more than 10 years." That strikes us -- you can call it "limitations" if you want, but it strikes us as a very powerful one. Because it restricts the Government's ability to bring such a case --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if --MR. WOLFMAN: -- for offset. JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- if we call it"limitations," you have a much harder case, because of the1991 Act.MR. WOLFMAN: Well, I -- with respect, I don't think that the actual nomenclature matters that much, but I will distinguish it from what the law normally calls a limitations period, because a limitations period is one that is raised as an affirmative defense and may be waived. This provision, where it says, "This Act does not9Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425apply" --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well --          MR. WOLFMAN:  -- does not apply.JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- can you give me a reason for the Government's adopting (e), the 10-year -- the 10- year bar, other than for stale claims or --          MR. WOLFMAN:  Oh, I don't know that there isone, but my point, again, is simply that the Governmenthas no authority to proceed.  So, then we look -- we lookat that statute, and we say, "What did the -- what did theCongress do in 1996?"  What the Congress did in 1996 wasamend that very statute by saying, "Within the confines ofthis statute, you may now offset."          JUSTICE BREYER:  All right, but that's --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I understand that, but I'mjust -- I'm just saying, if you could give me anexplanation, a characterization, a description, astatement of purpose that's other than the bar on staleclaims, I think you'd have a stronger case.  But it seemsto me just like a stale-claims statute, so I go back andlook for other limitations period, and I find it in1091(a).          MR. WOLFMAN:  You know, again, if -- it is not-- the purposes of the bar are not stated in any of thelegislative materials, and we can assume that at least one10Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 of the principal purposes was to not allow the litigation,2 the contesting of stale claims, or to give the individuals3 repose, which is a purpose of time bars.4 JUSTICE BREYER: You can call it any purpose you5 want, but there is an earlier word in 9- -- 1091(a), just6 what Justice Kennedy said. The earlier word says7 limitations don't apply to the higher-education debt. And8 so, if this later statute, the words you're talking about,9 the words of "10 years," the words that limit when you can10 do it, if those words, which are in subsection (e), are a11 "limitation," then I guess the earlier statute says they12 don't apply to the higher-education debt. And so, I don't13 see how you get out of that. I mean -- I mean, this is a14 rather harsh result. I understand why you'd like to get15 out16 it.1718 are19 first of all, if you must characterize what -- and we are20 happy to do so -- was in the 1996 Act as either a time21 bar or a limitations period, this is clearly the former,22 because this -- because the limitations periods in the law23 are ones which have to be raised by affirmative defense.24 For instance, the Rules of Civil Procedure say limitations25 periods are raised by affirmative defense, and the case11Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005of it.  But I don't understand how we do get out of      MR. WOLFMAN:  Well, I think there are -- there-- I -- there are several answers.  And, if I might,￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425law is unanimous that they can be waived.  That is notwhat this provision does.  This provision restricts theauthority, in the first instance, for the Government tobring the case.          The second thing I would say, though, Your Honor-- and I think it does not matter, ultimately -- that canbe our principal submission here, and it is, but it doesnot matter -- I think, ultimately, the nomenclaturedoesn't matter, because -- again, because the Actrestricts the authority of the Government to bring a casethat is beyond the 10-year period.  And that is thestatute that contains the express reference.  That is the--          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Of course, part of the problemis that 1091(a)(2), the "notwithstanding" clause, talksalso specifically about offsets, which is what this is, Itake it.          MR. WOLFMAN:  No, I understand that, Your Honor. I mean --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, if it had said "no" --          MR. WOLFMAN:  -- I understand that.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- "no limitations period,"then I might -- this specifically talks about an offset.          MR. WOLFMAN:  Well, that's right.  The -- and I-- I don't think that undercuts our argument at all, 12Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 because, after all, there's no question that, prior to2 1996, there was offset authority in the Government to3 offset -- to collect debt against other types of income,4 other than Social Security. So, I don't think that5 undercuts our argument at all.6 But let me, if I might, go back to your question7 one more time, because I think there's yet a third answer,8 which is -- which is the chronological answer that -- made9 in our briefs that, in 1991, the Congress could not have10 had the intent to get at Social Security benefits at all,11 because, of course, there -- and it's -- this point is12 conceded -- the Government had no authority whatsoever to13 offset Social Security benefits.14 If I might, in the -- let me go --15 JUSTICE SOUTER: May I pursue that16 second --17 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- more? I -- it18 that you would have a much stronger argument19 if, in 1996, the Act provided that, suddenly, Social20 Security benefits -- some Social Security benefits would21 be -- would be subject to administrative offset, but only22 those when the Government -- imposed when the Government23 is trying to collect educational loans. We would then24 have what seems to -- would seem to me to be a really25 head-to-head conflict between the two statutes. The 13Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005point for aseems to meon that point￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425     trouble is that, in 1996, the extension of the     administrative setoff authority covered Social Security     benefits to be -- for which there would be a setoff for     any purpose -- not just educational loans; for any     purpose.  So that, in fact, it is possible for us to read     the 1996 Act as having an effect -- there's a 10-year     limit, generally -- at the same time that we read the     earlier -- I forget what the -- '91, I guess it is --               MR. WOLFMAN:  The HETA law, yes.               JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- which says, with respect to     educational loan collections, including by setoff, there's     no limitation at all.  So, we can have both statutes     without rendering either one of them nugatory.  And isn't     that the preferred way to read statutes?               MR. WOLFMAN:  Well, but I -- but I -- with all     respect, I think our interpretation certainly does not     render HETA nugatory, because HETA would still override     limitations periods for other forms of collection with     respect to other types --               JUSTICE SOUTER:  But with --               MR. WOLFMAN:  of debts.               JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- with respect to Social     Security setoffs, of course, it would.               MR. WOLFMAN:  Well, it -- I'm not sure I     understand that question.14Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE SOUTER: Social Security -- Social2 Security said it would be -- it would be a -- it would --3 a flat head-to-head contradiction, no matter how you read4 it, on Social Security setoffs for educational loans.5 MR. WOLFMAN: Well --6 JUSTICE SOUTER: And if that's the only thing7 that the 1996 Act covered, we would say, "Boy, there is8 just an absolute conflict here. We can't have both9 statutes." But, in fact, we can have both statutes most of10 the time. We read the 1996 10-year limitation as covering11 everything except setoffs against Social Security for12 educational loans. And, with respect to the educational13 loans, we give respect to the -- to the earlier decision14 that there be no limitation at all. You just have a15 weaker argument than you would have if the 1996 Act only16 covered this case.17 MR. WOLFMAN: Well, that may be, but let me,18 again, if I -- if I might, respond to that -- to this --19 to this point, because I think it is true that the20 proportion of times under our argument that the 10-year21 bar would apply would -- is greater under our position,22 but it is, nevertheless, true that HETA still applies to23 many situations, under our reading, and the 10-year bar24 applies to somewhat more. But let me -- I think there's25 another answer to your point, which is, it still does not15Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 undercut our basic submission that the Congress could not2 have formed this specific intent. And it's very unlike3 the -- the intent being to get to the Government the --4 the result it seeks here. And the reason for that is --5 is, they could not have focused on this problem, because6 in -- it wasn't for another 5 years that Social Security7 was even on the radar screen at all. And this brings me8 back, I think, to Justice Breyer's --9 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but --10 MR. WOLFMAN: -- initial question.11 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- may I ask this question?12 That's a very -- that's a very interesting statutory13 construction case, I must say, by the way. But the -- in14 1996, when they made the offset available against Social15 Security payments, they didn't enact a 10-year statute of16 limitations; they changed subsection, I think, (b) to (d)17 and said the 10-year provision is retained. And when the18 10-year provision was first put in -- I mean, when the19 exception for student loans was made, in 1991, you had a20 statute that had a 10-year period for everything except21 student loan recovery. And it seems to me that if you22 look at the 1996 statute as saying, "We're going to allow23 offsets against Social Security," under the same scheme24 that was enacted in 1991, because we had just amended the25 10-year provision to preserve it -- they preserved the 10-16Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425year provision -- that they seem to me to be preserving itin a statute that made this distinction between studentloans and all other offsets.  Is --          MR. WOLFMAN:  I --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  It isn't as though theyenacted, for the first time, an authority to offset SocialSecurity and, in that statute, said, "And -- but, by theway, there's a 10-year period of limitations here."          MR. WOLFMAN:  Well, that --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Rather, they amended the 1991Act.          MR. WOLFMAN:  -- that is correct.  And I thinkthat -- but with a caveat, which I'll get to -- but -- Ithink that is correct, but it is a -- it is a consequenceof the situation that Congress found itself in, in 1996.In other words, it already had a statute, the offsetstatute, which had a 10-year bar.  And so --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But it also had the exceptionfor student loans.  It's -- it was --          MR. WOLFMAN:  Well --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- side by side with the restof the 10-year bar.          MR. WOLFMAN:  I'm not sure what you mean in that-- I'm not sure what you mean by the exception for studentloans.  There --17Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 23 statutory4 yes, what56 statute. 78 that was9 Security JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, it's 1091(a). MR. WOLFMAN:  Well, 1091 was in a different provision, in a different part of the code.  But I'm saying is, they -- JUSTICE STEVENS:  But it was in the 1991 MR. WOLFMAN:  Right.  It was in a 1991 statutea freestanding statute that dealt with Socialbenefits, generally.  Then what you had in 199610 was a focus on offsets, specifically, and on Social11 Security, specifically. And the only point --12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the '91 Act mentions13 offsets, specifically, as well.14 MR. WOLFMAN: That's right. And -- but it15 mentions a lot of -- many meanings of "collection," that16 is correct. And -- but I think it's not quite fair to say17 that they merely reenacted the 10-year bar. We think18 that's sufficient for us to prevail. But, you know, the19 Congress, in 1996, did a pretty comprehensive overall --20 overhaul of the Debt Collection Act. It appears to have21 gone through every section. It strengthened some of the22 notice provisions. It focused specifically on Social23 Security and said that you can now offset them by making24 the express reference. And then it turned to -- what had25 been subsection (c) then became subsection (e). It18Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 amended one of the paragraphs, but retained the paragraph2 that has the 10-year bar. So, I think it's fair to say3 that Congress looked at all the sections carefully. Now4 --5 JUSTICE STEVENS: If you say that -- let me just6 throw this thought out, so you can comment on it.7 JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that there is a8 reasonable basis for assuming Congress might have thought9 that student loans should not have a 10-year bar if you're10 going to collect from Social Security, because most Social11 Security payments won't accrue until many, many years --12 much more than 10 years after the student-loan default.13 MR. WOLFMAN: Well, that -- the Government14 certainly makes that submission in its brief, but, as we15 note in our reply brief, the statistics the Government16 cites don't really back that up. I -- but we do -- we do17 acknowledge that, with respect to Social Security18 retirement benefits, there will be many people who are19 beyond the 10-year bar. With respect to people who get20 other sorts of Social Security benefits, that's not clear21 at all, actually. There are survivors --22 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but there is a --23 MR. WOLFMAN: -- and there are disability --24 JUSTICE STEVENS: Retirement benefits are a25 pretty big part --19Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR.

WOLFMAN:  But, again, I don't think that --there's no -- there's no suggestion in -- the problem --the ultimate problem with that point for the Government,Justice Stevens, is that it requires us to believe thatCongress formed that intent in 1991, which is animpossibility, because --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  No, I understand that.          MR. WOLFMAN:  -- in 1991, Social Securitybenefits were just, sort of, offon the radar screen at all.  Andproblem with the Government's --the table.  They weren'tthat's the ultimate          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Mr.          MR. WOLFMAN:  -- theory there.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  -- Wolfman, are thereprovisions by regulation in the Department of Educationfor discharge of debts like this on a showing of total andpermanent disability?          MR. WOLFMAN:  There are, Your Honor.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  And your client doesn'tqualify, or --MR. WOLFMAN: Well, the record is completely 20Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005--￼1 silent on that question. I don't know the answer to that.2 He was certainly disabled. I will only point out that3 the standards for total and permanent disability under the4 Department of Education regs are much more stringent than5 those for Social Security, because that only requires a6 12-month period of disability. But I don't know the7 answer as to him.8 I do want to get to one other point9 before I sit down, and -- which is to address one of the10 Government's arguments -- is that to -- to get around a --11 the problem that the DCIA reenacted the 10-year bar, the12 Government relies on the "notwithstanding" clause of the13 1991 Education Act, arguing that it wipes away any time14 bar, regardless of when the time bar was enacted, and no15 matter what type of collection is at issue. But, as we16 note in our reply brief extensively, those17 "notwithstanding" clauses are not as all-powerful as the18 Government suggests they are. And what the case law --19 the lower-court case law suggests is that you need to20 look, as we have done in our submission, at the21 legislative history and the legislative motive surrounding22 both Acts, the previous Act and the subsequent Act. And,23 here, what you have -- and I don't want to beat a dead24 horse, but I will repeat once again that the problem here25 is -- for the Government -- is that we have this very21Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 powerful anti-attachment provision with its express-2 reference requirement. And the only place in these3 statutory materials where the express reference occurs is4 in a -- the very Act that includes the 10-year bar. And5 to accept the Government's argument, you would have to6 accept the notion that the -- an express reference in an7 act can go beyond the authority that's granted by that8 very act.9 JUSTICE BREYER: No, it -- I mean, you -- it's10 -- it probably comes up a lot. You have -- you have the11 earlier act that imposes -- suppose you have some --12 Endangered Species Act and -- at an earlier time -- and it13 says all provisions of a certain kind will have this14 effect in respect to endangered species. And then you15 have some laters act -- later acts. And, in those later16 acts, there are certain things about how to treat certain17 animals and so forth. And the question would be, "Well,18 does that earlier thing, telling you how to treat an19 endangered species, apply now to the animals in this later20 act insofar as they're endangered?" And the answer would21 be, "Of course it does" --222324 reason -- 25Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005MR.

WOLFMAN: Right.JUSTICE BREYER:  -- for thinking that itAnd so, what's the special reason --MR. WOLFMAN:  Well --JUSTICE BREYER:  -- here?

WOLFMAN: -- that's the nub of the case --20 JUSTICE BREYER: Uh-huh. Yes, that is the nub.21 MR. WOLFMAN: -- the special reasons. But --22 but I -- but I -- let me -- let me -- let me answer your23 question --24 JUSTICE BREYER: But, I mean, they don't have25 that big burden to show. They have to just --23Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. WOLFMAN: I --2 JUSTICE BREYER: -- show it's normal.3 MR. WOLFMAN: That's where I --4 JUSTICE BREYER: And you have to show it's5 special.6 MR. WOLFMAN: I think, on these legislative7 materials, they have quite a burden. And let me explain8 why. Your -- the -- Justice Breyer, the hypothetical you9 posit is one with which I can agree. We are not saying --10 I don't want to be mistaken -- that -- we are not saying11 that previous legislation can't have effect on future12 events, or even future legislation. We're not saying that13 all. But the nub of our argument is this express-14 reference requirement, and I think it's -- it seems very,15 very odd to us that when you have a statute that has an --16 where the express reference appears, and that has a 10-17 year bar on the authority --18 JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. --19 MR. WOLFMAN: -- to collect --20 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- Wolfman, couldn't you say21 the question could be phrased in this way? Do we view the22 notwithstanding language in 1091(a) as enacted in 1091 and23 governing the future, or do we view the 1996 amendment as,24 in effect, an amendment to that stat which -- which25 reenacted the provisions that were already there? And if24Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425it's a reenactment in 1996, then it's just an exceptionfrom the 10-year bar.          MR. WOLFMAN:  Right.  I think that -- that is afair characterization of one our arguments here --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes.          MR. WOLFMAN:  -- which -- one of our argumentshere is, given the various indicia of intent, both in '91and '96, that the '96 Act, with respect to a small sliverof collections, is effectively an amendment of the '91Act.  However, that is not our only, or even our principalsubmission.  Our principal submission has to do with thepowerful anti-attachment --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Right.          MR. WOLFMAN:  -- provision.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  I understand.          MR. WOLFMAN:  Okay?  And, again, theGovernment's position -- and I will rest after this,because I've repeated this already -- but the -- theGovernment's position is, in effect, that you can use theanti-attachment position in the express-referencerequirement in a statute to allow authority beyond thatvery statute.  And we submit that that is -- that is notpermissible under section 407.          Unless the Court has further questions, I'llreserve the rest of my time.25Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. Wolfman.Ms.          MS.may it pleaseBlatt.ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT   ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTBLATT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, andthe Court:          In sweeping and unqualified language, the HigherEducation Act provides that, notwithstanding any otherprovision of law, no limitations as to time shall apply tothe collection of student-loan debt by offset.  Therefore,notwithstanding the general 10-year limit that applies tothe offset of all Federal payments, including SocialSecurity payments, no time limit applies.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But it didn't include SocialSecurity payments when it was enacted.          MS. BLATT:  That's right.  In 1982, Congressauthorized --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Or 1991.  Either one.          MS. BLATT:  Right.  In 1982, Federal paymentswere subject to offsets such as Federal grants orcontracts or pension.  And, in 1991, Congress passed a lawthat said there's no -- going to be no time limit for theGovernment to collect student-loan debt by offset.Therefore, there has always been a student-loan exceptionto the Government's ability to offset for only up to 1026Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 years. So, we can't offset Federal pension payments or2 contract payments beyond 10 years unless it's for student3 loans.4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but then -- but then, in5 -- you know, you know what's coming. You -- the provision6 you rely on is 3116, and it's stuck into the middle of7 this -- of a provision which requires written notice,8 opportunity to inspect records, and so forth. All those9 apply. But you have to say that (e) doesn't apply.10 MS. BLATT: Well, (e) is a limitations period,11 and it is a provision of law, and the Higher Education Act12 says, notwithstanding any other provision of law, there's13 no time limit for offsetting -- for collection by offset14 when it's to collect student-loan debt. What happened in15 1996 is, Congress authorized Social Security benefits as16 another source of Federal payment. But it's critical to17 understand that Congress left completely undisturbed and18 intact that pre-existing 10-year limit and the pre-19 existing student-loan exception --20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Mr. Wolfman tells us, Ms.21 Blatt, that this clause is not quite as sweeping as you22 suggest, the clause in the 1991 Act, and points23 specifically to provisions that say, "no other provision24 of law enacted before, on, or after." The picture we're25 given of the 1991 Act is that up until 1991, whatever27Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 exists up2 this 19913 statutes.4until 1991, there's no time limitation, but thatstatute does not speak to subsequently enacted              MS. BLATT:  Yes, well, it is unqualified, on its5 face, Justice Ginsburg. It doesn't say "notwithstanding6 any other provision of existing law." It says "any law."7 And it would be a rather bizarre and novel statute if8 Congress had to keep amending every time Congress9 redesignated a limitation provision, which is all that's10 happened here. Every time Congress had a limitation11 provision that changed from subsection (e) to (a), or was12 given a different section number, Congress would have to13 go back and say -- I guess, reenact the Higher Education14 Act every time it amended the statute of limitations.15 But, even if you think that it only applied to pre-16 existing limitations period, this 10-year limit predated17 the Higher Education Act. It was passed in 1982, and had18 -- and has appeared in identical language since 1983.19 Nothing happened in 1996 to statutes of limitations. All20 that happened was21 Security benefits22 Federal payments.23 And let24 would largely nullify Social Security offsets to collect25 student-loan debt.28Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005that Congress, in essence, put Socialon par, equal footing, with all otherme just say, imposing a 10-year limit￼1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The point that Justice2 Stevens made --3 MS. BLATT: Yes.4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- before.5 MS. BLATT: Ninety percent of all student-loan6 debtors who default do so before age 55. And, therefore,7 a 10-year time limit will have expired before the debtor8 reaches full retirement age, at age 65. And it's relevant9 not so much what Congress what was thinking in '91, but10 it's relevant for what Congress was thinking in 1996. In11 1996, Congress made Social Security benefits subject to12 offset. And it's completely rational to think that13 Congress of course understood there would be a general 10-14 year limit that's always been applied to offsets of all15 Federal payments, including the Federal contract payments16 or pension payments, and now Social Security payments,17 but, yes, there's another provision of the U.S. code that18 contains an express and, we think, extraordinary19 exception. It says time limits are intolerable when it20 comes to the collection of student-loan debt.21 Now, at the same time, Social Security22 recipients are protected from any undue burden. The -- if23 you are disabled under the Department's regulations, you24 can obtain a complete discharge, a total walk-away-from-25 the-debt-forever, if you have a disability that prevents29Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 you from earning income. You also -- the amount of the2 Social Security offset is limited to the lesser of 153 percent of the benefit payment or the amount by which the4 benefit payment exceeds $750. And any debtor can enter5 into a repayment agreement that will take their total --6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Those are -- those are7 regulatory provisions, right?8 MS. BLATT: The caps, Mr. Chief Justice, are in9 the statute, and further limited by the regulations. But,10 actually, the repayment agreements are mandated provisions11 under the Higher Education Act. It mandates the Secretary12 of Education to allow debtors to enter in repayment13 agreements that are contingent on their income, and that14 will allow them to repay their debt under reasonable and15 affordable terms. That's also in the statute.16 JUSTICE BREYER: So, is the statute -- I saw17 something here, that a person who's going to get this18 offset, and he has Social Security, you exempt $9,000 of19 the Social Security, and then you limit it to 15 percent20 of the remainder or whatever is reasonable, whichever is21 less.22 MS. BLATT: It's the lesser of -- it's the23 lesser of the 15 percent or the amount by which the24 benefit payment exceeds 750. So, in this case, when the25 original Social Security check was, I think, like, $874,30Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 15 percent would have been a higher number. You have to2 leave the recipient with 750, so I think only $94 was3 taken out. And I may have my math a little off. But you4 -- the -- 56 Mr. Chief7 -- it's a8 lottery the next day, if you can show that you can't work9 because of a disability, the Secretary of Education willyou give the recipient the benefit.Now, the only thing that's in the regulations,Justice, are the disability, that that is just awalkaway on the loan.  Even if you win the10 discharge your loan.11 Now, the principal argument on the other side is12 section 207 of the Social Security Act. Now, that statute13 requires an explicit reference before Social Security14 benefits can be subject to a legal process. But it15 doesn't require an explicit reference when the only16 question is the statute of limitations that are applicable17 to a legal process that is already otherwise expressly18 authorized. The Debt Collection Act is the actual statute19 that authorizes the offset of Social Security benefits.20 The Higher Education Act just lifts limitations periods21 when there's another statute that establishes a collection22 mechanism. And the Debt Collection Act contains the23 express reference. It provides, in 3716, that, "We're24 making our clear statement, we want Social Security25 benefits to be subject to offset." And, like I said, it31Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 just -- it plugged the Social Security system into this2 pre-existing --3 JUSTICE STEVENS: But it is -- it is true that4 the 1996 statute, which is the first time the express5 reference appears, does contain the 10-year statute by the6 indirect reference, and does not expressly refer to the --7 cite the 1091(a).8 MS. BLATT: That's right. It makes the express9 reference to 207, and it has this general limitations10 period that applies to all offsets. But, Justice Stevens,11 just --12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it says -- and it says13 "offsets under this section."14 MS. BLATT: That's right. And that takes you15 down to the subsection (e), which imposes a 10-year limit.16 But just as today Congress certainly is free to say,17 "From now on, Social Security benefits and all offsets18 will be subject to an 11-year limitations period," it19 doesn't have to expressly reference 207 to amend the Debt20 Collection Act. The Debt Collection Act is what's being,21 in effect, amended or an exception. And the Debt22 Collection Act doesn't contain its own express-reference23 requirement before it can be amended. Congress didn't24 say, "We're forever binding ourselves," or, "We want some25 different canon of interpretation here." And so, you have32Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 a very extraordinary provision in the Higher Education Act2 that says, "Notwithstanding any other provision of law,3 there's not going to be a time limit to offset in order to4 collect student loan" --5 JUSTICE BREYER: But -- yeah, I think he's --6 one argument that they're emphasizing, anyway, is that --7 you look at the Debt Collection Act, and suppose it had8 said the following, "Section 207 is amended, or changed,9 as follows. We refer specially now -- we can collect,10 through offset, but only for 10 years. I mean, only to11 claims that are more than 10 years old. So, we are12 changing what 207 says for debts over 10 year -- under 1013 years old, and we can offset those." Now, suppose it had14 said that.15 MS. BLATT: It would still -- the express16 reference would be completely overtaken, because it says17 the "notwithstanding section 207." It would authorize18 offset for --19 JUSTICE BREYER: And you'd say it's the same.20 MS. BLATT: For up to 10 years.21 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. If that's the same,22 let's imagine this statute. The statute says, "We bestow23 upon the Social Security agency a very limited power."24 And it says, "This is the limited power. The Social25 Security Agency may, despite 207, levy offsets on under-33Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314151617181920212223242510-year-old debts."  That's what they say, right in theAct.          MS. BLATT:  Right.  It would -- the --          JUSTICE BREYER:  And then, indeed, the wholepoint of it -- it's entitled "Limited Offset Ability,"parenthesis -- "Limited Offset Ability (Extending Only toDebts of Less than Ten Years)," end parenthesis.  That'sthe title of the Act, and then it says just what I say,repeating that.          MS. BLATT:  Yes.  Well, our position is that theSocial Security Act only requires an express reference tocreate authorization to offset.that --JUSTICE BREYER:  But you're not going to treatMS. BLATT:  And --          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- one the same.  You see, whatthey're saying here is -- they want to say that what I'vejust said is what Congress wrote in this Act.  And --          MS. BLATT:  Right.          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- I'm making it harder andharder for you to accept that saying --          MS. BLATT:  Yes.  Well, our --          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- automatically.          MS. BLATT:  -- fundamental position --          -- I'll be clear on this -- is that34Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 the Higher Education Act applies unless it's been2 repealed. And there's just nothing in the Higher3 Education Act that comes close to repealing -- in, excuse4 me, the Debt Collection Act -- that comes close to5 repealing the Higher Education Act, because it doesn't6 address the subject of student loans. It just speaks to7 the ability to offset Social Security benefits, as well as8 all other Federal payments that have been subject to9 offset.10 JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Blatt, can I ask --11 there's no discussion -- legislative history in the briefs12 that I -- because I -- that I recall. Is it true that the13 people voting on the bill in 1996 had nothing but the14 amendment before them? Did they have a committee report15 on it explaining that it still applied to the -- that the16 -- that the "notwithstanding" clause in 1091(a) would17 still be in effect?18 MS. BLATT: No, I know of no statement to that19 effect. But I know of no statement -- any discussion20 about limitations period. There's no discussion of the21 10-year limit either.22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Because it seems to me that,23 conceivably, a legislator looking at the bill all by24 itself, not getting out the earlier provisions of the25 code, might well think, "Well, this includes a 10-year35Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 limit."2 MS. BLATT: Maybe they did, maybe they didn't.3 Maybe the knew that a court would actually apply the U.S.4 code, as written --5 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.6 MS. BLATT: -- and just because it -- the7 limitation period was in one section -- but, now, here's8 where I think the policy does come into play. A9 legislature would think that a 10-year limit would never10 come in to offset Social Security benefits on student11 loan, except in a rare case of an old debtor who -- and12 also defaults close in time to age 65. And, like I said,13 90 percent of all the student-loan defaults are by debtors14 who are under age 55, and over -- about 83 or 84 percent15 of all Social Security payments are under the retirement16 system, not the disability system. And if a person is17 disabled, there's no reason to think that they can't get a18 discharge of that loan.19 So, all we're talking about is basically20 rendering a dead letter Social Security offsets to collect21 student-loan debt, if Petitioner's position were to22 prevail.23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why can he get a discharge if24 he's disabled?25 MS. BLATT: You can get a discharge of your loan36Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 if you have a disability of indefinite duration that2 prevents you from working. The rationale is, sort of, a3 changed-circumstances rationale. If you took out a loan,4 you signed a promissory note, you intend to pay it back.5 But if you later become disabled, and that disability is6 going to prevent you from ever working, they'll discharge7 it. Now, about 30 percent of all people who do apply for8 this disability discharge do get it, and about 80 percent9 get a conditional discharge, what gives them -- it gives10 them a 3-year grace period. And the only difference11 between -- I mean, there are some small differences, but12 the main difference between a Social Security disability13 determination and an Education Department disability14 determination is the Department of Education wants you to15 be disabled of an indefinite duration, and not just 1216 months, because it's a complete and total walkaway from17 the loan. And Social Security will actually do a lookback18 after 12 months. But Education will never go back and ask19 for the money. Once they've discharged it, it's a20 permanent discharge.21 JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Blatt, it -- was this22 statute -- I'm just really kind of curious that something23 this important, we're first putting this burden on Social24 Security -- it's a fairly important change.

But I can saythe overall thrust -- and it's in their statement ofpurpose -- was to improve the Government's debt-collection--          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes.          MS. BLATT:  -- efforts.  And what it did was,for the first time -- and this was a very significantdevelopment -- establish a centralized offset.  Before1996, there was no ability to cross-check a debt from oneagency to a payment to --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Right.          MS. BLATT:  -- another agency, such that one38Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Department had no idea what another Department was doing. And now it is a massive program involving over $1trillion of Federal payables, $255 billion of certifieddebt, and 33 billion of that is education loan debt.  Andso, that  -- this was to -- an enormous undertaking tostart that, in 1996.  And one of the things that Congressdid in setting up this massive program was, made SocialSecurity benefits part of the offset program.  There'sabout $480 or $490 billion in Social Security benefits,so -- which  -- it was a huge source of revenue, althoughCongress obviously limited it substantially with the caveat.          And if there are no further questions, we wouldask that the Court of Appeals judgment be affirmed.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Ms. Blatt.          Mr. Wolfman, you have three and a half minutesremaining.            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN WOLFMAN                 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER          MR. WOLFMAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.          I want to address, first, a point that theGovernment makes, that -- and it's about Section 207 ofthe Social Security Act, the anti-attachment provision.Opposing counsel says that it doesn't really matter thatthe 10-year bar was not addressed in 1996, because allthat's necessary under the express-reference provision is39Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 to refer to the law, in general, that it doesn't apply to2 limitations periods. But that simply cannot be the case3 here, because, again, this statute that we are talking4 about, the Debt Collection Improvement Act, and the Debt5 Collection Act before, is a bar on the authority of the6 Government to collect after 10 years.7 And let me pick up on the language that Justice8 Kennedy pointed to from the Debt Collection Act. It says,9 in the very subsection in which Social Security first was10 put on the radar screen, was first dealt with,11 (c)(3)(a)(i) -- it says that you can now go after Social12 Security benefits, because they are subject to offset13 under this section, meaning 3716. Then, if you turn to14 another subsection of that section, it says -- and this is15 the 10-year bar -- this section, quote, "does not apply,"16 end quote, to a claim under this subchapter that has been17 outstanding for more than 10 years.18 Now, I don't see any reason to say that 207, the19 requirement of an express reference, is, sort of, a20 halfway requirement. In other words, "You only have to21 refer to Social Security benefits. We don't care what the22 extent of that authority is in the very section that you23 use that express reference." Here, the entire authority24 is circumscribed by the 10-year bar. That is our25 essential submission.40Alderson Reporting Company1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          I have one other point, which is that the --because there was a number of questions on it.  We thinkit doesn't go to the congressional intent here, but I dowant to clarify.  There is a substantial differencebetween being disabled and being eligible to get thedischarge.  Discharge requires permanent disability --forever, you cannot -- you are not capable of working.  InSocial Security law, you have to be incapable of workingfor a period of 12 months.          Thank you.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.          The case is submitted.          [Whereupon, at 11:49 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.]1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 40041Alderson Reporting Company 1-800-FOR-DEPOWashington, DC 20005
