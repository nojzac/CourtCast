New Mexico. Mr. Fisher.ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it Court:please theOfficial - Subject to Final ReviewThe text, purpose, and history of the Confrontation Clause make it clear that the prosecution cannot introduce one person's testimonial statements through the in-court testimony of someone else. Thus, having held in Melendez-Diaz that a lab analyst's statements in a forensic lab report are testimonial, this is an easy case.The State violated the Confrontation Clause by introducing lab analyst Curtis Caylor's statements in a forensic lab report without putting him on the stand. The New Mexico Supreme Court resisted this analysis, straightforward as it is, on the ground thatMr. Bullcoming, as the defendant, had the opportunity to cross-examine a substitute or a surrogate witness,Mr. Razatos.3￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 But a surrogate witness procedure violates2 all four components of the right to confrontation. It3 quite obviously violates the defendant's right to have4 the witness5 the jury so6 happened in7testify in his presence, in the presence of the jury can observe it, and under oath, as this case.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Fisher, when you say8 "in the presence," do you -- do you mean it necessarily9 must be in the courtroom, or would a video-conferencing10 set-up be permissible so that the technician or the11 analyst could testify from the lab, rather -- but it12 would be screened in -- in the courthouse?13 MR. FISHER: Well, the default rule under14 the Confrontation Clause is in presence, in the15 courtroom. Now, in Maryland v. Craig, this Court held16 in a child witness setting -- of course, very different17 than this case -- that closed-circuit TV would be18 permissible, and I believe, you know, in a future case,19 if the State perhaps made some sort of showing that the20 lab analyst couldn't come to court for some reason, and21 certainly if the defendant stipulated, and maybe even if22 the defendant didn't stipulate, a court could23 accommodate -­24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The defendant didn't give25 his consent, so we don't -- that's not a concern, but4￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425let's -- let's suppose defendant doesn't stipulate. Is this adequate to meet the Confrontation Clause?MR. FISHER: I don't think it would be adequate, Justice Ginsburg, with at least some -- absent at least some showing of unavailability of the witness or -- making the witness unable to come to court.Now -- now, there is an amicus brief in the case, I believe, that suggests some flexibility that trial judges might employ in -- in accommodating lab analysts' schedules.JUSTICE SCALIA: What about police witnesses? What about not requiring the officer who -­ who took the confession or who witnessed the alleged crime -- not requiring him to appear because he's busy?MR. FISHER: Well, that's never been -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Can't make it. He's out on the beat. So can we have him appear by television?MR. FISHER: That's never been the rule, Justice Scalia, and I don't think there would be a need to-­JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why is a lab technician different?MR. FISHER: I don't think -- I don't think one is, and you don't have to reach that in this case, because the State never attempted to make any showing5Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting Company12131415 the results 16No, they want to -­ -­Official - Subject to Final Review1 that Mr. Caylor was unavailable for any reason.

FISHER: Only if the State wants to11 present statements from them both.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:MR. FISHER: They bothCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:of the blood analysis -­MR. FISHER: I think -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the numbers the￼1718 machine spits out.19 MR. FISHER: I think in that scenario, if20 both people were there for the whole thing, the State21 could have either one of them testify. What the State22 couldn't do 232425-­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though one -­ MR. FISHER: -- and this is the rule -­ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though one6Alderson Reporting CompanyThey want to presentOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 didn't do it? Even though the question is going to be,2 did you put the aluminum on and crimp it, and the answer3 is going to be, no, Joe did it; he sits right next to4 me?5 MR. FISHER: That's right. The6 Confrontation Clause is a purely procedural right, Mr.7 Chief Justice.8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. That's9 right. Does -- do they both have to testify, then, or10 not?11 MR. FISHER: They do not have to. The12 Confrontation Clause is a purely procedural right. It13 all depends on what -- whose statements the State wants14 to introduce. So, if the State is satisfied to prove15 its case by having somebody testify, saying, I watched￼16 the thing go into the machine and17 come out and I saw that it wasn't18 was Mr. Bullcoming's sample, then19 And in fact, what some labs do -­20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I don't understand21 that. How is that any different than the supervisor of22 the lab saying,23 watch them on a24 work correctly?25 MR.I know what these people do, I -- I day-to-day basis, and they perform theirFISHER: Again, the question, Justice7Alderson Reporting CompanyI watched this result tampered with and it that would be fine.Official - Subject to Final Review1 Kennedy, is not who the State has to bring in. The2 question is whose statements the State wants to3 introduce. Here, the State wanted to introduce4 Mr. Caylor's statements, and so it therefore needs to -­5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What the State wanted to6 introduce is the result of the exam, and the Chief7 Justice gives you the hypothetical. Say, two people are8 necessary for the exam. You say only one has to be9 there if both saw it?10 MR. FISHER: If only -- if the State is only11 introducing one person -­12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it -- but it's hearsay13 as to what the first person did with -- with crimping -­14 MR. FISHER: I don't -­15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- crimping the thing.16 It's not direct testimony from that person. You didn't17 say, are you experienced in crimping? Did you use your18 right hand or your left hand? Is there a danger of19 spillage? And so on. All that is beyond the ability of￼20 the defense 2122 don't think23 eyewitness and saying: Here's what I watched.

It's simply being an8Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 Now, again, the only question is whose2 statements the State wants to introduce. By all means,3 Mr. Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy, if the State4 wanted to introduce statements from both of the lab5 analysts who worked together on the case, they would6 need to bring them both in, but if they only want to7 introduce one lab -­8 JUSTICE SCALIA: The State takes its9 chances, right? I mean, as to how much it has to bring10 in, in order to persuade the jury?11 MR. FISHER: That's right. That's the12 decision the State makes in every case, whether it be13 multiple police investigators, multiple eyewitnesses,14 or-­15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You always take your16 chances with a business record. That's a given, of17 course. Of course, the State takes a chance with the -­18 with the admission of any admissible hearsay testimony19 that the jury will be -- that you'll make the argument20 to the jury that you should discount it if the person21 isn't there. That's always true.22 MR. FISHER: I'm not sure I -- I disagree23 with anything you said, but the rule of the24 Confrontation Clause applies to a particular kind of25 statements, testimonial statements. And our rule today9￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 and the one that resolves this case is, if the State2 wants to introduce a witness's testimonial statements,3 it needs to 456 testimonial7 the hospital was the blood of the defendant. That's a8 testimonial statement?bring that witness to court.Now, footnote 1 in Melendez-Diaz -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, I take it it's a statement that this blood that was taken atMR. FISHER: Yes, I believe it would be,10 Justice Kennedy.11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And so I assume that in12 this case, the nurse and the police officer were both13 present.14 MR. FISHER: Yes, and, in fact -­15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I assume under your16 position, you could not have a record showing that17 the -- the nurse withdrew the sample at 10:08 p.m. on18 such-and-such a date and that she followed the regular19 procedure. That would be insufficient if the State20 wanted to introduce just a certificate or just -- just21 that record?22 MR. FISHER: I think that's what footnote 123 in Melendez-Diaz says. If the defendant wants to24 challenge the chain of custody, then the State needs to25 bring in the witnesses. Now, I think it's an109￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 interesting fact in this case, and it shows why that2 rule isn't so -­3 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that's not -- I don't4 think that's what Melendez-Diaz' footnote 1 says. It5 says that the State may be able to prove chain of6 custody by testimony other than the actual individuals7 who handled the sample, and then it has to take its8 chances as to whether the trier of fact is going to9 believe -- is going to believe that. Isn't that right?10 MR. FISHER: I think that's right. I think11 what footnote 1 says is the defendant -- when the State12 chooses whose testimony it wants to introduce, the13 defendant has the right to insist that that be done14 live.15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It does -- it does not -­16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does not Melendez-Diaz also17 say that if the defendant wants to challenge the -- the18 chain of custody, the State can adopt rules that19 requires the defendant to assert that challenge or his20 intention to make that challenge, or his intention to21 make that challenge, prior to the trial so that the￼22 State will23 testimony?2425 the noticeknow whether it has to introduce any liveMR. FISHER: Of course, that's correct under and demand regimes that Melendez-Diaz11Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 approved of. And the Public -- the PDS brief in this2 case showed that many States do use those regimes. Now,3 Justice Kennedy, I did want to -­4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the chain -- the chain5 of custody does involve a testimonial statement that6 this is the blood, that I took it out at 10:05 p.m. on7 Saturday evening. That's a testimonial statement. It's8 the defendant's blood.MR. FISHER: Yes, it can, Justice Kennedy, of custody is proved by live witnesses every every day in courtrooms across the country -­910 but chain11 day in --121314 Crawford. 1516 custody.17 this problem, or I am: Lab technician Jones looks at a18 vial, and it's blue. She says to Smith, "it's blue."JUSTICE BREYER: But it's not just -­MR. FISHER: -- long before Melendez-Diaz or￼IJUSTICE BREYER: It's not just chain of think the Chief Justice is trying to get at19 Smith turns 2021 make him go22 wonder is, is the defendant now entitled to the23 following instruction: Jury, because he's in court, he24 can say that the machine read B, but that proves nothing25 about the vial, nothing. All it proves is what someonea lever on a machine to B.Jason sees the B and goes into court -- you into court; that's our case. And what I12Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 said in the laboratory to another person, and those two2 people aren't in court.Now, that's -- you see, that's the problem, the intermediate step. I'd either like to wrong about that, you don't have to have34 I think, of5 be told I'm6 them, or explain whatever you'd like.7 MR. FISHER: If I understand your8 hypothetical correctly, I think that if the defendant9 wanted -- the defendant can certainly make that argument10 to a jury, and the defendant, if he wanted to insist -­11 if the prosecution wanted to tie the results -- let's12 bring it back to the facts of this case -- wanted to tie13 the .21 to Mr. Bullcoming by saying that was14 Mr. Bullcoming's sample, then they'd need to bring15 somebody into court if the defendant insisted upon it.16 But the one thing I want to add is that the17 Public Defender Service brief makes clear, and the facts18 of this case make clear, it's going to be very rare that19 a defendant wants to do that. The defendant in this20 case wanted to stipulate to the nurse's blood draw and21 that it was his blood that was drawn in the hospital.22 It was the State that insisted on putting her on the23 stand. It happens in courtrooms all across the country.24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but if you want to25 tell us, don't worry, it won't happen, I think that's an13￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 unacceptable argument. You're saying the defense has2 certain rights, and we have to presume there is a3 defense attorney who's going to afford his client every4 right the Constitution has. So the fact that we're not5 supposed to worry because it won't happen very often is6 (a) it seems to me, an unlikely hypothetical; and (b) it7 seems to me, irrelevant to your argument.8 MR. FISHER: Well, Justice Kennedy, I will9 gladly accept (b) if we want to say that consequences10 are irrelevant, because I think that's what -- the Sixth11 Amendment is what it is, but I think the only thing I12 would add is that all I can say is, empirically, in the13 States that have followed the rule we advocate today,￼14 long before Crawford or Melendez-Diaz, it simply is a15 manageable burden. I'm not saying it's no burden. But16 it is a thoroughly manageable -­17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Fisher, I thought -- I18 thought the Court put this worry behind us in Crawford.19 Wasn't the same worry raised in Crawford?20 MR. FISHER: Well, I think it21 even more pointedly in Melendez-Diaz when22 lab analysts. I think in both places the23 set that aside.24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Said, yes, it may be25 something of a risk, but the States have managed it in14Alderson Reporting Companywas raised it comes to Court, yes,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the past, and there's no reason to think they can't manage it in the future.MR. FISHER: I think that's what Melendez-Diaz -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, there are different types of hearsay involved here or different types of statements. There's the report itself, which was Exhibit 1 that was introduced, and it has certain certifications by the analyst, that he followed certain procedures, et cetera. I'm assuming that you're claiming that those -- those are the Confrontation Clause violations, that exhibit itself, because it is attesting or certifying to something.MR. FISHER: Yes.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The witness is not attrial here.MR. FISHER: Yes, Mr. Caylor's certifications in this -- in the lab report, not only that the blood -- that the blood had a .21 blood alcohol content, but also that -­want -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's where IMR.

FISHER: That's the totality of the -­8 JUSTICE9 JUSTICE10 who -­11 JUSTICE12 finish my question.13 JUSTICE14 JUSTICE15 raw data, the graphs that were made, were reviewed by a16 separate witness, and he reviewed the data and says,17 this data shows that the blood level concentration was18 .21, or two-point whatever it was. Would that violate19 the Confrontation Clause, using the raw data itself?20 MR. FISHER: I want to be clear that raw -­21 by "raw data," you mean the printout from a machine?22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The printout from the23 machine.24 MR.

FISHER: So what he did is just read the JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume he justOfficial - Subject to Final Reviewtook the raw data at trial. I know we now have a chain of custody, and someone will have to prove that this is the data related -­MR. FISHER: Right.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to Mr. Bullcoming. But if that expert then read that data and testified that this was of a certain amount or percentage of alcohol, would that violate the Confrontation Clause?MR. FISHER: Probably not. Provided, as you say, the chain of custody had been either properly proved or stipulated to, I think an expert could take the stand and say, I'm looking at a graph, and here's what the graph shows me. Now, you might get into -­JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's what -- that's the New Mexico Supreme Court suggested, didn't they?17￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 They said bring the printout from the gas -- whatever -­2 chromatograph, and then have an expert who was not the3 one who certified -- it was not Caylor -- but that4 here's the graph that came out of the machine, and this5 is the way this process operates.6 I -- in your answer to Justice Sotomayor,7 did you mean to agree with the New Mexico Supreme Court8 when they said printout plus an analyst who didn't do9 this particular run but knows how the process works?10 MR. FISHER: No, Justice Ginsburg. I'm11 certainly not here today to agree with the New Mexico12 Supreme Court. What they said doesn't -- doesn't make13 any sense in this case because (a) the printout was14 never introduced into evidence or looked at, and (b) it15 would matter a great deal -- and this is how I continue16 my answer. It mattered a great deal what was on the17 printout. If the printout is nothing more than a graph,18 then I don't think you can say that's a testimonial19 statement. If a printout comes out of a machine that20 also says at the top blood sample was Donald21 Bullcoming's, here's the test that was run, et cetera,22 those may well be testimonial statements that the23 analyst triggered the machine to spit out.24 So the Fourth Circuit has wrestled with this25 issue in the Washington case, and you can -- you can18￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425look at the majority and the dissenting opinions in that case. I think that the question would arise in that scenario, if the graphs were -- if the machine printouts were introduced into evidence, the question would be, are the machine printouts testimonial? And to the extent they are, you'd have the same problem in this case. To the extent they are not -- as the Fourth Circuit suggested, at least to some degree they may not be -- then you don't have a -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What part -­MR. FISHER: -- Confrontation Clauseproblem.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What part do you see as testimonial or not? What can an outside expert look at?MR. FISHER: I think an expert can look at anything. The only question is what's introduced into evidence. There's no -- there's no Confrontation Clause -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I -- that -­MR. FISHER: -- barring an expert from reviewing whatever he wants.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There's two different issues: one, what can be introduced into evidence, which is the reports themselves; and what can he or she testify to is a different question. That's a form of19Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 evidence. And so that's the line I'm trying to get you2 to describe for me, which is, when does that testimony3 become a violation of the Confrontation Clause?4 MR. FISHER: In one of two scenarios,5 Justice Sotomayor, the first which is the scenario we6 have in this case, when the report is introduced and7 it's testimonial. The second -­8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume the9 hypothetical I proffered.10 MR. FISHER: The second is that it's not11 introduced. Then you have a Confrontation Clause12 violation if the expert -- and this is the words many13 lower courts have used -- is a mere conduit for14 introducing the out-of-court testimonial statement.15 So-­16 JUSTICE ALITO: Could we break this down in17 -- in this way? I see three things that the -- three18 statements that the -- the State was attempting to -- to19 prove. The first was that the sample that was tested20 was the sample that was taken from the defendant.21 Second was that the standard procedures were followed in22 this case, and the third was that the result was .21.23 Would you agree with that? Those are the three things?24 MR. FISHER: I think there's one other25 thing, Justice Alito, which is that the sample had not20￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425been tampered with -­JUSTICE ALITO: All right.MR. FISHER: -- or contaminated.JUSTICE ALITO: That the sample had not been tampered with. Now, as to the first three, in other words, everything other than the results, could the State prove those things without having -- simply by introducing testimony regarding the way things were generally done in the lab, and ask the jury to infer that the general procedures were followed in this particular case?MR. FISHER: I think that would be a question of State law, Justice Alito.JUSTICE ALITO: It wouldn't be a Confrontation -­MR. FISHER: It wouldn't be a Confrontation Clause question.JUSTICE ALITO: All right. Now, in this case, as I read the record, it seems to me that's what the prosecutor was attempting to do. This is on page 50 of the Joint Appendix. The analyst is beginning to testify, the second answer on page 50: So what we do is we will get the sample in the mail, et cetera.The analyst is beginning to testify about standard lab procedures, and then defense attorney says,21Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 "Your Honor, I'm going to object to what's done in the2 status quo." I take that to mean what is generally3 done. "I don't object to what was done in this case."4 So the defense attorney is preventing -- is5 objecting to the prosecution's attempting to discharge6 its responsibility with respect to those first three7 propositions through testimony about standard8 procedures, and is insisting that the analyst provide9 the testimony that you say was a violation of the10 Confrontation Clause; namely, testifying as to what was11 done in this particular case.12 MR. FISHER: Justice Alito, I think if you13 look earlier in the Joint Appendix, I believe it's at14 page 40, where the State for the first time says we're15 going to put Mr. Razatos on the stand instead of Mr.16 Caylor, there's a -- there's an objection there as well17 that says you can't then put the document into evidence18 that Mr. Caylor wrote if he's not going to be on the19 stand. That's the critical objection here.20 Now, you're right, there's nothing wrong21 with Mr. Razatos having taken the stand in this case,22 there's nothing wrong with him having described typical23 procedures in the lab. I think the objection you're24 pointing was to the one that said -- again, as far as25 the State law objection, saying he can't testify to22￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 something he doesn't have personal knowledge about,2 which is whether the procedures were followed in this3 case. But Mr. -- Mr. Razatos could certainly take the4 stand and testify to -- to general procedures. But at5 page 54 and 55 of the Joint Appendix, he -- he simply6 reads the report's results.7 And so you have two Confrontation Clause8 violations, really. You have the report being9 introduced in the first instance, and then you have -- I10 believe it's at 54 and 55 of the Joint Appendix. You11 have the prosecutor asking Mr. Razatos, what was the12 result? He says the result was .21. As the State13 itself says at page 58, note 15 of its brief, there was14 no independent analysis being applied there. All Mr.￼15 Razatos was16 conclusions1718 had expelled a piece of paper that said .21, that piece19 of paper would not be a -- introduction of that piece of20 paper, the contents of the piece of paper, would not be21 a violation of the Confrontation Clause?doing was repeating and giving the jury the that Mr. Caylor had reached.JUSTICE ALITO: But if the -- if the machine22 MR. FISHER: If it said nothing more than23 the .21 coming out of the machine, I think probably not.24 Now, judge Michael in the First Circuit would disagree;25 and so that's an issue that's not in this case, and I23Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 think you could debate whether that should -- even that2 should be considered hearsay of the operator.3 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, how can -- how can you4 debate it? The purpose of the Confrontation Clause is5 to allow cross-examination. How are you going to6 cross-examine the machine?7 MR. FISHER: Well -- well, the question that8 would arise there would be whether the .21 should be9 treated as Mr. Caylor's statement. Let me -- if I give10 you two hypotheticals, maybe it explains. On the one11 hand, I don't think anyone would claim that a time stamp12 on a fax machine, for example, is a human statement.13 It's a machine statement, and so therefore it can't be14 testimonial. On the other hand, if someone types out an15 affidavit on a word processor and hits print, you can't16 say, well, that's the machine talking, not the human.17 So the question arises in the lab context18 whether a .21 or anything else that comes out of the19 machine has enough human influence that it ought to be20 treated as the -- as the person's statement.21 Now, you don't have to resolve that in this22 case, and what's important to emphasize is that that23 hypothetical of the .21, even though the State would24 like it to be this case, is really miles away for the25 reason you said, because the State proved a lot more24￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 than .21 by Mr. Caylor's lab report, and that's why2 these hypotheticals I think are important.3 JUSTICE ALITO: But all of those other4 things could potentially be proven by indirect evidence,5 by establishing standard procedures and asking the jury6 to infer that the standard procedures were followed in7 this case. They might -- they might believe that; they8 might not -­9 MR. FISHER: The State could -­10 JUSTICE ALITO: They might make the11 inference; they might not.12 MR. FISHER: The State could make that13 choice, but it would be a considerably weaker case,14 Justice Alito, not just because they wouldn't have15 anyone saying that the procedures were actually followed16 in this case, but also in this case it would be a far17 weaker case because they'd have somebody on the stand18 who would now be subject to cross-examination as to why19 he had been recently put on unpaid leave.20 JUSTICE ALITO: But as to this case, didn't21 the defendant actually testify that he was drunk at the22 time of -- at the time when the blood was extracted? He23 took the stand and he testified that after the accident24 he went off into the woods and he came upon people who25 were drinking vodka and he drank, they drank -- what was25￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 it -- a gallon of vodka together, and then he went back2 to the scene and his blood was tested?3 MR. FISHER: That was -­4 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that correct?5 MR. FISHER: That was his defense, Justice6 Alito, and here's why the lab report is still important,7 though. Because you're right, he did admit he was8 drunk. But remember, he was not convicted simply of9 DUI; he was convicted in New Mexico law of aggravated10 DUI. And to have aggravated DUI you need to have up to11 a .16 blood alcohol count. So the report is the only12 the State could have proved over .16, even if Mr.13 Bullcoming admitted that he had been drinking that day.14 So that's why it's important in this case.15 That's why he wanted to challenge -- that's one reason16 why he wanted to challenge the report.17 Let me come back to the -- to the important18 point, I think, though, that what the State wants to be19 able to do -- I don't want to ascribe a bad motive, but20 what the State's rule would allow States to do is to21 insulate people from cross-examination, not just Mr.22 Caylor in this case, but -- but -- but please pay23 attention to, for example, the Dungo case that's cited24 in our opening brief, from California. That's a case25 where a coroner had been fired from his job, blacklisted26￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 by law enforcement, and prohibited from testifying in2 many counties because he falsified his reports, his3 autopsy reports, by writing them with the police report4 sitting right next to him.5 JUSTICE ALITO: But the State can't -­6 MR. FISHER: And -­7 JUSTICE ALITO: The State can't immunize8 those people from testifying. You could have subpoenaed9 Caylor, couldn't you? You could have asked for a10 continuance and -- and a subpoena, and brought him in to11 testify? It's just a question of who has to take the12 step, right?13 MR. FISHER: Well, we -- we could have, but14 Melendez-Diaz makes clear that doesn't satisfy the15 Confrontation Clause. And when you deal especially with16 a garden variety DUI case there is only so much time and17 resources at issue, and that's why the Confrontation18 Clause I think is especially important in a case like19 this, that the prosecution bring its witnesses into20 court.21 And if I could just finish the Dungo story,22 in the -- in the California Court of Appeal, when they23 reviewed that case, they said the prosecutor's intent in24 that case had been to shield Mr. -- I'm sorry, the -­25 the actual analyst in that case from cross-examination.27￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 And, in fact, the supervisor when he took the stand at2 the preliminary hearing told -- told the court the3 reason why they have me here is the prosecutors find it4 too hard to have this person in court. So that would be5 perfectly permissible, if -- if the State win this case6 today and surrogate testimony were allowed.7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you answer the8 practical situation that Caylor, who did this particular9 run, does some dozens day in and day out, and he will10 have no memory, in fact, of this particular test. So11 having him there -- he knows how the process operates;12 he doesn't remember this particular one -- how does13 having him there -- what could be elicited on￼14 cross-examination of him that couldn't be from his15 supervisor?16 MR. FISHER: Let me give you two answers,17 Justice Ginsburg, but first let me say we don't know18 whether somebody doesn't remember it until he's put on19 the stand. What the NACDL brief says is that even20 though analysts don't ordinary remember run-of-the-mill21 tests like this, that do remember if something went22 wrong or if something went haywire. So we don't know23 that.24 2528But assuming you're right that -­ JUSTICE SCALIA: Wasn't it the case thatAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 these tests are unusual in this particular jurisdiction?2 MR. FISHER: That's my understanding,3 Justice Scalia. So that's another reason why he may4 have remembered.5 But even if he didn't, there's two things6 that could be importantly probed here. One is his7 credibility. And I've explained why that was a very8 serious issue in this case, because he was put on unpaid9 leave.10 The other is his competence. Again,11 Melendez-Diaz says it's important to have the person on12 the stand to explain how he does his job, for the jury13 to observe his professionalism, for him to explain14 here's my understanding of these procedures, et cetera.15 That could be very important, and if I could leave you16 with one thing before I -­17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I assume that even if18 he doesn't remember, his testimony is not worthless to19 the prosecution. He -- the prosecution can bring out20 his high qualifications, and he can testify: It -- this21 isalwaysthewayIdoit. Idoitthiswayallthe22 time. I don't remember this particular incident.￼2324 can't it? 25All of that can be persuasive to the jury, MR. FISHER: Of course, it can, Justice29Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 Scalia. And on the flip side, even if he doesn't2 remember, cross-examination is very important.3 If I could leave you with one thing that I4 think isn't highlighted in the brief maybe the way it5 should have been. There's a line of cases from this6 Court, California v. Green, Delaware v. Fensterer, and7 United States v. Owens, that all hold that if a witness8 takes the stand and doesn't remember anything, that the9 Confrontation Clause is still -- is still satisfied, as10 long as that witness is on the stand for the reason11 Justice Scalia explained and because the jury can12 observe them, et cetera.13 And so, the flip side of that has to be -­14 it's the holding of Owens most recently is that those15 are meaningful things that the Confrontation Clause16 requires. And so the flip side of those cases has to be17 that if the witness takes the stand and doesn't18 remember, the ineffectiveness potentially of a19 cross-examination there doesn't matter, either.￼2021 left.2223 Mr. Fisher. 2425If I could reserve what little time I haveCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,General King.ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY K. KING30Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT2 MR. KING: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it3 please the Court:4 As the Court said in Michigan v. Bryant, a5 police interrogation resembles an ex parte examination6 when the primary purpose of the examination is to7 create, quote, an out-of-court substitute for trial8 testimony, end quote.9 A public record not prepared by a police10 officer is not the product of structured interrogation.11 It is neither ex parte nor is it an examination.12 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that.13 You mean so long as all -- all hearsay by non-police14 officers can be admitted without, without confrontation,15 just because they're not police officers?￼MR. KING: No, Your Honor, I don't believe the -­JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't think that was because it's certainly not true, is it? MR. KING: It is not my point, Your Honor. Your Honor, the point that I am making is1617 that that's 1819 your point, 202122 that in this case, the document, the report that we're23 talking about is a public record, and that24 differentiates it from the affidavit in Melendez-Diaz,25 and so the case that -­31Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry, could you2 tell me what that means? Why is it different than the3 affidavit? It's certified, and my understanding of the4 dictionary meaning of certification is that that's an5 attestation as to the truth of the statements contained6 therein. That's the common definition.7 So I'm assuming it's the equivalent of an8 affidavit. So how is it different than the9 Melendez-Diaz lab report?MR. KING: Your Honor, and I understand, and your question with regard to yourthat the certification is the same as the It's not our position that they're exactly1011 I'll answer12 expectation13 affidavit.14 the same, but there are several -­15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Tell me why not.16 MR. KING: There are other distinguishing -­17 distinguishing features that are significant between the18 affidavit in Melendez-Diaz and the report in this case.19 For one, the affidavit in Melendez-Diaz was prepared20 pursuant to an statute in Massachusetts that called for21 the preparation of an affidavit from the lab at some22 point in time after the actual test was done, and it was23 to be used specifically as an in-court statement to24 replace the live in-court testimony of the affiant.25 In our case, the report being a public￼32Alderson Reporting Company4 the machine5 provided by6 7and recorded on a standard document that's the -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can any -­JUSTICE SCALIA: And that was prepared justOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 record was a record that is kept contemporaneously by2 the analyst in the lab, it is, in this case, the .21 is3 a single data point that is taken from the raw data in8 for fun, not for use in trial?9 MR. KING: No, Your Honor. I believe10 that -- that that statement is planned to be used in11 trial, and -­12 JUSTICE SCALIA: So what difference does it13 make whether the statute requires it to be taken to be14 used at trial or whether the police send it over to be15 used at trial as a use of the State? What difference16 does that make?￼MR. KING: Your Honor, I think the key is to purpose of the analyst who was preparing the is a public employee, who is just carrying court said, copying the information from the1718 look at the19 report, who20 out, as our21 machine onto the report. And so, that's significantly22 different than the amount of analysis that was done23 by -- by the -- the witness in -­24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. He's not25 simply looking at a number and putting it on a report.33Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 He's certifying to certain things. He's certifying to2 following certain steps, that the evidence wasn't3 tampered with. He's certifying that he's complied with4 all the requirements of New Mexico law with respect to5 the report, so he's just not copying a number.6 MR. KING: That's correct, Your Honor.7 In -- in this case the certification doesn't necessarily8 make the report testimonial. There -- there are several9 other examples of -- of cases where -- where evidence is10 introduced at court that -- that have certifications.11 For instance, it may be necessary for a12 public records custodian to provide a copy of a birth13 certificate in -- in a trial, and in that case, the14 custodian always has a certification that says I15 certify -­16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't the difference17 between those two documents is that one was prepared18 primarily for the purposes -- this lab report, for19 prosecution purposes, and the birth certificate is not20 prepared for that? It's prepared to mark the birth of a21 person, then it's used for many other purposes besides22 trial; is that correct?23 MR. KING: That is correct with regard to24 the birth -- birth certificate, Your Honor.25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So tell me what makes34￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 this certificate not primarily for the purpose of use in2 the prosecution of an individual? Would they have3 tested this blood if -- if it wasn't to prosecute him?4 MR. KING: Your Honor, in -- in this case,5 no. This -- this case is all about a sample that was6 sent to the lab to be tested for this. But I think you7 made it clear in Michigan v. Bryant that -- that there8 might be a variety of purposes that should be analyzed9 in order to10 testimonial1112 lab analyst13 of the police officer who requested the analysis. The14 lab analyst does this for a living, and it's -- it's15 their public duty. The lab in this case is -- isdecide whether or not the statement isor not.In this case, the purpose of the -- of the is significantly different from the purpose￼16 operated by the State Department of Health, scientific17 lab division, and -- and they do a variety of different18 kinds of analysis.19 And so, the -- the analyst who does the test20 wouldn't necessarily have the same purpose in -- in21 creating their statement for that document. As a matter22 of fact, the analyst would most likely be driven by the23 desire as a scientist -­24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does he do any testing25 except for the police?35Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 MR. KING: Yes, Your Honor.2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Who else do they test3 for?4 MR. KING: This lab also tests for, in this5 particular case, the gas chromatograph analyses of blood6 alcohol, they test for the office of the medical7 examiner and -- and under New Mexico law, interestingly8 enough, the -- the defendant can also ask for a test.9 They would use the same form to ask for this test.10 So, the analysis might be being done for a11 defendant as well as for the State.12 JUSTICE ALITO: Are these lab analysts civil13 service employees? Are the lab analysts civil service14 employees?15 MR. KING: Yes, Your Honor, they are. They16 work for the New Mexico Department of Health.￼JUSTICE ALITO: Is there any way in whichor prosecutors or the police could causeget promotions if they weren't producing the reports that the police and the prosecution1718 your office19 them not to20 kind of lab21 might like?2223 As a matter24 between the25 and the police that even extends to the point of aMR. KING: No, Your Honor, they could not. of fact, there -- there is a separation operation of the Department of Health lab36Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425physical separation. Police officers are not allowed into the lab area where -- where they are -­JUSTICE SCALIA: This analyst was fired, as I recall. Was he fired, placed on administrative leave or something?MR. KING: No, Your Honor, the record indicates that -- that Mr. Caylor was not available for court because he was on leave without pay, which -­JUSTICE SCALIA: On leave without pay?MR. KING: Uh-huh.JUSTICE SCALIA: And do we know why it wasleave without pay?MR. KING: We don't know why, Your Honor.JUSTICE SCALIA: Does the defense know why it was leave without pay? Could the defense have found out in cross-examination that the reason he was leave without pay because he was -- had shown himself to be incompetent, and they were in the process of firing him? I don't know whether that's true, but wouldn't that be important to the defense?MR. KING: Your Honor, I -- I think that the defense would like to know the answer to that question.JUSTICE SCALIA: And didn't -- and didn't the prosecution intentionally set it up this way so that this person would not have to testify, so that he could37Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 not be cross-examined? Isn't that why they sent the2 substitute to testify?3 MR. KING: No, Your Honor. In this case,4 that's -- that's not the case. I -- the -- this case5 came about in a little bit of an unusual circumstance,6 because both sides had been negotiating a plea agreement7 and when the -- when the plea agreement was not8 successful, the defendant asked for the trial to be9 expedited and moved quickly to trial. So the defendant10 didn't do as much discovery, I think, as you would11 normally do in a case like that, but -­12 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what the facts13 are, but boy, it smells bad to me. It really does. And14 even if that was not the case, the mere possibility that15 it could have been the case shows why you should have to16 bring this person in if you want to introduce his17 testimony.18 MR. KING: Your Honor, I think that the key19 here is that if you would not look at the -- at any of20 the qualities of the declarant in deciding whether the21 statement is testimonial or not. And so once -- once22 the Court makes the determination as to whether it is23 testimonial or not, you wouldn't -- even if you would24 like to ask those questions, you wouldn't have the25 opportunity to ask those questions.38￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 In this case, factually, it might also be2 that Mr. Caylor was on unpaid leave because he had run3 out of his regular leave time, and he decided to do4 that. We -- it would all be speculation -­5 JUSTICE SCALIA: I agree that whether it's6 testimonial does not depend upon whether there's7 skullduggery or not, but the possibility of8 skullduggery, even in machine -- machine situations such9 as this, is a good reason for saying this is10 testimonial.11 MR. KING: Your Honor, I think that's why12 it's -- it's important that this is a public records13 case, because that is one of the assumptions that courts14 have made for hundreds of years with regard to the fact15 that there is -- there is a duty by the person who's16 taking down the information to -- to observe in a17 regular manner, to record in a regular manner, and so18 that's important here.19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That was the principal20 thrust of your brief, that this isn't testimonial at21 all. You have not said because it was unsworn, because22 you recognize the certification is the same, but you're23 trying to equate it to a business record, public record?24 MR. KING: Yes, Your Honor.25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You do have the hurdle39￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 that this record was created for a specific purpose. It2 was created to provide evidence for use in a criminal3 prosecution.4 MR. KING: Your Honor, I don't believe that5 that is the only purpose that this form 705 could be6 used for. It is the common purpose for this form, but7 it is a form that the lab uses in every circumstance.8 And indeed, as I said, in New Mexico law, the defendant9 can ask for a second test. They can have that done.10 It's done at the State's expense. They can have it done11 at any laboratory that they want to.12 But if they have the report done at the13 State lab, and they're entitled to have that done, they14 would utilize the same form.15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, does the -­16 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, what are the other -­17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does the analyst18 know whether he's being asked to do one for the19 prosecution or the defendant?MR. KING: Not necessarily, Your Honor. I21 -- I actually don't know the answer to that specifically22 except that the form -- and if you look at it, it's in23 the Joint Appendix -- does have some information in part24 A that -- that indicates that there is a police officer25 that -- that sent the test to the lab. There's a nurse40￼20Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that did that in this case.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, so they wouldknow the difference, right? MR. KING: They information would be on the submitted it or whether the-- I think that the same form whether the defendant -- or whether theOfficial - Subject to Final Reviewprosecution submitted it, and -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, not the sameinformation. One would say the police submitted it and the other one would say the defendant submitted it, right?MR. KING: Your Honor -­JUSTICE SCALIA: So if the police submitted it, the -- the person doing the -- the test would know that the police submitted it, I assume.MR. KING: If you look at the form, Your Honor, it would have the same information, but we'renot -- we're not here today arguing that the analyst wouldn't know that the police submitted this form. But it is an arm's length request, and once again, the Court addressed that in your most recent case, in Michigan v. Bryant, I believe because the -- the question is whether or not there was an interrogation. One of the key questions is whether there was an interrogation.This clearly does not look like a case where41￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 there was an interrogation by the police. It was a2 request on a standard form that was -- that was sent.3 And so the purpose test, it appears from Michigan v.4 Bryant, would not even apply in cases where there's not5 a police interrogation.6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is a key question7 whether this was an interrogation? Does the8 Confrontation Clause apply only to confrontations? To9 interrogations? I mean, if a -- if a witness, before10 the police ask any questions, blurts out, you know,11 "Jones did it," can that statement get in because it has12 not been in response to an interrogation?13 MR. KING: Your Honor, the analysis would be14 somewhat different. That's the point, is that -­15 JUSTICE SCALIA: It would be different16 because interrogation doesn't make any difference. That17 is not the condition for the application of the -- of18 the Confrontation Clause.19 MR. KING: Your Honor, we -- it appears that20 it does make some difference with regard to Michigan v.21 Bryant, and it's new to all of us.22 JUSTICE SCALIA: If it were an23 interrogation, the factors mentioned in Michigan v.24 Bryant would be relevant, presumably, but since this25 wasn't an interrogation, I don't see how that has any -­42￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 any relevance whatever.2 MR. KING: Well, the relevance, Your Honor,3 I think, is since it's not an interrogation, then -­4 then you have to look at, and I think the Court has set5 this out, you have to look at the nature of the evidence6 and to make a determination as to whether the evidence7 that's being presented is merely a substitute for live,8 in-court testimony.9 And there, back to the difference between10 the affidavit in Melendez-Diaz and the report in this11 case is, in our report, even if Mr. Caylor had been at12 the trial and on the stand, it would have been necessary13 to have the report as well. I think Justice Ginsburg14 raised this point, is that six months after the15 examination was done, to cross-examine the analyst and16 ask him, do you remember what the result was six months17 ago from this one test out of a hundred that he ran, he18 will not remember without looking at the report. The19 report is the best evidence in this case to prove the20 point that is being made here, and -­21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he'd look at the22 report and say, gee, I don't remember; you know, I do a23 lot of these reports. But then the prosecution in24 direct would say, well, how do you do them? And he25 would say, I always do this, I always do that, I always43￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 do the other thing. Did you do it in this case? Well,2 I don't specifically remember this case, but I always do3 it. And that's the testimony that would go to the jury.4 It would be pretty persuasive. Not as good as if he did5 remember.6 MR. KING: That's correct, Your Honor, and7 so that's why the analysis of whether this is8 testimonial or not is such an important analysis,9 because if the -- the reasoning that the Court has had10 for all of the hearsay exceptions, for excited11 utterances or, in this case, for a public record, would12 look at whether or not that evidence was the best13 evidence to support the truth-finding purpose of the14 trial. That's our -- that's our analysis, at least,15 Your Honor.16 And what we are arguing in this case is that17 there is no difference between Mr. Caylor transferring18 the .21 data from the machine to the piece of paper than19 there would be if you took a photograph, for instance,20 of the machine data and -­21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why did you give the22 data to the analyst at trial? If there wasn't a more23 persuasive power in the lab certification, why didn't24 you just have the new expert look at the printout from25 the graph and say, this is what it says?44￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 MR. KING: Procedurally, in this case, Your2 Honor, this -- the trial at the District Court level3 occurred before the Court's opinion in Melendez-Diaz.4 And so I think that at this point in time, that it would5 be more normal behavior for the -- for the State to6 present the raw data as well.7 In this case, Mr. Razatos -­8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's that as well.9 Don't you introduce the lab report because it -- it10 gives more credence to the reliability of the result?11 Because he's certifying that he followed certain12 procedures, that he did certain things, that the sample13 wasn't tampered with?14 MR. KING: Yes, Your Honor.15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is it -- you're looking16 for that testimony, correct? You're looking, at trial,17 to that testimony to bolster the test?18 MR. KING: Not using testimony in the sense19 that we're talking about testimony here. I mean, you20 might want that -- very well want that evidence in, not21 different from other cases where if you had a -- it was22 necessary to submit the judgment of a felony, for23 instance, to show that a person in a later trial was a24 felon with -- a felon in possession of a firearm, you25 would have a certification from the court clerk that45￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 would say, I certify that the copy of this document that2 I'm submitting to the court is a true copy of -- that's3 also not testimonial from -- for the purposes of the4 Confrontation Clause I don't believe.5 JUSTICE BREYER: You might want that in6 order to show the machine says X, Y, Z, but that's only7 as good as the stuff that was put into it. So you're8 going to have to show that this was his blood put into9 it. And many, many people might have handled it, and10 there might be a routine so that they all check a box11 when it's sealed and they get it.12 Is it your understanding if you lose these13 cases -- this case that you then have to take into court14 all those people?15 MR. KING: That's certainly a concern, Your16 Honor. I -- if you look at this document, there are six17 or seven people who have certifications on the -- on the18 dire -- different statements on the document. There are19 three certifications; there's one from the -- from the20 woman who takes the samples into the lab that says she21 received the samples; there's this one from Mr. Caylor;22 there's one from -- from the reviewing analyst who23 reviews it; and I gather that the -- that the Petitioner24 is only challenging the -- that one certification25 from -- from -- from Mr. Caylor.46￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 JUSTICE SCALIA: The chain of custody wasn't2 -- wasn't contested here, was it?3 MR. KING: It was not. And this document -­4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it often contested? My5 impression is it's not very often contested.6 MR. KING: I'm not aware of it being7 contested often, Your Honor, I -- and this form I think8 is one of the things in New Mexico that really helps9 with that.10 is that you11 evidence on12 lot of those statements really help -­13 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but the reason I asked14 the question is because I don't think it is normally15 contested. It's normally a business record of some16 kind.1718 distinction, because in the future I don't see why it19 wouldn't be contested, unless there's a distinction.MR. KING: Yes, Your Honor, and I think that21 the distinction is that in this case the -- the analyst22 is not essentially a party to the action. The analyst23 works arm's-length transaction from -- from the -- from24 the police and from the prosecutors, and so he's not25 part of the prosecution team, is -- is how I've been47The reason that the court submitted the form have everything relating to the chain of-- on one document, and -- and so indeed a￼20However, what I was looking for is aAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 thinking about it.2 JUSTICE SCALIA: General, I know your State3 takes a different view of it or you wouldn't be here,4 but aren't there are a number of States that -- that do5 provide the testimony of the technician, who do require6 the technician to come in and -- and testify?7 MR. KING: Your Honor, I believe that there8 are other States that have statutes that -- that have9 different ways of presenting evidence.10 JUSTICE SCALIA: And have they had, to your11 knowledge, serious problems about defendants contesting12 chain of custody simply because this other thing is13 required? Again, I'm -- I'm not aware that that's been14 a problem. I think it's a boogeyman.15 MR. KING: Your Honor, we -- we understand16 that -- that the -- that the burden on the State is -­17 is not an issue that comes directly into the analysis18 relating to the Confrontation Clause. I -- in New19 Mexico, for instance, one of the problems that we have20 is that -- is that the lab's centrally located in21 Albuquerque and the -- and in this case the trial was in22 San Juan County, so -- so the witness has to drive for23 about 3 hours to get to where the courthouse is. So24 that's sort of different in New Mexico than, say, in25 Massachusetts or something like that. And -- and even48￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 for 10 minutes worth of testimony, they might have to2 drive 6 hours and take a whole day out of the lab.3 So it -- it is a problem that -- that is4 there, but I don't think that it is the seminal issue5 that -­6 JUSTICE BREYER: Are there States -- are7 there States that do require a -- a -- a prosecutor to8 produce everyone who has handled something in a chain of9 custody at a -- at a laboratory, a criminal -- you know,10 normal business? Are there States that do require that?11 If so, could you tell me a couple, because I -­12 MR. KING: Your Honor, I'm not aware of any13 State that requires that everyone in the chain of14 custody appear in -- in trial. It is indeed normally up15 to the prosecutor with regard to chain of custody to16 determine who --who is going to be appearing.17 JUSTICE BREYER: What about medical reports18 that are aimed at a particular known victim of a crime19 and thus will end up in trial? For example, a graph, a20 graph which the nurse keeps, which is a statement by the21 nurse that the patient's temperature on such and such a22 day was 98.6 or whatever, and normally that graph would23 be introduced; but are there any States that wouldn't24 require -- would say, oh, no, you have to produce the25 nurse? You have to produce the doctor for all medical49￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 records? Which of course, are known by the keeper that2 they will be used at the criminal trial.3 Are there any States that require that?4 MR. KING: There are none that I'm aware of,5 Your Honor. I -- I don't -- I haven't -­6 JUSTICE BREYER: Are there any States that7 require ordinary business records perhaps of the most8 ordinary kind, which always are statements that somebody9 did something on a particular day? When those business10 records happen to be kept before with the knowledge that11 they'll probably be introduced at the trial, are there12 States that require the man or woman who made the13 business record to come into court?14 MR. KING: No, Your Honor, and I think15 that's the point of all of those. State law has their16 -- their hearsay law that -- that analyzed whether those17 statements are admissible.18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I -- I don't think19 that's an accurate response, at least if you include the20 qualification that Justice Breyer put in the question,21 which is that the records were kept with the knowledge22 that they would be introduced in -- in criminal trials.23 I mean, you can say that all the records of24 labs -- let's assume there's a -- there's a police lab25 which -- which only does police testing of blood. Those50￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 would be business records of the lab, but they certainly2 would not be introducible just because they're business3 records. If the record is made for the use in4 prosecution, surely it's -- it doesn't come under the5 business records exception, or else we wouldn't be here6 today.7 MR. KING: Your Honor, I think the8 hypothetical that -- that you say really shows where the9 line is. If -- if the lab is a police lab and only10 doing the analysis for the police, then they -- they11 look a lot more like a party to the -- to the lawsuit,12 and certainly the hearsay exceptions have made it clear13 that even though observations are -- are generally -­14 that are public records are generally allowed, that15 observations by police officers are not.16 And -- and so -­17 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's an independent lab and18 police always send it to this independent lab, but in19 fact it's an independent business, it makes a profit;20 but all the stuff it does it knows is going to be used21 at trial. That wouldn't be admissible, would it? Even22 though it's a perfectly normal business record.23 MR. KING: Your Honor, I think that that24 depends on -- on how you look at the purpose and whose25 purpose it is that -- that you're analyzing. Now first51￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 off that, would assume that the purpose test applies in2 this case, and it seems to me since Michigan v. Bryant3 that the purpose test may not apply to these kinds of4 cases where -- where there's not a police interrogation.5 But if -- if that is the case and the6 purpose test applies, then it -- it also appears to me7 that the -- that the test now requires that -- that you8 look not just at the purpose of the policeman who -­9 who's asking the question, but that you look at the10 purpose of the declarant, and in this case the purpose11 of the labs clearly is -- is a purpose just to -- to get12 the sample, do a good analysis, and -- and report that13 analysis to, in New Mexico's case, both parties.14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -­15 MR. KING: The analysis that comes from our16 State lab goes not only to the prosecution but also to17 the defendant.18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General -­19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General, we seem to be20 describing -- this case seemed rather particular, that21 is, there was no objection by New Mexico to having an22 analyst show up, Razatos; so -- so he had to travel￼23 however long he said. It's24 employee's time rather than25 But -- and then52just a question of one the other.you described how simpleAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 this thing was, you just put it in a machine, you would2 get out a piece of paper. Why didn't New Mexico have3 this -- there was an additional sample that could have4 been -- it would have been si simple to just retest it.5 Having the witness come to the court, why don't you arm6 him with the additional test, and then there would be no7 controversy?8 MR. KING: Your Honor, one of the problems9 in New Mexico would be since -- since the court believed10 that -- that that report was -- was admissible, if they11 did a second sample and --- and tried to submit that it12 would be cumulative evidence, and probably would be kept13 out by -- by the rule in New Mexico in that case.14 So Mr. Razatos did have an important purpose15 at this trial. In New Mexico you still I believe have16 to have a witness who -- who can authenticate the￼17 document to18 had to have1920 Court holds21 presence of22 sample. Is23 that testimony is suddenly excused, and you do not need24 the analyst if there's another sample available for the25 defendant to test? That's not the rule, is it?bring the document in. It might not have been Mr. Razatos in this case.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let's say that this that the Confrontation Clause requires the the actual analyst to testify about the there anything in the law that says that53Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. KING: It's not the rule, Your Honor, although one of the things that we pointed out is that -- is that the State always keeps two samples, that the defendant has the right statutorily in New Mexico to -­ to have a sample retested at a lab -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I'm saying that analytically that does not bear on the question whether or not the sample that's introduced by the State requires the -- the analyst to be present. They're just unrelated.MR. KING: Correct, Your Honor.JUSTICE KENNEDY: That may -- that may show that the confrontation rule is a silly rule. But it doesn't -- but it -- there's -- assuming confrontation is required, it's not excused -­MR. KING: Yes.JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- by the presence of another sample.JUSTICE GINSBURG: I -- I don't follow that because we have a substitute now. Caylor is out of the picture; we know that it is the defendant's blood because everything else is the same, and there's this vial that has a certain amount of blood and there's a certain amount left over, so it's not cumulative, because Caylor's out of the picture. It is the54Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 defendant's blood that has been lab tested by another2 analyst.3 MR. KING: I'm sorry, Your Honor, in -- in4 your hypothetical, if -- if the State knew far enough5 ahead of time that they -- they would not be able to6 submit the -- the -- that analyst's results, they could7 always -- because the blood sample continues to exist,8 they could always retest that and -- and have another9 witness who could do that. Depending on how the Court10 rules in this case, it might be that States will be11 required to do that.12 But at this point in time under -- under the13 current jurisprudence, it -- it didn't appear to the14 State that they needed to retest the sample, and I think15 you have to worry a little bit about -- about how many16 people you might indeed have to have come into court and17 testify if -- if the State -- if the burden on the State18 is that you have to -- you have to sample twice just in19 case you're going to lose one of your analysts, I -- I20 think that that does indeed put a great burden on the21 State to do that. And so -­22 JUSTICE SCALIA: General, I -- I don't want23 to eat up your -- your little remaining time, I think24 you can answer yes or no. Does New Mexico assert the25 same rule as applicable to ballistics testing?55￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 MR. KING: No, Your Honor.2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why?3 MR. KING: I think that you have to do the4 analysis in each kind of statement that you're looking5 at, Your Honor, to determine whether or not the6 statement that's -- that's being made and that's being7 proposed for trial is a substitute for live in-court8 testimony. And so, with regard to ballistics, you know,9 you would be looking at a little bit different set of10 facts.11 But in this case the facts are that -- that12 the gas chromatograph gave us a printout that said that13 the -- that the level of alcohol in the blood is .2114 grams per 100 milliliters, Mr. Caylor transferred that15 to a form, and that's what we are putting in.16 I -- I think that -- that it proves the17 point that I'm talking about, in a ballistics analysis,18 you would have to have some analysis and someone to19 reach a conclusion. And it's that that sets20 Melendez-Diaz apart from this case, is -- is that there21 was -- that there was some analysis by -- by -- by22 the -- the declarant in that case. And in the23 ballistics cases I think, most often, you would find24 that.2556￼Now, if the -- if in the ballistics case youAlderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 just took a photograph of the bullet and wanted to bring2 that into the court and say here's what the bullet looks3 like, the jury then could make a determination whether4 they think that that bullet appears to be the same as5 the other. That wouldn't be covered by the6 Confrontation Clause.7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Certainly not.8 MR. KING: And -- and -­9 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you -- you -- you think10 the result would be a -- the same if we could develop a11 machine that you put the bullet in and -- and -- and -­12 that's been fired from this gun, and the murder bullet,13 and the machine goes, blah, blah, blah, and it spits14 out, you know, 99 percent, 99.9 percent match, that15 would be okay?16 MR. KING: May I answer the question, Your17 Honor?18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.19 MR. KING: In -- in that case, if -- if the20 machine were able to do all of that, the machine21 essentially is giving you the best evidence, yes, I22 believe that that would be the case.23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.24 Mr. Fisher, you have 2 minutes remaining.25 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER57￼Alderson Reporting Company1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. FISHER: Thank you. Let me try to makefour quick points.First, Justice Alito, I said the firstobjection was at JA 40, it's actually 44-45 in the Joint Appendix.With regard to the State's argument about whether this document is testimonial, I would simply urge the Court to take a very close look at the lab report itself. It's at JA 62. At the top it says, Mr. Chief Justice, in response to your question, arresting officer identification, and the officer writes, check for blood alcohol concentration. That's the order to the lab.If you look at the bottom in the certification of analyst, he certifies that thefollowing is true and correct, signs his name, and perhaps the most critical thing is at the very bottom, the actual rules of the New Mexico evidence law and criminal procedure law are referenced. So, it's exactly like Melendez-Diaz. This is a document that is expressly prepared for substitute live testimony.JUSTICE SCALIA: Not under oath, though, that's the only difference?MR. FISHER: Not under oath if a58Official - Subject to Final Review￼Alderson Reporting CompanyOfficial - Subject to Final Review1 certification is actually different than an oath, that2 just makes this worse, as in Crawford this Court said3 that it would be implausible that trial by affidavit4 would be prohibited but trial by unsworn affidavit would5 be okay.6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do the rules of7 criminal -- do the rules of criminal procedure in New8 Mexico say it should be prima facie evidence?9 MR. FISHER: They say much the same thing.10 There are -- there are several rules referenced at the11 bottom that all make this automatically admissible,12 notwithstanding the hearsay rule to prove the truth of13 the matter asserted.14 With respect to Justice Ginsburg's question15 about retesting, you are exactly right. The State had16 many choices in the case -- in this case about how to17 proceed. But if it wanted Mr. Razatos to be its18 witness, all it had to do was have him do a -- retest it19 and write a new report and have him be the witness.20 There is no reason it would have to introduce21 Mr. Caylor's report then and come up against any State22 law issue. Mr. Razatos could have been the live23 witness.24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it depends on25 when they do it, of course. I mean, you have the right59￼Alderson Reporting Company181920 brought the21222324 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 25Official - Subject to Final Review1 to look at their evidence presumably so -- so far in2 advance of trial, whatever, and if they had to get a3 new -- new technician, that would have to put off the4 trial -­5 MR. FISHER: And I think that -- I'm sorry.6 I think that goes to my last point, which is, Justice7 Breyer, you're talking about States that do this -- I'll8 combine my answer to these two things. A continuance9 would have been perfectly -- perfectly appropriate if10 that scenario had arisen, Mr. Chief Justice, and that's11 what -- one thing the public -- Public Defender Service12 brief it talks about 23 -- 26 jurisdictions encompassing13 23 different States that follow the rule that we're14 advocating today. And it -- we're not asking for more15 witnesses. It's important that we're -- this isn't a16 multiple witness problem, we're just asking for a17 different witness.￼CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. MR.
