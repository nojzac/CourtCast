Mr. Kneedler.ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. KNEEDLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:The Ninth Circuit held in this case that the United States Postal Service may be sued for treble damages under the Federal antitrust laws. The court of appeals fundamentally erred in this holding. Throughout the nation's history, postal operations have been carried out by the United States Government itself, pursuant to the express authorization in article I of the Constitution, for Congress to establish post offices and post roads.As this Court explained in the Council of Greenburgh case about 20 years ago, the furnishing of postal services has historically been regarded as a sovereign function, indeed a sovereign necessity, to promote intercourse among the states and bind the nation together. Such functions of the United States Government3, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 are not regulated by the antitrust laws.2 Indeed, more than 60 years ago, in the Cooper3 Corporation case, this Court held that the United States4 is not a person for purposes of the antitrust laws.5 Although the precise question before the Court in that6 case was whether the United States could sue as a7 plaintiff under section 7 of the Sherman Act, the Court8 noted that the same word, person, is used to describe who9 may be held liable as a defendant, either in a civil10 action or in a criminal prosecution.11 QUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, in your view, are there12 any instrumentalities of the United States that you think13 could be considered a person under the Sherman Act?14 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I - I think that there are15 no instrumentalities that are constituent parts of the16 United States Government itself that could - that could be17 held liable. The word instrumentality is used in a - in a18 somewhat vague sense, elastic sense, and I think it would19 be necessary to look at the particular statute to see how20 much of a governmental character a particular entity has.21 QUESTION: Of course, I guess the court whose22 judgment we're reviewing thought that the change in the23 structure of the Postal Service affected the nature of24 that instrumentality.25 MR. KNEEDLER: It - it - it did, but the - the4, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 court of appeals was wrong on that. First of all, after2 the - the court of - after the - this Court's Cooper3 decision, a number of lower court decisions have held,4 beginning with the D.C. Circuit's decision in the Sea-5 Land case involving the Alaska Railroad, that agencies of6 the United States or instrumentalities just like the7 United States itself is not a person subject to the8 antitrust laws. The Ninth Circuit didn't -9 QUESTION: Mr. Kneedler - Mr. Kneedler, but I10 don't think in that case there was - the question was11 raised whether the Alaska Railroad was an agent of the12 United States that would - would carry the immunity of the13 United States.14 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, the - the - it was - the15 Court regarded it as an - as an instrumentality, and in16 fact the - the Court there recognized that the railroad17 and the officials of the Government responsible for18 supervising the railroad could be sued under the APA, and19 that, therefore, there had been a waiver of sovereign20 immunity to that extent, and to the extent of allowing21 injunctive relief. So the - the Court certainly focused22 on the question that the Alaska Railroad and those23 responsible for managing it were part of the United States24 Government.25 QUESTION: I didn't think it was a contested5, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 issue in - in that case.2 MR. KNEEDLER: It may not have been contested,3 but it - but it - the Court certainly addressed that4 question and then went on to hold that as an5 instrumentality of the United States, the - the railroad6 was not subject to suit under the antitrust law.7 QUESTION: Is the Postal Service subject to the8 Administrative Procedure Act?9 MR. KNEEDLER: It is not. It - it - Congress10 specifically accepted it that there's - in section 410 of11 the act, there's a very detailed enumeration of the12 provisions that Congress did want and did not want to be -13 the Postal Service to be subject to. But the - the14 important point for present purposes is that in 1970, when15 Congress enacted the Postal Reorganization Act, it carried16 forward the essential governmental character of the Postal17 Service, just as it had been up until that point.18 In fact, section 101(a) of the act says that the19 United States - and I quote - the United States Postal20 Service shall be operated as a basic and fundamental21 service provided to the people by the Government of the22 United States. And then it says, the Postal Service shall23 have as its basic function the obligation to provide24 postal services to bind the nation together.25 QUESTION: So you say it carried forward the -6, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 the essential governmental character. What - what does2 that consist of? Doesn't it consist of the nature of the3 entity, not just - just the - the tag? It can't just put4 a tag on it and - and say it has an essentially5 governmental character. I thought that the - that the6 purpose of the reorganization was to make the Postal7 Service function like a regular business.8 MR. KNEEDLER: In - in a - in a limited sense.9 Congress -10 QUESTION: Well, I'll - I'll qualify it. A11 regular business, a regular public utility -12 MR. KNEEDLER: No, I - I -13 QUESTION: - which has - which has certain14 obligations, yes. They have to do universal - universal15 mail service, just as a telephone company has to give16 universal telephone service. But on the other hand, the17 rest of their operations were supposed to be business-18 like.19 MR. KNEEDLER: In the - in the description of -20 of how the Postal Service was to be operated carrying21 forward, the - the Congress repeatedly referred to the22 Postal Service as - as a governmental function, a public23 service to be operated in a business-like way. But what24 Congress meant by that was to insulate the Postal Service25 from the prior political interference that had come up by7, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 imposing the duty on Congress to repeatedly raise rates2 and - and 345address services.QUESTION: Insulated from the Government.MR. KNEEDLER: Not - but by -QUESTION: You're - you're saying on the one hand of the Government, but on the other hand, what6 it's part7 Congress wanted to do was to insulate it from the8 Government.9 MR. KNEEDLER: No. By - by no means insulate it10 from the Government. The Postal Service - the governors11 of the Postal Service are denominated officers of the12 United States, so the people responsible for the Postal13 Service are officers of the United States.14 QUESTION: Are they - are they removable by the15 President?16 MR. KNEEDLER: They're removable for cause.17 QUESTION: For cause. Just like the heads of18 independent agencies.19 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, but - but certainly the other20 independent agencies like the Federal Trade Commission and21 agencies like that are part of the United States22 Government performing a governmental function.23 QUESTION: Congress never said that they were24 supposed to operate like a business, which was the purpose25 of the Reorganization Act.8, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. KNEEDLER: Actually, in the - in the text of2 the act itself, there - there is - there is not an express3 directive that the Postal Service will be operated like a4 commercial entity. What Congress had in mind was to - was5 to rationalize the internal operations of the Postal6 Service, but it did not change any of the fundamental ways7 in which the Postal Service operated. It - it maintained8 the postal monopoly, which, under the private express9 statutes, about 80 percent of the revenues of the Postal10 Service are - are protected by the private express -11 QUESTION: It - it did - it did retain that12 monopoly and - and the Government's position here is that13 the Postal Service has the power to extend that monopoly14 into fields that the Government did not specifically15 confer upon it, right? Because the Government's position,16 as I understand it, is not only that the Postal Service17 can't be sued under the antitrust laws, but that the -18 that the Postal Service is not subject to the antitrust19 laws.20 MR. KNEEDLER: It is not a person within the21 meaning of the antitrust laws.22 QUESTION: So it can - it can go ahead and extend23 the monopoly conferred by statute beyond the - the narrow24 context granted by Congress.25 MR. KNEEDLER: That is not a - that is not a new9, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 feature of the - of the Postal Service. As we point out2 in our reply brief, quoting this Court's decision in the3 Emergency Fleet Corporation case, there the Court pointed4 out, with respect to the Post Office, it said the Post5 Office has since 1872 competed with bankers through money6 orders, it competed with savings and loan association7 through savings accounts, which the Postal Service8 operated -9 QUESTION: Suppose there - suppose there were an10 actionable violation of the antitrust laws and there was a11 conspiracy between two private suppliers, and the Postal12 Service, through some of its high officers, joined that13 conspiracy. Would there be any liability, individual14 liability, on the part of the officers of the Postal15 Service?16 MR. KNEEDLER: I - I'm not sure about that. The17 Postal Service itself would not be - would not be liable,18 andI-andIthinkifthe-Iguessitdependsonwhat19 one means by a - by a conspiracy as well, because if the -20 the Postal Service has brought authority in procurement,21 for example, to - it's exempt from some of the Federal22 procurement statutes, but Congress granted it the23 authority to have its own procurement arrangements. So if24 the - if - if a - if the Postmaster General decides on a25 particular procurement methodology that - that was alleged10, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 to be anti-competitive, I don't think that could be fairly2 characterized as a conspiracy, even -3 QUESTION: Is the private express statute still4 in effect?5 MR. KNEEDLER: It is, it is, and that has - that6 has not been changed, and the Court discussed that in the7 California Board of Regents case and other - and other8 decisions of this Court. Really, the - all the Ninth9 Circuit relied upon in - in this case was the presence of10 a sue-and-be-sued clause in the Postal Reorganization Act,11 which simply says that the Postal Service may sue and be12 sued in its official name.13 There is a - there is virtually no discussion of14 that provision in the legislative history of the act, and15 the Ninth Circuit essentially said that because the Postal16 Service may sue - may be sued in its official name,17 therefore, it has - its sovereign character has been cast18 off and it can be sued just like a private party.19 That - that analysis is in direct conflict with20 this Court's decision in FDIC v. Meyer, where the Court21 reversed a similar determination with respect to the FDIC,22 saying that the Ninth Circuit had conflated what are two23 analytically distinct questions. The first is whether24 there is a waiver of sovereign immunity. We do not25 dispute that there is a waiver of sovereign immunity here11, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 under the sue-and-be-sued clause. But the - the second2 and critical question here is whether the - the3 substantive law that the plaintiff relies upon provides an4 avenue for relief.5 In this case, that is the antitrust laws, and6 Congress has never amended the antitrust laws to make an7 agency or an entity of the United States Government8 liable. After the decision in Cooper - Cooper9 Corporation, Congress amended the Clayton Act to allow the10 United States to sue as a plaintiff if it's injured in its11 business or property, but it did not do that by changing12 the word person. It - it explicitly provided a cause of13 action for the United States as the United States, but it14 did not, as the D.C. Circuit pointed out in the Sea-Land15 case, amend the definition of person or otherwise make the16 United States or its constituent parts subject to the17 antitrust laws as a - as a defendant.18 QUESTION: What happens - I'm sorry, go on.19 QUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, is this - section 201 of20 Title 39 says, there is established as an independent21 establishment of the executive branch of the Government of22 the United States the United States Post Office. Was that23 in the statute before the reorganization or is that part24 of the reorganization?25 MR. KNEEDLER: That's part of the reorganization.12, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 There was a Post Office Department before that was part of2 the Cabinet, and what - what Congress wanted to do was to3 take the post - postal operations out of the Cabinet and4 put them under - under the Board of Governors, who are5 officers of the United States but not part of the Cabinet.6 And the - the phrase, establishment of the executive7 branch, is used with respect to other undeniably Federal8 agencies,as we point out in our - in our brief, the OPM, Personnel Management, the Transportation Safety9 Office of10 Board.1112 clearer that the Postal Service was not to be under the13 President's direct control, and in fact there wereAnd I - I think it's just intended to make14 proposals to make the Postal Service a corporation, and15 Congress emphatically rejected that. And instead, as16 President Nixon proposed in - in submitting a proposal to17 Congress, the Postal Service would be constituted as an18 agency like the SEC or NASA or the Board of Governors of19 the Federal Reserve System. All of those entities are -20 are performing quintessentially governmental functions21 that are not subject to the antitrust laws.￼22 QUESTION: If I get into23 with a postal delivery truck, do24 under the Federal tort claims?25 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, yes,13, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005a car accident with a - I sue the United Statesyoudo.And-and-1 it's - it's an important thing to - to be clear about in2 the Postal Reorganization Act. Pervasively throughout3 that statute, Congress treated the Postal Service as a4 governmental entity. The torts are subject to the Federal5 Tort Claims Act.6 QUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, where does the money7 come to pay the judgment? Is it -8 MR. KNEEDLER: Out of the - out of the Postal9 Service fund, but that is a fund in the Treasury. There's10 a separate provision -11 QUESTION: But it isn't the general judgment12 fund?13 MR. KNEEDLER: No - no, it's - no, it's not, but14 - but there are other - other situations in which15 appropriated funds from a particular agency are used to16 reimburse the judgment fund if there's a particular17 appropriation set aside for that purpose, so this is not a18 unique feature of - of the - of the Postal Act.19 But if I could also mention, torts are subject20 to suit against the United States, but with respect to21 contracts, Congress subjected the Postal Service to the22 Contract Disputes Act. The Court of Claims held almost 2023 years ago, soon after the act was passed, that the United24 States itself could be sued under the Tucker Act based on25 a breach of contract with the Postal Service, because of14, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 the close connection between the Postal Service and the2 United States.3 The Postal Service could be sued in district4 court in its own name under the sue-and-be-sued clause for5 breach of contract, but the Court of Claims held that -6 that the United States itself can be sued, and therefore7 is responsible for the contracts of - of the Postal8 Service, and it -9 QUESTION: Could the United States sue - bring an10 antitrust suit as plaintiff on behalf of the Postal11 Service?12 MR. KNEEDLER: We - we believe it could. It13 would - it would be brought in its own name, but - but the14 United States - if the Postal Service, just like any other15 entity, purchased goods, for example, and was a victim of16 - of a - of a - of an antitrust violation, the United17 States would be able to sue and - and collect treble18 damages. That was the purpose of the Cooper Corporation19 case, where there was a procurement of tires by a number20 of different Federal agencies, and Congress authorized the21 United States to bring a suit to recover for the injuries22 sustained to Federal agencies generally in that situation.23 QUESTION: Under this sue-and-be-sued clause, is24 it your position that there must always be a Federal25 statute authorizing the suit before the post office has15, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 any substantive liability?2 MR. KNEEDLER: As a general rule, yes. There -3 before the Federal Tort Claims Act was passed though, it4 was assumed that tort claims could be brought against5 Federal entities that had sue-and-be-sued clauses,6 although a lot of those were private corporations that7 were instrumentalities, not - not Federal agencies. And8 also with910 have some 1112 because back when they were first put in the - in the13 statutes, the - the separation of a - the existence of a14 waiver of sovereign immunity and the existence of a cause15 of action were - were not separated the way they are16 today. For example, under the - under the Tucker Act, a17 plaintiff can bring a breach of contract action against18 the United States, even though there's no statute that19 specifically provides a cause of action for breach ofrespect -QUESTION: So the sue-and-be-sued clause does substantive force in some other cases?MR.

KNEEDLER: They - they do, and that - QUESTION: So that really doesn't determine whatMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I - I think it's part of an pattern.QUESTION: And they're subject to the Sherman course.MR. KNEEDLER: Right. But it's part of an pattern. Congress does not lightly confer the17, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 right of eminent domain on - on Federal agencies, but it's2 part of a general pattern in which the United States -3 excuse me, in which Congress treated the Postal Service as4 a - as a governmental entity.5 I did want to point out one particular way that6 illustrates the - the way in which the antitrust laws are7 unsuitable here. The precise - this is - this is at8 bottom a routine - a routine procurement dispute. And as9 the Ninth Circuit held in this case, the plaintiffs here10 had a cause of action, in fact, brought one under the11 Administrative Disputes Resolution Act that is essentially12 a bid protest statute.13 And there are two features of that statute that14 are inconsistent with antitrust liability in this setting.15 First of all, Congress expressly provided that the16 standard of review in such an action is the arbitrary and17 capricious standard of the APA, meaning that the Postal18 Service, like any other Federal agency subject to that,19 has to have broad latitude -20 QUESTION: It seems to me, Mr. Kneedler, this is21 an argument that you don't have an antitrust violation22 here, but we're concerned with the problem of whether you23 had a classic violation, say they agreed with somebody24 else on the prices they would charge for advertising the25 Olympics or something like that, where you had a clear -18, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

I think it's arguable whether the alleged violation - but that's not the issue before us.MR. KNEEDLER: Well, except - except to this extent. In - in virtually every direction you turn, in looking on how - on how disputes involving the Postal Service are handled, you find a governmental dispute resolution mechanism, and that - this was the point about the-QUESTION: But what about a breach of - infringement of patents, for example?MR.

Where Congress has wanted to provide the United -QUESTION: Supposing there was a - one of these antitrust violations that involved abuses of patents in order to extend a monopoly or something like that, that could be a classic antitrust violation. But you say there are other Federal remedies there?MR. KNEEDLER: There - there might be - there might be remedies under some of the statutes mentioned here. There - I mean, Congress has expressly subjected19, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 the United States to suit under the Lanham Act, under the2 copyright statute, under - under the trademark laws, under3 the patent laws, but - and - and then there are these4 procurement statutes that I mentioned that are applicable5 in this particular case. But in this case as well,6 Congress did not provide for treble damages. The only7 monetary relief a plaintiff could get in this procurement8 situation, as we point out in our brief under the9 Administrative Dispute Resolution Act, is bid preparation10 costs, not treble damages.11 QUESTION: What if - what if the Post Office buys12 a lot of paper from somebody and doesn't pay for it?13 What's - what is the remedy of that person on a contract?14 MR. KNEEDLER: There would be an alternative15 remedies. Before the Contract Disputes Act was passed,16 the Postal Service could have been sued itself in its own17 name under the sue-and-be-sued clause, or in the Tuck -18 under the Tucker Act in the - in the Court of Claims. Now19 under the Contract Disputes Act, Congress has made that20 statute applicable to the Postal Service just as it has to21 other Federal entities.22 QUESTION: And23 action could be brought24 MR. KNEEDLER:25 Postal Service board of20, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼that could be - that sort of an under the Contract Disputes Act? Yes.

KNEEDLER: Well, I would - I would - if the - a decision - it's a complicated mechanism the way thePostal Rate Commission interacts with the Postal Service, but there is a provision for judicial review. If the Postal Service enters a final decision after - after receiving the input from the Postal Rate Commission, there is a provision for judicial review of that - of determinations of -QUESTION: What would be the -MR. KNEEDLER: - rates and classifications. QUESTION: What would be the substantive basis21, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 for the review?2 MR. KNEEDLER: Under - under the Postal3 Reorganization Act, the provisions beginning in - in4 section 3601 of5 classification,6 that the Postal7 must adhere to.8 QUESTION: And - and would it eliminate this9 possibility of predatory lowing - lowering rates for -the act address rate-making andand there are specific standards there Rate Commission and the Postal Service10 MR. KNEEDLER: They - they are designed to. The11 - the - the way the - the way the act operates, it12 specifies that each classification - first - two things:13 one, overall, the Postal Service rates are to be set at a14 rate so that they - the income will roughly equal15 expenditures. And then within each class, Congress has16 provided the direct and indirect costs of that class are17 to be allocated to it, along with some - an appropriate18 portion of the institutional costs, the things that are19 difficult to - to allocate to any one - any one class.20 QUESTION: Of course, this only becomes a real21 problem when the Postal Service turns a profit on its22 monopoly business, which it has not yet succeeded in23 doing, has it?24 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, and - and it's not - over25 the long term, over the long term since the Postal22, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Reorganization Act, I believe that the Postal Service is2 within about a billion dollars of breaking even. There3 are times when it is in a deficit. There are times when4 it is in a surplus, but the statutory goal is that it -5 that it be roughly equal balance between - between income6 and expenditures.7 QUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, can I ask you a basic8 question I just kind of forgotten that I thought I knew9 about, but I thought the Postal Service had a monopoly of10 the business of delivering letters and packages, and that11 these competing services are only allowed to exist by some12 special privilege granted by the Postal Service.13 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. That's true for letters, but14 not for parcel post.15 QUESTION: But not for parcel, I see.16 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. There's - there's an - the17 Postal Service adopted an exception to the private express18 statutes for urgent letters, which - which has allowed19 organizations like Federal Express to carry letters for￼20 urgent delivery.21 practice would be22 express statutes.23 But the24 competes with non-Federal entities is not new. As I - as25 I pointed out, the Postal Service began competing with23, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005Absent that exception, they would - that prohibited by the - by the private- the idea that the Postal Service1 money orders before the turn of the last century, for 502 years have had savings deposits with up to 4 million3 depositors that competed with savings associations, so and4 - and it's competed - it went into the parcel post5 business, the parcel delivery business in 1913 alongside6 of other businesses.7 So that - that sort of competition with private8 businesses has - has occurred since well before the Postal9 Reorganization Act, and nothing in the Postal10 Reorganization Act changes the way in which that should be11 regarded under the - under the antitrust laws.12 If the Court has no further questions, I'd like13 to reserve the balance of my time.14 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.15 Mr. Krent, we'll hear from you.16 ORAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD J. KRENT17 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS18 MR. KRENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please19 the Court:20 As Justice Scalia noted, Congress launched the21 Postal Service into the commercial world in 1970,22 authorizing it to compete in any market of its own23 choosing, and this new commercial entity fits comfortably24 within the term, person, under the antitrust laws for at25 least four distinct reasons.24, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 First, this is unlike any other Federal entity2 in the fact that the Postal Service has been authorized to3 decide which markets it wants to compete into. It's not4 competing in order to fulfill a specific congressional5 mission, but rather to compete in order to break even to6 make money.7 Second, Congress has directed the Postal Service8 enter these markets with scant regulatory oversight. The9 APA, the Postal Rate Commission, the Federal acquisition10 regulations, all do not apply when the Postal Service is11 acting under its non-monopoly powers.12 QUESTION: You're saying then that the Cooper13 decision doesn't affect your argument, because the - the14 Congress has separated the Post Office Department from the15 - from the executive?16 MR. KRENT: That's correct, Your Honor. And in17 many other contexts, though, it's clear that this Court18 has recognized that the Postal Service should be distinct19 from the United States, the Franchise Tax opinion, the20 Loeffler decision, and I think the other -21 QUESTION: Well, neither of those are quite in22 point.23 MR. KRENT: Neither are involved in separate24 cause of action, but both involve this Court's recognition25 that the Postal Service is not the same as United States25, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 and should be treated differently.2 QUESTION: But what do you do with the statutory3 language that it's an establishment of the executive4 branch of the Government of the United States?5 MR. KRENT: Well, I think it is an establishment6 of the executive branch, and it keeps some kind of7 connection to the United States, and so, for instance,8 Congress evidently cared about the fact that, given the9 monopoly given over letter mail, that there would be some10 tie. I mean, the - the President cannot, can neither11 appoint nor discharge the Postmaster General, but yet12 there is some link between the President and the Postal13 Service. Yet financially, the Postal Service is14 independent.15 QUESTION: There isn't any Postmaster General16 anymore, is there?17 MR. KRENT: Well, there - there is, Your Honor,18 in terms of the individual who's so-called under the19 statute the executive official of the - of the United20 States, and that individual is to - is also a member of21 the Board of Governors of the Postal Service and is to22 direct and execute the business operations of the Postal23 Service.24 QUESTION: How is he selected? By the Board of25 Governors?26, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. KRENT: Chosen by the Board of - yes, Your2 Honor. And I think that, again, Evans is the separation3 or the insulation of the Postal Service from direct4 executive branch control. But financially, as I5 mentioned, the debts of the Postal Service are not the6 debts of the United States. Any kind of - of recovery7 against the Postal Service does not come from the judgment8 fund, it comes from the Postal Service fund. Again, these9 two things reflect the fact that the budget, as well as10 the overall financial structure of the Postal Service, is11 independent.12 And - and the fourth reason, Your Honor, of why13 the Postal Service is a distinct entity is - is the fact14 that there is a sue-and-be-sued clause that differentiates15 this case from the Sea-Land case, in which there was no16 sue-and-be-sued clause.17 QUESTION: It doesn't differentiate though from18 the Meyer case?19 MR. KRENT: No, Your Honor, and indeed, we think20 though that the - these four factors together amply21 demonstrate that this is a - there is a congressional22 intent that the Postal Service be considered a separate,23 distinct entity that can qualify under the term, person,24 in antitrust laws. And indeed, this is not an unadorned25 sue-and-be-sued clause. Congress sat and thought about27, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 the ramifications of the sue-and-be-sued clause and2 thought about what specific limitations should be grafted3 on to the waiver of immunity. It decided to make sure the4 Postal Service complied with the Federal Tort Claims Act.5 It wanted to make sure that the Postal Service, despite6 the distinction with the United States, viewed its own -7 had different venue - had the same venue.8 QUESTION: But Meyer says you have to have9 something more than a sue-and-be-sued clause, that you10 have to show that there's a cause of action available. So11 a sue-and-be-sued clause itself is not enough for you in12 this case, don't you agree with that?13 MR. KRENT: I agree, Your Honor, and indeed it's14 the fact that the antitrust laws say that every person15 should be subject to the anti-competitive measures, or16 pro-competitive measures, in - in the statutes.17 QUESTION: Well, yes, but the - that was true -18 they said that in the Cooper case too, that person, and19 the Cooper Court said, no, the United States is not a20 person.21 MR. KRENT: That's right, Your Honor, but I think22 the Cooper case must be looked at in the structure of the23 decision itself, because the Cooper Court was very clear24 to limit its decision. It said that person did not equal25 United States because of the fact that there were other28, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425remedies given to the United States explicitly in the act, and indeed, that that conformed to -QUESTION: But certainly after the Cooper decision, it was clear that the United States could not be a defendant either, was it not, as well as not be a plaintiff -MR. KRENT: Well, it didn't matter Your Honor, because there was no waiver of immunity.QUESTION: Well, answer my question, will you?MR. KRENT: I believe that it was clear, because - but, again, I think that nobody tried to avail themselves of that remedy because the United States had not waived its immunity. But this Court extended the notion of the - of person, and to as broad as possible, including states, including foreign governments, as well as associations and public corporations.QUESTION: Didn't the Court say in Cooper, the reason why we're not letting the United States be a person as plaintiff, because if we did that it would follow like the night day that they would be a person as a defendant, and we certainly don't want them to be a person as a defendant? So that's right in the -MR. KRENT: Well, we have no quarrel -QUESTION: That's right in the opinion. It's not something subtle. One of the driving forces for saying29, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 they couldn't be - they weren't going to read into the act2 plaintiff3 mean they45 Your Honor, but this Court, in Georgia v. Evans, and this6 Court in Pfizer, made clear to cast the Cooper decision in7 the light of the fact that it was a narrow decision,status was that this Court thought that would would be a person for defendant status.MR. KRENT: I agree that it's in the opinion,8 predicated not specifically on that point, Your Honor, but9 rather on the notion that there was an election of10 remedies, the fact that the United States could sue to11 seize property under the act, the United States could12 pursue criminal penalties under the act, and that13 linguistically, the United States doesn't seem to fit in14 within the terms, an organization or association existing15 under the law as the United States.16 QUESTION: Well, the - what, the Postal17 Reorganization Act was 1970? Have any other antitrust18 suits been brought against the Postal Service in that 3419 years?20 MR. KRENT: Not to my knowledge, Your Honor.21 However, the Department of Justice in 1977 and again in22 1978, made findings suggesting that the Postal Service was23 likely to be subject to the antitrust laws.24 QUESTION: That's no longer the position of the25 department, is it?30, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. KRENT: That's correct. It was soon after2 the enactment of the 1970 statutes. And indeed, there are3 other entities, such as the Tennessee Valley Authority,4 which has been found to be a person under the antitrust5 acts, but I think it's - the fact that this is rising,6 this question arises under the Postal Services is no7 surprise, because the Postal Service has a roving mandate8 to decide to go into the business of greeting cards in9 competition to Hallmark, to go into the fact that it can10 sell bicycling gear, to go into the market of the package11 industry, to go into the market of calling cards and12 compete against AT&T.1314 which has15 Congress,16 1718 it had a mandate to make money. I thought the statute had19 ordered it to break even.20 MR. KRENT: Well, it has a statute - it - it's -21 it's a rough balance. It's unclear whether it's supposed22 to make a little money or lose a little money.23 QUESTION: But it - but it's unlike most profit-24 making institutions that are primarily engaged in trying25 to make as much money as they can.31, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005There is no other Federal entity to my knowledge this kind of roving mandate to make money from and indeed, it has used this ability - QUESTION: Well, it's an -￼QUESTION: It didn't - excuse me - I didn't think1 MR. KRENT: That is correct, Your Honor, but in2 the non-postal activities, the only objective is to make3 money. Certainly for universal service there are other4 objectives limiting and channeling the actions of the5 Postal Service, but with respect to selling bicycling gear6 or selling greeting cards, the only objective the Postal7 Service has is to make money, and it has tried to use this8 power, and indeed, there were surpluses, as mentioned by9 counsel for the Solicitor General, in several years. So10 the Postal Service can be successful at least at times,11 but other times, of course, especially after 9/11, it has12 seen hard times.13 QUESTION: But even - even when it is, I take it14 the object of the money that it makes is essentially to15 break even, maybe break even and a little bit more, on -16 on the mail delivery operation, which the statute itself17 recites as being a sovereign responsibility of the United18 States.19 MR. KRENT: Well, I think that's -20 QUESTION: So, I mean, that's - that's a long way21 from General Motors.22 MR. KRENT: I think it - it's - there is no23 shareholders, for instance, looking for a profit, but the24 goal of the Postal Service in these other areas of25 business, whether it's the package business or the32, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 greeting card business, is to make money.2 QUESTION: Well, it is to make money, but it is3 to make money in order to subsidize a particular activity,4 and I don't think - maybe I'm missing something - but I5 don't think there's an indication that there's a mandate6 there to maximize profits to in - in effect subsidize the7 rest of the Government.8 MR. KRENT: Not - not the rest of the Government9 at all, because there is a segregated fund. But it is10 there to - to make sure that any kind of losses that the11 Postal Service may sustain in its monopoly business can be12 overcome by profits generated in the non-monopoly13 business.1415 described16 sovereign1718 been very19 to be pursued here, and the Postal Service is pursuing20 that. But that's not what the Postal Service is only21 about. The Postal Service is also constructed as a22 business, and that's what this Court has recognized in23 Franchise Tax and in Loeffler case, and according to that24 business principles, is pursuing other tasks as well.25 Indeed, Congress -33, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005QUESTION: And that monopoly business is￼in the statute as being the discharge of a obligation of the United States, isn't it?MR. KRENT: Absolutely. The - the Congress has clear that there is a monopoly business to be -1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Whatis-whatisthe-whatisthe organizational form of this business? It's not a corporation, is it?MR. KRENT: It's a corporation-like form, Your Honor, and indeed -QUESTION: Well, but it's not a separate corporation.MR. KRENT: That's correct, Your Honor. I mean, the Postal Service has described itself as a corporation.QUESTION: Is it - is it a partnership?MR. KRENT: It's - it's a board of directors- type organization with the Board of Governors serving as a type of Board of Governors - as a board of directors - and the Board of Governors, as mentioned earlier, chooses the head or the chief executive officer of, or the Postmaster General, of the Postal Service itself.QUESTION: But the structure, I take it, is unlike anything that one would find in - in a - in a private profit-making organization.MR. KRENT: That's correct.QUESTION: It's not a corporation, not a partnership.MR. KRENT: That's correct, Your Honor.QUESTION: I mean, it is - has a distinct structure, but I think that the Congress that launched the34, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Postal Service in the business and suggested that the2 Postal Rate Commission, the APA, and the Federal3 acquisition regulations wouldn't apply, would not have4 wanted then the Postal Service to use any kind of monopoly5 powers to have a tying arrangement with an entity such as,6 you know, Emery Air Freight or Federal Express, it7 wouldn't wanted to have -8 QUESTION: Well, why isn't this the kind of9 policy judgment that we ought to leave to Congress to make10 explicitly? The Post Office, as reorganized, has two11 aspects to it, as you've pointed out effectively, but how12 it should relate to the Antitrust Act seems to be the kind13 of judgment that Congress should address expressly. Isn't14 that so?15 MR. KRENT: I think, Your Honor, that the16 Congress has already made that judgment by suggesting that17 the Postal Service have the right to be sue and be sued,18 suggesting the Postal Service -19 QUESTION: Well, I thought we20 discussed that. I mean, the mere fact21 and-be-sued clause is not enough under￼22 to answer 232425the question. You have to - MR. KRENT: Sure.QUESTION: - take another step - MR. KRENT: Right. The -35, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005had alreadythat there's a sue- the Meyer approach1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: - beyond that.MR. KRENT: Sure, Your Honor. The question is whether or not the Postal Service fits within the term, person. We know under the antitrust laws, we know that person can be applied to public corporations, as this Court has held. We know that person can be applied to states, as this Court has held. We know that person can be applied to foreign governmental entities, as this Court has held. So the only question is whether this person can also apply to Federal governmental entities, and we think that it's clear that some, but very few, governmental entities would qualify under the term, person.QUESTION: But you - you - you concede that before the Postal Reorganization Act, the answer to the question would be no?MR. KRENT: Absolutely.QUESTION: So you - you have to - I mean, you're - you're not writing on a blank slate. You - you have to find enough in the Postal Reorganization Act to change that answer from no to yes, and that's really the burden.MR. KRENT: I - I agree, Your Honor.QUESTION: Given that the Postal Service was not subject to the antitrust laws before, something so fundamental happened in 1970 that it is now a person under the antitrust law. That's - that's your -36, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. KRENT: I fully agree with that.QUESTION: - your burden.MR. KRENT: I full agree with that, and I think we candischarge that burden if you look at the fact that the Postal Service is financially independent, it's administratively independent, it doesn't have to comply with the pro-competitive measures and the Federal acquisitions regulations, it has a sue-and-be-sued clause.QUESTION: But its employees, are its employees subject to the Taft-Hartley law, or - or - or are they like - like Federal workers?MR. KRENT: They are the only employees in the entire government to my knowledge that must comply with the Taft-Hartley law, and indeed, Congress specified that it must comply within the law, because it wanted them to act more like a business and not have this restrictures of other organizations within the United States as they - following the fellow labor relations authority, Your Honor.QUESTION: So - so - would - would their employees be members of the American Federation of Governmental Employees or other unions?MR. KRENT: I believe it's the American Postal Workers Union, Your Honor.37, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Postal workers union?MR. KRENT: Yes. So it's a - it's a separate - they're separated again from the Government with respect to labor relations. And indeed, they are one of the few governmental entities that have signified their own operations under www-dot - dot-com. All right, they have decided not to become a governmental player.QUESTION: But of course, the Reorganization Act itself specified that they'd be subject to Taft-Hartley, did it not?MR. KRENT: That's correct. And that's part and parcel, I think -QUESTION: So why didn't it specify that they would be subject to the Sherman Act?MR. KRENT: Because -QUESTION: You see, I - I don't think that helps you, I think it hurts you.MR. KRENT: I don't -QUESTION: It - it is a significant feature that - that the - their employees are subject to Taft-Hartley, but that - that is more than answered by the fact that it says so in the Reorganization Act. Why doesn't it say so about the - about the antitrust laws?MR. KRENT: Well, I think it's important to think about what the Postal Reorganization Act does say. When38, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 it waives immunity, it makes limitations. The limitations2 are that the Postal Service must comply with the3 limitations in the Federal Tort Claims Act, that it has a4 different - the same venue provisions as by the United5 States, and that it has some of the jurisdictional6 qualities as the United States, though the - so the7 limitations and ramifications of the waiver are grafted in8 section 409 very clearly. There is no other limitation,9 and I think it's important to realize -10 QUESTION: Yeah, but there's one - one sticking11 point that - running through my mind. The fact that they12 had to waive the immunity in the sue-and-be-sued clause13 suggest that they're a sovereign.14 MR. KRENT: We agree that they're part of15 government, Your Honor. There's never been any kind of16 question about the fact that the Postal Service is part of17 the Government.18 QUESTION: And is a sovereign.19 MR. KRENT: And - yes, Your Honor. And it takes20 -takespartofthe-inthe-inthesensethatitwould21 have immunity, but for the waiver, clearly because22 Congress created the entity, and therefore Congress￼23 decides 2425 subjectwhether to waive the immunity.QUESTION: Of course, if you're right, they'reto criminal liability under the Sherman Act too.39, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. KRENT: Well, so are states theoretically, as well as cities. I don't think that would ever arise, but that is at least a theoretical possibility and this Court has averted to that in prior decisions as well. The same thing is true, of course, for cities under -QUESTION: A criminal case with the United States against the United States Postal Service.MR. KRENT: Well, I don't think that's likely to happen, Your Honor, but I think it's important that this -this waiver allows the Postal Service also to vindicate its own interests, right. But for this waiver, Postal Service could not go in and sue for any kind of antitrust injuries, and that's not clear.QUESTION: But Congress could have said thePostal Service is authorized to sue and omitted the be- sued clause. It could have done it that way -MR. KRENT: That -QUESTION: - in which there would have been nowaiver.MR. KRENT: That's correct, Your Honor. That would have made this case go away. But Congress chose not to follow that path, and indeed, if one could think that one launches a - an organization into the commercial marketplace and takes away the constraints of the APA, the FAR, the Postal Rate Commission -40, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Well, to say launch into the commercial marketplace, they're basically selling stamps and nobody else is selling stamps. What kind of a launching is that?MR. KRENT: Well, I think it's now for the monopoly business, Your Honor, but the launching with - with respect to the package delivery business, the greeting card business, the fact that they are sponsoring Lance Armstrong's bicycling team, these are all the areas in which the Postal Service has decided to venture outside of its mandate, and it's - the danger is allowing the Postal Service to extend its monopoly power into these new fields.QUESTION: Mr. Krent -QUESTION: But when it goes into all those fields anyway - we've made this point about 15 times - it - it doesn't set the prices it wants. It sets prices controlled by a commission under a mandate that says it's supposed to break even.MR. KRENT: No - no - if I understand your - QUESTION: Isn't that right?MR. KRENT: That's not right, Your Honor. Interms of all these different areas, the Postal Rate Commission does not operate whatsoever.QUESTION: It has no - in greeting cards and so41, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 forth?2 MR. KRENT: No jurisdiction. The Postal Service 3-45678910111213141516171819202122232425MR. KRENT: Oh, overall, Your Honor, but the Postal Rate Commission has no jurisdiction whatsoever on the Postal Service's actions with respect to greeting cards, bicycling gear, and the package delivery business. And I think that points out the danger of the monopoly practices. One could easily see -QUESTION: So if in - in the greeting cardbusiness, they decided to go into an agreement with three other companies, Hallmark and Smith's greeting cards, and they were to fix their prices at $14 a greeting card, which seems about right nowadays -(Laughter.)QUESTION: - the - the - then under those circumstances, there would be no remedy -MR. KRENT: That's correct, Your Honor.QUESTION: - for the consumer of the stores. There's no government agency anybody could appeal to?MR. KRENT: That's correct, Your Honor.42, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005QUESTION: So is it - it - and it's free? In other words, it doesn't - it isn't - well, you - I thought you answered Justice Souter by saying that they do have an obligation even there to break even overall?￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: All right. So that's -MR. KRENT: Absolutely none. And indeed, if there was a tying arrangement of trying to say, if you want our postal services then you have to buy our greeting cards, to follow your example, no remedy whatsoever there as well, so that all these kinds of fear of predatory pricing, tying arrangements, monopolistic prices, the -there's adanger -QUESTION: Well, but there - there wouldn't be a as the Postal Service, but I assume you couldremedyingsue American Greetings and Hallmark and whoever else had conspired with the Postal Service.MR. KRENT: You might, unless it was a tying agreement, Your Honor. If it was just the universal, unilateral action of the Postal Service with a tying arrangement, there would be no remedy.QUESTION: If it was unilateral action, they'dbe-QUESTION: We won't sell you any stamps unless you buy our greeting cards?MR. KRENT: You never know. One never knows. QUESTION: It might happen, I suppose. QUESTION: Mr. Krent, can we go back to Sea-Land, where I thought that the first point made in that decision was indeed as a result of the change in the APA43, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 that Alaska Railroad could be sued for injunctive relief.2 The Court said, yeah, they could be sued like any person,3 not for damages, but for injunctive relief. And then it4 said, but this is the question of whether Congress5 authorized them to be a defendant in an antitrust case is6 a totally7 waiver of89 Your Honor, and indeed, the difference in - in Sea-Land isdiscrete question, it has nothing to do with the sovereign immunity.MR. KRENT: Well, indeed, that - that's right,10 the fact that the Alaska Airlines never had a - never had11 to argue that they were separate from the United States.12 Their argument was that the United States could be sued13 for its proprietary activities under the Sherman Act.14 They didn't argue that they were a distinct entity, so15 they never said that - there was no - they agreed that16 there was no sue-and-be-sued clause, and so that whole17 argument that we're making in this case was never even18 raised in Sea-Land.19 QUESTION: Well, I'm - from the Court's point of20 view, it - the Court made as a threshold determination21 that the railroad could be sued for equitable relief, so22 it could be sued. And then it says, but that doesn't23 answer the question, we have to determine whether there is24 a claim, any claim under the antitrust laws, and on that25 the Court relied on Cooper.44, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. KRENT: That's correct, Your Honor, because2 of the Court's holding that the Alaska Airlines did not3 qualify under the term person under the antitrust laws.4 And it's our contention, because the Postal Service is not5 structured anywhere like the Alaska Airlines, because it's6 - Alaska Airlines did not have a separate budget, the7 Alaska Airlines could not sue and be sued, the Alaska8 airlines had to comply with the APA, unlike the Postal9 Service, that the Postal Service is a person, whereas the10 Alaska Airlines and the SBA and the Department of Commerce11 and HUD would not be persons under the antitrust law. So12 it's a very narrow argument predicated on the structure -131415 whom were16 I take it17 1819 appointed20 them.2122 Deputy Postmaster.23 QUESTION: All right. So nine out of the eleven24 are appointed. Are they confirmed by Congress?25 MR. KRENT: By the Senate, sure.45, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

So - and they're2 represented by the Solicitor General, and their license3 plates have government on them.4 MR. KRENT: Well, I've never seen their license5 plates, your Honor, but I'm -6 QUESTION: But, I mean, and - and they say that7 they're part of the Government, and 80 or 90 percent of8 what they do is not what private industry does at all and9 you have remedies against all of it except - under other10 statutes or powers of review within the Government, except11 for a small portion, I take it it is a small portion, this12 greeting card business.13 MR. KRENT: Well, we're focusing on the 2014 percent we agree -15 QUESTION: All right, then, so you're - in other16 words, I thought you were selling them sacks, you wanted17 to sell them burlap sacks.18 MR. KRENT: Well, they're not burlap, but yes,19 they are -20 QUESTION: Well, whatever they are -21 MR. KRENT: - they are sacks.22 QUESTION: - they're some kind of sack.23 MR. KRENT: Sure.24 QUESTION: Aren't they used for mail?25 MR. KRENT: They are used for international mail,46, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

I don't know that General Motors now can make a treaty.MR. KRENT: I agree with you, Your Honor.QUESTION: All right, so - so it wouldn't help you if we said that in the vast bulk of their business where they have all of these characteristics I just mentioned -MR. KRENT: Well, I think it would, Your Honor. QUESTION: - that it - it would help you? How? MR. KRENT: I think it would because I think theargument here -QUESTION: They're selling the sacks for thegreeting cards too?MR. KRENT: I think that what - actually thatthey probably do, but the - the - the gravamen here is that there was a conspiracy to monopolize the mail sack business, as well as the -QUESTION: Of course there was. Don't they have a right to monopolize the mail sack business or not? Isn't there some -MR. KRENT: No.QUESTION: They don't?MR.

Then why don't you go to thecommissions that run them and tell them they can't do it? MR. KRENT: Well, there - there is a procurement claim pending, Your Honor, but the Postal Rate Commissionwould not have jurisdiction over the - the mail sack purchase at all, Your Honor. And so the - the fear is that these kind of - of trade practices that are anti- competitive can go on without any kind of direct restraint. Certainly there is an overlap between procurement and antitrust, but it's not congruent in that sense.I think it's helpful to think about what Congress intended by waiving the Postal Service's immunity in the sue-and-be-sued clause. Clearly it has to apply to something. There was some point in waiving the immunity of the Postal Service. We know, for instance, at least I think that the Government has conceded, that the Postal Service is now subject to torts at state law torts. The -Franchise Tax suggested that the Government -QUESTION: Well, I - I thought conceded they weresubject to Federal Tort Claims Act?MR. KRENT: But the waiver was for torts and thenthe limitation in the waiver said that the procedures of the Federal Tort Claims Act must be applied, but clearly48, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼12345 6-7 QUESTION: So the - the Post Office can be sued8 in state court then for a - for a state tort?there's a waiver -QUESTION: Even though it's a state court actionagainst the Post Office?MR. KRENT: That's correct, just as it would bein any - for other Federal entity, but, for instance, the910 fact that11 Act apply1213 asked you 14151617 your question, Your Honor, but the - the argument then is18 that - that in other kinds of cases, such as the state law19 that said person in the Franchise Task - Tax - whether20 that - the question is whether that applies to the Postal21 Service as well, and of course in this Court, upheld the22 determination that the Postal Service would comply under23 the term person under the state law as well.24 So how far does person apply? Contract law,25 tort law, what about the Lanham Act, the trademark case?MR. KRENT: Well, it could be, except for the the - the limitations of the Federal Tort Claims by virtue of 409.QUESTION: Well, that's - that what I thought I a minute ago -MR. KRENT: Well then -QUESTION: - and you said something different. MR. KRENT: Well, I'm sorry if I misunderstood￼49, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 Before the recent amendments to the Lanham Act that were2 mentioned recently, the - all the3 was applied to persons, and three4 suggested that even though person5 United States, person could apply6 by virtue of its distinct status.7 QUESTION: But I thought8 definition written right into the9 person within the meaning of thatstatute said was that it courts of appealscould not apply to the to the Postal Service,the Lanham Act, Lanham Act was that a act is an organization10 capable of suing and being sued.MR. KRENT: Yes, but courts11 had said that the United States, previous to that, did not12 fall within the term person, because the person doesn't13 refer to governmental entities at all. So there the courts14 had distinguished -15 QUESTION: It said it with respect to the16 antitrust law in Cooper, but the Lanham Act defined person17 differently.18 MR. KRENT: But just slightly, Your Honor. The19 only difference was the capable-of-being-sued part. The20 United States is also capable of being sued.21 QUESTION: But I - I thought that was what was22 critical, that any organization capable of suing and being23 sued was within the Lanham Act.24 MR. KRENT: But the United States, Your Honor,25 can also be sued and is capable of suing itself, so I'm50, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 not sure that that distinguishes it, and indeed, under2 that language, courts had held the United States was not3 liable, and yet the Postal Service had registered4 trademarks in its own name, the Postal Service had5 registered copyrights in its own name, even though the6 United States cannot hold copyrights, and there is an7 exception -8 QUESTION: But isn't there a good reason for9 that?10 MR. KRENT: Well, I think there is a good reason.11 QUESTION: To stop people from engaging in12 designed piracy in stamps?13 MR. KRENT: And indeed, if that were all that the14 Postal Service had filed for, I would be - I would be in15 total agreement with Your Honor. But the Postal Service16 had filed for 300, at least 350, I believe, copyrights,17 books, training manuals, things that have nothing to do18 with the protection for the legitimacy of - of stamps.19 So again, the Postal Office has defined itself20 through its actions as a person in comparable commercial21 tort situations. It's only logical that if a Postal22 Service in the commercial world, saying that it's not like23 the United States for copyrights, for trademarks, then24 it's not like United States with respect to antitrust.25 When Congress formed the Postal Service, Your51, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Honors, and it took away the APA, the Postal Rate2 Commission for these non-monopoly actions, as well as the3 Federal acquisition regulations, certainly there was a4 quid pro quo.5 If you streamline the operations of the Postal6 Service, launch it into business, you would expect the7 private commercial torts in antitrust laws to be the8 restraint to make sure that the monopoly is not extended9 to the other kind of operations. And so I think that10 Congress' intent is quite clear that the Postal Service is11 unique, does not partake of the United States, and12 therefore, just as the Postal Service can be sued in tort13 law and under the Lanham Act, be it the old Lanham Act,14 the new Lanham Act, it can be sued under the antitrust15 laws as well.16 The burden, therefore, on the Solicitor General17 to explain why Congress would have wanted the Postal18 Service's monopoly to be extended, and why Congress would19 have wanted the Postal Service to be sue - to be able to20 be sued and to sue themselves without really being able to21 take advantage of the opportunity to sue in their own name22 under the antitrust laws or under trademark and copyright23 law, et cetera, and why they shouldn't be sued as well.24 If there are no further questions, thank you.25 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Krent.52, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Mr. Kneedler, you have six minutes remaining.2 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER3 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER4 MR. KNEEDLER: Several points, Mr. Chief Justice.5 In addition to the other statutes that I've mentioned with6 respect to the right to sue, there are a number of other7 respects in which Congress has treated the Postal Service8 as a Federal entity. It's subject to their Freedom of9 Information Act, the Privacy Act, the Inspector General10 Act, it's subject to the Federal sector OSHA regulations,11 and as this Court pointed out in the Loeffler decision,12 it's subject to the Federal sector Title VII prohibitions,13 not - it's not treated as a private corporation for14 purposes of Title VII.15 It is subject to the National Labor Relations16 Act, but this act was passed in 1970 before the Federal17 sector labor - labor management provisions came in in the18 Civil Service Reform Act, and as you pointed out, Justice19 Scalia, that's an express provision subjecting the Postal20 Service to something that otherwise applies to private21 entities, but in - but in virtually every other respect,22 Congress has specified that it would be subject to Federal23 law.24 And in section 409 of the act, with respect to25 judicial proceedings, Congress specified that the Postal53, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Service would be - would be treated just like the United2 States, not just with respect to Tort Claims Act, but3 venue, removal jurisdiction, and representation by the4 Attorney General.5 But the - the most fundamental point, however,6 to be made is that this is not a situation in which7 Congress has created a new entity and launched, in that8 sense, that entity into a private commercial world. Here,9 Congress has carried forward the nation's tradition of10 treating postal services as sovereign functions performed11 by the Government of the United States. These are - these12 are - to the extent they're commercial functions and - and13 they are unusual commercial functions, the Constitution14 treats them as - as something of particular interest to15 the United States Government.16 I should point out that with respect to the17 postal services, all postal services are subject to the18 jurisdiction of the Postal Rate Commission, not just those19 that are subject to monopoly, that - that the Postal20 Service has monopoly control over, Justice Breyer. So21 even in those areas in which the Postal Service is subject22 to competition in - in parcel and express mail, for23 example, the Postal Service - the Postal Rate Commission -24 does have regulatory jurisdiction over those -25 QUESTION: So greeting cards?54, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. KNEEDLER: It does not over greeting cards,2 but the non-postal functions of the Postal Service3 constitute less than 1 percent of the revenues of the - of4 the Postal Service. We're talking about a very minor5 aspect of the Postal Service's operations, and the6 affirmative authorization for the Postal Service to engage7 in that in section 404(7) of the act is cast in the same8 terms as the Postal Service's authorization to engage in9 all the other functions and they're really incidental.10 QUESTION: But the fact that it's only - the fact11 that it's only 1 percent means they're only liable under12 the antitrust laws for 1 percent of their business.13 MR. KNEEDLER: No, I think - I think it shows14 that - that - that the predominant character of the Postal15 Service is as it always has been, and these - these other16 services are really in most ways incidental to - to postal17 services like greeting cards and - and that sort of thing.18 QUESTION: But they're the services that they19 want to bring suits under. That's -20 MR. KNEEDLER: This - this is - this is not -21 this is not that. This case is a - is an ordinary22 procurement dispute that - all Federal agencies engage in23 procurement and - and -24 QUESTION: That's the curious thing about this25 suit. It actually represents a portion of the monopoly55, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 business, of using the monopoly to - to monopolize2 procurement.3 MR. KNEEDLER: And in procurement, and in4 procurement in particular, Congress has treated the Postal5 Service like all other - all other Federal agencies under6 the Contract Disputes Act, particularly with respect to7 the disputes at issue here. So in the end we believe8 that, as Justice O'Connor said, this is essentially a9 policy choice for Congress. If - if in the current10 climate the Postal Service is to be subject to the11 antitrust laws, notwithstanding the fact that it remains a12 governmental entity, that is a - that is a choice that13 Congress should make, whether these governmental14 activities should be regulated by treble damage actions,15 which was extremely unusual under - under Federal16 statutes.17 And where Congress has chosen to subject the18 United States to liability under statutes such as this,19 but not nearly as free-ranging in the patent laws, et20 cetera, it has done so expressly, and we think 30 years21 after the passage of the Postal Reorganization Act, that22 if the - if the Postal Service is now to be subject to the23 antitrust laws, that is something for Congress to do and24 not for the courts to try to divine from complete silence25 in the Postal Reorganization Act or its legislative56, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.
