KNEEDLER               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MR. KNEEDLER:   Mr.  Chief Justice,  and may  itplease the Court:10111213   Trade  Agreement,   concluded  that  the   United  States'14   continuation  of a  blanket  ban or  a  moratorium on  theIn February of 2001, an international arbitration panel, convened under the North American Free15161718   excuse me --  his intention to comply with the arbitration19 decision by invoking power specifically vested in him by20   Congress to lift the moratorium in order to comply with an21 international trade agreement. And the President in fact22   did lift the moratorium in November of 2002.23             In this case,  the Ninth  Circuit held that  the24 Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, an agency in25   the Department of Transportation that is limited to a -- a3operation of Mexican domiciled commercial carriers beyond the border zone in the United States violated NAFTA.1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005Soon  thereafter, the  President  made clear  --￼1 safety mandate, was required to conduct an elaborate and2 complex environmental analysis of the President's foreign3 trade and foreign policy decision before it could enter or4 issue procedural safety regulations that were necessary to5 implement the President's decision. The Ninth Circuit set6 aside the procedural regulations on that ground and 7 thereby prevented the agency from granting certification 8 to carriers that under the President's decision were 9 eligible to receive it.10             The Ninth Circuit's decision is incorrect and it11   has frustrated  the  President's ability  to  comply  with12   NAFTA.13             Congress  and the  President,  the two  entities14   whose  joint  action  brought  about  the lifting  of  the15   moratorium,  are  not  subject  to   either  NEPA  or  the16   provisions of the  Clean Air Act that  respondents rely on17 to require an environmental analysis. Accordingly, the18 agency acted entirely reasonably in choosing to take the19 President's action as a given, including any increased20   traffic or  trade  that might  occur as  a  result of  the21   President's  decision  and  to,  instead,  focus  its  own22   environmental  analysis   on  the   effects  of   its  own23   procedural regulations.24             FMCA's government -- governing statute  requires25   it to  grant registration to  any carrier that  is willing41111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 and able to comply with applicable safety, safety fitness,2 and financial responsibility requirements. The agency has3 no authority to deny operating permission to a carrier,4 foreign or domestic, based on environmental concerns or5 foreign trade concerns. It has no authority to 6 countermand the President's decision or to refuse to issue 7 the regulations that were necessary to implement the 8 President's decision. 9             QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, just  a -- a background10   fact.  Perhaps I missed it,  but was there any parallel in11 Canada? We're talking about Mexico or Mexican vehicles.12 I understood that originally there was the same limitation13 for both.1415 thereafter, the -- the moratorium was imposed in 1982 16 originally, but it conferred on the President the power to 17 lift the moratorium, and an agreement was arrived at soon 18 thereafter with Canada. So since the early '80's, 19 Canadian carriers have been -- have been permitted to 20 enter.21 The -- the moratorium was remained in -- 22 retained in effect by the President through subsequent 23 actions into the '90's. In the North American Free Trade24 Agreement, the United States included a reservation to a25 complete opening of the border for transporter operations51111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005MR.  KNEEDLER:   There  was.   And  -- and  soon￼1 by carriers subject to a phase-out, initially a phase-out 2   that would allow carriers from Mexico to operate in any of 3   the border  States -- that was 3 years after the agreement 4   was  signed --  and then  by the  year 2000, to  allow the 5   carriers to  operate anywhere in  the United States.   The 6   President decided  not to go forward with  that because of7 concerns about whether the safety regulatory regime in8 Mexico was sufficient to prepare the Mexican carriers to 9   come into the United States.  So that is the reason why it10   was held up.11             And -- and  the basis  of the NAFTA  arbitration12 panel's decision was that a blanket prohibition on that 13 ground was not -- was -- was not permissible under NAFTA 14 and that the United States had to consider applications 15 from Mexican carriers on a case-by-case basis. It could 16 adopt special procedures to ensure that the carriers who 17 would be permitted to come in under the President's 18 lifting of the moratorium would satisfy the substantive 19 safety standards. And that is the set of regulations that20212223 standards that -- that Mexican carriers, like -- like 24 other foreign and domestic carriers in the United States 25 have to comply with, are -- have already been in place.6are at issue here.          But it's important to  recognize that these  arenot substantive safety  standards.   The substance --  the1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1   All  that  we  are  talking  about  here  are  essentiallyprocedural or administrative regulations.          QUESTION:    Mr.  Kneedler,  can  I  ask  you  a 2 3 4 5   I'm  trying  to  think  through  the  case.    Assume  the6 President wasn't involved at all and Congress had decided 7   to lift the moratorium and enact it and did everything the 8   President did and said, but before you do  it, we want you9 to, as a precondition, adopt these safety regulations.10   Would your position be any different?11 MR. KNEEDLER: Oh, yes, yes. And it -- I think12   it's  the  same situation.   The  FMCSA, as  a subordinate13   agency in the executive branch, I think would have to take14 as a given that act of Congress just -- just as it was -­15 it was --16             QUESTION:  It  wouldn't be any different.   I -­17   you -- you -­18             MR. KNEEDLER:  No, no.  I -­19             QUESTION:  I thought you were saying it's -­20             QUESTION:  Your position would be the same.21             MR. KNEEDLER:  The same.  Yes.22             QUESTION:  Oh, well -­23             MR. KNEEDLER:  That's what I -- I'm sorry.24             QUESTION:  You scared me for a minute.25             MR. KNEEDLER:  No, no.  I -- I misspoke.7question? Because I'm really kind of confused about this.1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1             (Laughter.)2             MR. KNEEDLER:   I'm  sorry.   I  misspoke.   The3   position  would be exactly  the same  and -- and  for very4 5 6 7 8 91011   not have been the kind  of major Federal action that  mustsimilar reasons, that that's essentially a political decision, in the one case by Congress in your example, or -- or by the President.And -- and that's why Congress traditionally vests an authority such as this in the President because he is responsible for foreign relations and foreign trade.QUESTION:  But -- but in either  event, it would1213141516   part of  the context in which the agency is operating, but17   it would be presumptuous of the agency to take upon itself18   a --  a  determination  to evaluate  or  to  second  guess19   effectively the President's determination.20 QUESTION: Well, but -- but it wouldn't be a 21 question of second guessing, would it, if the agency 22 regulations in question could reduce somehow the -- the 23 impact that the -- the known action by the President, 24 who's pretty sure this was going to happen, would cause? 25 And -- and so it's sort of relevant, it seems to me,8be preceded by an EIS.          MR. KNEEDLER:  That's correct.1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005QUESTION:  That's your basic position.MR. KNEEDLER:   That's -- that's correct.   It's￼ 1   whether these rules issued by  the agency could, if  there2 had been an environmental impact statement, have been3 adjusted in such a way as to reduce the -- the4 environmental impact. Is there any relationship between 5   these  rules   and  the  environmental   impact  that  the 6   respondents are concerned about? 7             MR. KNEEDLER:  Two things  I'd like to say about 8   that.   The first  one is  that the  -- that  respondents' 9   claim in this case and the Ninth Circuit's holding in this10   case are  not premised on the  sort of tinkering  with the11   application and monitoring rules  that -- that you may  be12   referring to.  The --  the premise of the Ninth  Circuit's13   decision was that  -- that the President's lifting  of the14   moratorium  was  foreseeable  and therefore  FMCSA  had to15   evaluate  the  --  the much  broader  question  of whether16   Mexican trucks should be permitted to come in at all.17 QUESTION: No, but I mean, my point is it -- it 18 seems to me obvious that you don't have to evaluate in an192021222324   though, that  -- that the agency  might have been  able to25   refine  the  regulations  in  some way,  that  is  not  anenvironmental impact statement something that you have no power -­1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.QUESTION:  -- to  -- to remedy.MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.   As to your second point,9￼1 argument that respondents made to the agency. And under2   Vermont Yankee -- and this is critical to the operation of3 -- of NEPA and the corresponding Clean Air Act provisions4   is that  an agency  can only  evaluate or  -- or  identify5 6 7 8 9errors if they're called to its attention.          QUESTION:   When did respondents first make thispoint?  You say they didn't make it in -­          MR. KNEEDLER:  The -- the first place  that thispoint -- it  was really  just in  a sentence --  was in  a23 24 25into consideration effects that thehave the authority to avoid.          MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.10agency itself does notreply brief in the court of appeals that they -- that they1011   -- that they -- they said that the agency  might have been12   -- been able to come  up with some modified version  of -­13   of the regulations.14             But it's not  very realistic to think  that what15   the agency  could do -- could permissibly do -- could have16   a significant effect on -- on emissions because -­17             QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Kneedler, on -- on  that -­18   going to  that  point,  I mean,  that  goes  to  something19   Justice Scalia raised and I wanted to raise it too.  He -­20   he  expressed, as a premise  to his question  -- and I had21   assumed when I started out on this case -- that the agency22   does not have  to prepare an impact statement  which takes1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1234   Roman  (i).   One of  the  things the  agency  has got  to5   disclose  is  the  environmental  impact  of  the proposed6   action.  That  I understand.  They could  avoid that in -­7   theoretically in  -- in the general rule.  They could say,8   well, we won't take the  proposed action if it has a  very9   bad effect.   And that's consistent  with what he  assumedQUESTION: And -- and I'm looking -- by the way, I'monpage--whatisit--2aof--ofyourbrief where you set out the statute down at the bottom of the page,10   and what I assumed.11 But then you get to Roman (ii) and Roman (ii)12 says they've got to disclose any adverse environmental13   effects which  cannot be  avoided should  the proposal  be14   implemented.  And that seems to be broader.  That seems to15   say   if   your   proposal,  which   in   itself   may  be16 environmentally benign, is the trigger for action by other17 agencies or other people, which is not environmentally18   benign, you've got  to disclose the effects that will come19   about  when  you take  the  triggering action  even though20   you're  triggering  action  is  clean.    Am  I  --  am  I21   misreading that?22             MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, respondents have not relied23   on that  provision, but -- but  my -- my  understanding of24   that is that that refers -- that refers to effects that -­25   that are within the agency's control.111111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1             The -- the critical point -- and this -- this is 2   reflected  in the --  in the  regulations on page  4a, the3 things that an agency is responsible for taking account of4 under NEPA, are direct -- things that are directly caused5 or indirectly caused. And caused is the -- is the 6 operative word. And this Court said in the Metropolitan 7 Edison case that it's -- that -- that strict but-for 8   causation is not enough under NEPA.9 QUESTION: But if -- if that's the -- if -- if10 the -- if -- I'll call it (C)(ii) here -- is -- is being11 read in that way, then I take it what it means -- let's12 forget the presidential action here. Let's just take 13 conventional government action. If you had, let's say, 14 six Government agencies, each of which on a coordinated 15 basis was going to do something to bring about a result, 16 and the effect of the action of each one of those agencies 17 by itself really didn't amount to much, but the action of 18 all six together amounted to a very great deal 19 environmentally, there never would be an environmental 20 impact statement that would take into effect the21   cumulative action.22             MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.23             QUESTION:  Is -- is that fair to say?24 MR. KNEEDLER: And -- and I was just going to25   say there is a separate  requirement under the -- CEQ  has121111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 elaborate regulations that -- that flesh this out. And -­ 2 and CEQ has a regulation that the Ninth Circuit relied 3 upon and -- and respondents have -- have abandoned any4 5 6 7 8 9reliance on it, which is that an agency has to evaluate cumulative impacts. It has to -- it has to essentially evaluate the incremental contribution that its own action will make toward a -­          QUESTION:  Then why doesn't that apply here?               MR. KNEEDLER:   Because the --  the -- first  of10   all, the agency did that.  It evaluated its incremental -­11   its incremental impact.  What -- what it did -­12             QUESTION:  But I'm talking about the  cumulative13   effect.   I --  I thought  -- maybe  I misunderstood  what14151617   Environmental Quality reg, at some point they had  to takeyou've said.          MR. KNEEDLER:  It -- it --QUESTION:    I  thought  under  the  Council  of18192021222324 get a big thing. I thought you were saying that under the 25 Council on Environmental Quality regs, somewhere along the13into effect -- they had to disclose the cumulative effect. MR. KNEEDLER: Well, if you mean -- if you meanwith the -- the -­          QUESTION:    The  effect  of  all  the  agenciestogether in my hypothesis.  You've got six agencies.  Eachof them does a little thing.   Add the six together.   You1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   line somebody  has got to disclose  in an --  in an impact 2   statement -­ 3             MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, and -- and -- 4             QUESTION:  -- the cumulation. 5             MR. KNEEDLER:   Right, and  -- and what  -- what6 the-- 7             QUESTION:  So why wasn't it done here? 8             MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, the -- the agency  here was9 the only one taking action, and all the cumulative impact10 requirement requires it to do is to isolate what its 11 incremental contribution will be -­12 QUESTION: Well, that's under Roman (i), but 13 under Roman (ii) it's broader, and you said, I thought, 14 under the Council on Environmental Quality regs, at some 15 point you've got to disclose the cumulative effect of all16 of it. So on my hypothesis, it's -- when -- who -- what17   agency and when has to disclose the cumulative effect -­18             MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, if -- if there are -­19             QUESTION:  -- and why wasn't it done here?20 MR. KNEEDLER: If there are -- if there are two21   agencies  working  in tandem  --  see, the  --  again, the22   President -­23             QUESTION:  So you're saying -­24             MR. KNEEDLER:  -- the President -­25             QUESTION:  -- it -- it would have been done here141111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   but for the fact that the President is not an agency. 2             MR.  KNEEDLER:    If  two  agencies  --  if  two3 agencies are taking parallel action, they are supposed -­4 or coordinated action, they're supposed to coordinate5 the-­ 6             QUESTION:   Right, and you're saying because the 7   President is not an agency, that doesn't apply here. 8             MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.  Right.  And -- and -- 9             QUESTION:  Now,  does the -- does the Council on10 Environmental Quality regulation say that the -- that the11 disclosure of cumulative effect depends upon the action of12   many agencies as opposed to the actions of many persons to13   which an agency contributes?14 MR. KNEEDLER: It is -- it is -- it's15   addressed -­16             QUESTION:  Yes, but what is it?17 MR. KNEEDLER: -- more -- it -- it includes18 more -­19             QUESTION:  But is it --20             MR. KNEEDLER:   It's not  just limited to  other21   agencies, but there's an -­22             QUESTION:  Then why didn't it apply here?  We'll23   assume the  President is not an  agency.  Why  didn't that24   requirement apply here?25             MR. KNEEDLER:   The agency did comply  by saying151111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼this is  the context in which  we were acting.   What theysaid is we have no control.  And this is the -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   that.    So  that's  really  what  the  cumulative  impact 9   analysis requires is to  -- for the agency to  put its own10   action in context.11             But  where the agency's  own action is marginal,12   which is  the case here, it  can be expected  -- these are13 basically administrative undertakings by the agency,14 application forms, and -- and on-site inspections. That15 -- that where the agency's own action is going to 16 contribute so marginally to environmental impacts, the 17 rule -- the general rule of reason under -- under NEPA 18 does not require an agency to, for -- for example, conduct 19 a -- a nationwide study of Clean Air Act possible effects 20 of Mexican trucks in order to determine that its own21   contribution is going to be minimal.22 And -- and what -- what -- as I mentioned, the23 agency's contribution here arises simply from developing24 an application form, a -- a preapproval analysis, on-site25   analysis, of -- of the carrier in Mexico in most cases, or16QUESTION:  Yes.MR. KNEEDLER: -- literally language. We have no control over what the President is going to do. It projected -- it projected increases in traffic or -- or increases in trade that might -- might result or discussed1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1   --  or  on  paper,  and   then  follow-up  monitoring  and2 inspections. And the only real contribution to emissions3   that any of  that would have  are the -- are  the roadside4   inspections where  the engine might be -- will be idling a5 little bit while the truck is inspected and the agency 6 fully evaluated its contribution to increased emissions 7 for that and concluded that they would be negligible,89 10 11 12 13 14looked at in that way.  And neither  the Ninth Circuit norrespondents have ever challenged that.And as I -- as I mentioned, although the -- the Ninth Circuit treated the President's action as -- as a -­ a consequence of what the agency did, the respondents have receded from that position as well.And they have -- they have relied on this 15 appropriations provision, section 350, as it's been 16 referred to in this litigation, which required FMCSA to do 17 certain things before it could spend any money to approve 18 individual applications of carriers that would be eligible 19 under the -- under the President's lifting of the 20 moratorium. But section 350 reinforces our position21 22 23 24 25because it reinforces the proposition that the agency's role was limited to safety matters.          QUESTION:     Did  350   limit  itself   in  itsdirections to the agency to safety matters?          MR. KNEEDLER:   Yes.  There's not  -- there's no171111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 mention of -- of environment -- environmental issues in -­2   in it.  And in fact, what it did is it further constrained3 FMCSA's discretion. Whatever discretion -- and it -- and4   it  overrode  or  made more  strict  the  agency's initial5 6 7 8 9proposed regulations by requiring safety evaluations in Mexico and stringent evaluations afterward. It added some very strict requirements because Congress wanted to make sure that the agency was going to impose -­23 24 25it-­QUESTION:  I see.MR. KNEEDLER:   And the agency shall  include in18QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler?MR.

Does that  mean16   that an  action  taken by  the President  is  not a  majorkind of preliminary question?

KNEEDLER:  Because it  says include in every-- the agency in -- in the introductory part shall include in every recommendation or report on proposals or major16171819   350 serves to confine the  agency's discretion here.   And20   the   --  the  agency's  decision  that  an  environmental21   assessment was  all that  was necessary  and a  full-blown22   environmental  impact   statement  was  not   required  is23   reinforced in this case by the -- by decisions of a number24   of courts of appeals that  have said that where an  agency25   does not have discretion, it  does not have to prepare  an19case from the exemption of the President from -- from NEPAat all.1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005And the --  I -- I mentioned before that section￼1 environmental impact statement because the purposes of2 NEPA are really to inform the agency's own decision-making 3   process and  to inform the public so it can participate in 4   the agency's decision-making process. 5             Where the  agency essentially has  no discretion 6   about whether to -- to go forward, as the agency here  did7 not, then to require a full-blown environmental impact8 statement of -- of clean air issues, which are exceedingly 9   complex, before the  agency would go  -- could go  forward10   would  not further the  purposes of  -- of NEPA  and wouldonly serve, in fact, to slow down the process of complyingwith NAFTA.11121314151617 substantive requirement. But -- but in this case there 18 was really a need for expedition, and it's -- and that's 19 -- that's made evident here by the fact that the statute 20 that authorized the President to lift the moratorium 21 provided for the President to give notice and allow public 22 comment for that, but allowed him to waive that where 23 expeditious action was required. And when the President 24 looked at the moratorium in November of 2002, he 25 specifically invoked that provision, dispensed with20          QUESTION:    Well,  in  fact,  an  agency  couldproduce  an  EIS that  said  what  we  propose  to  do  isdisastrous and nevertheless go ahead, could it not?1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005MR.  KNEEDLER:    Yes,  yes.   NEPA  imposes  no￼1 further opportunity for public comment because he 2 determined that expeditious action was required.3 It's very much like this Court's decision in 4 Crosby several terms ago in that way because the -- 5 although here it's a subordinate Federal agency rather 6 than a State, but the result is to interfere with the 7 ability of the President to respond promptly to an 8 international disagreement that had arisen out of a 9 foreign trade agreement.10 I did want to spend just a moment on the Clean 11 Air Act conformity analysis point which the -- the 12 conclusion on that we think follows directly from the13141516 here, and the D.C.

Under those 17 regulations an -- an agency is required to conduct a 18 conformity analysis and to conform its action only where 19 its action causes emissions, but beyond that, where -- 20 where the emissions are subject to the agency'sconclusion on NEPA.          Under  --   under  EPA  regulations   that  werepromulgated in 1993, respondent doesn't challenge thempracticable  control and  where the  agency  will maintainthat control through continuing program authority -­21222324   regulations?25             MR.

Those are all things  that13   are beyond the agency's control.14 QUESTION: Mr. -- Mr. Kneedler, I -- I read the 15 regs the same way you do. The -- the interesting thing to 16 me was, although it's probably -- I guess it's academic 17 here is that the statute seems to be broader than the regs 18 because the -- the statute would -- would require 19 attention -- and I'm reading from page 45 of your -- your20212223   would not only cause but  contribute to a new air  quality24   -- to an air quality violation.

KNEEDLER:    Well,  I   suppose  under  the11   broadest reading,  but I think even that might -- might be12   a extensive  reading of the regulation.   And let  me also13   just say again  that respondents  have not challenged  the14151617   question  just  in displaying  my  ignorance of  the wholevalidity of the regulation.          QUESTION:  I know.QUESTION: May I -- may I ask this otherproblem?

WEISSGLASS:   Mr. Chief Justice, and  may it12   please the Court:13             Congress  gave FMCSA  important choices  to make14   about safety before  any trucks come over  the border from15161718 rules are made more stringent, fewer trucks will be able 19 to meet the requirements and those that do will be newer. 20 QUESTION: But this wasn't your argument. Your 21 argument was, as -- as I understood it, that the reason 22 the EIS had to be prepared was not because there would be 23 any substantial environmental impact from the nature of 24 the safety standards, but because no trucks at all can 25 come in until -- until the agency comes out with this -­26Mexico.

WEISSGLASS:  -- no  trucks can come in untilthe agency makes these safety choices.QUESTION: Okay. Therefore, that's a consequence of the agency action. Therefore, the agency has to do an EIS.          MR.  WEISSGLASS:    That  is  correct.   And  inaddition, the -­1011121314151617   Commission and there are others who are competing  for the18   same license,  and he announces that  if he is  denied the19   license and the license is  given to somebody else, he  is20   going  to unleash  a flood  of trucks around  the country,21   pouring out emissions and -- and  greatly affecting the -­22   the air  quality throughout  the country.   Does the  FCC,23   knowing that  this is going to be the consequence of their24 granting the license to this particular individual -- does25   it have to do an environmental impact statement?27QUESTION: Now, just let me ask.

But now what the 14 statute says is every license that's issued for safety -­ 15 safety purposes -- has to be a stamp that you put in the 16 car, and then there's a rule that says, no stamp shall 17 issue until the Post Office Department certifies it will 18 be red or blue. All right? And moreover, there could be 19 an environmental impact just from the red and blue. I 20 mean, one reflects the --21 Now, the Post Office knows that if it tells you 22 what color it is, then they'll have it, and if they have 23 it, they give out the license. And if they give out the 24 license, the mad millionaire is going to let loose smoke 25 throughout the Nation. Does that mean that the Post291111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9Office Department has to write an environmental impact statement about the mad millionaire? No. The answer is clearly no. Isn't it?          But the only problem is your theory doesn't tellme why.          MR. WEISSGLASS:   The -- the reason is this.  In-- in this case the agency has significant choices to makeabout safety.  Congress -­QUESTION: And so does the Post Office. It's 10 going to be red or blue. Now, the relationship between 11 the red and blue choice and environmental being wrecked 12 through the smoke of the mad millionaire is zero. And 13 now, you want to say that's not true with this safety 14 regulation. So explain why.15 MR. WEISSGLASS: Because it's -- it's what 16 Congress -- it's how Congress set up the -- the situation. 17 Congress said that no trucks come in until the agency 18 makes these choices and Congress gave the agency 19 discretion about those choices and those choices will 20 determine which trucks come in and how many and therefore 21 the environmental effects.22 Now, just because the -- there is -- there is 23 another actor that has to make decisions and has to take24 action before there will be any environmental effects does25   not remove this from major Federal action.301111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9That's the Robertson case that this Court decided where the agency has to decide yes or no to issue a permit.

And it's the older trucks that 20 are more polluting. And -- and -­21 QUESTION: No, but can't the -- isn't the 22 agency's discretion to determine whether older trucks come 23 in or not a discretion which is supposed to be exercised 24 on the basis of safety considerations rather than 25 environmental considerations?321111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005QUESTION: They -- they were not part of the -­￼ 1             MR.

I don't think anybody said that 9   this  would have been a  major Federal action requiring an10 environmental impact statement if there were nothing11   involved except whether  these safety  rules are going  to12   cause more pollution or not.  Your -- what you're using to13   require the EIS is the fact that, boom, once they come out14   with their  safety rules, floods  of -- of  Mexican trucks15   come into the country.16 MR.

Even if you assume that some 20 trucks are definitely going to come over, what the agency 21 does is -- is going to have a big effect.22             The agency specifically says  that the rules are23   going to target high-risk trucks  -- and this is from  the24 environmental assessment -- to, quote, bring them into25 compliance with United States safety and environmental331111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 laws. The agency knew that there was this correlation 2 between safety and the environment. And we're talking 3 about tens of thousands of trucks, and a Mexican fleet 4 that is skewed much older than the U.S. fleet. 5             QUESTION:  Well,  don't -- don't the  rules have 6   to  be such  that American trucks  and Mexican  trucks are 7   treated alike? 8             MR.

WEISSGLASS: The -- the agency said that it 19 was going to target high-risk trucks to be in compliance 20 with safety and environmental laws. And because the rules 21 only deal with safety, that's a concession that safety22 23 24 25choices affect the environment. Nothing else needed to be told to the agency.          QUESTION:  Well -­          QUESTION:  So your -- your answer to my question361111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 911             MR.

You say the agency already knew it.               MR. WEISSGLASS:  The -- right.   The agency knew     it and the  public was not required to cause the agency to     connect the dots.               QUESTION:  Knew -- knew what?               MR. WEISSGLASS:  The agency  knew that there wasa--               QUESTION:   That  -- that  high-risk trucks  are10   what?  More polluting?131415161718   attention as  one of the things that they should take into19   account in -- in their safety rules?20             MR.  WEISSGLASS:   The --  the agency had  it -­21   said it in  its environmental assessment  and what I  just22   said.   And the public commented that the older trucks are23   more polluting.   And the agency  admits it's a  matter of24   common sense that the older trucks are less safe.25             QUESTION:  The  agency did take it  into account37that there's a correlation -­          QUESTION:  Between pollution and age.MR.

I had thought that what you're 7   challenging is  that may well be  true, that --  that just8 from the content of the rules, there's no significant 9 impact. However, the rules trigger the presidential10   action which  lets in the Mexican  trucks and that  is the11   significant  environmental   impact.    Wasn't   that  the12   accurate -- an accurate description of your case?13             MR.

But that's not  the issue.The issue really is the agency for me.MR. WEISSGLASS:  Okay.          QUESTION:   I mean,  where --  where before  theagency was it raised?          MR. WEISSGLASS:   The -- the agency, as  I said,agreed  there's this  correlation between  safety and  the1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   it  an  obligation   of  the  agency  to   consider  every2 significant aspect of the environmental effects of its 3   action.   This is not a  situation like in  Vermont Yankee4 where someone raised an issue about unchartered territory 5   and refused  to clarify.   The  agency has  an affirmative 6   obligation to take  this into account  because it had  the 7   predicate facts in front of it. 8             QUESTION:  All right.  Are you saying  we didn't 9   raise  it before the agency?  The reason we didn't is that10 we didn't have to. All we had to do was raise it when we11   appealed from the agency.  Is that your answer?12             MR. WEISSGLASS:  You said it  much better than I13   could.  Yes.14             QUESTION:  Okay.15             QUESTION:  But  if that's your answer,  then you16   didn't raise  it, and then the  question would be  does an17   agency have  to have figured  out here that  its different18   alternatives in front  of it  might have had  differential19202122232425environmental impacts that they didn't take account of.

WEISSGLASS:  Because -­               QUESTION:  What -- what -- go ahead.               MR. WEISSGLASS:  Because -- thank you, Mr. Chief               Because in the  joint appendix at page  193, the 9   agency admits  this correlation,  and it  was also  record10   evidence before the agency that the Mexican  fleet is much11   older than  the U.S. fleet, that the older trucks are more12   polluting.  And so it stands to  reason -- and -- and this13   is what  the  agency  has  to  do  when  it's  considering1234567   Justice.8          QUESTION:   -- and try to  -- try to  figure outwhether it is yes.14151617   until the  petition for rehearing  in the  Ninth --  Ninth18   Circuit to raise it before that court?environmental effects is  look at what its  safety choicesare going to do in terms of the environment.QUESTION:   Well, why  did --  why did  you wait19             MR. WEISSGLASS:  It wasn't rehearing.  It was on20   a  reply  brief.    It was  in  response  to  the agency's21 admission in its opposition brief that the stringency of22   the standards does have this effect.23             QUESTION:   What -- here  is -- here's  what the24 Ninth Circuit said. DOT's assessment that its regulations25   will cause  emissions below  the amounts  specified in  40411111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   C.F.R. 93,  thus excusing  it from  making a  conformitory2 determination is based on the predicted emissions in its3 EA. As we have already determined, however, DOT failed to4 conduct a reliable environmental analysis because of its 5   illusory  distinction   between   the   effects   of   the6 regulations themselves, which is what we've been talking7 about, and the effects of the presidential rescission of 8   the moratorium. 9             It seems  to me  it was  essential to the  Ninth10 Circuit's decision that you have to take into account, 11 before -- before you win, the -- the impact of the 12 President's decision. The Ninth Circuit did not base it 13 just on the effects of the regulations themselves.14             MR. WEISSGLASS:   The --  and the Ninth  Circuit15   also said  that the  -- the  environmental assessment  was16   inadequate   for,   quote,   not   considering  additional17   alternatives  such   as,  for   example,  proposing   more18 stringent controls on incoming Mexican trucks. The Ninth19 Circuit clearly recognized that there was this correlation20   between a stringency  of the  rules and the  environmental21   effects.22             Now, it's very important  to understand that the23   way Congress set this up  was it's not that the  agency is24 somehow overriding a presidential decision. There are two25 separate and independent decisions here. The President421111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 has authority over trade issues the way Congress gave him 2   that authority.   But the Congress  at the same  time said3 that the agency has authority over safety issues. These 4   are two separate things. 5             QUESTION:  Yes, it's true that the Ninth Circuit 6   said just what you  said it said,  but it was quoting  the7 general requirement, I think, which exists in the way you 8   describe it.  And here, I guess the  question is, is given9 their environmental assessment, had they failed to fulfill10 that requirement and so it would require somebody to point11 out to them, look at this environmental assessment. This12 environmental assessment is not adequate to fulfill that13   requirement  that we  all know  exists.   Now,  what about14   that?15161718   now is the agency is  considering alternative A, B, or  C.19   They  all  involve   safety.    They're  likely   to  have20   differential impacts  on smoke and so forth.  And now they21 have in front of them an environmental assessment, and the22 environmental assessment explains to them why they don't23 have to do more than they've done in respect to just what 24 we're talking about. Everyone agrees that the requirement 25 is what you said. The Ninth Circuit says it. Who told43          MR.  WEISSGLASS:   The -- I'm  not quite  sure Iunderstand the question.1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005QUESTION:   Remember, what  we're talking  about￼ 1   the agency  that this EA is  inadequate when it  tells you 2   you don't have to do more  in respect to that to assessing 3   one, two, and three, you know, et cetera. 4             MR. WEISSGLASS:  The -- the agency -­ 5             QUESTION:  I think that's -­ 6             MR.  WEISSGLASS:     --   issued   the  --   the7 environmental assessment and then asked for comment on it 8   after  it  had  already issued  the  interim  final rules. 9   There were  comments to the agency, and as I've said, they10   didn't  specifically  say  this.     But  the  agency  was11 challenged in the Ninth Circuit and that issue was raised.12   And that is enough because the -- the agency had before it13 all the predicate facts to take into account the 14 relationship between the stringency of the safety rules 15 and the environment. It knew the effects of its actions.16171819   NEPA  doesn't require a  citizen to  come in and  tell the20   agency what  its options are.   It requires the  agency toIt specifically said  that high-risk trucks are  both more-- more polluting and less safe.It  had to do that.   That's what NEPA requires.take that action.          QUESTION:   Does this agency have  the authority21222324   an older truck and will pollute  more?  Is that within the25   scope of what the agency can do?to exclude a perfectly safe truck because in its view it's1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 2000544￼1             MR.

WEISSGLASS:   The agency does not  have that17 obligation because NEPA does not require substantive18   decisions.  But what NEPA requires is that the agency take19   a look at those effects.20             QUESTION:  All right.   Then -- excuse me.   Let21   me -- let me ask you this question.22             Let's assume  the agency  concluded that  on all23   significant safety  factors, the  old trucks  are just  as24   good as  the new trucks.

The agency cannot keep out the old trucks for 2   that reason alone.  My  question is, does the agency  have3 to prepare an impact statement saying we're letting in the4 old as well as the new, but in letting in the old, we're 5   letting in  more highly polluting trucks?  Do they have to6 prepare that statement even though their action is, and 7   legally can be, the same with respect to the old as to the8 new? 9             MR. WEISSGLASS:   Yes, as long as the agency has10   --  has  a  significant  choice  to  make about  what  the11   standards should be.12             QUESTION:     Suppose  under   Justice  Souter's13   question, the agency has no choice  and it must let in the14   trucks.  Does it still have to prepare the EIS?15             MR. WEISSGLASS:  If the agency has no choice -­16             QUESTION:  Or the EA.17             MR. WEISSGLASS:  -- then -- then under  a number18 of circuit court cases, which the Government cited, the 19 agency would not have to do it. And that's an open 20 question for this Court, but the Court doesn't need to 21 reach it.2223   think, suppose the agency is  trying to choose between two24   headlight inspections a year or one.   All right.  Now, if25   you have two a year, in fact, there will be  fewer trucks.471111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005QUESTION:  No.   But you're -- you're  saying, I￼ 1   If you go to one a year, there might be more trucks coming 2   in and then you will have more pollution. 3             Now, if that's a significant  difference, then I 4   guess  the agency does  have to go  into it.   But if they 5   have an EA  that tells them, you know, it's not that big a 6   deal because  they're going to be about the same number of7 trucks regardless, then I would think the burden would be8 on the environmentalists to show that that's really wrong. 9   And I  think that's  the kind  of argument you're  making.10   And  you're telling me  that it's so  obviously wrong that11   even though you didn't raise it in the agency, they should12   have figured it out.  Is -- is that where we are?13             MR.  WEISSGLASS:    That  --  I  think  that  is14   accurate about where  we are.  And -- and the fact is that15   there  were  numerous  comments to  the  agency  about the16   safety things  that it  should have  done and  didn't, and17   there are numerous -- there's numerous -- there's a lot of18   room  between  the  standards that  are  being  imposed on19   trucks  coming  over  the  border   from  Mexico  and  the20   standards that are in -- on U.S. trucks.21             The agency  could have  made choices that  would22   affect  this, that would affect the safety, and that would23   also  affect  the environment.    And the  agency concedes24   that.  The agency concedes  it had the discretion, and  it25   concedes that this could affect the environment.481111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1             What  the  agency does  is  say that  that's all 2   about  the  President  because the  President  lifted  the 3   moratorium.    But  where that  is  a  mistake is  because 4   Congress was the -- was the body that said when trucks can 5   come over, and it gave  both the President and the  agency6 separate authority over that. So it all goes back to 7 Congress in making this -- this foreign commerce decision. 8 Now, before I finish my argument, I did want to 9 talk about the Clean Air Act because this is very10 important. Justice Souter raised this point. The way the 11 agency reads the regulations, it -- it would -- it would 12 be completely out of accord with the language of the13   statute which --14             QUESTION:  Did -- did you challenge the regs?15             MR.

WEISSGLASS:   No, because  we read the  regs19   very differently  than the agency.   The agency --  the -­20   the  way the  -- the  particular regulation reads  is that21 22 23 24 25it's not just where -­          QUESTION:  Where -- where are you?  On 46?          QUESTION:  8a, page 8a, isn't it?          QUESTION:  46 of your brief or where?          MR. WEISSGLASS:  Actually the -- the critical -­491111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 the critical regulation that the Government raised was in2 its reply brief. It's on page 17 of the -- of the reply3 brief. 4             And -- and there is the definition of continuing5 program responsibility because once the -- the -- you get 6   past the cause  point -- and EPA is  very clear that under 7   the Clean  Air Act, it's but-for causation.  It says that. 8   And so we clearly have that here. 9             Then the question  is whether  the agency has  a10 continuing program responsibility. And there are two11 sentences that are separate formulations of when there is12 that responsibility. The -- the Government relies solely13   on the  first sentence, which we  do not rely on.   That's14   when an agency requires some activities.15             But  the   second  sentence   is  the   critical16 sentence, which is when an agency, quote, takes actions 17 itself or imposes conditions that result in air pollutant 18 emissions. Well, in this case, the agency is -- is taking 19 action and imposing conditions that are going to result in 20 emissions because under 350, no trucks come in at all21 until the agency makes these choices and because in making22 the choices, it's imposing conditions that are going to be23 absolutely determinative as to what the -- the pollutants24   -- how much pollution there's going  to be.  If the agency25   ratchets up  its -- its controls, there's going to be less501111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼pollution.  The agency admits that.          QUESTION:  I  thought they  were relying on  the 1 2 3 4   That's certainly  what they  raised in their  -- in  their5 argument here, which -- which makes whatever this other6 regulation says quite irrelevant because it's a definition 7   of emissions.  And it says that to be an indirect emission 8   within the  act, the Federal agency  must have --  must be9 able to practicably control and maintain control over the10 emissions due to a continuing program responsibility.11             MR.   WEISSGLASS:     That's   right,  and   the12 regulation I've just read is the definition of continuing13 program responsibility. The agency clearly has a 14 continuing program responsibility here because as it's 15 enforcing the regs that it -- that it writes, it's going 16 to determine how much pollution there is. And it clearly 17 practicably controls the emissions because, as I said, 18 both without some choices, there's going to be no trucks 19 and once the agency makes the choices, those choices are 20 going to determine how much pollution comes in because 21 that's how many trucks and what type are coming in.22 QUESTION: Well, I -- I guess that any -- any 23 Federal licensing agency for -- for automobiles or 24 anything else would -- would come within this and would 25 have to -- you know, if I don't issue a license, I can51regulation on page 8a of the Government's principal brief.1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 practicably control the -- the amount of emissions, even 2 though the agency is not a -- an emissions approving 3   agency.

KNEEDLER     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR.  KNEEDLER:     Several  things,   Mr.  ChiefThe -- the critical point here is that the20 agency had no discretion to deny certification to Mexican21 trucks that were eligible under -- under the President's22 lifting of the moratorium if they satisfied the -- the 23 requirement that they'd be willing and able to comply with 24 the -- with the statutory standards. So the agency was 25 really acting under two imperatives. One is its521111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   preexisting  organic   statute  and  then   secondly,  the2 President's lifting of a moratorium that required the -­3 the Government to live up to its obligations under NAFTA. 4             QUESTION:    What  --  I'd  like  to  hear  your5 response to the argument, which I didn't realize they were6 making independently, that just based on the agency's 7   available choices, it  could have made the  safety -- have8 different safety regulations. That was a sufficient 9   effect on the environment that they had to do a -­10 MR. KNEEDLER: They did not -- they did not --11   what  -- what  they're really  arguing is that  the agency12 should have considered some other alternative. The agency13 analyzed essentially two alternatives, go forward under14 our existing regulations -- again, these are procedural,15 not substantive regulations, just regulations designed to16 identify whether carriers satisfy substantive standards -­17   either to go forward under  -- under preexisting or --  or18   introduce new ones.19             The  respondents  never   said  to  the  agency,20 there's a third alternative. You can make your new 21 regulations even more stringent and here's what you could 22 do. And in fact, even now, they don't identify what23 24 25further strengths -­          QUESTION:  They're  -- they're making  basicallythe argument you said they waived.531111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1             MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.2             QUESTION:  You know, I  mean, that's been pretty3   much our  whole  discussion.   And I  think  on that,  the4   Government  says,   well,  they're  right   in  principle.5 They're saying -- I mean, if in fact an agency has a6 choice, A, B, or C, and if you choose A, there's a lot of7   smoke; B,  a little  smoke; and  C, no  smoke, well,  they8   ought to go  analyze it under an  EIS.  I think  you agree9 with that.10             MR. KNEEDLER:  But --11             QUESTION:   But you're  saying, well, they never12   made that point.13             MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.14             QUESTION:   They said,  but it's  so obvious  we15 didn't have to make it, and besides, when we got to the 16 Ninth Circuit, at least in the reply brief, we did make 17 it.181920212223 agency -- the agency did an EA in order to determine it 24 didn't have to produce an environmental impact statement. 25 If they were wrong on that, that should have been called54is-­to that?MR. KNEEDLER:   Yes.  Well, the  important thingQUESTION:  All  right.  So what's  your responseMR. KNEEDLER: The -- the -- first of all, the1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 to their attention on this precise point, specifically2 that the agency should have adopted an even more stringent 3   alternative.    And  it's  --  and even  now,  they  don't 4   identify one  that the agency could do that wouldn't be -­ 5   essentially  be  a pretext,  Justice  Souter, as  you were6 suggesting, that would be consistent with their duty to7 let in trucks and -- and still have -- have more 8   flexibility.9 What they quote for this is on page 193 of the10 joint appendix in the environmental assessment. It's11   important to recognize that that is a portion of the -- of12 the environmental assessment that repeats that our own13 actions, including the inspections, are not going to have14   a substantial  impact on the environment.  But even so, we15   can -- we  can mitigate that tiny impact, and it's in that16   context where  the agency says, we  can try to  screen out17   the  dirtier  trucks.     And   there's  a  reference   to18   environment.   It's unclear what it means, but I think two19 pages later the court identifies that there could be leaks20 from a truck that would be identified during an inspection21   they  could  turn over  to  environmental people  from the22   State.  So it's focused on a very narrow question, whether23   -- whether  the inspections  would --  would increase  the24   emissions.25             And respondents have never really challenged the551111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 notion, which is what's being addressed here, that -- that2 the increased inspections under these rules would have an 3   impact on -- on the environment.4 I did want to address the -- the Clean Air Act 5   regulations.    We  did not  raise  the  regulation that's 6   quoted  on page 17  of our brief.   We relied,  as Justice 7   Scalia  pointed  out,   on  the  --  under   the  indirect 8   emissions.   As  I mentioned,  the --  the  agency has  no9 continuing control. It isn't the control at the outset.10 It's control over the subsequent activities, which is the11 word in the regulation, and the -- this agency, a safety­ 12 certifying agency, has no continuing control over where 13 these trucks will travel in the U.S., even whether the -­ 14 even whether the particular trucks come into the U.S. -­1516   Kneedler.171819202122232425CHIEF  JUSTICE  REHNQUIST:     Thank  you,   Mr.The case is submitted.          (Whereupon,  at  12:03  p.m.,  the  case in  theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 2000556
