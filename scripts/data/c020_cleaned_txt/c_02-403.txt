Christine Beaumont.Mr. Clement.ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENTON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:This Court's campaign finance cases consistentlyemphasize the fundamental distinction between contributions and expenditures. Direct transfers of cash to a candidate pose unique risks of the appearance of corruption or the threat of actual corruption while, at the same time, imposing less significant interference with First Amendment values. And so this Court's jurisprudence consistently recognizes that there is less rigorous scrutiny on limitations on contributions relative to limitations on expenditures.The court below lost sight of that fundamental dichotomy. It held that corporations of the type that this Court exempted from the general limitations on corporate expenditures in Massachusetts Citizens for Life were equally exempt from the broad prohibitions on31111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 corporate contributions to candidates. That reasoning2 ignores this Court's decision in Massachusetts Citizens3 for Life itself, which specifically distinguished between4 the expenditures and contributions of nonprofit5 corporations.6 More fundamentally, the decision below ignores7 this Court's decision in National Right to Work Committee.8 There this Court held that the broad limitations on9 corporate contributions and the specific limitations on10 solicitation embedded in that broad prohibition were11 constitutional against a First Amendment challenge.12 QUESTION: Mr. Clement, the Government does --13 does not challenge the exemption of this not-for-profit14 corporation from expenditure limitations?15 MR. CLEMENT: That's right, Justice Scalia. The16 court below addressed both an expenditure issue and a17 prohibition issue with respect to contributions, and the18 Government only took up the prohibition on contributions.19 So that is the only issue before the Court.20 I think it's important, though, to understand21 that that is a distinction that the court below placed22 insufficient emphasis on because that is a distinction23 between contributions and expenditures that underlies the24 last quarter century of this Court's campaign finance25 jurisprudence.41111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 And in National Right to Work Committee itself,2 this Court recognized that the broad prohibitions on3 contributions applied to all corporations, including those4 like National Right to Work Committee itself that were5 without great financial resources.6 Nonetheless, in the particular context of7 corporate contributions to candidates, this Court held8 that it would not second guess Congress' decision that a9 broad, prophylactic approach was necessary when corruption10 was the evil feared.11 QUESTION:12 Massachusetts -- the13 have a right to make14 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think it would, Chief15 Justice Rehnquist, and I think that where I would point to16 first is your dissent in that case because in that case in17 your dissent, you made the argument that National Right to18 Work Committee was essentially the same as Massachusetts19 Citizens for Life. And the majority, in responding to20 that argument, didn't draw any particular distinction21 between National Right to Work Committee and Massachusetts22 Citizens for Life, but rather drew a firm distinction23 between the level of scrutiny that applies to limitations24 on contributions and the level of scrutiny that applies to25 limitations on expenditures.51111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005Do you think after the decision in Massachusetts case, the NRWC would independent expenditures?￼1 So I would read that decision as saying that the2 critical distinction is not the differences among the3 types of corporations with respect to contribution bans,4 but is the fact that contribution bans are much more5 readily approved under First Amendment analysis than6 expenditure bans.7 And National Right to Work Committee obviously8 wasn't the last word on that subject. This Court9 reaffirmed the validity of a broad, prophylactic approach10 to corporate contributions both in National Conservative11 Political Action Committee and in Massachusetts Citizens12 for Life itself. Particularly, in light of Massachusetts13 Citizens for Life, a ban on corporate contributions by14 nonprofits does not impose significant burdens on First15 Amendment interests.16 In the particular context of this type of17 corporation, the corporation is free to engage in18 unlimited spending on elections through the corporate19 form, and the individual respondents are free to give20 unlimited contributions to North Carolina Right to Life.21 In addition and equally important, the individual members22 of North Carolina Right to Life are free to give23 contributions to the candidates of their choice up to the24 constitutionally valid contribution limits.25 Accordingly, this case doesn't involve the right61111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 to associate together or the right to associate with2 candidates of someone's individual choosing, but only the3 right to assemble together collectively to give money to4 candidates of an organization's collective choosing. And5 even that rather attenuated First Amendment interest is6 only affected to the extent that a corporation must direct7 its contributions through a separate segregated fund with8 enhanced disclosure and reporting and bookkeeping9 requirements.10 QUESTION: Why -- why is that an attenuated11 First Amendment right? Isn't that the right that enables12 the formation of political parties, people forming13 together in order to collectively give money to particular14 candidates?15 MR. CLEMENT: Well, certainly in -- in the first16 point, parties are subject to a different type of17 regulation under the campaign finance laws.18 But secondly --19 QUESTION: Well, it may well be, but -- but I --20 I wouldn't shrug off as inconsequential the importance of21 individuals being able to band together to support22 individual candidates. That's the whole basis for our --23 our party system.24 MR. CLEMENT: And -- and I don't want to suggest25 that there's no First Amendment interest on the other side71111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 of -- of the argument in this case, but what I did mean to2 suggest is that interest is less significant than the3 interest in individuals banding together to make4 expenditures that they might otherwise not be able to5 make.6 And I think even in the party context, this7 Court recognized that distinction in the Colorado8 Republican cases where it held that limitations on what9 the -- the party can spend to support a candidate are not10 subject to limitation, but what -- but there -- but there11 are valid limitations on what the party can contribute to12 a candidate of its choosing.13 Now, in contrast to the rather minimal First14 Amendment interests that are interfered with by section15 441b, it plays an important role in safeguarding the16 integrity of the election process. This Court in -- in17 National Right to Work Committee already has recognized18 that corporate contributions pose a risk of the reality19 and appearance of corruption and that a broad,20 prophylactic limitation on all corporations, including21 those without great financial resources, is an appropriate22 response to that threat.23 All corporations, regardless of their size, also24 pose risks of circumvention and of undermining the25 workability of candidate disclosure requirements.81111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 As this Court recognized in Cedric Kushner2 Promotions against King, the whole point of a corporation,3 its basic purpose and fundamental reason for -- for4 existing is to create legal separateness between the5 individuals that form and run the corporation and the6 artificial corporate entity itself.7 Giving such an artificial entity the right to8 contribute in its own name, independent of the individuals9 that underlie the corporation, obviously poses a distinct10 risk to a campaign finance system that is based largely on11 individual contribution limits. Section 441b addresses12 that risk by requiring that those contributions be made13 through a segregated fund subject to enhanced bookkeeping14 and disclosure requirements.15 Those bookkeeping and disclosure requirements,16 in turn, make the campaign disclosure forms that17 individual candidates have to file work in a meaningful18 fashion. If those candidate disclosure forms simply19 revealed that the candidate received money from an20 artificial entity with either an ambiguous name or what21 this Court in Citizens Against Rent Control v. Berkeley22 termed a seductive name that tends to conceal the true23 identity and true source of the funds, then those campaign24 finance forms -- or disclosure forms will not provide25 meaningful information.91111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 If, on the other hand, 441b makes the underlying2 corporations use a segregated fund that discloses the3 individual sources of the contributions, then the4 disclosure forms can work in a meaningful fashion.5 I think it bears emphasis, as this Court6 recognized in Massachusetts Citizens for Life, that the7 distinction between contributions and expenditures applies8 with full force in the context of nonprofit organizations.9 A limitation on expenditures can prevent an organization's10 members, who might otherwise not have the resources to11 reach a certain audience, to pool their resources together12 to reach that audience.13 There is no comparable function or benefit from14 the pooling of individual candidate contributions. The15 individual candidates themselves can perform that pooling16 function by assembling together candidate contributions of17 whatever size in order to reach an audience or to engage18 in political speech.19 The intermediate pooling function that the20 nonprofit corporation serves can only benefit by either21 circumventing the individual contribution requirements or22 assembling an aggregate contribution of a sufficient size23 to potentially capture the attention of a candidate for24 purposes of a quid pro quo. To be sure, the same25 provisions of the campaign finance laws allow corporations101111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 to assemble funds in -- in aggregate amounts through a2 segregated fund, but only with the additional safeguards3 that are imposed, including enhanced disclosure4 requirements.5 Congress, in adopting section 441b, drew an6 important distinction between corporations and their7 ability to contribute and individuals. In the expenditure8 context, the limitations on corporate expenditures stand9 in stark contrast to the general right of individuals to10 engage in 1112 corporate13 Congress addresses the threat of individual contributions14 through dollar amounts. It addresses the distinct risks15 of corporate contributions through the requirement of a16 segregated fund, higher limits, and enhanced disclosure17 requirements.18 Respondents effectively ask this Court to19 disregard and second guess Congress' decision to treat20 corporations differently from individuals for purposes of21 candidate contributions. With respect, I think22 essentially respondents ask this Court to treat North23 Carolina Right --24 QUESTION: Can you summarize briefly what the25 enhanced disclosure requirements are?111111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005unlimited independent expenditures.But no one has a right to engage in unlimited -- in unlimited contributions to candidates.￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. CLEMENT: Certainly, Chief Justice Rehnquist. The -- the main difference is that in the context of a segregated fund, all -- both all incoming contributions to the segregated fund and all disbursements must be disclosed.QUESTION: You're talking about PACs. Right?MR. CLEMENT: PACs. I mean, the PACs generally -- there are segregated funds in the particular context of corporations and labor unions.QUESTION: And the donor is listed.MR. CLEMENT: The donor is listed. There are specific provisions for very small donations where the name only goes to the FEC and is not publicly disclosed. But there's a -- but really, everything that comes in and comes out of the segregated fund is traceable either by the FEC or through the public in disclosure requirements.In the context of the corporation generally, only -- only donations that are given over $200 and for the express purpose of -- of political activity have to be disclosed. And that does create a significant loophole.In the --QUESTION: Mr. Clement, is this -- is this section 441b related or affected in any way by the McCain- Feingold legislation?MR. CLEMENT: Justice O'Connor, it really isn't,121111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425at least as this case comes to this Court. The prohibitions on corporate contributions have been in the law since 1907 and have been left completely unaffected by the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act.It is true that certain limitations on electioneering activity, which is a new term introduced into the law by the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act, do apply to corporations. So in considering challenges to the McCain-Feingold legislation, this Court may have to consider the restrictions on corporationsengaged in expenditures and activities, but not --QUESTION: But at case is unaffected by that. MR. CLEMENT: Thethese new electioneeringleast the issue here in thisissue of corporate￼contributions is miraculously unaffected by the many reforms that are put in place by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act.(Laughter.)MR. CLEMENT: In the end --QUESTION: What is the -- what is the limitationof the PAC? How much can they contribute, say, to a Senator?MR. CLEMENT: A -- a political action committee or any segregated fund can give $5,000.131111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 QUESTION: This -- this -- you're saying that2 this particular kind of organization can't contribute3 directly, but it could set up a -- what you call a4 segregated fund, which I was thinking of as a PAC. And so5 if that segregated fund now wants to make a contribution6 to Senator Smith for his reelection campaign, is there a7 limit as to how much they can give? I'd think so.8 MR. CLEMENT: There is indeed, Justice Breyer.9 It's $5,000.10 QUESTION: $5,000.11 MR. CLEMENT: And two points of emphasis just on12 that question. One is that respondents here don't just13 have the right to set up a segregated fund, but they've14 actually already done that. They've already set up a15 segregated fund. And I know that this Court in16 Massachusetts Citizens for Life emphasized that there are17 unique restrictions and burdens on setting up a segregated18 fund, and I think that's true in the context of19 expenditures.20 But I do think it's easy to exaggerate the21 burdens that are imposed in setting up a segregated fund.22 Although a segregated fund is like a PAC, there's no23 requirement that they have separate offices or separate24 officers. They have to have a distinct leadership and --25 and -- but it can be the same leadership as the141111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425corporation itself.QUESTION: I mean, could they have two members? MR. CLEMENT: I don't know of any particularlimit on -- on the members.But the point is all that's really required issegregation of funds and keeping it separate. It's not an onerous requirement. And I think it's no accident that in the four cases that this Court has had that involved a nonprofit corporation, National Right to Work Committee, Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Austin against Michigan Chamber of Commerce, and this case, all four of those nonprofits had already set up segregated funds before the case got to this Court. So I don't think, at least in the contribution context, that those are onerous requirements.QUESTION: Well --QUESTION: In Massachusetts Citizens for Life, there was a separate PAC?MR. CLEMENT: There was. This Court in footnote 8 suggested that that wasn't dispositive of its reasoning because other -- other entities could set -- be in a position that were similar to Massachusetts Citizens for Life, might not be able to afford those burdens. But Massachusetts Citizens --QUESTION: But the Court did say for that type of -- for that type of corporation, not a commercial151111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 corporation, that was burdensome and unnecessary because2 the risk of corruption for that kind of corporation was3 significantly less than for commercial corporations. And4 that would apply here as well. If the -- if the evil is5 corruption, I'm buying the candidate by my dollars, then6 that risk is less for an advocacy organization. Is that7 -- isn't --8 MR. CLEMENT: I don't want to suggest that the9 -- that it may not be true that the risks are slightly10 less in the context of a nonprofit advocacy corporation11 than in the context of something like General Motors.12 But I think in the particular context of13 candidate contributions by corporations, this Court has14 repeatedly decided that it's willing to accept a broad,15 prophylactic approach and to limit all corporate16 contributions, including contributions by corporations17 without great financial resources. The Court said as much18 in National Right to Work Committee. It repeated that19 again in National Conservative Political Action Committee,20 but I think most tellingly, it said that in Massachusetts21 Citizens for Life itself.22 And in particular, if you look at footnote 13 of23 the Massachusetts Citizens for Life decision, the Court24 there specifically said that it understood that25 Massachusetts Citizens for Life would continue to be161111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 subjected to the National Right to Work Committee regime2 for purposes of its contributions, and it was talking3 about the fact that it didn't have -- that Massachusetts4 Citizens for Life, for example, didn't have shareholders.5 But it was quick to -- to reinforce that that didn't mean6 that it didn't have members for purposes of National Right7 to Work Committee that it could solicit, subject of course8 to the overall limit that it could not give direct9 contributions to candidates.10 QUESTION: That was an assumption in the case.11 You don't -- you don't -- you don't assert that it was a12 holding of the case?13 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I don't think it's14 necessarily the holding of the case because, obviously,15 that case involved expenditures. But I do think that when16 this Court distinguishes a prior precedent of the Court,17 that that's not a part of the opinion that a lower court18 is free to ignore. I think that part of the opinion is19 critical to the reasoning of the Court and should be given20 stare decisis effect. And I don't think there's any21 reason that's been brought to bear here to revisit this22 Court's distinction in Massachusetts Citizens for Life23 between contributions and expenditures, which after all,24 is the fundamental building block of this Court's campaign25 finance jurisprudence.171111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: You think whenever we distinguish a2 prior case in one of our opinions, that -- that3 distinguishing has stare decisis effect.4 MR. CLEMENT: I would think that in many5 respects that's the most important part of the opinion.6 It's not to say that the Court can't subsequently revisit7 that part of the opinion. I mean, that's certainly what8 this Court can do, but I think for purposes of a lower9 court, anyway, if -- if this Court distinguishes two cases10 on the ground that the prior case involved a corporation11 that had less than $10,000 and a subsequent case comes12 along where there's $9,999 involved, I would think the13 lower court would be well served to heed the distinction14 that this Court drew. And I think in this particular15 context, obviously, this Court is free to reconsider its16 prior precedents, but I don't think there's any reason to17 do so.18 The distinction between contributions and19 expenditures has proved workable particularly in the20 context of nonprofit corporations. As I say, this isn't21 some abstract application of the contribution/expenditure22 dichotomy that this Court has never considered.23 Massachusetts Citizens for Life involved a nonprofit24 corporation and this Court was at pains, pretty much at25 every step in the Court's reasoning, to distinguish181111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425between contributions and expenditures.In the end, I think respondents ask this Courteffectively to disregard Congress' decision to treat corporate contributions distinctly from individual contributions. They effectively ask this Court to treat North Carolina Right to Life Incorporated as if it were not incorporated, but there's no reason to disregard either respondents' decision to incorporate or Congress' decision to subject all corporations to the same regime, segregated funds, distinct disclosure requirements, and higher limits, in fact, on their contributions.If there are no further questions, I'll reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Clement. Mr. Bopp, we'll hear from you.ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR. ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSMR. BOPP: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:Expressive associations play a vital role in our democratic republic. Because they attract financial support due to their political ideas, not their prowess in the economic marketplace, their participation in our political process poses no threat of corruption, as long as they do not serve as a conduit for business corporation191111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 contributions.2 QUESTION: I -- I don't understand that. If --3 if I bribe somebody, a Senator, out of -- out of political4 motivation because I'm an environmentalist or whatever,5 that's not corruption? It's only -- it's only if I have6 some economic motive that it's corruption?7 MR. BOPP: Well, that's classic quid pro quo8 corruption which is dealt with by contribution limits,9 now--10 QUESTION: Well, I mean, I -- it may well be,11 but I don't see that the distinction between whether it's12 an economic actor or a political actor has anything to do13 with whether there's corruption or not.14 MR. BOPP: Well, there has been some controversy15 on this Court on -- on whether or not the -- the decisions16 of this Court in Mass. Citizens and on Austin were in17 accordance with the Constitution, but in both cases the18 Court distinguished between the types of corruption that19 are entailed by the corporate form, which is the potential20 for unfair employment of wealth for political purposes.21 This applies to economic corporations, that -- that is,22 those that are not, as Mass. Citizens or North Carolina23 Right to Life, formed to advance political ideas.24 QUESTION: Well, but you can have an immense25 corporation formed to advance political ideas. I -- I201111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425don't -- this one happens to be a small one, but -- MR. BOPP: Yes. And --QUESTION: -- if you attract enough people, you can have an immense organization. What's the organization for -- American Association of Retired Persons. I mean, that's an immense organization with -- with a large amount of available money.MR. BOPP: That's right and the size of the organization is not the issue. The issue in this Court's jurisprudence is whether -- is the nature of the organization itself and not the corporate form per se. If the nature of --QUESTION: Well, Mr. Bopp, would you say that the AARP, which was referred to by Justice Scalia, the National Right to Work Committee, which was involved in that opinion, and Massachusetts Citizens for Life are all in the same boat?MR. BOPP: I don't believe so, Your Honor. I think we do --QUESTION: Why not?MR. BOPP: Well, the -- the Court in Mass. Citizens established some criteria to determine whether or not an organization, a corporation, benefitted from the MCFL exemption. And those include whether or not there are incentives to disassociate -- lack of incentives to211111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 disassociate by, for instance, having insurance plans and2 other benefits of membership that are economically3 related.4 Secondly, you would look to the amount of5 corporate -- business corporation contributions or6 business activities. If those are too much or those are7 not insignificant, in -- in comparison with the total sums8 raised, then again they would not qualify.9 QUESTION: Mr. Bopp, on that point I thought10 that Massachusetts Citizens for Life went further. It11 said having a policy against accepting corporate12 contributions, which is one difference between your13 organization and Massachusetts Citizens for Life. They14 said they would take no money from corporations. You15 accept money from corporations. You get very little from16 business corporations, but you don't have a policy of17 turning them away.18 MR. BOPP: That's correct, Your Honor. And the19 -- all the circuits that have considered this, which have20 been four of the circuits, all agree that the features21 explained and -- and characterizing Mass. Citizens in --22 in the Supreme Court's decision were not constitutional23 requirements, but descriptions of the organization before24 it. And all of them have agreed that -- that not-for-25 profit ideological corporations can still qualify for the221111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425-- for the Massachusetts Citizens exemption. QUESTION: Well, would you call AARP anideological organization?MR. BOPP: I think they have a mixture ofpolitical and nonpolitical purposes and are, therefore, more like Austin -- the -- the Michigan Chamber of Commerce and Austin that had a mixture of political and nonpolitical purposes and therefore did not qualify for the MCFL exemption.And to complete my answer --QUESTION: I'll bet the members also get benefits --MR. BOPP: Yes.QUESTION: -- and -- and that criterion would -- would make it different from --MR. BOPP: There were also incentives that were economic in nature that would cause people to be reluctant to disassociate with Michigan Chamber of Commerce if it -- if it proved to be that they disagreed with their political ideas or the advancement of their political ideas.And the four circuits that have considered the question of the amount of business corporation contributions have all said that as long as they are insignificant, in comparison with the total revenue of the231111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 organization, they still -- they do not serve as a conduit2 for business corporation contributions and still qualify3 for the exemption.4 QUESTION: But they could serve as a conduit for5 a very large donor, a very wealthy person, who wants to6 avoid the personal limitations on how much that individual7 could give.8 MR. BOPP: Well, it is true that there are no9 contribution limits to not-for-profit corporations.10 However, the intent of a donor to circumvent those limits11 would be -- contributing to a not-for-profit would be a12 highly inefficient and ineffective way of doing so because13 the political activities of not-for-profit corporations,14 both because of the major purpose test that would cause an15 organization to become a PAC if political activity became16 their major purpose, and the Internal Revenue Service's17 limitations on the activities of 501(c)(4) organizations,18 which is what the regulations require you to be qualified19 as in -- in order to quality for the MCFL exemption, all20 -- all mean that a very small percentage of any21 contribution to a not-for-profit corporation could ever be22 used for political activity.23 Furthermore, contributing to a not-for-profit24 versus a PAC and a -- or a political party is also an25 unfavorable prospect for a donor. I mean, after all, the241111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 -- a not-for-profit under the 441a contribution limits is2 limited to a $2,000 contribution, where a PAC can give3 $5,000 and political parties can give much more.4 Furthermore, all of the money that PACs or5 political parties receive in their hard money accounts can6 be used for political activity, whereas I've mentioned for7 not-for-profits it's really a very small percentage in8 order to continue to qualify under the MCFL exemption and9 continue to not be deemed a PAC for -- for the purposes of10 the Federal Election Campaign Act.11 Now, the disclosure interest that there -- that12 there is for contributions can be readily and in a13 narrowly tailored way dealt with by simply requiring that14 any contribution to a not-for-profit that is to be used15 for or is intended to be used for contributions to16 candidates must be reported and is -- and is thereby17 subject to the aggregate contribution limits. This is a18 much more narrowly tailored way to deal with disclosure19 and the aggregate contribution limits than prohibiting the20 organization completely from making any contribution.21 QUESTION: What you do then -- this is what I22 understand you to be saying. The -- one of their23 justifications that has been advanced for this restriction24 on contributions I've interpreted as the following. We25 have five people. These five people each write a check to251111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 Candidate Smith for $2,000. They get annoyed. They think2 they should be able to give $4,000, which the law forbids.3 So they form a committee, a nonprofit corporation, called4 the $4,000 for Smith Corporation.5 (Laughter.)6 QUESTION: And now each of them writes another7 check for $2,000, gives it to the corporation, and the8 corporation gives it to Smith. And I think the Government9 says, well, Congress wanted to stop that. It's not10 actually going to limit them to zero. They're going to be11 limited to $5,000 as a group provided they jump through12 certain hoops.All right. Now, what's --MR. BOPP: Well, if they're a PAC --QUESTION: -- what's wrong with that argument? MR. BOPP: Well, if they're -- if they're a PAC, can give $5,000 out of the -- out of the $10,00013 14 15 1617 then they18 that you posit. If they're a not-for-profit corporation,19 the most they can give --￼20 QUESTION: I know, but do you see what I'm21 saying? I'm saying Congress doesn't want to have groups22 called the $4,000 for Smith group even if they call23 themselves something different.24 MR. BOPP: I agree.25 QUESTION: They want to limit each of those261111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425members to $2,000.MR. BOPP: Agreed.QUESTION: And that's what they do, though for a variety of other reasons, not directly relevant to my question, they've allowed those people to get together, jump through various hoops called the PAC hoops, and give up to $5,000 extra. So if Congress wanted to, they might say none.MR. BOPP: Yes.QUESTION: All right. Now, that's their -- that's basically the argument, and I want to get a straight, you know, direct reply to it.MR. BOPP: Well, the -- the desire of subjecting the aggregate contribution limit or a contribution in excess of $2,000, one direct and one through another source, is dealt with two ways and can be.One is if the contribution made to this group that you posit is earmarked, then that contribution is considered to be a contribution not just to the group but also to the candidate him or herself. So that earmarked contribution is subject to the $2,000 limit, and the contribution used for that would be in violation of the act currently.MR. BOPP: Yes.QUESTION: All right. So now -- is that --271111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. BOPP: That is current law. And -- and so that prospect is prohibited and appropriately so.Secondly, as the Federal Election Campaign Act previously required, that anyone contributing to a organization, not a PAC, that contributes money for an independent expenditure, that that contribution must be reported by the group that does the independent expenditure. Congress could require the same thing here. They could require money given more generally, not earmarked, but more generally for candidates to be reported by the -- the group and thereby subject to the aggregate contribution limits.QUESTION: Mr. Bopp, isn't it also the case that the -- that the corporation that Justice Breyer positswould not qualify as -- as a 501 exemptthe only thing it's using its money for contributions to political candidates?MR. BOPP: That would also beQUESTION: I'm just trying --QUESTION: It has to be -- it has to be arelatively insignificant part of its overall activity. MR. BOPP: Yes. The Internal Revenue Servicewould treat the organization that he described as a political organization --QUESTION: So these five people would had to --281111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005organization ifis to make￼true. They --1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425have to get together with maybe 100,000 other people so that their -- their little portion is so watered down that it's not a significant part of the corporation's business.MR. BOPP: That's exactly --QUESTION: I didn't think there was a numerical limit. And my question which tried to eliminate extraneous points I think you understood perfectly well there. I mean a 503(c) corporation but -- et cetera.But I want to go back to your answer. The -- the -- because I'm trying to get clear about this. And the -- what you're saying is that Congress could take my group, with whatever else they have to do to qualify them -- they could take my group and you're saying Congress could just say, very well, we will limit the corporation so that it can only give money from these five people insofar as they haven't met their $2,000 individual limit.MR. BOPP: That would be an effect of what I said, yes.QUESTION: And -- and moreover, it could require reporting so we know who they are.MR. BOPP: Yes.QUESTION: All right. Now, is that a less restrictive alternative than what Congress has actually done, which is to say, proceed through a segregated fund?MR. BOPP: Yes, much less restrictive.291111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Because? Because?2 MR. BOPP: Well, because this Court held in3 Mass. Citizens and Austin that the PAC requirements, both4 administrative, including record keeping, appointment of a5 treasurer, filing regular reports, et cetera, and the6 limits that are imposed upon PACs -- there's a $5,0007 contribution limit to PACs, et cetera -- all impose an --8 a constitutionally burden -- a burden on constitutionally9 exercised rights that did not -- that did not pass10 constitutional muster. So -- so while it is true that you11 can do it under a PAC, that imposes an unconstitutional12 burden on the First Amendment activities.13 And that, of course, all goes back to, you know,14 is there a justification for this. In other words, we15 have a prohibited source --16 QUESTION: Well, just before you go on, I don't17 see why your proposal doesn't have all of the same18 administrative inconveniences.19 MR. BOPP: Well, there's a one-page report.20 There are organizations that can do independent21 expenditures that are not PACs. There's a one -- one-22 page report to file, and that -- and that report would say23 how much is being spent on the independent expenditure and24 how much has been donated to the organization for the25 purpose of that independent expenditure.301111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Similarly, a report like that could be filed for contributions so that we could capture those people who are trying to circumvent the limits to -- to make undisclosed or excessive contributions. We would capture them because then the only choice left to the donor would be a completely undifferentiated, unearmarked contribution that is going to be used by the organization 95, 98 percent for other purposes, for lobbying, for education, for other charitable activity.QUESTION: Mr. Bopp, the Court basically decided this issue in National Right to Work Committee case, didn't it? You just want us to distinguish your type of nonprofit corporation.MR. BOPP: Well, we are asking you to distinguish the Massachusetts Citizens for Life type -- QUESTION: I think that's very hard to do. Imean, we dealt with this precise issue in that case. MR. BOPP: But there was no issue in that caseabout whether or not the organization itself should not be viewed as a prohibited source of -- of making independent expenditures or making contributions in that case.QUESTION: But the organization opted for the corporate form --MR. BOPP: Yes.QUESTION: -- knowing about these limitations.311111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. BOPP: Yes, but this Court has -- was clear in Mass. Citizens that it's not the corporate form per se, but the potential for unfair deployment of wealth for political purposes and held that these types of organizations pose no threat, no threat whatsoever.QUESTION: Well, it couldn't have been a holding in -- in the Massachusetts case because there you were talking about independent expenditures rather than contributions.MR. BOPP: Well, but -- but --QUESTION: Certainly the Massachusetts case doesn't control the outcome here.MR. BOPP: Well, we -- we believe that it -- that the holding of the Court in Mass. Citizens -- that this organization serves no potential for corruption of the democratic process, was essential for the Court to hold that no independent -- that independent expenditures would be allowed because, after all --QUESTION: Mr. Bopp, at least three times in the text of the Court's opinion in Massachusetts Citizens for Life, at least three times, it distinguishes direct contributions to candidates from expenditures, and each time it explains why it reached the result it did. It makes that distinction.MR. BOPP: Yes.321111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: And I think that -- that that's so2 central to Massachusetts Citizens for Life. So if -- if3 we just had this opinion shorn of all but however,4 remember that this is not a contribution to a candidate5 and then citing back to the -- the earlier decision that6 Justice O'Connor mentioned, the National Right to Work7 Committee, to distinguish it from this case, but it just8 seems so all over Massachusetts Citizens for Life that it9 is drawing this bright line between contributions to10 candidates and independent expenditures.11 MR. BOPP: But in -- but in Right to Work, it12 wasn't a prohibition on contributions. It was a -- a13 limit on the amount of contributions. And we agree that14 limits on amounts --15 QUESTION: Yes, but I'm -- I'm talking about16 Massachusetts Citizens for Life and the line that Justice17 Brennan drew in the Massachusetts Citizens for Life18 between contributions to candidates. Every time he talks19 about the holding in this case, he said, remember, this is20 not contributions to candidates.21 MR. BOPP: Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.22 That's what you said. But the -- the case did not involve23 -- neither Mass. Citizens nor Right to Work involved a24 limit on the amount of contributions, that is, like a25 $2,000 limit. We have not challenged that.331111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Mr. Bopp, do you challenge the distinction for First Amendment purposes between restricting contributions and restricting expenditures?MR. BOPP: Only as to a prohibition on them. That is, this Court in Buckley and reaffirmed in Shrink said that there were both speech and association aspects of making a contribution. That is, it's a -- as far as speech is concerned, this is a general expression of support that is found in the undifferentiated act of contributing.Well, here they are prohibited from contributing. They cannot -- these organizations cannot give one cent. Therefore, that's --QUESTION: So -- so you're -- you're saying there is a distinction --MR. BOPP: Yes, as to a prohibition.QUESTION: -- for -- for valid First Amendment purposes between the -- the contribution limit and the -- and the expenditure limit, but that distinction is not strong enough to forbid an entire prohibition.MR. BOPP: That's correct because both the speech aspects and association aspects of contributing that are -- that remain after limits on the amounts are imposed because the speech aspect is a general expression of support and the association aspect is to serve to341111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 affiliate a person with the candidate. You have your name2 now through the -- the method of the contribution3 affiliated with the candidate.4 When you have a zero contribution limit, then5 there is no speech and no association that is allowed6 through the act of contributing. Therefore --7 QUESTION: But you can say -- you can --8 QUESTION: I don't think any of our cases have9 sliced the onion quite that fine to get into these nuances10 that there's a difference between prohibiting a11 contribution and limiting it. I think our distinctions12 have been primarily that contributions may be quite13 substantially regulated, independent expenditures cannot14 be.15 MR. BOPP: Well, that is -- that is generally a16 correct characterization of your jurisprudence, but you17 have to examine why. Why is it that contributions are18 subject to a lower level of scrutiny? And the -- the why19 is is that the speech and association aspects of giving a20 smaller contribution remain, but if you can't give any21 contribution, then both that speech and association22 aspect --23 QUESTION: But when you say can't give any, you24 are overlooking or saying the PAC doesn't count.25 MR. BOPP: Yes.351111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: It isn't an absolute no contribution. It is, if you do it, you have to do it through this arm that you create, this segregated fund, this 501 -- of the 501(c)(4) organization. You can -- you can do it but you have to do it in a rather cumbersome way.MR. BOPP: Yes.QUESTION: So it isn't you cannot make any contributions.MR. BOPP: Well, not only is it cumbersome, but it's constitutionally -- it's an unconstitutional burden this Court has held in Mass. Citizens and in Austin to require First Amendment political activity to be done through a PAC. So --QUESTION: Not First Amendment activity in -- in the Massachusetts case itself, as I just said. I don't want to repeat that except that Justice Brennan did repeat it at least three times.MR. BOPP: Yes. And I'm aware of that, but I'm just asking this Court to -- to consider not -- not to apply what is dicta in Mass. Citizens since it did not involve contributions -- to -- to just apply that, but to consider the rationale.And in North -- in -- in National Right to Work, the Court was considering not a prohibition on soliciting contributions from members to its PAC, it was considering361111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 a limit on what is considered to be a member. So once2 again, that case involved contribution limits, not3 prohibition.4 QUESTION: Mr. Bopp, that -- that First5 Amendment right that you talk about as the associational6 interest, the -- the ability to give at least a dollar7 will identify you with a -- with the candidate, is that8 really a First Amendment interest that applies to the9 association, or does it apply to the members of the10 association? And as Mr. Clement pointed out, the11 individual members of the association remain free to give12 a dollar, indeed up to $2,000, to the particular13 candidate.14 All you're really talking about here is -- is15 not the ability of individuals to identify themselves with16 a candidate, but the ability of individuals by pooling17 their resources to help a candidate significantly. It18 seems to me that that's the only interest at -- at issue19 here.20 MR. BOPP: Well, there's valid reasons unlike21 the representation -- or the argument of the Government22 for people to want to pool their resources in an23 association. That those valid reasons are, in fact, why24 people already contribute to PACs and the political party25 --371111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: But among those reasons is not in order to identify myself with that candidate.MR. BOPP: Well, but the --QUESTION: To -- to do that, all you have to do is reach in your pocket and give them a dollar.MR. BOPP: That is true, but many people choose to pool their resources because they want the group, which has a separate existence and has a political purpose, unlike them as an individual -- you know, they are not as identified with a particular point of view or political idea like a group would be, like -- like NARAL would be. So if -- so they choose then to pool their resources with the group in order to make the much more powerful statement about the political ideas that they are attempting to support and they want candidates to be associated with.Now, in addition, the fact that the group can aggregate these small contributions and then make a large contribution to a particular candidate enhances the -- the contribution that the individual would otherwise made -- be made because it is being done by the group and in an aggregate. So there are justifiable reasons why people want to associate.And then further, the association -- QUESTION: Mr. Bopp, it seems to me that your381111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425argument really would go just the same way to an amount limitation as to a total prohibition.MR. BOPP: No, because amount limitations donot--QUESTION: Everybody can just contribute $10. Wouldn't that -- would that be okay with you?MR. BOPP: You mean the -- the amount that --QUESTION: Say the amount limitation was very low. As I understand it, you're trying to draw a categorical distinction between total prohibition and amount limitation.MR. BOPP: Yes.QUESTION: And I don't know -- I don't see that your argument really is directed to that.MR. BOPP: Well, it goes to the source of the -- of the rights, the First Amendment rights, that are implicated by a -- by an amount limitation as opposed to a prohibition.QUESTION: But it seems to me an amount limitation that's very, very low would have the same vice under your argument as a total prohibition.MR. BOPP: Well, potentially, but that would be a case to be a decided at that point. And -- now, this Court has upheld the $5,000 limit, for instance, to political action committees. And -- but you would have to391111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425consider -- if it got too low, I mean, there's certainly a potential for contributions that are too low -- as Justices Breyer and Ginsburg explained in Shrink, there is certainly a potential if they're too low to be unconstitutional.But here we're not talking about and have not challenged the -- the $2,000 limit. We accept that. We just don't accept the proposition that because the organization poses no threat of corruption to the political process, that they should be completely prohibited from making a contribution.So -- so we view this then as a source limitation, not as an amount limitation, and as a result, the -- the contribution jurisprudence of this Court that have accepted greater regulation of contributions is not applicable.If there are no other questions, thank you. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Bopp.Mr. Clement, you have 11 minutes remaining.REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:Let me begin with the distinction that respondents rely on between limits on contributions and401111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 prohibitions on contributions. Even if there is something2 to that distinction -- and I rather doubt there is for3 some of the reasons unearthed by Justice Stevens' colloquy4 with -- with counsel for respondent. Even if that were a5 valid distinction, this case does not involve an absolute6 prohibition.7 This Court, both in Massachusetts Citizens for8 Life and Austin, and in fact, much earlier in Pipefitters,9 made clear that the limitations on corporate and labor10 union contributions in section 441b are not a, quote,11 absolute prohibition, but rather just a limitation on12 contributions. The availability of the segregated funds13 to make the contributions is another way of making this a14 limitation, a particular limitation designed for the15 unique risks of artificial entities like corporations and16 labor unions.￼17 And18 discussion in19 distinguished20 expenditures on the grounds that a prohibition might be21 different just doesn't work because both Massachusetts22 Citizens for Life and National Right to Work Committee23 involved this very provision, section 441b. So whatever24 there might be in the case of an absolute prohibition on25 somebody's right to make contributions, 441b either isn't411111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005I think any effort to distinguish the Massachusetts Citizens for Life and its -- distinctions between contributions and1 that or isn't that in -- in a constitutionally relevant2 way after this Court's decisions in Massachusetts Citizens3 for Life and National Right to Work Committee.4 Some discussion was had about fine distinctions5 that potentially could be drawn between the American6 Association of Retired Persons, National Right to Work7 Committee, Massachusetts Citizens for Life, and North8 Carolina Citizens Right to Life. The point of section9 441b in the contribution context is that Congress has not10 found a need to draw those kind of fine distinctions.11 MCFL itself, of course, drew some of those12 distinctions in the contribution context -- in the13 expenditure context, rather, but drew a distinction14 between contributions in light of the inherently greater15 risk of corruption from contributions.16 Another suggestion was made that perhaps there17 is a seemingly less restrictive alternative. As with18 independent expenditures made by nonprofit associations,19 perhaps contributions that are made to the association20 with the purpose of them being used for contributions to21 candidates could be disclosed.22 QUESTION: Have we actually held, Mr. Clement,23 that in regulating contributions, the Government must find24 the least restrictive means?25 MR. CLEMENT: No, and to the contrary. This421111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 Court has not held that. It did not apply a least2 restrictive alternative analysis in National Right to Work3 Committee. In the California Medical Association case, a4 plurality of the Court, in fact, affirmatively held that5 the least restrictive alternative was not required in the6 context of contributions. So I don't think there is that7 requirement.8 But I want to address the -- the supposed less9 restrictive alternative precisely because I believe that10 less restrictive alternative is illusory because the11 suggestion is that -- that individuals could say -- could12 disclose when they give a contribution to a nonprofit13 organization for the purpose of a contribution. Well, if14 that's going to have the effect of avoiding the15 circumvention rationale, I wonder whether people are16 really going to volunteer the information that the17 contribution to the nonprofit is for that purpose.18 And additionally, even if that is a permissible19 way and would be enforceable in the real political world,20 that really doesn't give you much of a different result21 than what Congress has specifically provided for with the22 segregated fund.23 And indeed, the segregated fund actually is24 responsive to the kind of First Amendment associational25 interests that underlie this Court's concerns in Buckley431111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 and even going back to NAACP against Button. The concern2 is that disclosure requirements imposed on organizations3 could be a backhanded way to get at membership lists. The4 segregated fund prevents that by keeping the membership5 lists and the organization itself separate from the6 political activity of the organization. Indeed, if7 Congress hadn't provided for segregated funds as a8 requirement for all corporations, but simply made that9 available, I would think that many nonprofit corporations10 would avail themselves of that option precisely to avoid11 the interference with associational interests as in cases12 like NAACP against Button.The last point I'd like to talk about is simply that again underlies much of respondents'that because there is no threat from1314 this idea15 arguments16 expenditures to these types of corporations, there is17 therefore no threat to these type of corporations engaging18 in corporate contributions. If that analysis were applied19 across the board, it would undermine the entirety of this20 Court's campaign finance jurisprudence which is based on21 the fundamental recognition that contributions involve22 greater risks than expenditures, and -- and expenditures,23 therefore, are largely unregulated because they are --24 presumably do not pose as great a risk as contributions.25 If there are no further questions, I'd like the￼441111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425court below reversed.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.Clement.The case is submitted.(Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the above-entitled matter was submitted.)￼451111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005
