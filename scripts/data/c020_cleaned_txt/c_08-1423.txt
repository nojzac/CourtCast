Omega.Mr. Englert.ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.,ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. ENGLERT: please the Court:This case is King v. L'anza with onlyMr. Chief Justice, and may ita repeat of Quality - Subject to Final Reviewone pertinent difference. Both cases involve goods not authorized for importation into￼the United States. Both cases involve arguments that the first sale doctrine must be narrowly construed, thus the Copyright Act's importation ban, section 602(a), be given less than its supposedly intended scope. The only difference is place of manufacture of the goods.Quality King involved U.S. manufactured goods; this case involves goods made in Switzerland.According to the Ninth Circuit in Omega, Congress intended to treat foreign manufactured goods better in this respect than goods made in the United States. It is wildly implausible that Congress had any such intent.3 - Subject to Final Review1 From 1790 to 1891, foreigners were2 categorically ineligible to hold U.S. copyrights. From3 1891 to 1986, the United States discriminated against4 foreign manufacturing of copyrighted goods through a5 series of so-called manufacturing clauses, including6 section 601 of the 1976 Act. If Congress intended to7 make the first sale doctrine discriminate in favor of8 foreign manufacturing at the same time, one would expect9 some note to be taken of that fact in the legislative10 history, but none is. And yet the Ninth Circuit held11 that Congress in 1976 altered the long-established first12 sale doctrine to make it uniquely favorable to foreign13 manufacturing of copyrighted goods and did so through14 the obscure phrase, "lawfully made under this title," in15 section 109.16 No one in all the briefs in this case has17 identified a single reason why Congress would have18 wanted to do so. Moreover, the words "lawfully made19 under this title" are used elsewhere in the Copyright20 Act, and they never mean what the Ninth Circuit said21 they mean in section 109.22 Most instructive is the very next section23 after section 109, section 110, which governs24 educational use of copyrighted works and was enacted25 contemporaneously with 109. In describing the kinds of4￼ - Subject to Final Review1 works teachers may show students in their classroom2 without fear of copyright liability, Congress referred3 to works lawfully made under this title. Our briefs4 have pointed out the absurdity of construing the phrase5 in section 110 to mean made in the United States, and6 it's very revealing how Respondent and its amici have7 tried to answer that point.8 Omega says "lawfully made under this title"9 means either made in the United States or authorized for10 distribution in the United States. That argument gives11 up any pretense -­12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would you clarify for me13 what your exact meaning is? There -- your blue brief14 and your reply brief appear to give two different15 meanings.16 MR. ENGLERT: I hope not, Your Honor. I17 believe our -­18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your reply brief19 suggests that if Omega grants foreign reproduction and20 distribution rights but retains U.S. rights, that the21 first sale doctrine would allow Omega to bar22 importation.23 MR. ENGLERT: If it grants exclusive foreign24 distribution.25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why does it matter?5￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Because your blue brief says that "lawfully made" means anything that was made with Omega's consent or authority. So why the difference at all?MR. ENGLERT: It matters, Your Honor, because of the underlying rationale of the first sale doctrine and the underlying rationale of the import ban in section 602.The purpose of the first sale doctrine is to make sure that the copyright owner gets one and only one recompense for each copy, for each lawfully made copy.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So if he sells his rights to a foreign manufacturer and distributor, he gets paid for those rights. Why should he now have any additional rights to bar that authorized copy -­MR. ENGLERT: The reason, Your -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- from being imported into the United States?MR. ENGLERT: Yes, Your Honor. The -­ JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I don't understandwhat -­MR. ENGLERT: The reason is to give effect to the examples given in the legislative history of section 602.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Not -- you mean to the examples in the legislative history or in the examples6 - Subject to Final Review￼ - Subject to Final Review1 in Quality King?2 MR. ENGLERT: Oh. The Quality King has a3 paragraph, much discussed in the briefs, which cites to4 the legislative history of section 602 and in5 particular, cites to witness statements that are in the6 committee prints that are part of the legislative7 history of section 602.8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So do you think that9 there is a difference between assigning a copyright to a10 foreign entity or merely licensing a foreign entity?11 One of the criticisms of your approach is that you would12 draw a line between those two.13 MR. ENGLERT: We don't draw a line between14 those two, Your Honor.15 The line is -- depends on whether the16 copyright owner has given exclusive foreign rights to17 someone else. And the reason the exclusivity of the18 foreign rights matters is because that is the example19 given in the legislative history of 602 and in the20 paragraph in Quality King.21 And to give meaning to section 602 and to be22 completely consistent with the rationale of the first23 sale doctrine, one must draw some line. Drawing a line24 between the U.S. manufacturer and the foreign25 manufacturer makes no sense. It's not consistent with7￼ - Subject to Final Review1 the purposes of anything.2 Drawing a line between the exclusive grant3 of rights, whether by license or assignment to a foreign4 manufacturer -- or a foreign distributor, rather, and5 not granting such exclusive rights is perfectly6 consistent with the rationale -­7 JUSTICE BREYER: You are talking about the8 first sale doctrine. The perfectly consistent rationale9 would be whether there is a first sale. So -- so 109,10 though it doesn't say it, but if you look at the history11 and title, there has to be a transfer.12 So in fact, if a British publisher with a13 British right given by an American author or publisher14 makes this, 109 doesn't apply -- I mean, 109 doesn't15 apply until there's a sale.16 Now, that makes -- you -- you haven't17 adopted that. Nobody -- I guess maybe one of the amicus18 briefs does, but I don't see why that isn't perfectly19 sensible and I find no authority against it.20 MR. ENGLERT: Well, Your Honor, since that's21 a -- a broader position than ours, and we would -­22 JUSTICE BREYER: I know it is, but it -- the23 trouble with your position is it gets everybody, I24 think, going to be -- I mean, I don't know what all25 these contracts say. There are hundreds of thousands of8￼ - Subject to Final Review1 them, if not millions. What I don't see is why you2 don't just say: The first sale doctrine has always3 meant there was a transfer or sale.4 It meant that in 1792, when I took Phil5 Arita's antitrust course, and he used to bring it up.6 You go back to the 18th century. It's always meant7 there has to be a sale or transfer. So why don't we8 just read 109 that way, and there you give meaning to9 everything, and there is just no problem?10 Now, I raise that not because -- I raise it11 because since there's only a few people really12 supporting this, there must be some problem with what I13 say. So what is it?14 MR. ENGLERT: Well, the issue, Your Honor -­15 and you're putting me in a position of arguing against16 myself a little bit, but the issue is a fair reading of17 the legislative history of section 602 -- not the text,18 but the legislative history -- is that Congress did19 intend to allow certain blocking of imported goods when20 there had been -­21 JUSTICE BREYER: Of course, if you say there22 has to be a first sale, there is no problem. You block23 that British manufacturer from sending his books to the24 United States, but you don't block the person to whom he25 sells it. Gives meaning to everything.9￼ - Subject to Final Review1 MR. ENGLERT: Okay, Your Honor.2 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, no, I'm putting3 that to you, because since you haven't advocated it, I4 must be missing something, and I'm not an expert in5 copyright law. What am I missing?6 MR. ENGLERT: Well, there is a dictum in7 this Court's opinion in Quality King that suggests that8 if a publisher and a -- an American publisher gives9 exclusive rights to a British publisher, if an American10 author or a British author gives exclusive territorial11 rights to two different publishers, then 602 retains12 meaning in that -­13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Exactly, and that's what14 it does under my theory, because there has been no first15 sale.16 MR. ENGLERT: No, but -- with respect, Your17 Honor, it's my understanding of both the legislative18 history and this Court's dictum that they refer to19 second and subsequent sales.20 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, you mean you are21 talking about jobbers? Somebody goes and buys, and so22 they're -- and so then you lose, because if that's what23 we are supposed to follow, those excerpts in the24 legislative history, then it would mean that a person25 who buys from the British publisher cannot import into10￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the United States because 109 doesn't apply.MR. ENGLERT: No, that's not what theexample means. It doesn't say categorically all second sales from British publishers are not subject to the first sale doctrine. What it says is in a situation in which rights have been divided and exclusive territorial rights have been given in two different countries, or to put it in copyright language, in the language you also used in the legislative history, when the copyright owner has divided its rights because an innovation of the '76 act, the Copyright Act, the copyrights became divisible.JUSTICE SCALIA: Where do you get that in the text? I mean, that's lovely, and you're saying that what Justice Breyer suggests makes perfect sense except for dictum and legislative history. Does your position make any sense with regard to text?MR. ENGLERT: Yes, absolutely, Your Honor.JUSTICE SCALIA: Where? Where is that limitation in the text?MR. ENGLERT: The other side's effort to read 602 broadly has no support in the text after Quality King, but -­JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm talking about your -­ MR. ENGLERT: I understand.11 - Subject to Final Review￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SCALIA: -- your limitation on exclusive rights abroad versus nonexclusive rights abroad. Where can you possibly find that in the text?MR. ENGLERT: You cannot.JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh. Well, that's the end of it for me.MR. ENGLERT: Let us -­JUSTICE BREYER: I have to say, I didn't even see it in the legislative history. I didn't think they made a big deal about jobbers. I like history here. Go back to 1792.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Englert, also talk about what, if anything, 602(a)(1) does, then. It seems 602(a)(2) is dealing with infringing goods, with pirated goods. So given the first sale doctrine as you construe it, what does 602(a)(1) protect?MR. ENGLERT: 602(a)(1) is limited to imports and doesn't confer a private right of action. 602(a)(2), which was enacted after the Ninth Circuit ruled in this case, adds a private right of action and adds exports. But it is -- 602(a)(2) is a new statute. It was not part of the 1976 Copyright Act. So it -- it is a subsection in which Congress expanded on what was already prohibited in 602(a)(1).Now, with respect to text, the text that the12 - Subject to Final Review￼ - Subject to Final Review1 Court is construing is five words, "lawfully made under2 this title." And those five words are used several3 places in the Copyright Act, including section 110, "for4 educational use." The government says "lawfully made5 under this title" can mean two different things in6 section 109 and section 110, provisions of the same7 chapter of the Copyright Act enacted contemporaneously.8 As a fallback position, the government says9 there is nothing wrong with having copyright liability10 for teachers who show foreign-made films in the11 classroom as long as they know they weren't made in the12 United States. So, for example, showing an Ingmar13 Bergman film, The Seventh Seal, in class would be14 copyright infringement according to the government.15 Even the people who make movies don't agree16 with that argument. The Motion Picture Association of17 America has filed an amicus brief in this case, and on18 page 19 of its brief, the MPAA says that the result the19 government says is A-OK is, quote, "a nonsensical and20 unintended consequence." The MPAA goes on to say there21 is no evidence that such liability has ever been22 imposed, but that argument misses the point. We are23 trying to ascertain what Congress meant by using the24 phrase "lawfully made under this title," not making a25 policy argument about consequences, and section 11013￼ - Subject to Final Review1 remains a powerful argument that Congress didn't use the2 phrase to mean "made in the United States."3 There is nothing extraterritorial about4 construing "lawfully made in this title" as a choice of5 law clause, which means: Lawfully made according to6 standards of the U.S. Copyright Act anywhere in the7 world. In that respect, this case is no different from8 Quality King, in which the court rejected an9 extraterritoriality argument in a two-sentence footnote.10 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't really mean -­11 your position is that "lawfully made under this title"12 means that -- means "would have been lawfully made under13 this title if this title governed." Isn't that14 basically what you are saying?15 MR. ENGLERT: Yes.16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. But there is another17 provision of the statute -- I forget where it is -­18 which says that in so many words.19 MR. ENGLERT: Not quite, Your Honor. In20 section 602(a)(2) and in section 602(b), Congress used21 the phrase, "would have constituted an infringement if22 this title had been applicable," and it says -­23 JUSTICE SCALIA: "If this title had been24 applicable," right? We say "applicable." Much25 prettier.14￼ - Subject to Final Review1 MR. ENGLERT: Okay, sir. Yes, that is the2 phrase Congress used to express a certain disfavored3 class of goods, goods that would have been infringing if4 this title would have been applicable. 110 -- 109,5 excuse me, and 110 are a different purpose. They are6 the purpose of favoring goods, goods that have been7 lawfully made under this title.8 So, yes, Congress could have chosen to use a9 variation of the phrase "if this title had been10 applicable" under 109, but it didn't. And we are left11 with the language Congress enacted, but it is language12 that Congress uses at least four different places in the13 Copyright Act, and we have a pretty good idea that it14 doesn't mean "made in the United States" and it doesn't15 mean what Omega says it means, which is "made in the16 United States or authorized at any time for distribution17 in the United States."￼JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you -- I see is now broken into (1) and (2) and it's you put entirely in quotes. But what does1819 that 602(a)20 602(b) that21 602(a) shelter? How does it coexist with the first sale22 doctrine?2324 there is no25 interaction15MR. ENGLERT: Well, Your Honor, as you know, reference in the legislative history to the between 602(a) and 109, and therefore, this - Subject to Final Review1 Court had to address that question for the first time in2 Quality King, and the Court rejected the argument that3 109 is inapplicable to imported goods altogether.4 The Court did say in a dictum which has been5 discussed already this morning that if a British and an6 American publisher divide rights, then section 602(a)7 does have a role to play. But the Court did not say8 books manufactured in Britain are not subject to the9 first sale doctrine.10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was a concurring11 opinion that says -- that said this case is about a12 round trip and doesn't talk to goods that -­13 MR. ENGLERT: Correct, and the concurring14 opinion cited two distinguished copyright treatises that15 suggested there was some concern about16 extraterritoriality in this case. Well, even the17 government has conceded there is no concern about18 extraterritoriality in this case, so the rationale of19 those treatises, learned though they are, is undermined.20 If one looks more closely at those21 treatises, they argue the language is so plain that it22 can only be construed one way. The government concedes23 that's not true. They argue extraterritoriality, as24 I've already said, and they argue that this court's25 dictum in Quality King -- the later additions to those16￼ - Subject to Final Review1 treatises argue that this Court's dictum in Quality King2 drew a distinction based on place of manufacture, but3 it's only the concurring opinion, not the dictum in the4 court's opinion that mentions place of manufacture. So5 it's a vert thin reed to say that the case turned on6 place of manufacture. And again, one can find nothing7 in the Quality King dictum, nothing in the legislative8 history of 602, nothing in the legislative history of9 109 that talks about place of manufacture.10 JUSTICE SCALIA: And nothing in the text11 that supports your position.12 MR. ENGLERT: No. What supports our13 position, Your Honor, is the text of 109, the use of the14 phrase "lawfully made under this title," and the use of15 that phrase "elsewhere in the Copyright Act."16 JUSTICE SCALIA: You pulled out of the sky17 this distinction between having created exclusive rights18 abroad and having created nonexclusive rights abroad.19 Where does that come from?20 MR. ENGLERT: That comes from the21 legislative history, Your Honor. And for those who22 prefer not to look at legislative history -­23 JUSTICE SCALIA: You use -­24 MR. ENGLERT: -- that distinction may not25 hold up. But if that distinction doesn't hold up -­17￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know why using -­ MR. ENGLERT: -- that strengthens myposition. - Subject to Final ReviewJUSTICE SCALIA: Did the legislative history suggest what part of the text this -- this novelsuggestion was based upon?MR. ENGLERT: It does not. The relevantlegislative history is witness statements.JUSTICE BREYER: I do read legislativehistory, but I didn't really find anything that said that they were worried about an American and a British publisher dividing rights, and they want them to do that. There is no problem with that, because there has never been a sale. So they divide the rights.And there isn't even a problem with -- with buyers from the British publisher, because a reasonable vertically imposed territorial agreement or other restriction on resale is lawful.MR. ENGLERT: Well, if -­JUSTICE BREYER: And if it's reasonable, they don't even need copyright.MR. ENGLERT: That was not true at the time.JUSTICE BREYER: If it isn't reasonable, why should they have it?MR. ENGLERT: Pardon me, Justice Breyer.18￼ - Subject to Final Review1 JUSTICE BREYER: That's all you -- yes, I2 just want you to respond.3 MR. ENGLERT: It was not lawful at the time4 of the enactment of this statute. This Court had not5 yet decided6 were per se7 statute.89 guess, they 1011 law in Europe.12 JUSTICE BREYER: I think -- I think it's13 always been true.14 MR. ENGLERT: But, again, what the Court has15 asked me many questions about is whether I'm giving too16 broad a scope to section 602 and too narrow a scope to17 section 109.1819 necessarily20 accommodate21 Quality King to give some role for section 602 to play22 in the case of nonpiratical goods. If the Court wants23 to reject anything, if it wants to reconsider the dictum24 in Quality King or not rely on legislative history, that25 makes my position -­19GTE Sylvania, and territorial restrictions unlawful at the time Congress enacted thisJUSTICE BREYER: Here. But in Europe, I were lawful.MR. ENGLERT: I don't know the state of the￼Our position is that section 109 has a broad reach, and we have tried tothe legislative history and the dictum in - Subject to Final Review1 JUSTICE BREYER: My question really wasn't2 to argue with you. My question was: Where in the3 legislative history does it say that the point of 602 is4 to prevent a foreign publisher from selling copies to a5 distributor and then that distributor resells them to6 the United States? I'm not saying it doesn't; it's just7 that I didn't focus on those particular words directly.8 MR. ENGLERT: And Justice Breyer, to be fair9 about what the legislative history says, it is10 statements by witnesses. It is not statements by11 committee, so it's a little bit hard to tell where12 they're drawing the line.13 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh. In other words,14 somebody wanted that. I understand the industry wanted15 it. But -- but I -- is there anything in there that16 suggests that this is what Congress wanted to do,17 members of Congress? Even I draw the line somewhere.18 (Laughter.)19 MR. ENGLERT: Yes. Yes.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me write that down.21 (Laughter.)22 MR. ENGLERT: Justice Breyer, we do know23 that section 602(a) has some role to play. And when24 this Court was trying to figure out in Quality King what25 role it had to play it did look to the statements of20￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Mrs. Harriet Pilpel, Mr. Horace Manges from the American Book Publishers Council. And those are the statements that the Court said in dicta presumably reflected congressional intent, and so I am relying on those statements for the limitation of section 109 to accommodate section 602.But again, if the Court disagrees with me and wants to give less of a role to 602 and more of a role to section 109, that is, of course, further assistance to my position.I would like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.￼Englert.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.Mr. Panner.ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON M. PANNERON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. PANNER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it - Subject to Final Reviewplease the Court:Section -- section 602(a)(1) allows thedistribution of foreign-made copies abroad without the U.S. copyright holder forfeiting the exclusive right to distribute copies domestically, which is guaranteed by section 106(3), and that provision applies in this case. And unlike in Quality King, section 109(a) provides21 - Subject to Final Review1 Costco with no defense because the copies at issue were2 not lawfully made under this title. That is, the making3 of the copies was not subject to or governed by U.S.4 copyright law.5 The decision of the court of appeals should6 not be affirmed for three basic reasons, and the first7 depends on the plain language of section 109(a), which8 applies only to copies that were lawfully made under9 this title.10 JUSTICE ALITO: What do you say "made"11 means?12 MR. PANNER: Well, "made" certainly includes13 the creation of the physical copy. It also includes the14 addition of any necessary intellectual property rights15 that would permit distribution in the United States.16 So that is to say that we understand section17 109(a) should be read to reach a situation in which copy18 has been subject to an authorized sale in the United19 States.20 JUSTICE ALITO: See, I'm with you, and I21 think you -- the text supports you up to the point where22 you add the qualification. But once you've added that23 qualification, I think you're -- you're outside the24 text, just as Costco is outside the text with the25 qualification that they had.22￼ - Subject to Final Review1 MR. PANNER: I don't think so, Your Honor,2 and let me try to explain why. Section 202 of the Act3 draws a -- a distinction between the material object and4 the intellectual property rights that are involved in5 the copyright. And it makes sense. The word "made" is6 not -- does not correspond to the word "reproduced" in7 section 106(1). It's a broader term that can also refer8 to the addition of these necessary intellectual property9 rights.10 And the -- what is, I think, important is11 the decision whether the copy was lawfully made under12 this title will, of course, be made at the time of the13 sale. It is not -- the decision doesn't need to be made14 at the time of -- of manufacture, because the question15 is: How should section 109(a) or another provision16 apply to that particular copy?17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in their brief, the18 brief for the National Library Association indicates at19 the bottom -- the American Library Association indicates20 at the bottom of page 38 that "made" might mean cause to21 exist, cause to appear, and so that it applies the first22 time that U.S. copyright law lawfully could apply; so23 that if you lawfully import it into the United States,24 it would then apply at that time.25 MR. PANNER: Well, I think that that23￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425probably gets us to pretty much the same place, Justice Kennedy. I think the point is -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it makes the exemption work, then, too.MR. PANNER: That's correct, Your Honor.And the -- that also gives effect to the language of 602(a)(1), because section 602(a)(1) is actually written in a very broad term. It's written to apply to copies that have been acquired outside of the United States. I think -- that is, I think, an answer, Justice Breyer, to your objection that any sort of sale ought to suffice.Section 602(a)(1) is designed to permit a U.S. copyright owner to exclude legitimate copies, and if you ask where Congress said that, it's right in the House Committee report, in the legislative history.JUSTICE BREYER: And legitimate copies before there's MR. PANNER: But the JUSTICE BREYER: Andit can. It can exclude a first sale.-­the -- the -­ - Subject to Final Review￼question is -- I mean, the text seems to say 602 expands or falls within 106. All right?So that's what it says. It says -- it says it's an infringement of the exclusive right todistribute copies. That's the 106 right. MR. PANNER: That's correct.241 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE BREYER: And then 109 is an exception from 106. So it's automatically an exception from 602.MR. PANNER: And I think -­JUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's the text. And therefore, you are back at what the meaning of 109 is, if I understand your argument. And it seems to me that's the choice. If you are going to take 109 literally, then everything that comes into the United States can't, without the permission of the copyright holder, but for the exception in (a)(3), and a library that brings them in under (a)(3) cannot even lend out the books. That's one choice.And the other choice is to say that "lawfully made" means it's made without contravening any provision of the Act, if the Act were applicable.MR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor -­JUSTICE BREYER: What's a third choice? Maybe you want a third choice.MR. PANNER: Well, a small qualification, Your Honor. The exception in section 602(a)(3) does allow libraries to lend copies that are imported pursuant to that section. It's for archival or lending purposes.But in any event, I think that that's -- I25 - Subject to Final Review￼ - Subject to Final Review1 don't want to get caught up on the small point. The2 more significant point is that section 602(a)(1) is3 designed to permit a U.S. copyright owner -- as Costco4 admits, it's designed to permit a U.S. copyright owner5 to exclude legitimate copies that are made overseas.6 If the only issue were one of contract,7 there would be no need for section 602(a)(1) because8 there would be no need to create a copyright remedy9 where contractual remedies are sufficient; that is, in10 circumstances where there is privity between the U.S.11 copyright owner or the U.S. copyright owner's direct12 party and the foreign copyright owner.13 JUSTICE BREYER: That's why I started with14 the first sale doctrine, because if you apply the first15 sale doctrine as it traditionally has been applied and16 if you believe that 109 incorporates that, there is17 loads of room for 602(a)(1) to act. That's all the18 instances where the British publisher published -- makes19 the book. What they do is they have a license and they20 try to send it to the United States and they can't21 without permission because of 602(a)(1), and then 10922 doesn't come into play because there's been no first23 sale. That's the part of this case that I'm finding the24 hardest, because, literally, 109(a) -- as you correctly25 point out, 109 doesn't say that literally.26￼ - Subject to Final Review1 MR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor, section2 602(a)(1) refers specifically to copies that have been3 acquired outside of the United States. So it does not4 make sense to say that it's limited to the publisher,5 because the publisher hasn't acquired the copies. It6 has produced the copies.7 JUSTICE BREYER: That's all right.8 MR. PANNER: So I think that the difficulty9 with Costco's reading, by contrast -- and I think that10 some of the Court's questions brought that out this11 morning -- is that either they -- Costco's reading tends12 to eliminate any practical effect for section 602(a)(1)13 by making it not apply to legitimate copies or it makes14 substantive rights turn on formalities of title, which15 is quite inconsistent with the structure of the16 Copyright Act, which actually goes out of its way to17 make clear that the nature of the rights that are held18 by the copyright owner, which is defined to mean the19 owner of any of the many rights that comprise the20 copyright, are the same regardless of whether there's21 been a transfer.￼And so when Costco says, for example, that have the right to exclude foreign-madewere produced by a transferee, but cannot do2223 Omega would24 copies that25 so if it manufactures the copy abroad itself, it really27 - Subject to Final Review1 draws a distinction that has absolutely no basis in the2 text of the Copyright Act and that would make3 substantive rights, the value of the rights under4 602(a)(1) and 106(3), turn on formalities and, again,5 transfers that really should make no difference in terms6 of the substantive rights that are available to the7 copyright owner.89 didn't they10 title," why11 States"?12JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me -- whysay -- instead of "lawfully made under this didn't they just say "made in the UnitedMR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor -­JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that's what you say14 it means. "Made under this title" means "made in the15 United States."16 MR. PANNER: That is not our position, Your17 Honor. Our position is that "lawfully made under this18 title" would include a copy that was manufactured in the19 United States, but that it is not so limited, and that20 if you look at section 1(e) of our brief, we discuss the21 fact that an interpretation of "lawfully made under this22 title" to include a copy that includes the necessary23 licenses for distribution in the United States is a24 consistent reading -- is consistent with the language of25 that provision and gives -- and is consistent with the2813￼ - Subject to Final Review1 traditional2 intended to34 exhausted rights with respect to a particular copy by5 having been compensated for a right that has beenunderstanding that section 109(a) is reflect an exhaustion principle.So where a U.S. copyright owner has6 invested into that copy, that can be included in the7 making.8 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's just not in the9 text. I mean, like the other side, in order to make10 your theory of the text appear reasonable, you have to11 bring in a skyhook with a limitation that finds no basis12 in the text.13 MR. PANNER: I don't think so, Your Honor.14 Again, there is -- because the textual evidence is that15 there is a distinction between reproduction, which is16 the narrow term used in section 106(1), and the broader17 term that is used in section 109(a), which is "made" -­18 and again, that inquiry is always going to occur at the19 time of the challenged sale in the United States.20 And so the question is as to that topic.21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then you are trying to22 rewrite Quality King. Now you are saying that the23 entire premise of Quality King is wrong.24 MR. PANNER: Not at all, Your Honor, because25 in Quality King, what the Court held was that a copy29￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that is made in the United States is lawfully made under this title.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where in Quality King do you see anything Quality King turning on where the goods were made?MR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor, the reason -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I read the decision and it barely mentions that, if at all. Its whole premise was on what the owner did: Did the owner sell this copy?MR. PANNER: I don't think so, Your Honor. What -- there was no challenge in Quality King to the idea that the copy was lawfully made under this title, precisely because the copy was made in the United States where the Copyright Act governs.This Court said in our Descani case that the natural reading under this title is subject to or governed by this title, and therefore it is a perfectly straightforward reading of the text.JUSTICE SCALIA: But you don't say that. I mean, you bring in this other qualification.MR. PANNER: But Your Honor, again, the distinction is between the question whether -- what the conduct that is being addressed is simply the manufacture. That's the case here.30 - Subject to Final Review￼ - Subject to Final Review1 There's -- all that happened here is that2 the copies were manufactured in Switzerland and sold in3 Switzerland for distribution abroad. That does not4 implicate U.S. copyright law at all. U.S. copyright law5 provides the copyright owner with certain rights to6 exclude. It has no right to exclude the making of a7 copy, whatever you want to say the making means, in8 Switzerland. And it is for that reason that the Ninth9 Circuit correctly determined that the copies at issue10 here were not lawfully made11 JUSTICE ALITO:12 situation -­13 JUSTICE SCALIA:14 made under this title, even15 know, made abroad, if what?16 MR. PANNER: If17 pursuant to a license that allowed for distribution in18 the United States, there would be an affirmative19 exercise of the exclusive right that the copyright20 holder has under section 106(3) with respect to that21 particular copy. And so it makes perfect sense to say22 that that copy is lawfully made under this title,23 because you need to look to U.S. law to determine24 whether the making of that copy -- even though it took25 place overseas, for example -- was governed by -- was31under this title.

And it makes perfect sense to say -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you are saying -­￼16 MR. PANNER: In a particular case, it might17 be, Your Honor, but in the typical case -- let's say the18 Heartland case -- if a manufacturer has a license under19 U.S. copyright to distribute in the United States, it20 could be lawfully made at that time.21 But I think, Justice Alito, you were going22 to ask a question about how often the situation arises,23 and I think it's important to point out that there is no24 case that Costco has pointed to, and we are not aware of25 them, where a U.S. copyright owner has sought to32 - Subject to Final Review1 challenge the resale of a copy where there was an2 acknowledged, authorized sale in the United States.3 Obviously, this is a significant issue to4 bringing -­5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they still6 have that right. You say there is no case. But under7 what theory of yours do they not have that right?8 MR. PANNER: Because if the sale is9 authorized in the United States, then that copy would be10 considered lawfully made because it includes the11 license. That copy carries with it a license to be12 distributed in the United States, which would include13 then the right for a lawful owner to resell it. Again,14 that's consistent with the language of "made" and it15 gives proper effect both to section 602(a)(1), which is16 clearly intended to allow the owner of the U.S.17 distribution right to exclude legitimate copies that18 were made overseas, and it also sensibly construes19 section 109(a) to give affect to the exhaustion20 principle that underlies it. Which is where a U.S.21 copyright owner has exercised his U.S. distribution22 rights with regard to a particular copy.23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Panner, can you24 answer Mr. Englert's point what earthly sense would it25 make to prefer goods that are manufactured abroad over33￼ - Subject to Final Review1 those manufactured in the United States?2 MR. PANNER: Your Honor, it doesn't create3 any sort of a preference, as Mr. Englert -- Mr. Englert4 suggests that this is somehow -- prefers the -- the -­5 the copies that are made abroad. But in the same6 breath, he suggests that this will actually promote the7 sale of U.S. -- U.S.-manufactured goods because8 foreign-manufactured goods may therefore be of suspect9 legitimacy for purposes of resale in the United States.10 But the key point is that in Quality King11 this Court looked at the language of section 109(a), and12 it says -- and -- and -- and it emphasized that to13 determine the scope of the first sale doctrine that text14 is what matters. And it says section 109(a) applies to15 goods that are lawfully made under this title.16 There was no dispute that goods that are17 reproduced in the United States are lawfully made under18 this title, because one must have a U.S. -- the U.S.19 right in order to lawfully make a copy in the United20 States.21 JUSTICE BREYER: There's a whole brief filed22 that traces the history of that language, and I think23 comes to a somewhat different conclusion. Do you want24 to say anything about that? It was on the other side.25 MR. PANNER: Well, I think that the -­34￼ - Subject to Final Review1 the -- the tracing of the language is -- is helpful,2 actually, to understand how section -- the current3 section 60 -- excuse me current section 109(a) differs4 from section 27, which is, in section 27, what happened5 was is that Congress codified in 1909 the idea that the6 material object is different from the copyright. And7 when it did that, it added that language as a tag-on to8 that principle to ensure that it did not end up9 overruling legislatively Bobbs-Merrill.10 And when the -- when the Congress recodified11 the provision in 1976, it actually took section 202, put12 it separately, and it -- it codified 109(a) in a way13 that is significantly different and then it says14 notwithstanding the rights under 106(3) the owner of a15 copy lawfully made under this title is entitled to16 resell it.17 And that needs to then be read in harmony18 with section 602(a)(1), which after all, was part of the19 same act in 1976, it must be read in such a way as to20 give section rule 602(a)(1) sufficient room to perform21 the function that it was intended to perform, which is22 to ensure that a U.S. copyright owner could protect23 domestic distribution rights against competition from24 legitimate foreign copies. And that's what it -- that's25 precisely what's at issue here.35￼ - Subject to Final Review1 JUSTICE ALITO: How often do issues2 involving 602(a)(1) come up with respect to things like3 books, musical recordings, movies, as opposed to the4 copyrighted -- the -- the -- the material that is5 copyrighted here, a little -- a little insignia, a place6 toalabel--putonalabelorputona--ongoods?7 MR.

This has been -- this has been applied to11 all sorts of traditional copyrighted materials, and12 indeed that's why the amici who have filed in this case13 are not at all limited but include all of the14 traditional copyright industries, software, publishing,15 movies, music.16 And, indeed, Costco does not argue that17 there is any legal significance to the fact that -- to18 the nature of the image or the fact that it -- that it￼19 is placed on a watch, because I20 quite aware that what is really21 section 602(a)(1) will continue22 protection for the exclusive -­23 JUSTICE BREYER: The other side, if you go24 to--yougoto--gotoHomeDepotandbuyadesk,and25 how do you know -- are you worried that maybe on this36think that Costco isat stake here is whether to provide effective1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425desk it says there was a restriction somewhere, you could only use it for homes and not for offices?

PANNER: Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Stewart? ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART,ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENTMR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:If the government's interpretation of section 109(a) is a little bit different from either of the parties, since I want to make clear precisely what it is, in our view, the words "lawfully made under this title" mean made subject to and in accordance with Title 17. And because the Copyright Act doesn't apply abroad, in order for a copy to be made subject to Title 17, it would have to be created in the United States.Now, I think our interpretation of the statute still gives it a slightly different meaning from the alternative "lawfully made in the United States," because at least in theory, it would be possible for the creation of a copy to entail a violation of environmental laws, workplace safety laws, minimum wage laws, et cetera. And it wouldn't be accurate to characterize a copy made in that way as lawfully made in the United States, but it would be made -- it would be38￼ - Subject to Final Review1 lawfully made under this title, because it would be made2 subject to and in a manner consistent with the3 requirements of the Copyright Act.4 Now, with respect to the types of copyright5 materials at issue here, the watches are clearly very6 different from what Congress had in mind when it enacted7 section 602(a)(1). But in other respects, what Omega8 was trying to do in this case was exactly what Congress9 intended to allow when it expanded the importation10 provisions beyond restrictions on importation of radical11 copies. The ideal was to allow a copyright owner to12 segment markets either to give -- either retain for13 itself or to give to another entity exclusive rights14 within the United States, but give other rights abroad15 to other producers.16 And consequently, we argued in Quality King17 and we are arguing here that the Court should construe18 section 109(a) in a way that doesn't prevent section19 602(a) from performing that function.20 And the Court in Quality King grappled with21 the question of whether applying the -- section 109(a)22 to the labels that were at issue in that case would have23 the effect of negating 602(a)(1) and the Court said no24 it wouldn't, because section 109(a) applies only to25 copies that are lawfully made under this title. And the39￼ - Subject to Final Review1 Court specially said it wouldn't apply to copies that2 were made -- lawfully made under the law of the foreign3 country.4 Now, the Court didn't refer specifically to5 the place of manufacture. In giving the example of the6 British publisher who would be creating copies under the7 law of Great Britain, it didn't specifically say that's8 because British law would apply when the copies are made9 in England. But I think that's the necessary inference,10 because the Court's analysis made quite clear that it11 viewed a particular copy as being lawfully made under12 the law of one and only one question -­13 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what is your answer to14 the argument that if "lawfully made under this title"15 means basically made in the United States, that provides16 a great incentive to manufacture goods abroad and that17 can't possibly be what Congress intended?18 MR. STEWART: Well, I think there are -- I19 think we would say a couple of things. The question has20 been raised whether this gives favored status to a21 foreign manufactured goods. And in one sense our22 reading -- from -- from the perspective of the copyright23 owner, it's true, that this creates something of24 potential incentive to manufacture abroad. Now, from25 the perspective of the potential importer, you could say40￼ - Subject to Final Review1 this makes foreign manufactured goods disfavored because2 they were harder to get into the country than would be3 the case if they had been manufactured within the United4 States and had then been sent abroad and -- and5 reimported.6 I guess the best we can say about the7 treatment from the copyright owners' prospective, the8 differential treatment of foreign and domestic9 manufactured goods is that at least with respect to10 goods that were made within the United States, the11 copyright owner has exercised rights under United States12 law. He has -- it has exercised its exclusive right to13 produce the copies in the first instance, whereas the14 manufacturer in Omega's position by creating and then15 selling the watches abroad, never exercised any of its16 Title 17 rights.17 And the theory underlying the first sale18 doctrine tracing it back to -- to Bobbs-Merrill, the19 first articulation by this Court of the -- the doctrine20 of the copyright context, the theory is that a copyright21 owner who sells the goods, places them in the stream of22 commerce, has exercised, as the Court put it in23 Bobbs-Merrill, its exclusive right to vend, and24 therefore it can claim no more rights under the25 copyright laws.41￼ - Subject to Final Review1 Omega with respect to the2 watches at issue here, never exercised any its rights3 under title 17, not -- not when the watches were made4 and not when they were sold.5 I do also want to address the question of6 what happens in the circumstance where Omega7 manufactures watches abroad, but then voluntarily8 imports them into the United States, sells them here;9 can it place restrictions on resale because I think it's10 an important policy question and here again we get to11 the same point in the end as the Respondents do, but we12 have a somewhat different textual route to get there.13 Our view is that in that circumstance14 section 109(a) still would not apply, because even15 though the goods were imported into the United States,16 they were made abroad, and that's what counts for17 determining whether they were lawfully made under this￼18 title. But section 109(a)19 doesn't prohibit anything.20 conduct falls within these21 doing is legal, whether or22 violate the copyright act.23 But if there is a dispute as to whether24 section 109(a) applies, and a court held that it25 doesn't, the consequence is not necessarily that the42is simply a safe harbor. It Section 109(a) says if yourcontours then what you are not it would otherwise - Subject to Final Review1 conduct is unlawful. The consequence is that you look2 to other provisions of title 17 to see whether it is3 lawful or not.4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in your example, if5 there is a lawful importation of the foreign-made good,6 then if you interpret "made" as causing to exist of7 appear or under these laws, as the library brief8 suggests, the first sale doctrine would operate.9 MR. STEWART: I think we would say the first10 sale doctrine as articulated in Bobbs-Merrill would11 operate, but we wouldn't place this within section12 109(a).13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's the14 problem I have with your position. You are suddenly15 saying a copyright -- these issues have to be resolved16 not within the confines of the Copyright Act, but then17 you have to look to -- to common law as well, which is a18 very confused situation.19 MR. STEWART: I think we would still be20 looking to other provisions of the Copyright Act rather21 than to common law. That is, in the hypothetical I22 describe, clearly there could be no violation of23 602(a)(1), because the copies would have been imported24 by Omega itself. And so the question is if Omega sells25 them within the United States and the buyer attempts to43￼11 once it12 copies,13 assert.14had exercised its exclusive right to vend the it was done with them and had no more rights toAnd there is no reason to give the right to the right to distribute under the current law a reading than the right to vend had at that time, - Subject to Final Review1 resell them, would that be an infringement of Omega 17's2 rights? And the only claim that Omega could -- I mean3 that -- Omega could plausibly make in that circumstance4 would be to say, that is a violation of my exclusive5 right to distribute copies to the public protected by6 section 106(3).7 And I think the response would be under8 Bobbs-Merrill, the Court already held that once the9 copyright owner exercised its exclusive right to vend -­10 the word which appeared at the statute at the time -­￼15 vend --16 broader17 simply because Congress has enacted section 109.And -- so I think that the -- it would still that in order to prevail in a copyright would have to show that not only thatwas inapplicable, but there was a violation1819 be the case20 suit, Omega21 section 10922 of the exclusive rights and I don't think it would be23 able to do that here.24 Now in Bobbs-Merrill, the Court was25 certainly drawing on common law principles but it said44 - Subject to Final Review1 in the end, its words: "This is exclusively a question2 of statutory interpretation." It -- it based its3 holding on the language of the Copyright Act as it4 existed at that time, specifically the exclusive right5 to vend; and the exclusive right to distribute copies to6 the public is no different for these purposes under the7 current statute.8 JUSTICE BREYER: I found the brief I was9 looking for which is the American Intellectual Property10 Law Association. And they trace this back to Professor11 Nimmer's 1965 letter, and they say that the point there12 was that they were reading Bobbs-Merrill as it was a13 pre-emption question, that they thought that the14 copyright law was not pre-empting State law of contract,15 and State law of contract had the exception in it which16 applied the first sale doctrine. Now if that's the17 reasoning, that reasoning would seem to me to apply. We18 could look up what the State law is, but my guess is19 that the first sale doctrine applies just as much to20 goods that come from abroad as to goods that are here at21 home.22 MR. STEWART: I -- I think with -- with23 respect to the pre-emption question, what they had in24 mind was a situation in which Omega sells the watch to a25 reseller -- to a retailer on condition, for instance,45￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that the retailer only sell them in a particular way, or do particular types of advertising, and the reseller sells them in violation.JUSTICE BREYER: What Nimmer said is, he said we want to be sure in his -- in bill back in '64, '65 -- not to invalidate any State law contractual restriction on the right of the owner of the particular copy to dispose, exhibit, et cetera the same.MR. STEWART: Exactly. I think the language was chosen in part at least to make clear that although Omega under in that hypothetical circumstance would have no remedy under the Copyright Act, it might potentially have a breach of contract suit against the retailer if the retailer had breached the agreement with Omega, and that nothing was -- in the Federal law was intended to preempt the State law contractual remedies that would otherwise be available. And I think the language adequately accomplishes that purpose.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why don't we let -­ MR.

STEWART: I think in 1960 -- may I?CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Very briefly.MR. STEWART: Because many of the people with which Congress were concerned would not be in privity of contract with the U.S. copyright owner.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Englert, you have nine minutesremaining.REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.,ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. ENGLERT: Thank you, Your Honor. Justice Ginsberg asked Mr. Panner whatpolicy Congress could have had in mind to give this different status to foreign-made goods than to U.S. made goods, and Mr. Panner's answer, and Mr. Stewart said something similar, was that in one respect Congress is disfavoring foreign goods under their interpretation by making them harder to import. That's not true.Under both of their theories, as long as the manufacturer chooses to authorize importation, which is Omega's test, or as long as an authorized first sale takes place in the United States, then the first sale doctrine does apply. So the copyright holder has control under their theory and it's not harder to import47 - Subject to Final Review￼ - Subject to Final Review1 the goods.2 In the briefs in this case you will not find3 anyone making any policy argument as to what Congress4 could have had in mind to favor foreign-manufactured5 goods.6 The heart of Mr. Panner's argument was that7 Costco's position either eliminates any significant role8 for section 602(a)(1) or makes section 602(a)(1) turn on9 formalities of transfer of title. Neither of those10 propositions is true. This Court in Quality King11 addressed the role that section 602(a)(1) has to play if12 section 109 is applicable to imported goods, and the13 answer was it still applies to nonowners. That was the14 Court's first answer.￼The dictum that has been much discussed this another answer but the Court's first answer still applies to nonowners, and because, for1516 morning was17 was that it18 example, software is licensed there is a very live issue19 about whether the first sale doctrine applies to20 lawfully acquired copies of -- of software. So21 602(a)(1) has a role to play under anyone's22 interpretation.23 Now Mr. Panner asserts that our answers to24 some of the questions that the Court has asked in our25 efforts to harmonize our position with the dictum in48 - Subject to Final Review1 Quality King make 602(a)(1) turn on formalities of2 transfer of title. Our position can perhaps be3 criticized and has been criticized this morning not for4 having a textual basis, but it cannot be criticized for5 making anything turn on formalities.6 Our position turns on the economic realities7 of the situation. If the copyright owner gets its one8 reward, the first sale doctrine applies; if the9 copyright owner doesn't get its run reward, because for10 example it has given the exclusive foreign manufacturing11 rights to someone else, and retained or assigned or12 licensed the exclusive U.S. manufacturing rights, then13 602(a)(1) has a role to play. So neither of Mr.14 Panner's criticisms of our position is correct.15 Mr. Panner asserted that section 109(a)16 differs from section 27, the predecessor statute in the17 1947 Act, which in turn was Section 41 of the 1909 Act.18 This Court said the exact opposite in Quality King.19 It said there is no evidence of any attempt20 to narrow the first sale doctrine through the language21 of section 109(a). And if one looks at the House22 report -- again, getting into legislative history, which23 some members of the Court do not like to get into -- but24 if one looks at the House report, the first sentence of25 the relevant part of the House report is section 109(a)49￼ - Subject to Final Review1 restates and confirms the principle that where the2 copyright owner has transferred ownership of a3 particular copy or phonorecord of a work, the person to4 whom the copy or phonorecord is transferred is entitled5 to dispose of it by sale, rental or other means. No6 hint that using "lawfully made" under this title to7 narrow the doctrine.8 The last sentence of the relevant part of9 the House report: To come within the scope of section10 109(a) a copy or phonorecord must have been lawfully11 made under this title though not necessarily with the12 copyright owner's authorization. For example, any13 resale of an illegally pirated phonorecord would be an14 infringement, but the disposition of a phonorecord15 legally made under the compulsory licensing provisions16 of section 115, would not.17 So what does the House report on section 10918 tell us? It tells us that lawfully made under this19 title was intended to expand the category of covered20 works beyond just those made by the copyright owner, or21 with the authorization of the copyright owner. But22 under Omega's and the government's position, that phrase23 is used to contract the scope of the first sale doctrine24 in derogation of the common law, imposing a restraint on25 alienation for foreign-made goods that is not imposed on50￼ - Subject to Final Review1 U.S.-made goods.2 With respect to the policy incentives that3 it creates it's undeniable that it creates an incentive4 for outsourcing of manufacture. The government admitted5 that in its cert stage brief, and again, in its brief in6 this Court. Obviously if Congress wants to create an7 incentive for outsourcing, that's probably within its8 power as long as it can be said somehow to advance9 science and the useful arts; but there is simply not a10 shred of evidence in text or legislative history that11 Congress intended to encourage outsourcing; quite the12 contrary.13 The very controversial section 601, the14 adjacent section to section 602, required that15 nondramatic literary works in the English language be16 manufactured in the United States or Canada or else they17 would not be eligible for a U.S. copyright. So we know18 that the 1976 Congress wanted to favor the domestic19 printing industry, not to disfavor it; and yet their20 interpretation of 602 and 109 would disfavor domestic21 printing industry and any domestic manufacturing22 industry.
