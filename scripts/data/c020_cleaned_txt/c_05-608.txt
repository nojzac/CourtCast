KESTER       ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERMR. KESTER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          As of this morning, it is exactly 70 years ago101112131415161718192021222324   royalties under protest in the meantime.  That complaint25   was ordered dismissed by the Federal Circuit as outside3to the day, minus 4 months, that this Court heard argumentchallenging the new Federal Declaratory Judgment Act of1934, in an action to construe an insurance contract.          And exactly 25 years -- 25 days later, in aunanimous opinion written by Chief Justice Hughes, joinedby Justices Stone, Brandeis, and others, the Act was heldfully consistent with Article III of the Constitution.          This morning, you are here because an action wasbrought for a declaratory judgment that a biomedicalmanufacturer need not play -- pay large sums, under alicense as patent royalties, under a patent it contends isinvalid, unenforceable, and not infringed, but is paying￼ - Subject to Final Review1   the Article III judicial power of the United States.2             In detail, the Petitioner, MedImmune, is a3   biotech company, formed in 1988.  During the 1990s --4 5 6 7 8 9          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Kester, would it --          MR. KESTER:  Yes?          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- would it -- wouldyour position be different if the contract contained aspecific -- the license -- a specific provision specifyingthat the licensee may not sue?1011121314151617   defense if such -- if such a claim were raised.  This case18   is here at the level of subject-matter jurisdiction.19             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me, I don't -- I don't20   understand what you just said.  You mean, it would be21   enforceable; that if such a suit were brought, the22   licensor could raise that contractual provision as a basis23   for dismissing the suit.  Is that --24             MR. KESTER:  Under 12- -- under 12(b)(6) --25             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.4          MR. KESTER:  No, it would not, Your Honor,because --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You -- do you think sucha provision would be enforceable?          MR. KESTER:  I doubt it would be enforceable.It would be a matter -- under the Lear case, Lear againstAdkins, it would be an -- it would be an affirmative￼ - Subject to Final Review 1             MR. KESTER:  -- perhaps. 2             JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, then it is enforceable. 3             JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but -- 4             MR. KESTER:  No. 5             JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- your point is, it's not 6   jurisdictional. 7             MR. KESTER:  It's not jurisdictional, exactly, 8   Justice Souter.  This is a jurisdictional ruling.  And 9   that's all that this Court granted certiorari on.10             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but as a matter of11   policy, we, at some point, either in this case or some12   later case, may have to address the question of whether or13   not such a provision is enforceable.  If it is, we may be14   -- not be talking about much.  It's just going to be15   boilerplate in every license agreement, and that's the end16   of it.  And it --1718192021222324   part, in 1969.  Provisions in license contracts that25   prevent challenges to the contracts are not enforceable5MR. KESTER:  And so --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- but it -- on the otherhand, it may be that there are reasons not to enforcethis, so that we don't have courts flooded with lawsuits,et cetera, et cetera.          MR. KESTER:  And those reasons, I would suggest,Justice Kennedy, were taken care of in Lear, for the most￼ - Subject to Final Review1   under the patent laws of the United States.  But then, I2   -- as I was saying, that is a matter of patent law.3   That's not a matter of jurisdictional law.  We're here --4             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, let's look at what5   might be a matter of jurisdictional law.  I take it, from6   your position, there's nothing preventing Genentech from7   suing, either, is there?  In other words, to establish the8 910111213141517   controversy?     validity of their patent.               MR. KESTER:  It has -- it has happened, on     various occasions, that patentees have brought suit to     establish the validity of --               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Against licensees?               MR. KESTER:  Against licensees and others.  Andthe --               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Against licensees who are not16   claiming that the patent is invalid?  And where is the18192021222324   royalties.  The patentee could also be putting ads in the25   paper saying, "This is not a valid patent."  It could --6          MR. KESTER:  The controversy could arise in anynumber of ways.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I mean, I can see, if the --if licensee says the patent is invalid, that the patenteesays paying its royalties -- how does it --MR. KESTER:  The patentee could be paying his￼ - Subject to Final Review1   it could have acquired a lot of publicity.  And, in the2   end, there could be reasons, and there have been such3   cases -- which we cited, 47 of, our brief -- where such4   suits have been brought.  But --5 6 7 8 9          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If it -- if the -- if the --if the licensee came into court and said, "I'm notcontesting this patent," that would be the end of it,wouldn't it?          MR. KESTER:  If the licensee said, "I am notcontesting that patent," that could be.101112   would just say, "Look, we have a license.  I think the13   patent's valid, and you owe me a dollar a unit."  The14   licensee said, "Well, I don't think they're -- it's valid,15   so I owe you nothing."  And they settle on a license for16   50 cents.  Why can't the patentee say, "You know, if I get17   a judicial decision establishing that the patent is valid,18   I can charge a higher license, either when this agreement19   expires or for other licenses"?20             MR. KESTER:  That -- I agree with that, Mr.21   Chief Justice.  But the practicality is that a patentee22   starts out with, essentially, a judgment that the patent23   is valid.  There is a presumption of validity.  And to24   challenge that patent -- that presumption of validity, is25   a very difficult undertaking.  Most of them don't bother.7CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, but the patentee￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   Why would they?  If they are receiving -- if they're 2   receiving -- 3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm trying to see how 4   far you want -- are willing to push your argument that 5   just because there's been an agreement, or perhaps even a 6   settlement, that that somehow or another doesn't moot the 7   controversy, the underlying legal dispute.  And it -- I 8   gather your answer to me is that Genentech, or a patentee, 9   can sue, even though they have an existing -- they're10   getting royalties from the licensee, they can still sue11   the licensee.12             MR. KESTER:  A settlement does not deprive a13   Federal Court of subject-matter jurisdiction.  That's the14   narrow point that is before this -- before this Court.15             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why aren't you -- you said,16   "The only question before the court is jurisdictional."17   If that's so, why isn't your position that the Federal18   Circuit put the wrong label on this, that license is19   listed in 8(c) as an affirmative defense; so, whatever the20   outcome should be, the wrong label should -- is -- was21   used.  It shouldn't be a subject-matter jurisdiction,22   shouldn't be 12(b)(1); it should be an 8(c) affirmative23   defense.  And then the -- you're out of the jurisdiction24   box, but you're left with the same underlying question.25             MR. KESTER:  But not the same underlying8￼9 10 11 12 13 1412(b)(6) --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what --          MR. KESTER:  -- motion.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- good would it do?  Supposewe said, "Federal Circuit, you put the wrong label on it.It should be 12(b)(6), not 12(b)(1), or perhaps even 8(c), - Subject to Final Review1   question, Justice Ginsburg, with respect, because then you2   are in a situation like the business forms case in the3   Seventh Circuit, which came out shortly after the Lear.4   There was a settle -- settlement, and the -- and it was5   argued that the settlement was not effective because of6   the Lear decision, and parties can't settle themselves out7   of the Lear decision.  But that is all under 12(b)(6), and8   not 12(b)(1).  This case involves a 12(b)(1) motion, not a15   affirmative defense"?  Then you go back to the Federal16171819202122232425Circuit, and they'll come up with the same decision, that,as long as you are licensed and are paying your royalties,you have -- and they just put a different label on it --you have --          MR. KESTER:  They --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- you have no -- you havenot stated a claim.          MR. KESTER:  That would be effectivelyoverruling Lear, which is what, I think, is what many ofthe parties in this case actually seek to do.9￼ - Subject to Final Review1             Lear does not allow inhibitions of challenges to2   patent licenses.  A licensee can challenge the validity,3   the enforceability of the patent.  That's because there's4   a public interest in this, as well.  Parties cannot simply5 6 7 8 9contract with each other and prevent a challenge to a --to a patent --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But then --          MR. KESTER:  -- license.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- the Federal Circuitdistinguished Lear, and said what -- in Lear, the licensee1011   had stopped paying royalties.  Isn't that so?12             MR. KESTER:  That -- those were the facts of13   Lear.  But -- it happened that way in Lear, but that14   wasn't the reasoning of Lear.  Lear would not totally15   cover that situation, but we would submit to this Court,16   it shouldn't make any difference.  The reasoning of Lear17   is the same.  The licensee cannot, by contract, be18   estopped, licensee estoppel, from challenging a patent.19             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, there's no way, I --20   under your view, that a patent holder can protect itself21   from suit through any license arrangement or any agreement22   of any kind.23             MR. KESTER:  I suspect there are many ways, Mr.24   Chief Justice, but not by throwing them out on a25   jurisdictional basis at the very first moment of the10￼1   lawsuit.234JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How about -- - Subject to Final Review          MR. KESTER:  There may be ways this could bearranged at the second level, through --56789   licensee sues, then the royalty fees will be upped.  Would          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, what are those ways --I mean, the ones that have been mentioned as possibilitiesin the Government brief -- one, you rejected, and theother that was mentioned was: if you sue -- if the10   that be effective?11             MR. KESTER:  That is a question that would arise12   under Lear against Adkins.  And the question before this13   Court in that situation, if it got to this Court, would14   be, Is that kind of a provision compatible with the policy15   that was so firmly expressed by Justice Harlan in Lear,16   and has been reiterated in so many subsequent cases of17   this Court?18             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, you have rejected both of19   the Government's suggestions on what the patent holder20   might do to protect itself.  Do you have anything concrete21   that you would concede the patent holder could do?22             MR. KESTER:  I don't think that I have rejected23   both the Government's suggestions.  I've said that they24   raise problems on -- as to the scope of Lear.25             JUSTICE SOUTER:  With respect to -- whether we11￼ - Subject to Final Review1   are talking about a jurisdictional defense or whether we2   are talking about an affirmative defense, assuming3   jurisdiction, is there any -- is there any reason for us4   to accept your position, other than the reason that you5   have mentioned a number of times, and that is the adoption6   and encouragement of a public policy that allows patent7   challenges freely?  Is that the nub of our reasoning, if89 10 11 12 13 1416   Altvater, wasn't there?17             MR. KESTER:  That -- but that -- but was --18             JUSTICE SOUTER:  Which raises an entirely19   different policy issue?20             MR. KESTER:  Well, I would say what it -- what21   it raises is simply an extra fact, but it wasn't a22   necessary fact.  Because this Court, in Altvater,23   specifically pointed out that even if there weren't an24   injunction there, there would be -- there would be the25   danger forced on the licensee, of an infringement suit;12we were to support your position, either jurisdictionally,in this case, or in recognizing -- or the -- in dealingwith the affirmative defense in another case?          MR. KESTER:  Not quite, Justice Souter.  I wouldsay the nub of your position is the Altvater case, theAetna case, the Maryland --               JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, Altvater is difficult for15   you, isn't it?  Because there was an injunction in￼1819202122232425          JUSTICE SOUTER:  No --          MR. KESTER:  -- in Aetna.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, I realize that.  But, Imean, what we've got in this case, and in any of thesecases, is a question of line-drawing under Article III.And your argument is, you want to draw the line where youwant it drawn primarily because there are practicalreasons to favor a public policy of free challenge.13 - Subject to Final Review1   and an infringement suit means, possibly, an injunction of2   the patent, treble damages, any number of sanctions.  An3   injunction suit can put a company out of business,4   especially like a company like my client here.  And --5             JUSTICE SOUTER:  But that is -- that is a good6   reason.  And, I take it, it's your logic that that is a7 8 9good reason to recognize a fairly broad right on the partof the licensee to challenge.          MR. KESTER:  Right.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  In other words, the nub of yourposition, as I understand it, is the public policy thatfavors relative --10111213141516   policy, it's Article III.  Article III says that you can17   bring a lawsuit in this situation.  And that was settled --MR. KESTER:  It --JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- freedom to challenge --MR. KESTER:  It's more -- it's more than public￼ - Subject to Final Review1             MR. KESTER:  What we are presenting in this case2   is a dispute about money.  It's not abstract.  It's not3   hypothetical.  It's not conjectural.  It is concrete,4   immediate.  All the facts are in.  It's definitely5   adversarial.  It's legal.6789   doesn't create a case or controversy.  What is the injury,          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- well, you can have sucha dispute on a theoretical question between, I don't know,the ACLU and the National Rifle Association, but that1011121314151617   to pay, because this is an invalid patent."  Money is18   being paid by my client every quarter, large amounts of19   money.  That is a major injury.20             JCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if you don't --21             MR. KESTER:  And if --22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- think --23             MR. KESTER:  And if --24             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- if you don't think --25             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is it -- is it unlawful to14the imminent injury to your -- to your client that is thebasis for the case or controversy?MR. KESTER:  The --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is it anything other than, "Ihave to pay the royalties that I agreed to pay."?          MR. KESTER:  It is the -- it is that, "I amhaving to pay the royalties -- that I say I did not agree￼ 91011121314151617181923 24 25          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, then why are youpaying it, if you -- if you don't think you owe it?          MR. KESTER:  Because the --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Because of the threat oftreble damages --          MR. KESTER:  The threat --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- and injunction.          MR. KESTER:  -- of this --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If we're trying tofigure out where the public policy is here, why don't we - Subject to Final Review1234567   what we agreed to.  We're saying this is a contract8   dispute.  And the whole purpose of the --agree to pay somebody money who does not have a patent?          MR. KESTER:  It is --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, you're speaking asthough somehow that -- such a contract is contrary topublic policy, and void.MR. KESTER:  No, we're saying that that isn't     give some weight to those congressional enactments that20   obviously fortify the strength of the patent?  In other21   words, Congress passed these provisions providing for22   treble damages for attorneys' fees.  And --          MR. KESTER:  But --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- and to respond thatthere's got to be a public policy to counterbalance that,15￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   Congress can always do that, if it wants; but it didn't -- 2   it thinks that you need these provisions to protect the 3   patent holders. 4             MR. KESTER:  But, Mr. Chief Justice, 5   Congress can also amend the Declaratory Judgment Act, if 6   it wants.  And Congress was proud of the Declaratory 7   Judgment Act when it was passed in 1934.  And the 8   legislative history of it -- and nothing in the text is 9   contrary, says the purpose of this is so that contracts10   can be resolved without breach, and judicial11   determinations can be had.  It's like a noninvasive, a12   less invasive kind of surgery.13             JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Kester, may I ask you this14   question?  Is it your view that Gen-Probe represented a1516171819202122232425change in the law?          MR. KESTER:  Absolutely.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Were there -- before Gen-Probewas decided, were there any cases, like this case, thatwere decided?          MR. KESTER:  There were many, Your Honor, andthey were decided --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Where the -- where thelicensee brought suit challenging validity while thelicense was still in full --          MR. KESTER:  We --16￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7   satisfied." 8             This case came as a shock in 2004.  And, in 9   fact, the judges below, in this series of cases, all said,10   "We thought it was settled law the other way."  All thisJUSTICE STEVENS:  -- force?          MR. KESTER:  We had suits in the Third Circuit,the Seventh Circuit, the Second Circuit, and even in theFederal Circuit, in its early days, where it quoted thosecases which said, "It is not necessary for the licensee tostop paying payments in order for Article III to be1112131415161718192021   about their legal rights and obligations.  If that dispute22   is resolved, money will change hands.  That is an Article23   III case or controversy.24             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How do you ever end25   these things?  Let's say they have this dispute, they17case represents, from our point of view, is, "Let's goback to the way it has always been."I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. Kester.Ms. Maynard.ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E.

MAYNARD:  If there were to be a settlement,in the second case, the -- it would not be an Article III171819202122   easily resolved, on that ground.  But, in terms of thethat suit should not be dismissed under 12(b)(1).          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.          MS. MAYNARD:  The -- in that case, the patentholder might have a valid 12(b)(6) defense, and the suit,laying aside enforceability issues that you raised, may be￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   the question before the Court right now -- as a policy 2   matter, the -- it's not clear from this Court's cases 3   exactly what types of agreements would be enforceable.  I 4   think there's a spectrum of cases one can imagine, ranging 5   from Pope -- the type of promise that was extracted in 6   Pope, which this Court held was unenforceable -- 7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I think you 8   overread Pope.  All Pope said was that they're not going 9   to grant specific performance.  In fact, they've said,10   "Whatever you may think of the policy here, we don't --11   specific performance calls on the equitable discretion,12   and we're not going to do it."  But, I don't read Pope as13   holding that the clauses are otherwise unenforceable.  In14   --15             MS. MAYNARD:  Well --16             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- other words you're17   maybe entitled to damages.  And that may be measured by18   the license fee that you agreed to pay.19             MS. MAYNARD:  Well, there certainly would be a20   question, though, the way that Lear read Pope, and under21   Lear, about whether a bare agreement not to challenge22   licenses, especially ones like in Pope, where they agreed23   not to challenge the license, even beyond the term, would24   be enforceable.  And the Government thinks there's a25   spectrum.  One -- at one end of the spectrum would be19￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   licenses like those in Pope, and at the other end of the 2   spectrum would be a consent decree entered after 3   settlement of a bona fide patent infringement suit where 4   the -- which included an agreement not to settle.  Now, 5   that's clearly not what we have here. 6             JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, is -- if -- I guess there 7   are three possible positions on the question of whether a 8   licensee can attack a contract, a patent where he has a 9   license and wants to keep the contract.  One, he can never10   do it.  Two, he can always do it.  Three, it depends on11   what the contract says.  Now, do any of those questions               MS. MAYNARD:  No, Your Honor.               JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  If we were to reach     the question, which is very interesting, "What is the     Government's position as to which of those three positions     is the right position?" -- were we to reach it -- I agree     with you, I don't see it in front of us; but maybe it is     -- if it were, what would be your view?have anything to do with the question before us, which iswhether it is a case or controversy?121314151617181920212223   -- you would have to consider each case on its terms.  And24   it's not clear, from this Court's cases, where the          MS. MAYNARD:  The Government's view is thatthere's a spectrum along the spectrum, and it would have25   policies in that --20￼ - Subject to Final Review 1             JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So, basically, 2   though, you're not certain.  The Government's view would 3   be, it is a matter as to whether you can sue claiming the 4   patent is invalid, whether the licensee can do it, that 5   probably -- but you're not certain, and you haven't made 6   up your mind definitely, because it is not in this case -- 7   but you think it's going to be something they could 8   regulate themselves by contract. 9             MS. MAYNARD:  It's certainly not foreclosed by10   this Court's precedent, and it's an open question where11   the policies -- how they would weigh out.  There's no12   language in this license, however, suggesting any type of13   settlement.  And, moreover, I think it's important to14   recognize that the parties here actually have a concrete15   dispute about what the licensing agreement means.  Count16   one in the complaint is asking for a declaration --17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you don't think18   that matters, though, do you?  I mean, even if they all19   agree there's no dispute about what the license agreement20   means, your position is still the same, right?  There is21   an Article III controversy because they challenge the22   validity of the patent?23             MS. MAYNARD:  If the parties have a concrete24   dispute about the validity of the patent, and it would25   affect their rights and obligations in the way that it21￼22 23 24 25contract or a question of --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Contractually?  They say thatthat's their contractual right?          MS. MAYNARD:  They claim that, under the22 - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7   on an invalid patent?  You thought it was valid -- parties 8   had a dispute about it -- whether it is valid.  You 9   entered into agreement, say, "Well, let's split the10   difference.  We'll -- you know, 50 cents rather than a11   dollar or nothing."  It's determined that the patent is12   invalid.  Can the patentee then still say, "Well, you13   still owe me the money.  We've, kind of, cut -- split the14   difference.  That was part of the agreement"?15             MS. MAYNARD:  It might depend on whether there16   was consideration beyond the patent itself.  In the -- in17   this -- in this case, though, the Petitioner claims that18   if the -- if the patent is invalid, they no longer owe19   licensing fees, and, under Lear, they would be entitled to20   the licensing fees, that they've paid since they began21   challenging, back.  So, it's clear that under either thewould here -- in other words, that money will no longer bedue to the Respondents if the patent's invalid --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is --MS. MAYNARD:  -- and the --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- that always the case?I mean, could -- can you enforce a license agreement based￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   licensing agreement, they only owe royalties on valid 2   claims.  That's count one of the complaint, in the (j) -- 3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where does that appear in the 4   licensing agreement?  Or -- 5             MS. MAYNARD:  Where does it appear in the 6   licensing agreement? 7             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, I took them as just 8   asserting a general proposition of law -- that, where 9   they've agreed to pay royalties because of a patent, if10   the patent is invalid, they don't have to pay royalties --11   not because there's some special provision in this12   contract.13             MS. MAYNARD:  The parties actually have a14   concrete dispute about the meaning of the licensing15   agreement in that regard, Justice Scalia.  On page 399 of16   the joint appendix is the provision about which they have17   a dispute.  And the language in there provides that they18   will pay on substances which would, if not licensed under19   this agreement, infringe one or more claims of either or20   both of the Shamir patents, or coexpression patents, which21   have neither expired nor been held invalid by a court or22   other body of competent jurisdiction.  There was similar23   language in --24             JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, there's really not much at25   issue in this case.  And that's clearly a case of23￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   controversy, isn't it?  There is a dispute over the 2   meaning of that provision of the agreement. 3             MS. MAYNARD:  Yes, Your Honor. 4             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Gee, there's less here than 5   meets the eye. 6             MS. MAYNARD:  That's what the Government 7   believes, Your Honor. 8             It's also -- the licensee also does not need to 9   breach the licensing agreement in order to create a case10   or controversy.  The licensee is currently paying11   royalties that it does not believe it owes and that it12   believes it would be entitled to have back if it should13   prevail on its interpretation of the -- of the patent and14   the licensing agreement.  It doesn't have to make that15   injury more severe by breaching.  That's clear from this16   Court's decision in Altvater.  In Altvater, royalties were17181920212223   reasoning.  What the Court said is, "You need not suffer24   patent damages in order to bring the suit."  Not a25   contempt.  "You need not breach the injunction and put24being demanded and royalties were being paid, but,nevertheless, this Court held --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but that -- it'sbeen pointed out that was pursuant to an injunction.          MS. MAYNARD:  Yes, it was pursuant toinjunction, but that was not important to the Court's￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   yourself at risk of treble damages for infringement."  It 2   was the patent damages that put the licensee at risk, and 3   that's the same risk that the Petitioner faces here and 4   should not have to bear in order to bring suit. 5             The case or controversy is whether or not the -- 6   they owe the royalties.  The whole point of the 7   Declaratory Judgment Act was to allow contracting parties 8   not to have to sever their ongoing contractual relations 9   in order to get disputes resolved between --10             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you think --11             MS. MAYNARD:  -- themselves.12             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you think there would13   be a case or controversy if Genentech were suing to14   establish the validity of its patent?15             MS. MAYNARD:  In the situation that we have16   here, Your Honor?17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes.18             MS. MAYNARD:  Yes, I do.  Where the Petitioner19   claims that the patent is invalid, that they could -- that20   the Petitioner's claims unsettles their right, damages21   their property value, potentially, and that they could22   bring a declaratory judgment action of validity.23             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And what would their -- what24   would their concrete injury be?  What is the threatened25   imminent injury that they would assert in that -- in that25￼ - Subject to Final Review1 action?2             MS. MAYNARD:  Well, right now --3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  You have a licensee who's4   paying the license fees.  What is their concrete injury?5             MS. MAYNARD:  It -- from the moment -- the6   Petitioner has an argument that from the moment it ceased7   -- it starts claiming that the patent is invalid and pays8   under protest, that it is entitled to those royalties9 back.1011121314   disagreement?  I mean, it's sort of like the ACLU saying15   that the patent's invalid.  You know, it's a niceJUSTICE SCALIA:  But --MS. MAYNARD:  The --JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- so long as they're stillpaying the royalties, isn't that sort of an abstract16   theoretical question that we can argue about, but as long17   as they're paying the royalties, where's the concrete18 injury? 19202122232425          MS. MAYNARD:  Well, I think, technically,Justice Scalia, they probably have a claim for patentinfringement, to which the defense, as Justice Ginsburg --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I --          MS. MAYNARD:  -- points out --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I find it --          MS. MAYNARD:  -- would be an easy defense.26￼ - Subject to Final Review 1             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I -- 2             MS. MAYNARD:  So, there's not an Article III 3   lack of case or controversy, which is -- 4             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I find it -- 5             MS. MAYNARD:  -- what's the question before -- 6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- very difficult -- 7             MS. MAYNARD:  -- the Court. 8             JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- to see how there would be a 9   proper declaratory judgment action brought by the patentee10   here.  It's just not the kind of a situation where you can11   have a mirror-image suit.  I don't see what the --MS. MAYNARD:  Well, you need --JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- patentee --MS. MAYNARD:  You -- may I answer that question?1213141516   Justice Scalia.  And Altvater makes that clear.  In171819202122232425Altvater, the patentee's claim was --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's fine.          MS. MAYNARD:  -- much narrower than thecounterclaim; and, nevertheless, the Court allowed thatcounterclaim to proceed.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.          Ms. Mahoney.           ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY                 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT27You need not have a mirror-image suit, in that sense,￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4   four counts in the complaint for declaratory relief.  The 5   first one is styled as a -- contractual relations claims. 6   The other three are styled as patent law claims.  And it's 7   important to emphasize, at the outset, that this Court, in 8   Skelly Oil, in Calderone, and in, really, all of the 9   cases, has said it's very important to look behind the10   labels that a Declaratory Judgment Act plaintiff puts on11   their claims.  We need to actually see what is the cause12   of action they're trying to adjudicate so we can do an13   accurate assessment of justiciability -- standing,14   ripeness, Federal-question jurisdiction.15             I want to start by explaining why there is no16   contract claim at issue here.  You heard today, they're17   trying to salvage this, say that there's a contract18   dispute, a dispute about the terms of the contract.  They19   didn't argue that below, and with good reason.  And I'd20   just point you to the briefs in the Federal Circuit.21   Roman numeral I, which is all about the improper dismissal22   of the Declaratory Judgment Act claims, refers to the fact23   these are, quote, "patent-law claims," end quote, at page24   27.  Nowhere do they say that there is a dispute about the25   proper interpretation of the contract terms.  And let me28          MS. MAHONEY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:I'd like to start with the fact that there are￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   explain why. 2             The contract terms, which were just read to you, 3   is Section 110 of -- 1.10 at JA-399 of the license -- says 4   that there is an obligation to pay royalties for Synagis 5   on any claim -- not any valid claim, any claim -- that has 6   not been held invalid by a court or other competent 7   jurisdiction from which no appeal has, or may, be taken. 8   Now, they never said, below, "That clause means that we 9   can come to court and have the court decide whether this10   patent is valid, and, depending on whether we win or not,11   then we can stop paying."  And the reason they didn't make12   that argument is, it was rejected by this Court a hundred13   years ago, in United States versus Harvey Steel.  Very14   similar clause.  The United States says, "This means that15   we don't have to pay if the patent is invalid."  And, in16   an opinion by Justice Holmes, this Court rejected it out17   of hand by -- and said, "This was a conventional proviso.18   We don't even need to look to evidence of the party's19   intent, because this is the standard proviso.  It does not20   mean" -- and they said it was a "twisted interpretation"21   that the Government was offering -- it doesn't mean that22   the licensee, quote, "thought the patent bad and would23   like to have the Court say so now," end quote.  Yet that24   is exactly --25             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Was that a case about Article29￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   III case or controversy? 2             MS. MAHONEY:  It is, in the following sense, 3   Your Honor.  They can't just show up here today and say, 4   "Well, there really is a dispute about the contract."  But 5   they never argued, below, and is foreclosed -- 6             JUSTICE BREYER:  Shouldn't we send that back?  I 7   mean, I thought we were here to decide one question, that 8   the Federal Circuit has said that, "Unless there is a 9   reasonable apprehension of a lawsuit, you can't bring a10   declaratory judgment action, because of the Constitution11   of the United States."  Now, I have to admit, I've looked12   up, or I've had my law clerk look up, probably now13   hundreds of cases, and we can't find, in any case, such a14   requirement.  Indeed, the very purpose -- as I -- we've15   just heard the SG say, of this act, the Declaratory16   Judgment Act, seems to be to allow people who -- a17   contract -- who are in a real concrete disagreement, to18   get a declaratory judgment without getting rid of the19   contract.  But I might be wrong about that.20             But you've now argued a different point.21             MS. MAHONEY:  Well --22             JUSTICE BREYER:  So, isn't the right thing for23   us to do, to decide the issue in front of us and then send24   it back?  If you're right that they have to pay, whether25   they win or lose; if they're right that they promise not30￼7 8 9didn't address it, because they didn't argue it, becauseit's foreclosed by -- - Subject to Final Review1   to sue; if you're right on 14 other grounds, you might2   win.  But should we decide those grounds today?  Why?          MS. MAHONEY:  Well, first of all, with respectto this issue, whether there would be jurisdiction over areal live contract dispute, they never argued it, Your3456   Honor.  It's not part of this case.  The Federal CircuitJUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the question --MS. MAHONEY:  -- a precedent a hundred --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The question that is10111213141516171819   the cause of action they're seeking to adjudicate.  In20   here, what the Federal Circuit properly understood is that21   they are seeking to adjudicate affirmative defenses to an22   infringement action under the patent laws.23             And, just like in Steffel, if you're trying to24   adjudicate, on an anticipatory basis, an enforcement25   action, you have to show that you would reasonably fear31presented to us -- whatever they suggested at this oralargument that wasn't in III, the question it presented tous is, Was the Federal Circuit right when they said, "Youhave no access to a declaratory judgment unless there is areasonable apprehension that you will be sued"?          MS. MAHONEY:  Your Honor, that is the right --that is the right starting point for a test, depending on￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   that enforcement action.  And, in fact, Steffel uses that 2   language, and Poe versus Ullman dismisses a case for 3   failure to establish a genuine fear of prosecution.  But 4   then, you have to go one step beyond, and that is to say, 5   Are they -- is the cause of action not ripening because 6   the declaratory judgment plaintiff is forfeiting their 7   legal rights in order to avoid some very severe harm that 8   would be cognizable coercion?  That's the test that's used 9   in Steffel for -- in essence, being able to test a --10   defenses to a cause of action that --11             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And why --12             MS. MAHONEY:  -- an enforcement action.13             JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- doesn't that work here?14             MS. MAHONEY:  It doesn't work here, for several15   reasons.  Most fundamentally, this is a settlement.  I16   mean, Mr. Steffel did not enter into a settlement or a17   compromise with the prosecutor.  He wasn't complying18   because he was under an agreement to do so.  Here, it has19202122232425   characterization that it's a compromise?  As I -- andbeen settled for -- forever, that if a -- an agreement --if you're making payments pursuant to an agreement, in thenature of a compromise, you can't come and say that it'sbeen coerced or it's a form of duress.JUSTICE SCALIA:  What is the --JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why should we accept the32￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   maybe I'm just factually wrong here?  I thought, at the 2   time they entered into the license agreement, they had 3   some disagreements about the scope of the then-patent, the 4   scope of the anticipated patent, and so on, and they 5   couldn't very well be resolved.  But they were -- they 6   were not settling, in the -- in the classic sense of the 7   word, a -- let us say, a focus claim, one against the 8   other. 9             MS. MAHONEY:  I think the answer, Your Honor,10   is, they weren't settling, for all time, in the sense that11   they could never get out of the deal.  Certainly, they12   could repudiate and then go ahead and sue.  But yet, at13   page 3 of their petition, they expressly say, the reason14   they entered into this agreement was in order to avoid the15   costs and risks of litigation.  It is the reason --16             JUSTICE SOUTER:  But had they gotten to the17   point, prior to the execution of the contract, in which18   one party was saying, "You may not do this," and the other19   party was saying, "Oh, yes I can," so that there -- there20   was a focus controversy that would have been the subject21   matter of a conventional lawsuit, then and there, had22   there not been this license agreement?23             MS. MAHONEY:  Not exactly, but what they did was24   they headed it off at the pass.  They understood that --25             JUSTICE SOUTER:  But the question is, How far33￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   ahead of the pass can they get and still call it a 2   settlement?" in the sense that you're using that term. 3             MS. MAHONEY:  It's a compromise.  It's a 4   compromise of the very claims they're trying to adjudicate 5   here.  What they want to adjudicate are affirmative 6   defenses to a patent infringement action.  That is not a 7   ripe claim, and there is not sufficient immediacy, because 8   they are preventing that claim from ripening by continuing 9   to make voluntary payments --10             JUSTICE SOUTER:  But --11             MS. MAHONEY:  -- under their --12             JUSTICE SOUTER:  But you --13             MS. MAHONEY:  -- agreement.14             JUSTICE SOUTER:  Right.  But you were saying15   that the status of that agreement, for purposes of the16   jurisdictional question here, is exactly the same as the17   status of an agreement that they might have entered into18   after one party had brought suit against the other.  And19   --20             MS. MAHONEY:  Well --21             JUSTICE SOUTER:  And they -- they had settled.22   And then, later on, somebody wanted to repudiate the23   settlement.24             MS. MAHONEY:  I don't know if it's exactly the25   status.  For instance, in a settlement after litigation34￼21 22 23 24 25you sue then?          MS. MAHONEY:  No, I don't think so, unless --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but then -- so then, theargument that you've made is just not --          MS. MAHONEY:  No, I --35 - Subject to Final Review1   has been filed, I think that Lear would say that you can't2   even repudiate that.  But certainly -- so, there might be 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   following sense.  They understood that if they -- if they10   didn't get a license, that they would be exposed to11   Genentech's claims under the -- under the infringement12   laws.  And in order to avoid that exposure, even thoughsome differences -- but from --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  In any event --MS. MAHONEY:  -- the standpoint of coercion --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- it's equivalent to asettlement after a formal demand has been made.MS. MAHONEY:  It is equivalent to that, in the13141516   the information.  Suppose you enter into a license17   agreement -- you're convinced, as the one that's going to18   pay the license fee, that it's a good patent -- after the19   agreement's signed, the technological advances, other20   disclosures, indicate that the patent is deficient.  Couldthey had all the information they needed to assess thevalidity of this patent at the time --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose they didn't have all￼ - Subject to Final Review 1             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- relevant for us, the fact 2   that they knew everything -- 3             MS. MAHONEY:  They did. 4             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And it also means that this 5   isn't really a settlement, in any respect. 6             MS. MAHONEY:  It's a compromise of claims that 7   could be brought. 8             JUSTICE STEVENS:  Ms. Mahoney, can I ask this 9   question?  Supposing at the time they negotiate the10   license agreement there's some uncertainty about whether11   the patent is valid or not.  So, at the end of the license12   agreement -- they agree on the royalties, the term, and13   the -- everything it covers, but they put in a provision14   and say, "We're not entirely sure the patent is valid, so15   we reserve the right to bring an action challenging the16   validity of the patent.  We will pay royalties in the17   meantime, and the -- you will accept these royalties as18   sufficient for the use of the patent, that, if we win, you19   don't have to pay royals, if we lose, you do."  Would that20   be a valid provision?21             MS. MAHONEY:  I don't think so, but that would22   certainly be a closer case if there --23             JUSTICE STEVENS:  But would it --24             MS.

MAHONEY:  -- a standard proviso --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- whether the parties couldagree to create a case or controversy.          MS.

MAHONEY:  -- that that's one of the --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Well --          MS. MAHONEY:  -- one of the problems --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Will you assume Justice37 - Subject to Final Review1   issue as a jurisdictional matter as to whether there's a2   case or controversy?3             MS. MAHONEY:  No, I don't think so, because the4   real issue, in terms of Steffel, is whether you can say5   that the party is being coerced.  And, at least in your6 7 8 9hypothetical, you could say that they have --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  He's not being coerced, buthe's bargaining a little better royalty rate than he'll --otherwise would have to pay.          MS. MAHONEY:  Well, in terms of whether they're-- if the parties expressly agreed that that was part oftheir deal, then you at least wouldn't say that there was10111213   an issue of coercion.  But here, that isn't what happened.￼ - Subject to Final Review1   Stevens' hypothetical?  Assume it, take it as given.  They2   did put that in.  I know you think they didn't, but I want3   to assume it.4             MS. MAHONEY:  Uh-huh.5             JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, I'd like to also assume --6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Could I have a review of the7   bidding?  What --8 9101112131415[Laughter.]          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Go back -- what is thehypothetical --          JUSTICE BREYER:  The hypothetical is --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Continue on.          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- that they write into thecontract -- the party who's the licensee says, "And we     stipulate that the licensee thinks that the patent is16   invalid."  Nonetheless, the licensee wants a license, for17   business reasons.  Therefore, the licensee and the18   licensor agrees that, after they sign the contract and19   he's paying a thousand dollars a month in royalties, he20   can go into court and challenge the patent."  So, we21222324   state of the law.  The state of the law is that there is25   no public policy or any other policy that forbids such a38assume that's written into the contract.          MS. MAHONEY:  Uh-huh.JUSTICE BREYER:  And now, let us also assume a￼1   condition in a contract.  All right?89 10 11 12          MS. MAHONEY:  I don't think so, because I thinkwhat they're really asking for is advice about a businessdeal under those circumstances.          JUSTICE BREYER:  But he says, by the way, "If Iwin, I will, in fact, save $42 billion a year in licenses"          MS. MAHONEY:  Yes.          [Laughter.]          MS. MAHONEY:  But -- you know, but now -- but13 -- 141516 - Subject to Final Review          Now, on those two assumptions, the next thingthat happens is that the licensee asks for a declaratoryjudgment that the patent is invalid.23456   controversy under the Federal Constitution?

And that has --13141516171819   also invalid.  Is that -- is that right?20             MS. MAHONEY:  I don't think so.  I don't think21   the license agreement itself is invalid.  It simply --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, isn't there --MS. MAHONEY:  -- is something --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- true adversity?  Ithought the assumption underlying the -- everybody'shypothetical is that, if the patent is determined to beinvalid, that the license -- then the license agreement is￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9that has been determined to be invalid?          MS. MAHONEY:  Not on that patent.  Right.  Thelicense --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It would --          MS.

MAHONEY:  If the patent has been -- underLear and other cases, if a patent has been held to beinvalid by a final decision of a court, then I think it isimproper for a licensee to seek to obtain --101112131415161718   this patent.  We don't know.  We disagree.  And so, we've19   entered into a compromise royalty rate that reflects the20   uncertainty."  But once it's determined to be invalid, theCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Collective --MS. MAHONEY:  -- royalties --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Even if --MS. MAHONEY:  -- for that.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- the royalty agreementsays, you know, "We have a dispute about the validity of2122232425   wrinkle.  What if the contract goes the further step andlicense fees are not collectible.          MS.

Let's assume they assume, precisely, the 6   invalidity.  Would you say the contract is unenforceable 7   then, and the -- and the -- 8             MS.

There is a provision in17   there to the effect that if, during the term of this18   contract, the license is determined to be invalid,19   royalties will still be payable under this contract --20             MS. MAHONEY:  Uh-huh.21             JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- because that is one of the22   contingencies, which is a consideration for our bargain.23   Would you say, in those circumstances, that your answer24   would be the same, that there's no -- there's no case or25 --42MS.

MAHONEY:  Well, I don't know what the 2   dispute would be about, Your Honor, because it sounds like 3   the contract terms would be clear.  And if the contract 4   terms are clear, they would simply go in accordance, 5   unless they have an argument that the contract is -- 6             JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but I'm talking about 7   jurisdictional purposes. 8             MS. MAHONEY:  -- unenforceable.  If the -- if 9   the point is that it is actually invalid, illegal, that --10   that may be a different case, although I think there would11   still be an estoppel argument, that they should not be12   permitted to bring that action without giving up the13   benefits of the bargain, which is the immunity from suit.14   I mean, that is one of the fundamental problems with this15 case.16171819202122232425          JUSTICE SOUTER:  But do you see --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought your argument-- I'm sorry.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, if -- do you see adifference between -- I guess you're saying there's nodifference between my added wrinkle on the hypo and theChief Justice's hypo, for jurisdictional purposes.          MS.

The fact is that they are making the payments          MS. MAHONEY:  -- but I think, here, that themajor problem, from a jurisdictional perspective, is thatthere is not anything in the language of the contract thatgives them a right to come to court to dispute validity.Instead, we're --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about the fact thatit's under protest?MS. MAHONEY:  That makes no difference, Your10   pursuant to an agreement.  They're not under compulsion of11   an injunction.  They're doing it because they voluntarily12   entered into it.  Altvater is completely different.13   There, there was no license agreement in force.  The14   courts found that it -- that the reissue patents were15   never part of the agreement, to begin with.  In other16   words, Altvater never agreed to pay royalties.  Altvater17   had been sued, so there wasn't a counterclaim for18   invalidity.19202122232425   license as a defense"?  Would that be a "case orJUSTICE GINSBURG:  Could the --MS.

I don't think any court has ever allowed5   that.6789          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is it -- it's -- no, thepatent -- the licensee is coming into court and wants adeclaration of invalidity so it can manufacture withoutthe fear of an infringement suit.101112131415   license.  Wouldn't the patent holder have that option?16             MS. MAHONEY:  Yes, the patent -- well, no.  I17   mean, not necessarily.

MAHONEY:  I don't think so, Your Honor,because I don't think the parties are allowed to justdecide, "Well, we'd like to do this now," when they're --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, even --          MS. MAHONEY:  -- they've treated --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- even if the patent holderchooses not to raise the license, the court would have to, - Subject to Final Review1             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- "we want a declaration of2   infringement."  And the patent holder doesn't take the3   position that you're taking; instead says, "I'm prepared4   to fight this out now.  I know that I have the license,5   which could be an affirmative defense, but I'm not going6   to raise it.  I'm going to go head to head on the validity7   of this patent."  Would that be a case or controversy?     on its own motion, say, "Sorry, you didn't -- you're not16   the master of your defense.  We decide that you have to17   effectively plead the license."18             MS. MAHONEY:  I think the plaintiff has to show19   that they are here pursuant to -- that they have a legal20   right that permits them to adjudicate the issue of21   validity.  What the -- what the patent owner does, or not,22   I don't think turns this into a case or controversy; that,23   instead, we have to start with the fundamental question,24   "What is the cause of action that they are attempting to25   adjudicate?  Is it a contract action or is it a -- an46￼ - Subject to Final Review1   action under the patent laws?  Is it an infringement2   action?"  Here, I don't think there's any question but3 4 5 6 7 8 91011   the law, isn't it?  I mean, I imagine that the very -- we12   see, all the time, declaratory judgments where a State13   passes a law and the individual says, "Well, I think this14   is unconstitutional, but my preferences are not to go to15   jail; my preferences are not to be penalized.  So, my16   first choice is unconstitutional and my second is to obey17   it."  There's no possibility in the world that he will18   violate that law.  And yet, we've often held that, with19   regulations, you have to have the other requirements.  You20   have to have the requirements that it's concrete, it's not21   just ideological, there's real harm.  But, if those other22   requirements that are fulfilled, I've never seen any where23   it said that there also has to be a reasonable24   apprehension of a lawsuit in the absence of the25   declaratory judgment.  I've just never found that phrase,47that it is -- they're trying to adjudicate an action foran infringement that can't arise, because they're immunefrom suit, because they continue to make their payments.And, under those circumstances, it is not sufficientlyimmediate to establish jurisdiction in --JUSTICE BREYER:  It is --MS. MAHONEY:  -- this Court.JUSTICE BREYER:  -- it is, under other fields of￼ - Subject to Final Review123456   there are a lot of reasons why to dismiss it.  I'm just7   wondering if there is an additional reason that there has8   to be a reasonable apprehension of a lawsuit in the9   absence of the declaratory judgment action.  It's thatand I can't imagine why it would be part of the law.          MS. MAHONEY:  Your Honor, Poe versus Ullman,this Court actually dismissed a declaratory judgment --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Oh, there are many dismissed,for the reasons that they aren't concrete, definite --phrase that I've never found anywhere --          MS. MAHONEY:  We --1011121314   requirement.  And I'm putting that directly to you,15   because I want to hear you give me the counterexamples.16             MS. MAHONEY:  Well -- but in Poe versus Ullman,17   it was a declaratory judgment action.  They were seeking18   to have a statute declared unconstitutional.  And this19   Court did dismiss, because they didn't have a reasonable20   fear that they would actually be prosecuted.  Dismissed21   for lack of jurisdiction.22             JUSTICE BREYER:  And you say there has never23   been a declaratory judgment action, except in the instance24   where, in the absence of the action, the person would have25   violated the law, if it's a Government law.  In other48          JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- and can't think of anyreason why that would be an additional constitutional￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6   extended.

MAHONEY:  But there is always a reasonable19   apprehension, and there was always a finding of coercion.20   Poe versus Ullman says you can't do it unless there is --21             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do I remember that --22             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, Poe versus Ullman was a23   case in which, even if there was a violation of the law,24   there was going to be no prosecution.25             MS.

Here --111213141516   precedent.17             MS. MAHONEY:  I don't -- I don't think it's like18   violating the contract here, though, Your Honor, because,19   What are the consequences here?  What is the choice?20   First of all, they actually owe the royalties under the21   agreement, so they're trying to escape their bargain, not22   enforce it.  That's number one.  So, they're not23 24 25forfeiting any rights under the contract, they're simplytrying to get out of the contract.          Number two, the consequences here, the choice50JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, but --MS.

MAHONEY:  That's --          JUSTICE ALITO:  -- to be based on their having - Subject to Final Review1   they're talking about, isn't in the nature of coercion.2   Again, they're not being arrested or prosecuted.

As part of the13   bargain, the patent holder promises not to sue for14   infringement.15             MS. MAHONEY:  It's not based on them giving up16   their right to sue, in the sense that all they have to do17   is stop paying royalties, and they can sue.  They have to18   --19             JUSTICE ALITO:  But in answer to the20   hypotheticals, you seem to say it wouldn't matter if they21   explicitly did not give up their right to sue.  So, what22   is left of this argument that what's involved here is23   essentially a settlement?24             MS. MAHONEY:  Well, it is in the nature of a25   compromise, Your Honor, and there's nothing in this51￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   agreement that gives them a right to sue.  They have to 2   find some legal right.  What they're really saying -- what 3   their argument has always been is that Lear actually 4   creates an implied right of action for a licensee to sue 5   at any time of their choosing.  That's been their argument 6   from the beginning. 7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, their concrete 8   right is, as I thought you conceded earlier, that if the 9   patent is declared invalid, they will not owe license10   fees.11             MS. MAHONEY:  That's true.  But that's getting12   the cart before the horse.  What this Court said in --131415161718   Honor.  I think every single contract case in the lower19   courts where they have allowed a suit to be brought on a20   contract prior to breach, there was a genuine dispute21   about the interpretation of the terms.  Here, what they're22   trying to do is adjudicate a cause of action outside of23   the contract.  They're trying to adjudicate an24   infringement action and then say, "Aha, see what I have?25   I have a judgment that the patent's invalid.  And so, now52CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's what --MS. MAHONEY:  -- U.S. v. Harvey Steel is --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- a declaratoryjudgment action does, though, isn't it?          MS. MAHONEY:  Well, I don't think so, Your￼23 24 25then, when you couple that with the fact that --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that wasn't -- theDistrict Court, in this very case, seemed to say, "I think53 - Subject to Final Review1   I'd like to say that I don't have to pay royalties under2   my contract."3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ms. Mahoney, the patent bar is4   sort of specialized -- more than "sort of" -- it's a5   specialized bar, and I've never -- I've never been a part6   of it.  Do you agree with the statement of the7 8 911   Jenkinson, which is a Second Circuit case that allowed12   this kind of action back in the '70s, was one of the only13   cases ever that allowed it.  And other reasons were found14   to dismiss similar kinds of claims.  In Gen-Probe, it was15   a surprise that a licensee could do this.  It -- the law16   -- by the time that this license was executed in the17   Federal Circuit, there was a case, called Shell Oil, where18   the Court specifically held that a licensee cannot take19   advantage of the protections of Lear until it has20   repudiated the license, stopped paying, and said that it21   wants to challenge validity.  So that was the background22   rule that was in force at the time of this license.  AndPetitioner's counsel that Gen-Probe came as a -- as ashock to the --               MS. MAHONEY:  As a -- I do not agree that it10   came as a shock.  And, in fact, I think that Warner￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   this suit should go forward, but there's Gen-Probe, and I 2   must follow Gen-Probe."  The District Court, at least as I 3   read it, seemed to think that Gen-Probe moved in a 4   different direction from where the Federal Circuit was5 before. 6             MS. MAHONEY:  In all of the prior Federal 7   Circuit cases, the licensee had stopped paying royalties. 8   And what the Court explained in Gen-Probe is that that is 9   the sine qua non, that a licensee can't establish10   jurisdiction, and it can't establish a right to challenge11   validity, if it's still paying royalties.12             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Ms. Mahoney, you argue,13   in the alternative, that we should dismiss it on the basis14   of equitable considerations under the Declaratory Judgment15   Act.  We can't reach that argument unless we rule against16   you on the Article III question.  Is that right?171819202122232425          MS. MAHONEY:  I don't think so, Your Honor.  Ithink you can, because I think that you can do it as analternative threshold prudential jurisdictional dismissalin the nature --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We would have to beassuming that we had jurisdiction, wouldn't we?          MS. MAHONEY:  I think that --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Under Article III?          MS. MAHONEY:  I think that a prudential54￼ - Subject to Final Review1   dismissal under Article III would also be fine, and that2   Steel Co. would allow for that kind of dismissal, because3   Wilton said that you can dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,4   at the front end, on prudential grounds if you know that5   there would not be relief allowed at the back end.6             And I think that there's no need for a remand to7   do this.  We are really talking about an equitable rule8   that has governed equitable actions for 300 years.  It is9 10 1113   have the power to entertain this case, but, as a matter of14   equity, we're not going to do so."   The power question, I15   think, is a -- one that's -- it's either yes or no, either16   the court has the power, or doesn't.17             MS. MAHONEY:  But I don't think that the Court18   has to answer that question in order to dismiss on a19   prudential ground, a prudential jurisdictional ground, and20   nor is there a need for a remand in Samuels versus21   Mackell, and in Cardinal, for instance.  Those are cases22   where the Court adopted prudential rules and went ahead23   and applied them without remand.  I -- and no remand's24   necessary.  The Federal Circuit has already looked at25   this.  They --55a--               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what -- but jurisdiction     is a question of power, Does the Court have the power to12   do this?  A discretion question is different.  It's, "We￼ 910111213141516          JUSTICE STEVENS:  I'm asking you whether --          MS. MAHONEY:  -- argued below.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- you think there was.          MS. MAHONEY:  I think it -- it may well be, butI don't think the answer in this case turns on it, becauseI think they have to have their own right to bring theaction, whether it's a breach or not, and that they don't.Because they don't have an implied right of action under - Subject to Final Review1             JUSTICE STEVENS:  Ms. Mahoney, can I ask you one2   question before your light goes off?  I know it's not --3   goes to the "case or controversy" issue, but, in your4   view, was the bringing of this action a material breach of5   an implied condition of the contract that would justify a6   termination of a license?7             MS. MAHONEY:  It would depend on whether there8   is an implied covenant, Your Honor.  It wasn't --17   Lear, they don't have a right to bring this action.  And18   that is an essential component of their ability to19   challenge the issue of validity.  So, I think that's the20   first and fundamental --21             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, if that's so, and it's a22   super-violation of an implied covenant, and I guess you23   could get damages.24             MS. MAHONEY:  I think that their theory, Your25   Honor, is that a licensee can do this at any time, and56￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9that --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I think that your theoryis that it's a super-violation of an implied covenant.          MS. MAHONEY:  Your Honor, I don't think --whether it's an implied covenant or not --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  "Not only did we agree to it,but we you can't even do it if you agree to it."          MS. MAHONEY:  I think that an additional factorthat bears on this analysis is also the fact that Congresshas never created an implied right of -- has never createda right of action --23 24 25don't think more needs to be said about it.          Harvey Steel, on which Respondents rely, was, ofcourse, overruled --57 - Subject to Final Review101112131415161718192021   was right where it belongs.  The contract claim is clear22   in the record.  It's at page 136 of the joint appendix.  IThank you, Your Honor.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Ms. Mahoney.    Mr. Kester, you have 3 minutes remaining.REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. KESTER       ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERMR. KESTER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.  Justseveral quick items.          I think -- I think, Mr. Chief Justice, you were,a while ago, putting the horse in front of the cart, which￼ 9101112131415wouldn't concede that that -- that that would even matter.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But was it raised beforethe Federal Circuit?          MR.

It's been a -- it's been8   here throughout.  If it -- if it even matters.  I mean, we          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wait, wait.  Before you leavethat, do you agree that it was not raised below?MR. KESTER:  No, we don't.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where -- can you tell us whereit was raised below?MR. KESTER:  Well, it -- it's raised in the --               MR. KESTER:  I believe it was.  I'd have to go16   back and -- you mean in terms of the oral argument.  It17   was certainly in the briefs.  It was certainly not waived.18             There was never, of course, any -- anything in19   the license, or anyplace else, where Petitioner gave up20   the right to sue.  Petitioner doesn't need permission in21   the license to sue.22             And as for the shock in the lower courts when23   this case was decided, I would call to your attention what24   the Federal Circuit, in 1983, itself, said, and it quoted25   the Warner-Jenkinson case, which was the Second Circuit58￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   case that my friend dismissed somewhat.  The C.R. Bard 2   case -- this is Federal Circuit, early -- starts out, the 3   opening line -- it says, and I quote -- this is 716 F.2d 4   875 -- "We hold that a patent license need not be 5   terminated before a patent licensee may bring a Federal 6   declaratory judgment action," close quote.  And the last 7   words of the same opinion, at 882 of 716 F.2d, are, "We 8   hold that a patent licensee may bring a Federal 9   declaratory judgment action to declare the Federal -- to10   declare the patent subject to the license invalid without11   prior termination of the -- of the license."  That was12   1983.  Gen-Probe was 2004.  Something happened in the13   interval.141516171819202122232425          Finally, the discussion of settlements herestrikes me as, indeed, strange, because if this -- if alicense were to be redesignated as a settlement, we wouldhave the situation here where -- a license was signed in1977; the only patent at issue in this case was not evenissued until 2001.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. Kester.          MR.
