HURD   ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERSMR. HURD: Justice Stevens, and may it please            As Congress recently reaffirmed, the IDEA wasenacted to protect the rights of children withdisabilities, and the rights of their parents.  It is anAct intended by Congress to remedy a long history ofdiscrimination that once kept these children from theschoolhouse door.  It is an Act intended, as this Courtsaid in Rowley, to maximize parental involvement and toensure that these children have access to an appropriateeducation.            Today, the intent of Congress, as shown by thetext, structure, and purposes of the Act, calls for theburden of proof in administrative hearings to be placed onthe school system, not on the parent.            The Fourth Circuit said that placing the burdenon the party who initiates proceeding is the traditionalrule.  But, there is no single traditional rule.  Instead,31111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425there is a collection of different rules.JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, Congress was silent onthis subject of the burden of proof, was it not?MR. HURD: Yes, it was, Justice O'Connor.JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Was there -- did you find anything in the legislative history -- I know some members don't care to look at that, but I would be willing --[Laughter.]JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- that shows any discussion at all about the burden-of-proof question?MR. HURD: We are aware of none, Your Honor. What we -- what we have here is a situation where Congress, when it wishes to allocate the burden of proof one way or the other legislatively, knows how to do so. It did so in the APA, for example, while adopting the rule that the Fourth Circuit said applies in this case. But Congress did not adopt the rule in this case.JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Why didn't it? I -- why wasn't the APA applicable?MR. HURD: Well, Your Honor, the APA governs Federal agencies, it doesn't --JUSTICE SCALIA: I see.MR. HURD: -- govern proceedings -- JUSTICE SCALIA: I see.MR. HURD: -- under the --41111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: So --2 MR. HURD: -- under the IDEA.3 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- what it if were -- what it4 were a school on a Federal base? Are they covered by this5 Act, by the 678 --9 1011 with them? 121314way? You know --MR. HURD: Your Honor, there are --JUSTICE SCALIA: -- military schools on militaryMR. HURD: -- DOD schools --JUSTICE SCALIA: DOD schools. What do you do Are they governed by the APA?MR. HURD: We don't believe so, Your Honor. JUSTICE SCALIA: No?MR. HURD: They are not. And part of the reason15 for that has to do with this unique structure of the Act.16 It is a very nontraditional statute. It is --17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you'd be suing some18 Federal agency. I mean, it has to be some Federal agency19 that's running that school, and at least for that kind of20 a school the burden is clearly going to be on the person21 challenging the agency action.22 MR. HURD: I don't agree, Your Honor, and let23 me explain why, because of the unique structure of this24 Act, it creates an equal partnership between parents and25 the school system, with the purpose of that partnership51111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 being to produce an Individualized Education Program for2 the benefit of the child. And, as this Court recognized3 in Honig, that IEP is the centerpiece of the entire4 statute.5 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, well, what if you had6 an IEP that the parents had initially agreed with, and7 then they decide it isn't working well, they want to8 challenge it. They shouldn't have a burden of proof?9 MR. HURD: Your Honor, that would be a different10 situation, and courts below have reached different results11 on that. We believe that the school system --12 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, you mean the court has13 -- every court faced with this problem is supposed to14 decide, in that particular case, who has the15 burden?16 MR. HURD: No, Your Honor. Some courts have17 decided that, where either party -- the school system or18 the parents -- challenges an existing IEP or wants to19 change an existing IEP, some courts have said the burden20 is always on the school system, some have said the party21 challenging 222324has the burden. But --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you --MR. HURD: -- in this case --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- do you think it's open to25 a State to adopt a general rule on who has the burden of 61111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 proof under 23 We believe 4this statute?MR. HURD: Your Honor, we think that it is not. it is a Federal question that --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Have some States purported to5 adopt a general rule on this?6 MR. HURD: Some have, Your Honor.7 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And you think that's invalid?8 MR. HURD: Well, we believe -- yes, Your Honor,9 we believe it is a -- it is a Federal-law question. What10 we do know, however, is that Maryland has adopted no rule11 on this question, no statute to allocate the burden, one12 way or the other. And even if a State has the ability to13 adopt a rule, if it wishes to do so, that still leaves14 open the question of what rules should apply in the15 absence of a State-based rule. Now --16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hurd, do you recognize --17 to narrow what's at issue -- that the parent objecting18 to the school's IEP would at least have a burden of coming19 forward? In other words, I -- are you speaking just of20 the ultimate persuasion burden? Wouldn't the parents at21 least be required to come forward with some reason to22 believe that the State -- the school district's plan is23 inadequate?24 MR. HURD: Your Honor, we don't believe that25 it's necessary. We do recognize that is a different71111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 question. In this case, for example, the school system2 was required to go first, but, initially, the parents were3 given the burden of proof. It is a -- it is a different4 question.5 And let me address, if I may, the different6 paradigm that this kind of action presents, because it's7 very different than a traditional statute. It goes back8 to this unique equal partnership. Congress intends for9 that child to have an IEP. And there are only two ways to10 get that IEP. One is a consensus between parent and11 school system. But if there is an impasse, Congress still12 wants that child to have an IEP, and there's only one way13 to carry out that congressional purpose; somebody has to14 step forward and ask for the hearing officer to make a15 decision. And it makes little sense to burden a party16 just because that party is the one who stepped forward to17 advance the congressional goal by asking for the IE- --18 hearing officer first.19 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: What case is your closest one20 to support the view that the Court should adopt some21 particular rule here, based on the scheme?22 MR. HURD: Well --23 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: What do you rely on? I just24 don't know where we look for the --25 MR. HURD: Your Honor, I would --81111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- guiding principle.2 MR. HURD: -- I would -- Justice O'Connor, I3 would point, for example, to your opinion in Gebser vs.4 Lago Vista, where you said that the general rule -- this5 was not a burden-of-proof case, but, in any event, you6 said the general rule must yield to the purposes of the7 statute --8 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Okay, but let --9 MR. HURD: -- in order to figure out --10 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- let's talk about--11 MR. HURD: -- congressional intent.12 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- burden-of-proof cases.13 What is your closest one where the courts are left to do14 this? What do we look to?15 MR. HURD: Well, Your Honor, the Court, last16 year, in Alaska versus EPA, said, there is no single rule,17 or principle, governing the allocation of the burden. And18 in that case, this Court also said two other things that19 are important here. One is, it put the burden on the20 Government in that case, regardless of whether the21 Government was the plaintiff or the defendant. So, the22 idea of burdening the party who initiates the proceedings23 was rejected there, and this Court said it looked at the24 purposes of the statute and saw no reason to place the25 burden differently, depending upon whether the Government91111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 came to court as the plaintiff or took unilateral action2 forcing the other side to come to court where the3 Government would be the defendant.4 JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand the purposes-of-5 the-statute argument. The purpose of the statute is6 always to provide relief to someone who's been injured.7 And to conclude, from this, that, therefore, the burden8 should be on the other side, in order -- in order that9 people who are injured can get relief, is -- I mean --10 MR. HURD: Your Honor --11 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that will always be the12 case.13 MR. HURD: Justice Scalia, the purpose of the14 statute is to obtain for the child an Individualized15 Education Program.16 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine. I -- that's one17 sort of relief. But, I mean, you have some relief at18 issue under every statute. They want a needy person to be19 given justice. And to say that, since that's their20 purpose, you should always put the burden on the other21 side, is -- I just don't understand that argument.22 MR. HURD: Well, Your Honor, this is a unique23 statutory scheme. The purposes of the Act are set forth24 in the law very clearly -- page 6 and 7 of the addendum to25 the blue brief -- one is to ensure that all children with101111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 disabilities have available to them a free, appropriate2 public education. And --3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure.4 MR. HURD: -- that purpose is served far more,5 Justice Scalia --6 JUSTICE SCALIA: And the Federal Tort Claims7 Act, for all I know, says, in its prologue -- or, if it8 doesn't, it should have, or it could have -- the purpose9 of this is to assure that every person who's been injured10 by a -- by a Government tort obtains relief.11 MR. HURD: But let me, then, point out the very12 different paradigm between the ordinary tort claim statute13 and this statute. In your ordinary tort claim statute,14 your ordinary litigation, the law starts out by being15 neutral with respect to the status quo. And that's the16 reason why you have this rule -- we don't think it is17 called "traditional rule" appropriately -- but the general18 rule that you place the burden on the party who initiates19 litigation is because the law is neutral with respect to20 the status quo at the beginning of the lawsuit. Here, the21 law is not neutral, because the status quo before the22 hearing is: the child has no Individualized Education23 Program.24 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's where I am not25 understanding your argument. There is an IEP in all of111111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 these cases. I would understand your argument if the2 State -- the school district said, "We're not going to3 educate this kid. Throw him into the pot with everybody4 else. We won't give you an IEP." That's not what we've5 got here. And, in fact, if that's what we had here, the6 burden-of-proof issue would be of no significance, because7 the State -- the parents would walk in, and the only thing8 they'd have to do to satisfy "a" burden of proof would be9 to say, "They didn't come up with an IEP."101112 fight about 1314 there is no15 --16171819 words. 202122 will not come up with an IEP." The State is saying, "This23 is what we're going to give you," and the parents say,24 "It's not good enough."25 MR. HURD: Your Honor, that is not an IEP; that121111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MR. HURD: Justice Scalia [sic] --JUSTICE SOUTER: Instead, what we have here is a whether it's a good IEP or no IEP.MR. HURD: Justice Scalia, with all due respect,IEP; there's only a proposed IEP.  Andthat isaboutJUSTICE SOUTER: Then --MR. HURD: -- the crucial difference -- JUSTICE SOUTER: -- then we're arguingMR. HURD:  The point, though, is that with --JUSTICE SOUTER:  The State is not saying, "We￼1 is a proposed IEP. And it is not merely arguing about2 words; it goes to the heart of the statute. Let me3 explain why.4Three things this Court has said -- or thesay.  Number one, the regulations say that thethe school system are equal partners.  Thisin the Honig case, that Congress very muchstrip school systems of the power to act5 regulations6 parents and7 Court said,8 intended to9 unilaterally with respect to these children. Thirdly,10 this Court said, in Rowley, the purpose of the statute11 to maximize parental involvement.12 Now, if we're equal partners at the table,13 sense does it make for the school system to tell the14 parents that, "We are equal partners here, but, if you15 disagree with me once we leave the table, I am presumed16 correct"?17 JUSTICE SCALIA: What sense does it make for the18 parents to tell that to the school system? I mean --19 JUSTICE SOUTER: In an -- in an equal-20 partnership argument, nobody's got the burden of proof.21 MR. HURD: Your Honor, in an equal-partnership22 argument, nobody has the burden, because they initiated23 the proceeding to ask for the goal that Congress had in24 mind --25JUSTICE KENNEDY: In all events -- 131111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005iswhat￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. HURD: -- that the child have an IEP.JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- in all events, it seems to me that it's still cut against you. This is a statutory scheme where, you point out, the parents have access to some initial consultation. In most instances -- or in many instances, people who are suing an institution don't have that initial access. Here, the parents get much more initial information than most -- than most petitioners do --MR. HURD: They --JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- than most -- than most complainants, than most aggrieved persons do.MR. HURD: Well, Your Honor, actually their discovery rights are less than what they would normally have. But let me go to the idea, then, that we are --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then let --MR. HURD: -- equal partners --JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- let me point -- let mepoint out something else.  Let's assume a state of affairs-- just assume that school districts -- many of them --independently and, I think, collectively, because schooldistricts talk to each other -- have a growing body ofdata and expertise about IEP.  And this is the basis onwhich you say that they should come forward.  It seems tome that, too, though, cuts against you, because when a141111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 school district has expertise, I think it's entitled to a2 presumption of governmental deregularity. And you have3 to challenge it.4 MR. HURD: Your Honor, we disagree with that,5 because of the structure of the Act. Again, it makes no6 sense to be equal partners at the table, and, once you7 reach an impasse, to say, well, you're going to presume8 one side is right.9 JUSTICE BREYER: That's a well-established10 principle of administrative law. I've never seen a case11 in administrative law where a party -- a private party12 coming in and challenging a Government's action doesn't13 bear the burden of proof. And Alaska isn't contrary to14 that. Alaska, they were citing hornbook law, whether --15 what happens with the -- if EPA normally does have a16 burden of proof when it challenges a State action, and17 that doesn't change, whether they bring it in a State18 proceeding or whether it's in a Federal proceeding. I19 didn't think it was quite on point. But maybe you know20 that I'm wrong on this. And so --21 MR. HURD: Well, Your Honor --22 JUSTICE BREYER: -- is there a -- can you think23 of any instance, in all of administrative law, where you24 didn't start out with the idea that a person challenging a25 -- an agency action that's been taken, and so forth,151111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 doesn't have the burden of proof?2 MR. HURD: Your Honor, there is no analogous3 case, because --45678 statute. 91011 is no other12 citizens are made equal partners with Government in the13 design and approval of Government actions.14 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Does this every15 come up? I mean, the other thing I wondered about this --16 it seems to me you have a hearing examiner and a district17 judge who have actually said what is only a law18 professor's dream. They say, "Oh, the evidence is19 precisely and equally in balance." I didn't know that20 happened in 212223 that judges24 complicated25 bit better,the real world. I --[Laughter.]JUSTICE BREYER: -- I thought that their -- normally did their job, which is, you look at evidence, and you say, "This side is a little or that side is a little bit better." Has16JUSTICE BREYER: That's what I --MR. HURD: -- because --JUSTICE BREYER: I do think that, yes.MR. HURD: -- because there is no analogousJUSTICE BREYER: There isn't?MR. HURD: There's no analogous statute. There statute we've been able to find where private1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425this come up in -- a lot, where they say, in this area, "Oh, it's exactly" --MR. HURD: Well --JUSTICE BREYER: -- "in equipoise"?MR. HURD: Your Honor, I don't -- I don't knowhow many times the hearing officer has said that.  I dothink the burden of proof is not -- is not -- or theevidence is not balanced on a razor's edge.  I think it isa -- is a broader table than that.  But let me explain, ifI may, three reasons.JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you, before you get to your three reasons, to go back to your -- somethingthat you said? I asked you, Are you dividing the burdenof production and persuasion? And you said no, it's allon one side or the other. But it seems to me your description of this proceeding, you said the school district goes first. So --MR. HURD: In this --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- the school district didcome forward.  And is that the usual practice in theseadministrative hearings -- that the first one to go todefend the plan is the school district, not the parentswho are attacking it?            MR. HURD:  Your Honor, I believe that thetypical procedure would be that the -- whichever party has171111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the burden of proof would go first.JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you said, in this case --MR. HURD: It --JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the school district wentfirst.MR. HURD: Yes, Your Honor. In this particular case, the hearing officer had not yet resolved the burden- of-proof issue at the beginning of the hearing, and --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, now, as a result of theFourth Circuit's decision, do the parents always go first--MR. HURD: Oh --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- and not the schooldistrict?  The school district has a plan that it has putforward.  And it seemed to me logical, well, it has aplan, so it should defend it.MR. HURD: Your Honor, the typical rule is, obviously, that whichever party has the burden of proof in that proceeding would go first, but --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, you think the ALJ -- orthe administrative hearing officer in this case told theState to go first -- the school district to go firstbecause he thought that maybe they had burden of proof,and would not have asked them to go first if he didn't?MR. HURD: Your Honor, there was a -- it's 181111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 unclear why he had them go first. There was some State2 regulation -- then in effect, no longer in effect -- that3 suggested that perhaps the State had some initial burden4 in that case. We're not necessarily asking that the --5 that the -- that the State be required to go first. What6 we are asking is that the State -- excuse me, not the7 State -- the local school system bear the burden of8 persuasion. And there are three --9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So,10 this is an ad hoc thing. There is11 about which one goes first.12 MR. HURD: Your Honor,13 would be that whoever has the burden of proof, the burden14 of persuasion, would also be the one to go first and go15 last. That's the general practice in procedures. And we16 believe it also applies here. But we're not -- what I'm17 -- my point is that we are not wedded -- this Court was to18 decide that the parents should go first, but the school19 system had the burden of persuasion, that would be fine20 with us. In the cases where the burden of persuasion is21 going to be22 substantial2324 if I may, is, Which allocation of the burden of proof best25 advances the purposes of Congress? There are threedeterminative, both sides are going to haveevidence before the hearing officer.The question we think is most important here,191111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005but you're saying this --no general practicethe general practice￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425reasons, at least, why we believe putting the burden onthe school system best advances purposes of theCongress.            Number one has to do with the risk of anerroneous decision.  This Court, for example, in Santosky,said: What will happen if there is an erroneous decision? It asked that question in the context of the standard ofproof.  It is important to ask that same question here.If the hearing officer makes a mistake and awards the child services that are not really needed, then the child will receive a somewhat better education than the law requires, and the school --JUSTICE SCALIA: It's only play money,right?JUSTICE STEVENS: Well I think it's only right - this isn't the question, Who's going to pay for it? Because this -- doesn't the parent often go ahead and get the other -- the better program, and then they ask for reimbursement for the -- from the Government?MR. HURD: Well, not in that case, where the -- my hypothetical was, where the hearing officer has awarded services --JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't it true that many of these fights occur after much of the education has already taken place --201111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. HURD: Your Honor, because of --            JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- and they're fighting aboutwho pays for it?MR. HURD: -- the wheels of justice grind slowly -- sometimes they do, but they -- the key point here is, look at what happens if the hearing officer deniesservices the child needs. The child is going to beharmed, and, in the long run, society is going to be harmed, as this Court recognized in Rowley. The harm to the child if the burden is erroneously -- excuse me -- the harm --JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, that's --MR. HURD: -- to the child --JUSTICE STEVENS: -- that's not true if theparents can afford to pay for it, and have, in fact, paid for it. Then the child is the neutral factor in it. Of course, in some cases, what you say would be true, but not in --MR. HURD: Your Honor, in most cases --JUSTICE STEVENS: -- not in all cases.MR. HURD: -- it would be true. These parentswere fortunate -- this child was fortunate, that they wereable to pay for Brian's services until Montgomery Countyfinally changed its mind and gave him the kind of serviceshe had sought from the beginning, services they gave him211111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 once they were given the burden of proof. But most2 parents are not going to be in that situation. Most3 parents of children with disabilities are not going to be4 able to go out and obtain the services they need if the5 hearing officer does not award --6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Hurd, here's --7 JUSTICE BREYER: This is true.8 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- here's my problem with your9 assertion that we have to decide it in the way that10 furthers the purposes of the statute. We said, in other11 cases -- and correctly, I think -- that no statute pursues12 its purpose at all costs, that there are limitations upon13 its purpose. It, of course, wants students who need this14 special help to get it, but it also does not want students15 who don't need this special help to get it. And for you16 to say, "There's no harm done." You know, "If he -- if17 he's given it when he doesn't need it. What's the18 problem? He goes to a better school." The problem is19 that this is not play money. It's coming from somewhere;20 and, namely, on the citizens who have to pay for it.21 MR. HURD: Your Honor, my purpose is not to22 minimize the monetary interests involved, but it is to23 focus the Court's attention on the aspect of it that24 Congress had focused on. Certainly, if we have an25 erroneous decision either way, there will be some loss.221111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 If the loss is on the school system, it will not be2 unimportant; it will be some money. If the loss is on the3 child, it will be in the squandering of human potential --4 JUSTICE BREYER: All right, that's true. That's5 -- I understand. I sympathize with that point. I'm6 worried, however, about the fact that this statute doesn't7 just cover the initial IEP. It covers a whole range of8 things, including, for example, you have a hyperactive9 child. The hyperactive child behaves badly in class. The10 hyperactive child receives discipline related, say, to how11 it's placed. Well, the parents might -- properly, perhaps12 -- think that was very unfair and wrong, and they might13 challenge that disciplinary mark. There can be thousands14 of different kinds of issues that come up. And, in all of15 these issues, is it supposed to be the burden of the16 school board, for example, to show that the teacher who17 had the child sit in the back of the class or received a18 bad discipline mark or something? Does the -- does the19 school board have to prove that the teacher was right?20 MR. HURD: Well, Your Honor, those cases would21 not arise under the IDEA --22 JUSTICE BREYER: Wouldn't it, if it were related23 to the placement?24 MR. HURD: Your Honor, your hypothetical did not25 change the child's placement.231111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, I say that there are a2 number of -- what I'm thinking of is a lot of interim3 decisions that come up that are affecting how the child is4 placed -- whether in class, whether in that class, whether5 with a special teacher, whether without a special teacher,6 whether with somebody during the recess periods, whether7 not. I mean, they're -- these are very complicated8 matters, and there can be important overall matters, and9 there can be what I'd call interstitial matters.10 MR. HURD: Your Honor, the initial matters you11 discussed -- sent to the back of the room -- the IDEA is12 not implicated there. If the school system tries to13 change the child's placement, then this Court has already14 said that the school system bears --15 JUSTICE BREYER: What I'm driving at is -- and I16 think it was well expressed in one17 Jersey case, perhaps -- that is it18 whether the matter is interstitial19 initial placement or a change of --20 MR. HURD: Yes, sir.21 JUSTICE BREYER: -- placement? Do we have the22 same burden of proof always on the school board, no matter23 what?24 MR. HURD: I understand your question, Your25 Honor. We believe the strongest possible case is,241111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005of these cases, a Newthe same burden of proofor whether it's an￼1 initially, where there is no IEP, where this is equal2 partnership, and the school system should be required to3 come forward and demonstrate this program is appropriate.4 If, however, you have a -- an agreed IEP and the5 parents say, "Well, now we want to change that," then the6 case for the parents is, frankly, not so strong. It is a7 different case. And some courts have said, in those8 cases, the parents have the burden, as the District Court9 did, actually, in this case, by way of dictum. Other10 courts have said, no, the school system always have the --11 has the burden.12 The Court need not go so far here as the New13 Jersey court went in Lascari, and say the school system14 always has the burden in order to the rule -- rule for the15 parents in this case and say that, initially, when there16 is no IEP, only a proposed IEP -- and, Justice Souter,17 Burlington used that word three times, "IEP proposal,"18 which we think implies that it was not a real IEP -- this19 -- the Court need not decide the other issue in order to20 decide that when there is no IEP, only a proposal, and21 when you have equal parties before the hearing officer,22 that it makes no sense to allocate the burden on which one23 filed for the hearing officer first, who asked for the24 tiebreaker first. That really makes no sense.25 You have to, instead, we submit, decide the251111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 case based on which allocation of the burden in this2 situation is most in accord with the purposes of the3 statute. Two purposes, if I may. Protecting the rights4 of children with disabilities, and the rights of their5 parents, is what the statute says.6 Protect them from whom? What did Congress have7 in mind? Obviously, to protect them, quite frankly, from8 the school systems, who had this history of9 discrimination, who are more powerful, if you will, in10 terms of both information and resources, and who have11 financial incentive, as the Deal court recognized, to12 minimize the needs of the child. Protecting the side13 Congress meant to protect means putting the burden on14 other side: the school system.athat the15 Secondly, more fundamentally, the purpose16 ensure the children have an appropriate education. The17 law doesn't say "promote." It doesn't say "presume." It18 doesn't say "risk." It says "ensure."19 In baseball, there's an old umpires' rule that20 the tie goes to the runner. In order to carry out21 purposes of this statute, when the evidence is in22 equipoise, the tie should go to the child.2324 rebuttal. 25I'd like to reserve the balance of my time forJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Garre. 261111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005is to￼1 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE2 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS3 MR. GARRE: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may4 it please the Court:5 Petitioners rejected the educational plan found6 appropriate by local school officials, enrolled their7 child in an expensive private school, and then filed a8 due-process complaint seeking reimbursement of $21,000 in9 private tuition expenses. The Court of Appeals properly10 held that petitioners bore the burden of proof in that11 proceeding, just like --12 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: This is a case where the13 parents unilaterally decided to move the child to14 private school, and then they sought tuition15 reimbursement?16 MR. GARRE: That's correct, Justice --17 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes.a18 MR. GARRE: -- O'Connor. Petitioners19 burden of --20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: As I understand it21 JUSTICE STEVENS: You don't contend the rule22 would be different if we were -- if it was all23 prospective, do you?24 MR. GARRE: No. Your Honor, we think the rule25 is the same in all of the various situations that could271111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005bore the--￼1 arise under the statute -- the complaining party, whether2 it's the parents, as in this case, or the school district,3 as in many other instances. And, Justice Breyer, you're4 right, one of the situations that is covered by this5 statute is where a child with a disability acts out in6 class, and the school has to take disciplinary action7 against that child. In that situation, IDEA regulates the8 actions that the school district can take. And if the9 parents believe that the school district has -- take a10 more severe disciplinary action than is required by the11 statute, school -- the school district, or the parents,12 could initiate a challenge in that situation.13 In fact, there are many parts of the statute14 that we think speak to the question, or at least --15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Before we -- you go onto the16 argument, your answer to Justice O'Connor, if I remember17 the facts correctly, wasn't quite right. This child was18 in private school for years, and the parents weren't19 asking anybody to do anything, because -- and it's only20 when the private school said, "We have to -- we can no21 longer put up with your child. Your child has all these22 problems" -- at that time, the parents then came to the23 school district and asked for an IEP.24 MR. GARRE: Justice Ginsburg, that's correct.25 The child was in a private school, at which point in time,281111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 the private school suggested that they find -- the parents2 find another environment for the child suitable for what3 they determined to be "special needs." The parents4 contacted the local school district, and, at that point,5 the school district, in conjunction with the parents,6 devised an educational plan for the child.7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Which the parents didn't8 think was acceptable and, in the interim, placed the child9 in another private school. But it was not a case that10 they put the child in a private school first, and then11 sought reimbursement.12 MR. GARRE: That is correct, Justice Ginsburg,13 except that the record does show that, during the time14 that the IEP was being developed, the parents applied for15 the child to attend a private school and actually accepted16 an application fee and enrolled the child in that school,17 and the ALJ in this case found that the parents had made a18 predetermined decision to send the student to child -- the19 student --20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought --21 MR. GARRE: -- to private school. But we don't22 think that the facts of this case bear on the question of23 who bears the burden of proof in the run of the Mine case.24 It's --25JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Garre, you -- or, Mr. 291111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Garre, you said, in your earlier statement, that sometimesthe school district will be the complaining party.  Howdoes that -- how does that come up?MR. GARRE: Your Honor, there are three situations in which the school district can be the complaining party. First, where a parent refuses to subject his child to evaluation for special services under the Act, and the school district disagrees and initiates that action.JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, why would the school district have to take any action? Why wouldn't it just --MR. GARRE: Well, under the statute Congress --JUSTICE SCALIA: -- just say, "The child can't come to class. He's too disruptive," period?MR. GARRE: The Congress placed on school districts the obligation to identify disabled children within their jurisdiction.JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.MR. GARRE: And when they have -- they believe they identified such children, and they request the parents to subject them to the evaluation -- Congress placed on the school districts to at least conduct an evaluation in that situation, and if parents disagree --JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.MR. GARRE: -- school districts can initiate.301111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 The second situation is in -- is where children2 act up in the classroom. The school -- the statute places3 restrictions on how the school district can discipline a4 child if the school district determines that the5 misbehavior is a manifestation of the child's disability.6 In that situation, if the -- if the school district7 believes that more severe discipline is warranted than8 would be allowed under the statute, the school district9 has to initiate the hearing in order to get an ALJ to10 allow it to take more severe action.11 And the third situation is where the school12 district disagrees with a parent's request for an13 independent educational evaluation. Parents can request,14 as part of the developmental process of an educational15 plan, to have an independent educational evaluation16 conducted on their child, paid for at public expense.17 Most of the times, that's conducted without incidence. In18 some situations, if school districts believe that that19 expense was not warranted, they could initiate a20 proceeding.21 And in all those cases, we acknowledge that --22 under the traditional rule, that the complaining party,23 the party that initiates the action and seeks relief,24 bears the burden of proof in that proceeding.25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre, do you have any311111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 numbers, overall, how -- of the incidence of the parents2 going to the administrative hearing first, as opposed to3 the school district? Isn't it overwhelming that, in these4 proceedings, the parents are the one -- ones who initiate5 the hearing?6 MR. GARRE: Your Honor, I don't have those7 statistics. I would -- I think it's probably true that in8 most instances it's the parents who are initiating the9 hearing. That would not have been news to Congress,10 however. Congress, in the statute -- and this is one of11 the things that we think is important, bearing on the12 burden of proof -- placed on parents the obligation to13 plead their case -- that is, to identify both the problem14 with the educational plan that they've seen -- and this is15 in 20 U.S.C. 1450(b)(7) -- as well as the proposed16 solution that they would -- that they would like to see17 the Court adopt. Now --18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now we go back to the --19 an answer you gave before, when we were going through20 what, in fact, happened, the suggestion that maybe the21 parents were just trying to get the private-school tuition22 reimbursed, the -- there was a finding, wasn't there, in23 the District Court, in the -- this is in the Petitioner's24 appendix, at 46 and 47 -- the district court said, "The25 parents in no way prevented the IEP from being formulated321111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 or otherwise failed, in good faith, to consider it."2 MR. GARRE: The -- Your Honor, that's correct.3 I think that the District Court also acknowledged, though,4 that the parents probably were interested in sending their5 child to private school. I think, either way, we're not6 suggesting that the record in this case requires the Court7 to take one result or another on the fundamental question8 of who bears the burden of proof. We think that the9 complaining party bears the burden of proof. That's the10 rule --11 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if I take -- if I accept12 your view of that, that would be a Federal rule written13 into the statute. And that would mean that, even if the14 Department of Education came to a different conclusion, or15 even if we have a bunch of States that come to a different16 conclusion, or even if it's in Minnesota, they want to17 have a rule that "sometimes it's one way, sometimes the18 other way," we couldn't do that. But if I were a Member19 of Congress, and never thought about the issue, which I20 think this void in the statute suggests, I might think it21 would work out better if we left it up to each State to do22 it whatever way they wanted here, if we left it up to the23 Department of Education to promulgate whatever rules they24 wanted. Now, couldn't we hold that?25 MR. GARRE: Yes, Your Honor, and, in fact,331111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 we've suggested that. In fact --2 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you haven't suggested3 leaving it up to each State, because you're suggesting a4 uniform rule. So, what -- how would you have it?5 MR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor, to be clear, we6 think that this -- that the statute establishes a Federal7 floor. It is spending clause -- a federal floor -- it is8 -- or a default rule that --9 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, it's just --10 MR. GARRE: -- unless --11 JUSTICE BREYER: -- a default rule.12 MR. GARRE: Exactly. That the --13 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. If it's just a14 default rule, that's a big improvement, because any State15 can do it any way it wants.16 MR. GARRE: And that --17 JUSTICE BREYER: But then, why not, here, send18 it back and say that the ALJ tried to answer the wrong19 question? He tried to answer the question of what was the20 Federal law, but what he really should have done was ask21 about what's the State law. And if he has a hard time22 figuring it out, perhaps he should look at that evidence23 harder and see. Maybe --24 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, is there any doubt,25 here, that there's no State law?341111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. GARRE: No, Your Honor, and I believe you2 just heard Mr. Hurd acknowledge that there is no statute3 or regulation on this.4 JUSTICE BREYER: No, but I've never heard of a5 State without law. There is no --6 MR. GARRE: Well --7 JUSTICE BREYER: -- black hole in the law --8 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: On the burden of proof in IEP9 cases --10 JUSTICE BREYER: Well --11 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- I should have explained.12 MR. GARRE: And, Your Honor, the Maryland case13 law adopts a traditional rule for administrative14 proceedings. We cite the case, in page 18 of the red15 brief. Importantly, though, what petitioners --16 JUSTICE SCALIA: These cases are appealed to17 Federal courts normally, aren't they?18 MR. GARRE: These cases -- the Congress gave19 them the right to bring a civil action in Federal court.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: In Federal courts. And most of21 these cases are in Federal courts. And you're -- you want22 to condemn Federal courts to figuring out what the State23 burden of proof is?24 MR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor, I think -- we25 analogize it to the question of the substantive amount of351111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 benefits to which parents are entitled under the Act. We2 think that this spending-clause legislation would allow a3 State to adopt a higher standard than the standard that4 this Court established in Rowley for free and5 appropriate public education, and that that would be the6 standard that would apply in a proceeding. And so, too,7 we think, with the question of the burden of proof. If8 States wanted to voluntarily assume the burden of proof9 for their own school districts in these proceedings, which10 this Court has characterized as a substantive rule of law11 -- the question of who bears the burden of proof -- we12 think that States could do so, and that that would be the13 rule that applies. We don't quarrel with that.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not hypothetical. Isn't15 it -- it isn't hypothetical. States -- isn't it true that16 some States have said that, in these hearings, the school17 district will have the burden of proof?18 MR. GARRE: Yes, Your Honor. We believe -- I19 believe eight States have said that. Three States -- at20 least three States have said that the burden of proof is21 on the parents in these proceedings.22 taken different views and said if --23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well --24 MR. GARRE: -- Minnesota25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- to the -- to the extent361111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005Some States have I believe it's --has said that --￼1 that we're concerned about unnecessarily increasing costs2 on school districts, and burdens on school districts, why3 shouldn't we have a uniform Federal rule? In other words,4 if we agree with your position that ordinary allocations5 puts this on the complainant, we have to conserve6 resources, and so forth, why should we allow States to7 have a different rule, when we're dealing with the8 administration of a Federal program?9 MR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor, because of the10 spending-clause nature of the legislation. That's what we11 think, that 121314 that States15 costs under16--JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, would you --MR. GARRE: -- this establishes a Federal floor can go beyond if they want to assume morethe Act.JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you have a statute that17 -- you know, it's in -- it's in great detail -- on18 administrative procedures. It obviously -- you know,19 decision of hearing officer, administrative procedures,20 disclosure, evaluations, and recommendations. And you21 think the Federal Government goes into all this detail and22 doesn't care who has the burden of proof? That seems, to23 me, most unlikely.24 MR. GARRE: Well, Justice Scalia, we agree, in25 the sense that we think that the statute establishes at371111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 least a default rule. And, just to be clear, if the Court2 holds that Federal law establishes the traditional rule,3 then, obviously, we would be very happy with that4 decision. What we -- what we reject to strenuously is5 petitioner's position that Federal law imposes an unstated6 burden on the school districts in all proceedings7 initiated under the Act.8 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I --9 MR. GARRE: That would be --10 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- ask this question? You've11 described three situations in which you have the burden of12 at least proceeding, and I guess persuasion, too -- and,13 of course, there's a difference between the two. And I14 was just trying to think, if I were a hearing officer, and15 I thought, well, the issue in this case is whether the16 parents' objections to the IEP are valid, I think the17 first thing I'd want to know is, What is the IEP, and18 who's the best person to tell me about it? And wouldn't19 the county be in the best position to explain what has20 been done and, sort of, get the -- get the hearing21 started, and so forth?22 MR. GARRE: Well, Justice Stevens, Congress has23 answered that problem, in the sense that it requires, in24 response to a complaint, the school district to submit the25 proposed -- the IEP, the educational plan, it's adopted,381111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425as well as the other considerations -- the other options it considered and why it didn't accept those other options. So, that evidence -- and I think we're talking about the burden of production --JUSTICE STEVENS: Right. I --MR. GARRE: -- not the --JUSTICE STEVENS: -- understand.MR. GARRE: -- burden persuasion there -- thatevidence already is required to be exchanged and disclosed. Here --JUSTICE STEVENS: But then, at the hearing, who -- who introduces the first exhibit or the first witness?MR. GARRE: Well, the way it's done in the States right now is, where, in the jurisdictions where school districts bear the burden of persuasion, they are required to go first. And that increases the costs and complexity of these trials for school districts, because the -- before the parents have put on their evidence as to why they think an educational plan is inappropriate or is -- in this case, why they think the school district hasn't properly characterized their child's disability, the school district has to go forward and present its case, which is a more complex -- it's -- there's more guesswork involved --JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this? Are there 391111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 any jurisdictions in which the burden of proceeding is2 different from the burden of persuasion?3 MR. GARRE: I don't know the answer to that4 question, Justice Stevens. I think it would be a very5 unusual rule.6 JUSTICE STEVENS: I know, analytically, it's a7 different issue. But it would seem to me the normal rule8 would be whoever goes first has the burden of the9 persuasion.10 MR. GARRE: That's absolutely correct, and11 that's certainly the way that we think it would -- it12 would, more preferably, operate under the statute. But13 the question before the Court in this case is, Who bears14 the burden of persuasion? That's a very important15 question under the Act. It's not just, with respect, an16 academic question about the number of cases in with -- in17 which the evidence is mathematically in equipoise. It is18 going not have a much broader impact on the implementation19 of this statute, because it's going to be decisive, or at20 least potentially decisive, in cases like this, where21 you've got a battle of the experts. I think --22 JUSTICE BREYER: Why? Why should it be? I23 mean, that's very interesting to me. Why shouldn't the24 law be such that particularly -- you have evidence on both25 sides and a neutral decision-maker who sits there -- that401111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 it encourages that decision-maker to decide. It's one2 thing if the record's blank. But not where they have a3 lot of experts. Decide. Don't retreat to something like4 announcing, "Oh, it's in equipoise."5 MR. GARRE: The -- we would agree with you,6 Justice Breyer, but, in practice, many of these cases, the7 dispute is over the provision of experimental therapies8 for children with disabilities, particularly children with9 autism, where medically and educationally --10 JUSTICE BREYER: All right, but then to do that11 is not really to look to the interests of the child or the12 board. I mean, it is to allow a sort of doctrine from13 left field, nothing to do with the merits, to decide the14 case.15 MR. GARRE: No, Your Honor. We think that what16 it is to do is to give effect to the traditional17 presumption of regularity, which is, ultimately -- if you18 do have a tie, whose judgment ought to be given effect?19 And under the statute, where Congress recognized that20 State and local governments would retain the primary21 authority over educational decisions -- and in the Rowley22 case, where this Court reaffirmed that -- we think that,23 combined with the traditional presumption of regularity --24 which is that the actions and decisions of public25 officials are presumed to be taken in good faith, and411111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 presumed to2 in favor of34 had a situation, say, under Title 7 -- and you pointed out5 in your brief that, in most benefit cases, most -- thebe correct -- those factors counsel strongly the traditional rule here. Petitioners -- JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre, if you -- if you6 person -- whether it's Social Security -- the person who7 is making the claim has the burden of proof. But there is8 something different about this setup, because the statute9 does obligate the school district to come up with a plan.10 And so, I was thinking, if you have a Title 7 case, and11 the plaintiff prevails on the merits, and then there's a12 question of remedy, and the employer said, "I propose this13 -- these changes to remedy the violation," wouldn't the14 employer in that case have the burden of establishing the15 adequacy of the plan that it has come up with to remedy16 the problem?1718 affirmative19 question of20 in a Social21 eligible person has been denied the benefits --MR.

GARRE: I think when we talk about the2 burden of proof, we're talking about the essential3 elements of the claim, whether there's been a violation.4 So I think --5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But when I ask --6 MR.

It would create a19 demoralizing and destabilizing educational regime in which20 the judgments --21 JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, the background --22 MR. GARRE: -- of --23 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- of the Act is, Congress was24 very dissatisfied with most of the judgments being made by25 local officials --441111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR.

SALMONS               ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES            MR. SALMONS:  Thank you, Justice Stevens, andmay it please the Court:Several features of the IDEA confirm that Congress intended the traditional allocation of the burden of proof to apply to the administrative hearings under the Act, and the most important of these --JUSTICE SCALIA: Absent different disposition 461111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 by the States? What's the Government's position? Can the2 States change this burden, just the background, you know3 -- unless you -- unless you think it's okay to, you know4 --5 MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, the --6 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- have the heavens fall -- we7 don't want the heavens to fall.8 MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, the Government has9 always understood -- and this Court has understood -- that10 this is spending-clause legislation, and that the11 requirements of the Act establish a floor, and that that's12 true with regard with the substantive provisions of the13 Act, as well as the procedural ones. And let me give you14 one example. I will concede that this may seem somewhat15 anomalous, but this an unusual statute. In Rowley, for16 example, this Court construed the meaning of the term "a17 free, appropriate public education," and it determined --18 in fact, it rejected a construction of that term that19 would have required maximizing the educational benefit to20 the child.21 There are States that have adopted that high22 substantive requirement for their schools. And when23 someone brings an action, either at a due-process hearing24 or in Federal or State court, a separate civil action25 under statute, the courts apply that higher State471111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 standard. We think the same would be true with regard to2 a State's decision to adopt more restrictive -- or more3 protective, excuse me, procedural provisions for the4 parents with children with disabilities. It is left up to5 the States. The Federal law --6 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: In other words --7 MR. SALMONS: -- just establishes a floor.8 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- your answer is yes, the9 States may adopt a burden-of-proof -- here -- standard?1011 we think is 12131415 information16 the States that have said, "School district, you bear the17 burden," do we know whether there's more litigation? Do18 we know whether there has been a notable increase in the19 costs in those States that have placed the burden on the20 school districts?21 MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I would say that we22 don't have any evidence that is as strong as we would like23 on that. What we do have, and what I would refer the24 Court to, is the 2003 GAO report on the way in which the25 -- these provisions have been implemented. That is --481111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MR. SALMONS: States may, and States have. What --JUSTICE GINSBURG: And do you have --MR. SALMONS: -- improper --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- do you have anyin -- to the question I asked earlier -- in￼1 it's cited in both respondent's and petitioner's brief,2 and it was relied on by Congress in the 2004 amendments.3 And what it -- what it demonstrates is that 80 percent --4 nearly 80 percent of all due-process hearings nationwide5 have occurred in just six jurisdictions, five States and6 the District of Columbia, and that -- and that, in those7 States -- it happens to be the case at all, but Maryland,8 which is one of those states -- have clear rules that put9 the burden of proof on the school districts, and that the10 costs --11 JUSTICE SCALIA: This --12 MR. SALMONS: I'm sorry.13 JUSTICE SCALIA: These other cases that you14 refer to, where -- that involve spending legislation,15 where the States go beyond what is minimally required -- I16 suspect that they are cases where it really is an17 imposition on the States, and they accept it. Here, the18 imposition is not on the States, it's on the local school19 districts. And very often, the interests of the local20 school district is quite different from the interests of21 the people, you know, down-State, in the State capital.22 I'm -- I am loath to think that just because a State23 supreme court says that every school district in the State24 has to bear the burden of proof, that Congress intended25 that to be the case. I think it's a different -- a491111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 different situation, where the spending is money that's2 coming out of the -- ultimately, out of the pocket of the3 school district.4 MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, it may very well be5 that you would want something more than just a court6 decision. And I --7 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do we have to --8 MR. SALMONS: -- and the States that have done9 it --10 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- decide that here?11 MR. SALMONS: No, I don't think --12 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Maryland --13 MR. SALMONS: -- we do, Your Honor.14 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- doesn't have --15 MR. SALMONS: Maryland --16 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- such a rule.17 MR. SALMONS: -- Maryland does not. And I18 think, in fact, the only thing -- the only question that's19 truly presented in this case is whether the Federal20 statute mandates the unusual burden -- shift of placing21 the burden on the schools in all cases. And we think that22 clearly wasn't what Congress intended.23 And let me point to the provision of the24 statute we think is the most relevant, and that is the25 requirement that the parents -- or the complaining party501111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 file a complaint to initiate the due-process hearing. And2 that traditional pleading regime requires that the -- in3 this context, the parents come forward and identify, with4 specificity and with supporting facts, the problem with5 the school's educational program and how they would6 propose to solve that problem.7 And, in 2004, Congress went even further and8 mandated that parents cannot even obtain a due-process9 hearing until they've first complied with this due-process10 notice requirement, and that the contents of the parents'11 complaint will strictly define the subjects that can be12 addressed at the hearing. And we think that is strong13 evidence that Congress intended the traditional allocation14 of the burden of proof.15 JUSTICE STEVENS: And may I be sure I didn't16 misunderstand something you said earlier? Did you say17 that in most jurisdictions the -- by local option, the18 States have elected to adopt your adversary's --19 MR. SALMONS: No --20 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- position?21 MR. SALMONS: -- no, Your Honor, I did not.22 What I indicated is that one of the unusual aspects of23 these due-process hearings is that they occur very24 infrequently, only about 5 for every 10,000 children25 receiving educational benefits under the Act nationwide.511111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 In certain jurisdictions, there is a very high incidence2 of these hearings. And Congress, in 2004, was clearly3 concerned about the costs that those hearings were4 imposing, and were diverting funds away from the real5 purposes of the Act.6 Now, getting back to the statute, we think --7 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not sure you answered my8 question. Did you not tell us that in the States where9 there -- the largest volume of these hearings -- in most10 of those States the burden is on the school board?11 MR. SALMONS: That's correct, Your Honor. What12 I was saying is that I can't tell you that more States13 than not have adopted one rule --14 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, I --15 MR. SALMONS: -- or the other.16 JUSTICE STEVENS: Not the number of States.17 MR. SALMONS: But most --18 JUSTICE STEVENS: Number of hearings.19 MR. SALMONS: -- of the due-process hearings20 that occur in --21 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.22 MR. SALMONS: -- in the country --23 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.24 MR. SALMONS: -- occur in jurisdictions --25 JUSTICE STEVENS: I think --521111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. SALMONS: -- where, either by court or by rule the burden has been placed --            JUSTICE STEVENS:  And this was -- I wanted topoint -- was that mostly -- in those jurisdictions, was itby court or by rule?            MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, I don't have thatinformation.  Most, I think, of the jurisdictions were --most of the jurisdictions have the burden on the schools,because that's what the courts -- the Federal courts haveconstrued the Federal statute to require.  What -- thereason I have a difficult time answering that is becausethe amount of due process hearings varies so widely fromone jurisdiction to another.            JUSTICE STEVENS:  Right.            MR. SALMONS:  And part of that is because of therules and the ways in which it's been adopted.JUSTICE STEVENS: See, this is really a unique statute in so many ways. We've learned, over the years, that discrimination is being treated like everybody else in this -- in this statute, unusual discrimination. And I'm just wondering, it's -- I find it surprising and significant that those who have been free to pick the right rule have picked the rule your opponent --            MR. SALMONS:  Well, no -- Your Honor, there areseveral States that have clearly placed the rule -- by531111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 rule, on the -- on the -- on the person initiating --2 JUSTICE STEVENS: Right.3 MR. SALMONS: -- the hearing. And, in fact, I4 would say most States probably have a sort of State APA --5 JUSTICE STEVENS: And the States that have --6 MR. SALMONS: -- very similar to the Federal7 APA.8 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- the States where most of9 the hearings have taken place and have taken the opposite10 view, has --11 MR. SALMONS: Well --12 JUSTICE STEVENS: --13 --14 MR. SALMONS: It --15 JUSTICE STEVENS: --16 MR. SALMONS: There may be a cause-and-effect17 issue there, Your Honor. It may be the case that the18 types -- that by encouraging the type of litigation under19 the Act by switching the burden of proof has resulted in20 more cases being brought. The interesting fact --21 JUSTICE STEVENS: I see what you mean.22 MR. SALMONS: -- from the 2004 amendments is23 that Congress sought to reduce the amount of litigation24 under the Act by, for example, allowing --25 JUSTICE STEVENS: But those States --541111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005that been true for a numberof years?￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. SALMONS: -- for the first time --JUSTICE STEVENS: Apparently that's -- this has been -- this is not really a brand-new statute. We're going back to the '70s --MR. SALMONS: That's correct.JUSTICE STEVENS: -- with this statute. And is it true that for most of that period that's been the rule, where most of litigation has taken place --MR. SALMONS: I -- Your Honor, I believe it's the -- I can't answer that. I think it's -- it's most -- it's more recent than that. And I think the explosion of litigation under the Act is more recent than that.JUSTICE STEVENS: Right.MR. SALMONS: And Congress has been very concerned about that.            Now, by requiring that the parent's due-processcomplaint define the contours of the hearing, we thinkCongress has signaled where the burden of proof should be. And, in addition to that, it seems -- it seems to us thatit has addressed the policy and fairness concerns thepetitioners rely on so much.  As this Court recognized inRowley, it's through the procedural protections of the Actthat Congress sought to ensure that parents had sufficientinformation and resources to defend the interests of theirchild.  And we think, by place -- this complaint notice551111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425requirement represents a considered judgment by Congressthat those procedural protections will have done theirjobs and that parents will be in a strong enough positionto adequately defend the interests of their child in anyhearing.  And that's certainly true if you would comparethe position of the parents under this Act with benefitsclaimants and civil rights plaintiffs in any number ofother Federal statutes.            If Your Honors have no more questions, thankyou.            JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Hurd, you have about threeminutes left.            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. HURD                ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS            MR. HURD:  Thank you, Your Honor.            Let me begin by focusing on the costs of placingthe burden on the school system.  Five years ago, theUnited States said, when it was then, in this case, on theside of the parents, that placing the burden on the schooldistrict, quote, "should not substantially increase theworkload for the school," end quote, page 12 of its briefin 2000.            The National School Board Association figuresshow that the total costs of mediation, due-processhearings and litigation works out to about $22 per head561111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425for every child in special education.  That's not a lot ofmoney to devote to the enforcement of civil rights law.JUSTICE SCALIA: For each hearing or -- for each hearing or just --MR. HURD: Total, Your Honor. The total figure, nationwide, is 146.5 million. If you divide that numberby the 6.7 children in special ed --JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh.MR. HURD: -- it's about --JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh.MR. HURD: -- $22 a head. And that -- JUSTICE SCALIA: I think it would be morerealistic to divide it by the number of hearings, ratherthan by the number of heads.MR. HURD: Well, Your Honor, the total -- the total figure is 146.5 million. It is a drop in the bucket compared to the 11.4 billion that Congress appropriates. Moreover, Your Honor --JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you know what the --MR. HURD: -- there's no indication --JUSTICE SOUTER: -- do you know what the figureis per hearing?MR. HURD: Per hearing --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes.            MR. HURD:  -- Your Honor, is going to vary.571111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 But there's no indication --2 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, no. You divide the3 number of hearings by the figure you've just mentioned,4 and that's the result. Have you -- have you done --5 MR. HURD: There are about 3,000 --6 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- the arithmetic?7 MR. HURD: -- there are about 3,000 --8 JUSTICE SOUTER: Three- --9 MR. HURD: -- hearings, but that $146 million is10 not just the hearings; it also includes mediation, it11 includes litigation. And there's no basis to conclude12 that putting the burden on the parents is going to13 decrease, rather than increase, hearings. If you let the14 school systems slide by without being held accountable,15 they are likely to be less thorough in preparing their16 IEPs, as they were in this case. And when they're less17 thorough, there will be more understatement, more18 disputes, and less consensus.19 May I also point out, in response to Justice20 Breyer's point, if there is to be no Federal law on this21 question, if it is purely State law -- then it ought to be22 remanded back to the Maryland district court to ascertain23 what Maryland law is on this point.24 And, Justice O'Connor, while there is no25 statute or regulation on point, there are certainly581111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 background principles of law that Maryland has, just as2 we've been arguing here at the Federal level, that would3 dictate for4 lie.56 pointed out7 But these are not traditional pleading requirements, where8 one side makes allegations and the other side goes,9 "admit, admit, deny, deny." If you look on page 12 of the10 addendum, you see the portion of the statute that requires11 the kind of response the Government must make. It's not12 admit/deny. It is to give, essentially, a detailed13 explanation for its position, just as the parents haveMaryland where that burden of proof shouldNow, opposing counsel, the Government, hasthat there are these pleading requirements.14 given a detailed explanation15 between those two positions,16 the burden of proof.17 I see my time is up.18 Thank the Court.19 [Whereupon, at 12:0220 above-entitled matter was submitted.]21 22 23 241111 14th Street, NW, Suite 40059 1-Washington, DC 20005for their position.
