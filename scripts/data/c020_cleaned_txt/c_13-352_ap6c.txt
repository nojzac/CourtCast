Hargis Industries.      Mr. Jay.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM JAY      ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. JAY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      The Lanham Act contains only one concept oflikelihood of confusion.  That is why the two tribunalsin this case decided the same issue, and that is whyissue of preclusion is appropriate.  Whether a court isconsidering registration or infringement or both at thesame time, the statutory test is the same, whether theresemblance of the marks as used on particular goodswould give rise to a likelihood of confusion or mistakeor deceit.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Jay, there are exceptions to preclusion even though you would see the identical issue, and one of them is when the stakes are higher in the second proceeding than in the first and, indeed, the restatement of judgments gives some examples of that. And it seems to me this is such a4￼1 case, because it's one thing to say that we won't2 register your mark and another to say you can't use the3 mark.4 MR. JAY: There is an exception for when ­­5 when the stakes are different, Justice Ginsburg, but I6 think that the difference has to be a difference of an7 order of magnitude greater than we're dealing with here.8 So I think the best example in the restatement is the9 example of a small claims court. Small claims courts10 are set up in such a way that their designers understand11 their judgments won't be preclusive and that's what gets12 people to litigate there.13 Here the stakes are different, but I don't14 think it can be said that the stakes before the15 Trademark Trial and Appeal Board are so low.16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't think that your17 example of small claims court is the closest. There's18 one on section 83, which is determinations by an19 administrative tribunal, and the example it gives is of20 a scheme that contemplates an agency proceeding to be as21 expeditious as possible. And one way of assuring22 expeditiousness is to confine the stakes to the matter23 immediately in controversy.24 MR. JAY: The matter immediately in25 controversy, though, in ­­ in this case, the matter is5￼1 the same and the ­­ the way that ­­2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The matter in controversy3 is registration, and in the second proceeding, it's4 infringement.5 MR. JAY: That's correct. That's why6 there's no claim preclusion, for example. So in that7 sense, they are different, but the inquiry that the two8 tribunals are asking is the same.9 And to say that the ­­ the stakes are10 different, certainly, they're different, but I don't11 think that they are sufficiently different that you can12 infer from that that Congress wanted the trademark13 board's judgments not to be preclusive.14 And I would encourage the Court to think15 about the ways in which the trademark board decides16 issues that will be, I think everyone would agree,17 exactly the same in subsequent litigation such as18 priority. Priority is the key to determining who gets19 to register a mark, who's the senior mark, and who's ­­20 and who's the junior mark. The trademark board21 frequently decides that factual question, who came22 first, who started using it in commerce first. And23 there's no reason to think that Congress would want that24 factual matter relitigated in a subsequent infringement25 action without regard to the proceeding that's come1 before.2 JUSTICE SCALIA:3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:4 JUSTICE SCALIA:5 the ­­ the trademark determination is broader rather6 than narrower than the infringement determination,7 right? The infringement determination just applies to8 one alleged infringer whereas the trademark registration9 would register the trademark as against the world. So10 I'm not sure that it's terribly narrower.11 MR. JAY: Well, in the ­­ in an opposition12 or cancellation proceeding, Justice Scalia, there ­­13 there is a concrete dispute between the holders of two14 marks. But you're right that a registration is a right15 nationwide as against the world that gives you16 priority as of a certain date.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But ­­ but the person who18 uses the mark could continue to use it. And the reason19 the restatement gives before the expeditious first20 proceeding is that you don't want to make that21 proceeding pull out all the stops because it's going to22 be determinative of the infringement suit.23 MR. JAY: But I think you could say the24 same, Justice Ginsburg, if the Trademark Trial and25 Appeal Board's decision were appealed to a U.S. DistrictI suppose ­­   Well, just ­­I suppose in one sense6￼7￼1 Court or to the Federal Circuit. The stakes would be2 the same. The stakes would still be registration.3 But I don't understand the other side to be4 saying that that tribunal's judgment would not be5 preclusive because ­­ because of a difference in the6 stakes. They're saying that the issues are different to7 be sure. They're saying that the legal issue of8 confuse ­­ of likelihood of confusion in infringement9 proceedings is different than the legal issue in10 registration proceedings.11 But I think once you get past that argument,12 and I think the statute and the history and the13 structure all dispatch that, then I think that the ­­ I14 don't think that the notion that the stakes are15 different can save Respondents from preclusion here.16 JUSTICE ALITO: Would you agree that if we17 accept your argument, the number of cases in which the18 elements of issue preclusion will be met by the TTAB19 proceeding will be relatively rare? And if that is the20 case, is it worthwhile to create a rule that applies21 only in that very limited set of circumstances?22 MR. JAY: I think, Justice Alito, that the23 number of circumstances in which the ­­ our rule would24 apply depends on the number of circumstances in which25 people seek to register the same goods that they are81 actually using. Now, it's certainly true that sometimes2 people file registrations for goods that they don't3 intend to use and that their actual use in real life4 will be different.5 But I do think that for the 40­some odd6 percent of registrations that are ­­ deal with marks7 already in use, that generally, when an applicant comes8 to the patent office and says, I'd like to register a9 trademark for use on these goods, that it's the goods10 that that person is already using. So that under our11 rule when the marks are the same, the goods are the12 same, and they're sold in the same channels of commerce,13 that's when it's appropriate for preclusion to apply.14 And I don't think that that's such a15 vanishingly small set of circumstances that you would16 say the game isn't worth the candle.17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I have a bit of a18 problem, okay? We have held that in ­­ in Kappos last19 year or two terms ago ­­ I've now lost track of time ­­20 that an applicant who loses before the board can21 introduce new evidence at the trial. So we have made22 the assumption that ­­ that an applicant doesn't have to23 produce everything. So what happens in the situation24 when there is new evidence? What kind of deference do25 we owe then? Is it ­­ that's why I think Justice Alito￼9￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425said this might be a unique case because I ­­ then ­­your adversary may tell me and tell me differently ­­the two proceedings had almost identical evidence.MR. JAY: That is certainly our position, that the proceedings were the same. The only difference Respondent has identified is this point about the two­word phrase, "building fasteners," which I'd be happy to come back to.      But I want to make sure I understand YourHonor's question.  You're asking what the preclusiveeffect of a district court's judgment would be if newevidence is ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No. Just assume that there's new evidence that they want to present at the infringement trial.MR. JAY: Oh, I see.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what's the charge the court gives? What deference does the court ask to be given to the board in that situation?MR. JAY: I think ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It didn't have evidence that existed before.MR. JAY: Well, I think that there are ­­ there are two different questions. One is whether the marks are the same, the goods are the same, and they're1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425being sold in the same channels of commerce, andthat's ­­ that is what would line up the infringementproceeding with the registration proceeding.      And saying I have new evidence that I wouldlike to introduce that I didn't introduce before, youhave the option to go up to the district court on reviewof the trademark board proceeding.  You always have thatoption, and that's what ­­ that is the significance ofKappos v. Hyatt.      If you don't take that option, I think youshould not expect in the infringement litigation to say,well, preclusion doesn't apply merely because I think Ihave some new evidence.      And that's a bedrock principle of the law onjudgments, that new evidence isright to preclusion, but ­­      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:the effects of full preclusion.MR. JAY: Well ­­      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:should have.not enough to get youSo you're talking aboutIf you could have, youMR. JAY: If you could have, you should have. Now, there certainly will be ­­ there certainly are matters that the trademark board will not adjudicate, and there certainly are ways in which10￼111 infringement litigation can differ and that the simplest2 way is if the goods are different. So if you seek to3 register a broad array of goods and the trademark board4 finds a likelihood of confusion based on that broad5 array of goods in your registration, but the6 infringement action turns only on one ­­ you know, one7 good within that set, jeans instead of all clothing, for8 example, then I think preclusion wouldn't apply. And9 that's the way the Federal Circuit applies it going in10 the opposite direction, that if infringement ­­ if11 infringement ­­ that no confusion judgment turns only on12 a tiny subset of the goods listed in the registration.13 Well, then, of course the issue is different because ­­14 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose the ­­ and maybe15 this is what is worrying some people. The marks, you16 have a mark, I have a mark, and I have ­­ it's like17 Louis Vuitton or something. I mean, it covers just18 thousands of things. And there is one manufacturer who19 makes one of those things, and he really thinks, I don't20 have to worry about this, you know. If ­­ if I win or21 lose, it's not that big a deal. I don't think they're22 going to come into my area really.23 MR. JAY: Louis Vuitton thinks this or24 the ­­25 JUSTICE BREYER: No, the ­­ the competitor￼12￼1 in one small thing like a lipstick or something, he2 doesn't think there is going to be Louis Vuitton3 lipstick, though there may be. And sure enough, it is4 there, and sure enough, he does do it, so he just5 doesn't want to go to the time and trouble of having6 every possible bit of evidence and so forth. And then7 lo and behold, later on it turns out this is a very big8 deal to him. And what he's worried about is that that9 means I have to look at every trademark application, I10 have to give my all the first time, and if I don't, I'm11 stuck. That's true, isn't it?12 MR. JAY: Well, it is true that whichever13 forum he goes to first, whether it's the trademark board14 or a court considering infringement, yes, he's supposed15 to give his all the first time because the judgment can16 be preclusive in future litigation.17 But ­­ and I think that the reasons to pay18 attention to registration in the circumstances that you19 gave are significant ones, because if he just lets Louis20 Vuitton sit there in the market with a registration for21 5 years, and Louis Vuitton's mark becomes incontestable22 then he has to face the consequences of that.23 So I think that people who are already in24 the ­­ in the market and see a junior mark holder coming25 in and seeking registration, they have reasons to oppose131 that registration. But if they don't want to go to the2 board, they don't have to go to the board. No one ever3 has to go to the board who doesn't want to, because you4 always have the option of pursuing the cancellation5 relief or getting a mark cancelled or getting your mark6 registered. You can do that in district court coupled7 with an infringement action.8 So if you are the senior mark holder, sue9 for infringement and you'll have a jury trial, right.10 If you win, then you can get the opposing mark11 cancelled, provided that it hasn't become uncontestable.12 That, I think, is a large part of our answer13 to the other side's argument about the jury trial right,14 that there's always the option to sue. There's also15 always the option to get Article III review of a16 judgment of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. The17 board is just deciding a question of public right. It's18 not trenching on the ­­ the role of Article III judges.19 But once its renders such a judgment, as a matter of20 preclusion law, as a matter of statutory text, its21 judgment is preclusive because it's deciding the same22 issue and under this Court's decision in Astoria v.23 Solimino.24 JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you happen to know what25 proportion of people in the situation that Justice￼141 Breyer indicated do go to the board? And is the board2 the ­­ the primary avenue or is it not?3 MR. JAY: That's a difficult question,4 Justice Kagan. I know that there are more board5 proceedings filed each year, opposition and cancellation6 proceedings filed, than there are infringement actions,7 you know, trademark actions, filed in the district8 courts. I know, however, that a lot of those don't go9 to final judgment, precisely because I think often the10 mere filing of an action in the ­­ in the board can11 alert the ­­ perhaps the junior mark holder that you're12 junior to someone else, you're going to have a problem13 if you don't either, A, reach an accommodation; B, limit14 yourself geographically; C, choose a different mark.15 And I think that the board's proceedings may well be16 more conducive to that than litigation. But in the ­­17 there are, I think, fewer than 200 board cases that go18 to final judgment each year in contested proceedings.19 I'm not sure how many trademark cases actually go to20 final judgment.21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: When you say "to final22 judgment," you mean final judgment before the board or23 file judgment after review in the courts?24 MR. JAY: I mean final judgment before the25 board, Justice Kennedy. The number of litigants that￼151 actually go on and seek review, as you would expect, is2 smaller. But there's certainly always the option to3 seek review, either before the Federal circuit under the4 APA standard of review or in district court. And if you5 go to district court, you can, if you choose, introduce6 new evidence.7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You have alternatively8 argued in your brief for some form of deference if we're9 not going to call it preclusive. It seemed to me that10 that was addressing an issue you didn't seek cert on,11 which was whether the court below erred in not12 permitting the mark holder to ­­ to tell the jury that13 the board had found a similarity and confusion. But I14 don't know that you've actually made that argument,15 number one. And number two, on what would you base a16 holding of deference? In what field of law do we say,17 give deference and how ­­ what ­­ what's the standard18 that we would use?19 MR. JAY: The ­­ first, Justice Sotomayor,20 let me be clear. Our primary position is, of course,21 preclusion. And the only reason that we would get into22 deference is if preclusion doesn't apply because, even23 though it's the same issue, for some reason the24 Trademark Board can't render a preclusive judgment, and25 we think that that issue is what's not properly been￼161 preserved because the other side waived it at the cert2 stage.3 But if you got into that, we think that what4 you would look ­­ and this is why we put question 2 in5 our cert petition and the Court granted both questions,6 what you would look to, I think ­­ or, for example, the7 arbitration cases like Alexander v. Gardner­Denver, in8 which this Court decided that an arbitration in a9 Title VII action would not be ­­ arbitration would not10 be preclusive of a Title VII action. But the fact that11 the same parties had litigated the same discrimination12 issue before an arbitrator with, perhaps, the same13 evidence was entitled to evidentiary weight and perhaps14 if every ­­ if the proceedings were full and fair and15 the issues really were the same, perhaps, great weight,16 I think, is the final footnote in Gardner­Denver and17 then in McDonald v. City of West Branch.18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Were those in days before19 you could get a jury trial in a Title VII case?20 MR. JAY: The Court, I believe, had not held21 that at that point, Justice Ginsburg. So I think22 that's ­­ I think that's correct. But I don't think23 that the jury question has any effect on this because,24 you know, for example, there's ­­ there's a jury right25 in a 1983 case, there's a jury right in an ADEA case.￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      JUSTICE GINSBURG:Circuit on that point was that the jury would bepowerfully confused; it has enough to deal with what thecharge in the infringement case is.MR. JAY: It ­­ it certainly would require an explanation of what went on, but I think that that would have been better than instructing the jury, as was done here, that the two proceedings involved completely different issues and that the jury should not give it any weight at all.      If I may at this point, I'd like to reservethe balance of my time.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bash.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. BASH     FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAESUPPORTING PETITIONERMR. BASH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      Respondent has not identified any materialdifference between the issue decided by the board andthe issue ­­ and what was at issue in the infringementcase.  For that reason ­­JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Bash, that's a very much stronger statement than your briefs make. So yourWhat disturbed the Eighth17￼181 briefs go likely and probably and this and that. And ­­2 so are all of your likely's and probably's no longer3 true?4 MR. BASH: Well, the likely's or probably's5 were an opening for Respondent to identify a material6 difference between the suit and the board proceeding.7 The reason we did that is because we were framing the8 standard in a slightly different way than it was9 proposed below. And we think if the normal course of10 proceedings had happened, Petitioner would have asked11 for summary judgment and then Respondent should have12 come forward and identified some difference in the goods13 or marks or channels of trade, and then the district14 court and potentially the jury could have considered15 whether that difference was material.16 The issues weren't teed up like that in17 the courts below, so we wanted to give Respondent a fair18 opportunity to identify a difference between what19 happened in the board and what happened before20 the court, and Respondent has not identified any21 difference that we would consider material under our22 standard.23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. That's an24 even ­­ that's another fudge word, "material." They25 have represented one, which was the use of the mark with￼191 the word "fastener" or whatever it was that the ­­ that2 the Solicitor General's Office referred to earlier, that3 Mr. Jay referred to earlier. So get to the stuff you4 think is immaterial.5 MR. BASH: So the only difference that6 Respondent has identified is what we would characterize7 as a different mark, "Sealtite Building Fasteners"8 versus "Sealtite." Now, I think Petitioner has9 demonstrated that "Sealtite Building Fasteners" wasn't10 even really at issue in the trial, but even putting11 aside that factual distinction, the ordinary rule is12 just adding a generic term like "building fasteners"13 can't make the difference in a preclusion analysis. So14 I think the way it should have worked had everything15 gone sort of the correct way is that Petitioner would16 have said, hey, the board proceeding gets issue17 preclusion in this infringement suit. I'm suing about18 the word "Sealtite," which is, by the way, what the jury19 was instructed, not "Sealtite Building Fasteners."20 Respondent then could have come forward and said, well,21 actually, the mark's a little different now. It's22 "Sealtite Building Fasteners" or "Sealtite Screws" or23 "Sealtite Nails."24 And at the summary judgment stage, the25 district court would have had to make a judgment about￼20￼1 whether that was a sufficiently different mark to2 obviate issue preclusion. And the material standard is3 not just drawn from thin air. It's the ordinary4 standard in issue preclusion where the question arises5 whether the second tribunal is considering a6 fundamentally different issue than the first tribunal.7 I think in Montana v. United States, when this Court8 talked about the changed circumstances principle, it9 averted to that principle.10 And it really has to be that way. I mean,11 just imagine the court­to­court scenario, infringement12 court at time one and then infringement court at time13 two. Surely, if Petitioner had obtained a judgment that14 the mark "Sealtite" infringes in an infringement court,15 Respondent couldn't then just add "Fasteners" and start16 the suit all over again and then once Respondent ­­17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, how do you respond18 to the question I asked Mr. Jay, that is, as the19 Restatement of Judgments says, if one aspect of the20 first proceeding is to assure expeditiousness, then21 confining the stakes to that issue of registration makes22 sense so that the parties will not be induced to dispute23 the administrative proceeding in anticipation of its24 effect on another proceeding.25 MR. BASH: Justice Ginsburg, I think that's19 administrative tribunal and20 could effectively mean that21 opportunity to litigate the22 JUSTICE KAGAN:a judicial proceeding thatthere wasn't a full and fairquestion.One of the amicus briefsvery much less expensive, so211 a correct statement of the law, but it's inapplicable2 here. I think it has two components. One is how3 expedited are the proceedings here? How close is it to4 small court? The other is what's at stake? So let me5 just take both of those in turn.6 This is not like small claims court or7 arbitral court. This is a proceeding in which you have8 the full discovery permitted by the civil rules, in fact9 with respect to interrogatories, three times as many10 interrogatories as in the civil rules, the full Federal11 Rules of Evidence, including E­discovery. It's just12 like a civil ­­ a civil proceeding. And, in fact, then13 you can ­­14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There are some15 differences. There's no live testimony, right.16 MR. BASH: There is ­­ there's no live17 testimony, but I don't think that has ever been18 understood as the sort of difference between an￼23 suggests that this is very,24 that it's like 10 percent of the cost of an infringement25 suit. Why is that?the district court andstart all over again deyou, Justice Scalia.How is that expeditious?  Igoing to follow on to myMR. BASH:JUSTICE SCALIA:Thank221 MR. BASH: Because in an infringement suit,2 the most discovery­intensive aspects, I think, are often3 damages and injunctive relief. In other words, you4 really have to look at the other side's books to know5 how many of these products did you sell, what were your6 profits, and so forth. So it's not surprising that in a7 suit where damages or injunctive relief is at issue, it8 could be, you know, four times the cost for discovery9 purposes of this kind of suit.10 JUSTICE SCALIA: I ­­ I find it hard to11 believe that this board proceeding is ­­ is intended￼12 to ­­13 up to14 novo.15to be expeditious, because the losing party can go1617 don't 1819 answer to Justice Ginsburg by making that point. I20 mean, you have a full de novo trial in district court if21 you want it, and that doesn't reflect the sort of22 proceeding that Congress would have thought was summary23 in nature. And I would just add one, I guess,24 higher­level point about the nature of the proceedings,25 which is that I think that can come into this case inunderstand that.MR. BASH:I was231 two ways. One, you could think that Congress would not2 have intended these proceedings to get preclusive effect3 because of their summary nature and I think that's how4 Respondent is using it. But that ­­ that doesn't work,5 because Congress did not set the procedures for the6 board. Section 1123 gives the director authority to set7 the procedures.8 JUSTICE BREYER: That's ­­ that's what I9 think you'll hear in a minute, because in the brief, the10 red brief, on pages 30 to 31 and 8 and 9, there is11 discussion about the evidentiary procedures before the12 board. And the ­­ the Respondent says they are much13 more limited. One, you cannot call live witnesses; two,14 the board continuously says that they should not be like15 a district court. They should be far more limited. So16 I guess the argument is, well, in light of that17 procedural difference, he can't call all his witnesses,18 he can't test the consumer experts of the other side who19 say that there is no confusion, and he can't present his20 very credible expert who will come up and say, I21 interviewed 4,000 consumers and they are totally mixed22 up.23 So ­­ so if you have that ­­ would you24 address that?25 MR. BASH: I will address that. The only￼241 significant difference is no live testimony in front of2 the adjudicator. There is written depositions where the3 experts testify, they submit reports, and they can be4 cross­examined. So the only significant difference is5 no live testimony in front of the adjudicator. And as6 you know, that is a principle embodied in the APA as7 consistent with ordinary administrative action. The8 adjudicator in an administrative tribunal does not need9 to hear the witness. That's embodied in the APA10 provision cited in the reply brief.11 The ­­ the other different ­­ purported12 differences that Respondent in one of the amicus briefs13 have identified are not actual differences. They're14 quoting snippets of TTAB decisions where the board was15 perturbed that the parties engaged in excessive16 discovery and they said something like, Look, given the17 narrowest of what we're ­­ narrowness of what we're18 deciding ­­ in one of the cases it was descriptiveness19 ­­ you don't need to engage in full­blown discovery.20 The rules and numerous TTAB decisions make very clear21 that full­lead discovery is allowed.22 The only other, I think, difference or23 purported difference identified in one of the amicus24 briefs was consumer surveys and the idea that they will25 only accept a consumer survey where it has the word on a￼25￼1 blank card. That's true ­­ you know, just the word2 "Sealtite" on a blank placard. That's true when what is3 sought to be registered is a word mark, not a design4 mark with a particular color. The idea being that you5 can't skew the survey by adding colors and things when6 actually what you're seeking registration for is just7 the word.8 But the same thing could happen in an9 infringement court. If the defendant was sued based on10 their registered word mark, I think a factfinder in an11 infringement court would say a survey that has design12 elements ­­ color, font, and so forth ­­ when you're13 asserting the right to use this word in any context,14 that sort of survey is not going to be as probative as a15 survey that just uses the word, since you're seeking the16 right to just use the word.17 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Bash, could you go back,18 I think it was to Justice Alito's question before, and19 just talk a little bit about, do you think that this is20 an unusual case in that the issues are the same or a21 usual case?22 MR. BASH: I don't have statistics, so I'm23 sort of speaking just from my experience reading24 the case law. But I don't think it's terribly unusual.25 I mean, I think a lot of times people seek to register a261 mark for the goods they sell and so an infringement suit2 is going to involve the same goods in the channels of3 trade those goods are ordinarily sold in. So I don't4 think it's a situation where issue preclusion is not5 worth the candle, and in fact, I think it's6 extraordinary administrable, in fact, more administrable7 than the average just litigation context, because the8 limitations in the first action, in other words, what9 goods were at issue, what marks are at issue, what the10 channels of trade are, are often just set forth right11 there in the registration. So it's not like you have to12 conduct a searching inquiry to figure out what was at13 issue in the first administrative proceeding. You look14 at the registration. If no common law rights are at15 issue on the opposition side, you look at the opposer's16 registration, and you say, okay, this was about cars17 sold to retail consumers; that's what was at issue in18 the board proceeding. If now we're talking about cars19 sold to government or municipal entities, that is20 potentially a materially different issue. And then you21 have to make the sort of materiality judgment that22 courts make every day.23 But I guess I just want to close with I24 think Respondents' primary textual argument that what is25 being considered here are different issues is that the￼27￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425registration provision uses the word ­­ the phrase, "soresembles" and the infringement provision 1114 uses thephrase "used in commerce."  I mean, as you can just seefrom the text of the provisions, they both are about themarks being used in commerce and whether the marks usedin commerce would confuse people.If I could just finish one sentence. The ­­ and in the infringement provision, the phrase "colorable imitation" is defined, as the reply brief points out, as "so resembles." So the textual provisions are precisely parallel.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Katyal.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL      ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSMR. KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      Congress designed the Trademark Registry asa relatively low­cost signaling mechanism to providenotice, but Congress made clear that the main event, theconclusive determination of the right to use a mark incommerce, was reserved for Article III courts withrobust procedures and sweeping remedies.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you do have that alternative before ­­ after a board action.281 MR. KATYAL: We certainly do with respect to2 district court review. It's de novo, and that's one3 reason, Justice Sotomayor, why we think when we're4 analyzing whether Congress intended to adopt a5 preclusion doctrine we think the answer to that is no.6 That is ­­7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's my problem,8 which is, it seems to me, that you are rendering the9 board proceeding almost irrelevant with respect to10 litigation. And it may be when you're seeking de novo11 review, but why should we say that you get a second bite12 at the apple after you've wasted the board's time? Why13 not just tell you go straight ­­ if you're going to wait14 for an infringement action, go there.15 MR. KATYAL: Well, I think that Congress did16 intend that the district court ­­ the TTAB proceeding17 was rendered largely irrelevant when there was district18 court de novo review.19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Except that in Kappos,20 we explicitly said that some weight should be given to21 the board's judgment. So it's not as if it's being22 ignored altogether, right?23 MR. KATYAL: Precisely. But when there's24 new evidence, as there was in Kappos, then it is de novo25 review. And this Court in Astoria said when that￼291 occurs, that when you have a system like that, that's2 Congress telegraphing that they didn't intend for3 preclusive review to exist. That is to say, why would4 Congress have said that the TTAB decisions over5 registration, something that they have absolute 1006 percent ­­7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:8 happened here. The court below9 a jury ­­ you can't describe to￼10 trademark board did. You can't11 the same evidence and how much weight to give. That's12 not the path that was followed here.13 MR. KATYAL: Well, I disagree, Your Honor.14 In this case, the jury was told about the ­­ about the15 TTAB determination at several points in the record.16 Now, it's true that the district court ultimately said,17 look, at the end of the day these are different18 questions. This is what Joint Appendix page 247 says,19 that the district court said, after review of all of20 this, it was different evidence answering a different21 question and fundamentally the different question that22 is at issue in TTAB or district court de nova review is23 this. It is ­­ you know, when ­­ they do say the same24 concept, likelihood of confusion, but the subject is25 very different. That is, in a registration decision theBut that's not whatsaid, no, you can't givethis jury what thedecide whether it was30￼1 question about what is likely to confuse is a2 resemblance where ­­ a confusing resemblance. Whereas3 the question under the statute with respect to4 infringement is a confusing use.5 Now, that distinction has6 persisted for 150 years, since the year 1870, and I7 think you could endorse the type of statutory gymnastics8 that my friend from the government does to say, hey,9 these are the same inquiry. But at the end of the day,10 that is against everything this Court's precedents11 teach, which is that when Congress uses different12 statutory formulations in different provisions, they are13 deemed to mean different things. And here, you know, my14 friend from the government concluded by saying, well,15 you know the statute defines confusing resemblance ­­16 excuse me, defines ­­ defines colorable imitation as a17 resemblance and so, therefore, the inquiries are somehow18 the same. Absolutely not. Because what the trademark19 infringement statute says, 1114, is not simply that you20 need to have a colorable imitation, it's that you need21 to have a colorable imitation that in its use causes a22 likelihood of confusion. A colorable imitation alone is23 not enough. You've got to have both the colorable24 imitation or resemblance, plus the use of it. That's25 what causes the infringement and that's the heart of the1 infringement inquiry ­­2 JUSTICE SCALIA:3 board has to decide whether the trademark as applied to4 particular goods is confusing. Once you say it's as5 applied to particular goods in a particular area of6 commerce, isn't that the same as saying has used whether7 it causes confusion?8 MR. KATYAL: Not at all, Justice Scalia.9 And you have all of the amici, all the trademark10 practitioners before you on behalf of neither party or11 on behalf of us telling you that is not what the statute12 means or how it's applied. Why? Because, yes, it13 mentions the word "use" once with respect to in14 connection of the goods, but that's only to connect the15 fact ­­ the mark to the fact that it is being applied to16 certain goods. Every amici is telling you that the way17 in which the TTAB interprets that statute is to say that18 the ultimate focus is on the confusing resemblance.19 This case is a perfect illustration of that.20 The TTAB here said, look, we're going to look to whether21 or not these are the same things. Basically, are these22 bolts or not and not to how in practice it's actually23 used. And that is why ­­24 JUSTICE SCALIA: But even in use what causes25 the confusion will be the resemblance. I don't care ifBut, but, but, but.  The31￼      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:the board in this case?MR. KATYAL:      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:board?MR.

KATYAL: We tried to put some of that evidence in, Your Honor, but as ­­ as the amici are saying and, indeed, as the decision in this case reveals, ultimately, the way the TTAB decides ­­ it doesn't really weigh actual use very much at the end of the day. That is, you can have all the inputs of actual use that you want into the TTAB process, but the question the TTAB is answering guided ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You didn't answer myThat answer.

The problem isthe resemblance between the two marks in every ­­ inevery situation it seems to me.MR. KATYAL: Justice Scalia, here's our key point. It's not simply the resemblance. It's how the products are used in practice. It's how they'remarketed, how they're sold, to whomthis case, for example, Justice ­­they're sold.  In331 question. Was all of that ­­ was the same evidence ­­2 MR. KATYAL: Absolutely not. And so for ­­3 let me just ­­ let me respond to what ­­ to the question4 that you were asking my friend before, was the evidence5 the same. Absolutely not.6 So in the ­­ in the TTAB proceedings there7 were a whopping four depositions introduced and zero8 discovery, zero discovery. In the trial, 14 live9 witnesses over a seven­day trial with 4,000 pages of10 discovery, this mirrors, as the amici say, the way that11 these proceedings generally unfold and here are some of12 the differences. The jury was told ­­ the jury trial13 had lots of evidence about customer sophistication.14 And ­­ and, indeed, the district court on summarizing15 that evidence said ­­ and this is at Joint Appendix ­­16 this is Petition Appendix page 37 ­­ that that evidence17 was overwhelming. That this was not kind of people18 going to Ace Hardware, the customers like that. This is19 a very sophisticated set of customers who knew exactly20 the difference between the types of bolts. Now,21 the TTAB ­­22 JUSTICE SCALIA: And this evidence could not23 have been introduced before the board.24 MR. KATYAL: We ­­ we tried ­­25 JUSTICE SCALIA: To be sure it was not￼341 introduced, but could it have been introduced before the2 board?3 MR. KATYAL: It could only to introduced to4 limit the mark and that's what the amici say. That is5 ­­ and this is a technical part of trademark law,6 here's how it works. Basically, when the TTAB is7 examining evidence of actual use, they can use it8 determine whether or not ­­ what the mark means.9 can introduce evidence about what is a building10 fastener, but you can't introduce that evidence to11 somehow limit the meaning of the mark. So the mark here12 is simply the word "Sealtite," that's what Joint13 Appendix page 70 says.14 You couldn't in TTAB point to all the amici15 who are before you saying that the TTAB couldn't take16 actual use evidence and say, well, it's only sold to17 this type of consumer or that type of consumer. That18 wouldn't be something that they could do.19 JUSTICE BREYER: Could you do this ­­ I20 don't know if you have time ­­ but with an example. The21 reason I'm having a hard time, I'm thinking Louis22 Vuitton, say, all right. Now Lilly Vuitton wants to23 register a mark. Okay. So we go to the TTAB and it's24 for lipstick. And Lilly says, look it, it says Lilly25 Vuitton and Louis says, yeah. And now the question is￼buttoSo you20 cause 2122 thing23 cause2425 thereconfusion?JUSTICE BREYER:here.  It says does it351 well, will it cause confusion when used in connection2 with the lipstick?3 MR. KATYAL: Right.4 JUSTICE BREYER: So we look at it. All5 right. Now we're in the infringement action. Exact6 same situation. And here they are supposed to say, will7 it cause confusion when you ­­ when ­­ will it cause8 confusion in connection with the sale of any goods or9 services which includes the lipstick? So I'm having a10 terrible time seeing what the difference is.11 MR. KATYAL: Well, Justice Breyer, the12 difference is exactly what you just said there with ­­13 JUSTICE BREYER: It may be what I said, but14 I just didn't see it.15 MR. KATYAL: The statute ­­ in the16 infringement statute, 1114, mentions use repeatedly,17 including advertising, sales, all different ways in￼18 which use causes confusion.19 that's being asked is: DoesAnd the ultimate questionthat use, does such useYes.  And it says the sameso resemble a mark as toconnection with the goods?confusion when used inMR. KATYAL: Exactly, Justice Breyer. Butit is the mark's resemblance that361 causes confusion. And to be sure, you can look to the2 fact that it's ­­3 JUSTICE BREYER: It's the resemblance in4 connection with the goods.5 MR. KATYAL: With the fact that it's goods,6 but not how the goods are used, the advertising, the7 marketing, the sales. That's the difference.8 JUSTICE BREYER: Not how they're used.9 Okay. So what about saying this then. We'd say, if it10 turns out that in your infringement case that was really11 an issue, you know, that was really a big deal in12 this ­­ a serious deal in this case, it's not because of13 the use of the goods, it's because of the resemblance14 through advertising cures it. Then you don't have ­­15 not ­­ not precluded. You are only precluded in the16 case the SG says, which is where everything is really17 the same.18 MR. KATYAL: We have two answers to that.19 The first is as Justice Ginsburg was saying earlier when20 the weight of the proceedings has differences at stake,21 then preclusion shouldn't apply. But the second, just22 to deal with that, is that if the mark itself claims23 some sort of limited sale, limited ­­ limited category24 of people to whom it's being sold to in the channels of25 trade and the like, then that actual use evidence can￼37￼1 come in.2 The red brief at page 47 gives you a bunch3 of cases from the TTAB, as well as the Federal Circuit,4 cases like Octocom, cases like Mayer Berkshire, in which5 the ­­ in which the TTAB is told it's actually error to6 introduce evidence of actual use. Now, why is it error?7 Because if you have a general mark, like the mark8 Sealtite, it's not being limited in any way to9 particular channels of trade or particular ways in which10 it's sold. If it is ­­11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would the ­­ would the12 same rule apply in a de novo review of the board's13 actions in a Federal district court?14 MR. KATYAL: We do think that it would15 apply. And I don't take my friend on the other side to16 be arguing the reverse. Yes, you could have live17 testimony that ­­ that aspect falls out. But still, the18 overall statutory inquiry is about whether the mark has19 a confusing resemblance.20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I was going to ask you21 in your answer to Justice Scalia in which you've talked22 about the narrowness of the issues, you would make the23 same comments and ­­ and give us the same instruction24 regarding what issues and what evidence is presented in25 the district court on de novo review?381 MR. KATYAL: That is why ­­ that our view is2 that even if evidence is introduced at the district3 court de novo stage, that still doesn't cure the4 fundamental problem. Preclusion shouldn't apply both5 because the question being asked is different as well as6 the procedures by which they're adjudicated. For7 example, no jury trial in the ­­ in the de novo review8 proceeding means that the full panoply of kind of rights9 that inhere when this Court ­­ when Article III courts10 are asked to decide a longstanding common law tradition11 such as the right of infringement.12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the ­­ the13 issues are not always different. Justice Breyer's14 lipstick example, I mean, that's sold in a retail15 market. So the question is not ­­ there isn't going to16 be a different use from what the TTAB is looking at and17 what you want to be able to look at de novo. But I18 gather in your case, you say these building fasteners,19 people don't go buy them like they buy lipstick, it's20 only more sophisticated general contractors.21 So why isn't that enough of an answer to say22 that as a general matter, the TTAB provisions are23 preclusive, but if you are showing a different ­­ a24 difference in use or a more specialized use or something25 other than what the TTAB would have been looking at,￼391 preclusion doesn't apply. Which I gather is ­­ is the2 way preclusion normally works.3 MR. KATYAL: I'd say two things. Number one4 is I don't think that argument is available to the5 Petitioner since they hadn't advanced that particular6 argument. And if they did, I think it would run7 headlong into the district court's conclusion at page8 28A that the evidence here was so different, even giving9 all sorts of deference ­­10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm more11 concerned if the argument is available to you. I mean,12 in other words, you're the one that is asking for the13 absence of preclusion. And it seems to me that you14 could prevail on the idea that when the ­­ when the uses15 are actually different it's not precluded, but when16 they ­­ they are not ­­ when they are the same, it is.17 That's the basic preclusion rule.18 MR. KATYAL: Well, I think that ultimately,19 though, the basic preclusion rule is caveated in two20 different ways. One is the inquiry actually has to be21 the same, it has to be an identical inquiry; and the22 second is that the procedures and the incentives at23 stake, as Justice Ginsburg was saying, have to be the24 same as well.25 We think the answer to that ­­ to both of￼40￼1 those is no. That is, even when the registration2 analysis is looking at evidence of actual use, it is3 looking to it for a different purpose. It's ultimately4 asking is the resemblance confusing, not is the actual5 use confusing.6 Now, imagine you could have some theoretical7 world, some hypothetical in which the TTAB is deciding8 the exact same actual use question as in the9 infringement action. The INTA brief at page 20, filed10 by the trademark practitioners on behalf of neither11 party, says that theoretical world never happens in12 reality.13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, would you give me an14 example of ­­ of a situation in which the use is15 confusing but the resemblance is not?16 MR. KATYAL: Sure. So the ­­ the confusing17 use is ­­ so suppose that the Trademark Office allows18 the regs straying of the word "Sike," S­I­K­E, to put on19 shoes. It's a general standard logo. It doesn't have20 any particular ­­ you know, it doesn't have any21 particular marks or anything like that, no stylization.22 JUSTICE SCALIA: To be put on shoes?23 MR.

KATYAL:15 JUSTICE SCALIA:16 Doesn't the court that is deciding whether this is an17 infringing use, doesn't that court have to decide18 whether that use is confusing by reason of the19 resemblance?20 MR. KATYAL: Not simply ­­ that's our whole21 point. And what I was saying to you earlier, it's not22 simply the resemblance that causes infringement. It is23 the use as well.

Is the9 trademark record before us in the joint appendix?10 MR. KATYAL: I'm not sure if the trademark11 record is. The trademark opinion ultimately is.￼17 But let me suggest to you that if you18 looked, for example, at customer sophistication, the19 district court says the evidence on this is overwhelming20 that this is a sophisticated group of consumers as to21 which ­­ after ­­ based on lots of live testimony, lots22 of different witnesses, whereas the Trademark Board said23 the reverse. They said, ah, it's hard to tell which way24 this cuts; there is very limited evidence one way or the25 other.1 Same thing with the words "Sealtite Building2 Fastener," which the district court at page 35a said3 there was evidence at trial that Sealtite, Hargis,4 always used the entire phrase as one thing, "Sealtite5 Building Fasteners." Why is that important? Because if6 you are using "Building Fasteners" in connection with7 "Sealtite," you are not going to confuse people who are8 buying screws for the aerospace industry or something9 like that. It's limited to building fasteners.10 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Katyal, if we want to11 check up on what you are saying about these limitations,12 where would we look? Where does the board say we don't13 look at use in the way that you're saying they don't14 look at use?15 MR. KATYAL: Let me read to you from the16 Octocom decision. This is ­­ this is from ­­ this is at17 page 47 of our brief: "It was not error for the board18 to give no weight to evidence that Octocom modems are19 bought by a particular class of purchases.

KATYAL:1 That's the way this is done in practice.2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Katyal, Justice3 Scalia suggested that these are not expeditious4 proceedings before the whatever it is, TTAB. And5 what ­­ what is the situation there? I know it's a lot6 less expensive to go to the board than it is to go to a7 court, but how rapidly are these processed?8 MR. KATYAL: I think the amici are before9 you, all of the amici saying that it is a much quicker10 process that tracks Congress's intent, which was a11 low­cost system that was going to provide notice. And12 if you adopt my friend's argument on the other side, as13 all the amici are saying to you, you do incentivize the14 Hargises of the world to come forth and in the15 registration ­­ they may not seek registration16 because the cost of doing so, as was suggested17 first part of the argument, is now going to be18 you are stuck for all time ­­ this is, Justice19 your earlier Louis Vuitton example ­­ you are stuck for20 all time with ­­ because you happened to litigate21 registration in the TTAB, now be ­­ now it is preclusive22 in an infringement action down the road.23 JUSTICE ALITO: I thought you said that the24 preclusion analysis would be the same if there were de25 novo review in the district court. So if that's theat allin theso high,Breyer,49￼501 case, then, how can you rely on the nature of the TTAB2 proceeding alone?3 MR. KATYAL: Well, if the nature ­­4 because even in the district court, the process isn't5 the same as an infringement in two different respects.6 One is, of course, there is no right to a jury trial and7 we do think that there are some constitutional doubts8 that are engendered by my friend's reading on the other9 side. And second, the question that is being asked in10 de novo review is ultimately a different one. It's11 about whether or not the use is confusing, not whether12 the resemblance is.13 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I see all those14 points, but do you claim that the district court15 proceeding is ­­ is expeditious and for that reason16 there would be no preclusion?17 MR. KATYAL: No. We're not saying that18 the ­­ at least the district court process does have the19 robust Article III and jury protections available to it.20 If the jury decides, first, a finding of infringement,21 we do think, as our brief points out, that a separate22 statute, 1051, would make that pre ­­ not preclusive,23 but would simply bar ­­ bar the registration of that24 mark.25￼And I think that's an important point511 because Congress here did something, and this is what2 our red brief at page 30 says, with respect to3 registration decisions, they actually thought through4 how is registration going to matter at the infringement5 stage? And they said, look, it's going to give you6 certain things. It's going to give you presumptions of7 validity, presumptions of ownership and the like, but8 nowhere did they do what, for example, they've done in9 the patent statute in 35 U.S.C. 315 and 325 and10 affirmatively buy into the preclusion doctrine and11 say ­­12 JUSTICE BREYER: Quick question. If you are13 right about the difference between resembling causing14 confusion and using in connection causing confusion,15 then if you go to the review procedure and you go into16 the full district court, that doesn't preclude either.17 MR. KATYAL: Exactly.18 JUSTICE BREYER: So there's no preclusion19 whether you go to the district court or not in your20 basic statutory view there.21 MR. KATYAL: That is correct.22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it seems to me that,23 and I'll check what the experts in this area say in the24 amicus briefs, but it seems to me that the fact that25 this is a simpler proceeding and that a person concerned￼521 about cost would want the simpler proceeding and would2 want the preclusion.3 MR. KATYAL: Well, Your Honor, sometimes4 they may want that once they've already made the5 decision to register, so our point is twofold. First,6 people like Hargis may not seek registration in the7 first place. And second, as the amici are saying, if8 they do seek registration, then they have to do, Justice9 Kennedy, exactly what you're saying, which is litigate10 to the hilt and turn that district court de novo review11 proceeding into an infringement trial. And that's12 antithetical to what Congress wanted. Congress wanted a13 low­cost system to incentivize people to come in because14 it generates positive externalities.15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure that I buy16 that, because to the extent that someone's not going to17 settle and go away or get a sublicense, why should we be18 now inviting, instead of a district court proceeding,19 inviting an infringement action? I mean, that will ­­20 that's going to be more lengthy no matter what because21 then damages and a lot of other things are involved.22 MR. KATYAL: Because, Justice Sotomayor, the23 registration decision at the end only decides a very24 limited thing. It doesn't decide the right to use the25 good. That's something only infringement does. That's￼531 why ­­ that's kind of ­­ it's kind of the main banana is2 infringement. Congress has known that. That's the way3 it's been for hundreds of years. There isn't going to4 be any sidestepping of an infringement inquiry in an5 appropriate case. It's going to happen.6 The question then is: Do you want a7 litigant like Hargis to be stuck with a limited record8 with limited evidence on a limited question,9 particularly when, as I was saying to Justice Scalia,10 the registration question that's being determined either11 in the district court or in the TTAB is generally a12 broader one. It's about the paper mark. And there's13 easier to find likelihood of confusion based on that14 paper mark than you can in actuality.15 And so someone like Hargis in which you've16 had a jury trial finding, look, no infringement, indeed17 they had to ­­ the evidence was so weak on likely to18 confusion that they had to manufacture some of it, those19 types of rulings will never be able to happen because of20 an administrative process, a stripped down process that21 didn't ask the right question at the end of the day,22 which is, is the use of the product, looking at the23 stylization, looking at the way it's done in practice,24 looking at the customer sophistication and the like, is25 that use actually causing confusion?￼54￼1 This case is a perfect illustration of why2 you wouldn't want to have a preclusion rule in practice3 because there's no infringement at bottom line here when4 the product's actual use is being decided. The only way5 you can find a likelihood of confusion is by looking to6 something more abstract, the resemblance and the7 similarity of the goods alone, only the goods, not the8 way in which the goods are actually being manufactured9 and being sold.10 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Katyal, I'm just11 looking here at the TTAB's analysis and it seems to me12 it's loaded with stuff about use. It says, "B&B's13 sophisticated fasteners are primarily used in sealing14 applications while Hargis's products are the next step15 up from a nail and are not made for sealing."16 MR. KATYAL: Justice Kagan, there's no doubt17 that they recite that as part of the facts, but at page18 70, they say the determinative factor here is the19 similarity of the goods and not the similarity of the20 goods in the actual marketplace because as the district21 court found, these goods actually don't compete in the22 marketplace whatsoever.23 Sure, some evidence is going to come in at24 the front end. Our point, Justice Kagan, is at the back25 end, the process that is the question the TTAB is      JUSTICE KAGAN:products of the partiestrade."  It says, "It'sidentical marks on closely­related products."    Again, it says, "Themove in different channels ofthe use of substantiallyMR. KATYAL: Well, Justice Kagan, our point is not ­­ our brief acknowledges that, that oftentimes the TTAB, some evidence of actual use comes in, but it comes in to answer a different question.      It's kind of like Montana v. Egelhoff, thedual intoxication case.  Some evidence about alcohol cancome in for ­­ to determine whether or not someone hadthe first degree murder intent.  Other evidence onintoxication might come in in a different trial todetermine whether or not someone had the physicalability to pull the trigger.  The evidence comes in inboth cases, but it's asking a different question at theend of the day.  The resemblance inquiry is abstractand ­­ and the infringement one is actuality.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Jay, you have three minutes.REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M.

And that7 is why we think that the Federal Circuit has been for8 years affirming the idea that once you've already won in9 one tribunal in an infringement action, the trademark10 board shouldn't reach a different decision. The11 trademark board should not be registering marks that12 infringe, it should not be withholding registration for13 marks that don't.14 Let me point ­­ let me be absolutely clear15 about what the trademark board can consider.

Even though ­­25 JUSTICE BREYER: This ­­ remember the case14 MR. JAY:15 contrast with ­­16 JUSTICE BREYER:17 MR. JAY:18 could put in, what it needed to put in, this just goes19 to the essential difference. And this is what Justice20 Kagan brought out in her colloquy with my friend. That21 there is a restriction in these registrations. One is22 restricted to aerospace fasteners. One is restricted to23 building fasteners. And the differences between those24 marks, that's what the board took evidence on and25 considered.

Okay?7 Seems different. Can I introduce evidence that the8 people who use these particular kinds of dry cleaners9 are colorblind? And so they won't recognize the10 difference. It has nothing to do with the use. It has11 only to do with the customers or the conditions in which12 they are used. Can I introduce that at the board or13 not?58￼1 the fastener market was. It took evidence on it and2 that's why at 61A and 64A of the Petition Appendix it3 explains it understands that the fastener market is not4 monolithic. It explains that there is not direct5 competition, but it understands that there is likely6 confusion because if you are looking for a fastener and7 you think that, oh, I'll buy a Sealtite fastener, it8 must be made by the aerospace people, that's what ­­9 that's what they were getting at, and that's evidence10 that the board could come in.11 My friend said repeatedly that the evidence12 was different between the proceedings. Respectfully,13 that doesn't matter. Page 52 of our blue brief, Section14 27 of the Restatement of Judgments: New evidence is not15 what matters. The question is were they asking the same16 question. And the Trademark Board could and did take17 evidence about the question whether aerospace fasteners18 are so different from construction fasteners that,19 despite the phonetic identity of the marks, we should20 let Hargis use its mark on these different goods. And21 the board said: We've looked at the differences, but we22 find that they are intrinsically related because they're23 both fasteners even if different.24 Maybe that was right and maybe that was25 wrong. We, of course, think it was right. But if59￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Hargis thought it was wrong its remedy was to appeal,not to relitigate.JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Katyal suggested that ­­ he read from two cases which suggest some kind of different standard.MR. JAY: The difference, Justice Kagan, is if both cases recite modems as to good, the board doesn't look beyond that and say, oh, fancy modems and cheap modems.
