NAGER               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MR. NAGER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court:          In this case, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth101112131415161718192021   letter.  As non-discretionary acts taken in the normal22   prescribed course, the municipality's actions here were23   necessarily rational ones taken without discriminatory24   motives and without treating the respondents here any25   differently than any other beneficiary of an ordinance31111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005Circuit held that a municipality may be held liable indamages because it withheld the issuance of buildingpermits for a proposed housing project pending a citizen-initiated referendum election on the ordinance authorizingthat housing project.￼          In so doing, the Sixth Circuit failed toappreciate that the municipality's actions here were alltaken pursuant to pre-existing procedures set forth in thecity's charter, procedures that the city followed to the 1   would have been treated that was subject to a petition. 2   And for that reason, we respectfully suggest that the 3   Sixth Circuit -- 4             QUESTION:  There's no evidence of some kind of 5   misbehavior on the part of the city other than the bare 6   claim that they refused to issue the permit during the 7   process of the referendum? 8             MR. NAGER:  That's correct, Justice O'Connor. 9   Every official action of the city here favored the10   respondents.  The city planning commission recommended11   approval of the housing project and of the site plan12   authorizing the housing project.  The city council votedin favor of the housing project.          QUESTION:  Wasn't there some evidence that some13141516   period of time, not -- not officially.  It didn't take --17   pass any resolution, but didn't they oppose immediatecity official was -- sought to delay the proceedings for a￼18   action on a couple of occasions?19             MR. NAGER:  Justice Stevens, prior to the city20   council voting on the -- the ordinance to approve the21   project, there was a lot of public debate, and in that22   public debate, there were city officials who said we --23   we need to take time to hear the citizens -- citizens'24   concerns.  We need to take time to understand what we're25   doing, and there were even comments, we should fight this.41111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   We should fight this and delay this. 2             QUESTION:  Supposing one of those comments said 3   we should fight this because we don't want 4   African-Americans to -- to move where they're going to 5   move, would that make any difference? 6             MR. NAGER:  It -- it could make a difference. 7             QUESTION:  Because even -- if that had happened, 8   it would still be true, as you pointed out earlier, that 9   every official action taken by the city was favorable to10   the -- your opponents.11             MR. NAGER:  Well, if -- if the actions were12   taken favorably to the opponents, it couldn't make a13   difference because at that point the alleged statement14   wouldn't have any connection to an adverse action.15   That -- that's the important point in this case because in16   order to have discrimination, either in violation of the17   Equal Protection Clause, or in violation of the Fair18   Housing Act, you not only have to have a motive, you have19   to have adverse differential treatment by the person --20             QUESTION:  So what -- I'm trying to be sure21   I understand.  I -- I think I understand your position.22   Is -- your position is that even if this ambiguous23   evidence was -- clearly showed racial hostility and that's24   why we're trying to delay it, there still would be no25   cause of action because everything the city did was in51111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9favor of -- officially was in favor of --          MR. NAGER:  That -- that's correct.          QUESTION:  So that really, we don't have to tryand draw -- to decide whether or not inferences ofimproper motive can be drawn from those statements.          MR. NAGER:  That's correct because in this case,all of the city's actions either favored the project ornon-discretionary actions.          QUESTION:  Now, what if the city had taken thesame official action that it took in this case, and everyofficial action either favored or was at least neutral,and yet the city officials went out and -- and whipped up,in effect, anti-black sentiment and -- and urged thefiling of the application for the referendum, would theanswer -- would the -- would the result be the same,that -- that there would be no way that the city could beheld liable?10111213141516171819   the answer would be the same.  Of course, if the20   referendum were enacted, it went to a vote and it were put21   into effect and it was racially motivated, that action￼MR. NAGER:  The short answer to that question is22   would be subject to challenge because that would be, in23   fact, an action of the city because they would have24   adopted, under your hypothetical facts, an ordinance that25   could allegedly have a discriminatory intent.61111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1             QUESTION:  But isn't the -- isn't the delay 2   simply a -- even the delay in -- in an instance in which 3   the ordinance is defeated simply a lesser degree of 4   damage, but which would, nonetheless, be -- be subject to5 a claim? 6             MR. NAGER:  And the answer to that is no.  And 7   the answer to that is no because the delay that happened 8   here is the delay that would happen with regard to any 9   referendum that was subject to a referendum petition.  And10   the record here is quite clear --11             QUESTION:  Well, it -- there's -- there's no12   question that it -- it would, but is -- is the -- is13   either the -- the statute in question here or the Equal14   Protection Clause blind to an obvious reason for the15   delay?  In other words, I -- I quite agree.  We start with￼the assumption that mere delay in governmental processesdoes not give rise to a cause of action, but when thedelay is induced by city officials for a raciallydiscriminatory reason, aren't we then in a different case?1617181920212223   outcome?24             MR. NAGER:  Well, because under Monell and its25   progeny, as well as this Court's State action cases, the          MR. NAGER:  Well, it's a different case, butit's not different outcome here, and the --QUESTION:  Why shouldn't it be a different71111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   municipality can be held liable only in damages only if 2   the city -- an official with the authority to authorize it 3   has authorized the discriminatory action that you're 4   talking about.  In this specific instance, the -- every 5   official action favored the project, and the delay that 6   you're talking about was authorized by a city charter 7   created 30 years before the fact. 8             QUESTION:  Well, the mechanism -- the mechanism 9   is provided by the city charter.10             I guess what I'm getting at is that if city11   officials -- let's just say the mayor, for the sake of12   argument, or the mayor and the city council -- in effect,13   do not establish a policy in the sense that they say, we14   want to stop black housing projects, but they follow a15   policy of trying to make it difficult for those housing16   projects to be approved, and one way they do that is by17   spurring the -- the request for referendums.  Assuming18   we're going to apply the Monell rule here, isn't that a19   policy position of the city even within the meaning of20   Monell?21             MR. NAGER:  No, because they wouldn't have the22   authority to do that.  There's a difference between six23   city council members voting at a city council meeting as24   to what the actions of the city are, and six city council25   members going out on their own in their private capacities81111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1234567   confronted with a project like this.  And one of the seven8   members of the city council says that, you know, he's1213141516171819202122232425action of this one individual taint the whole action ofthe city?          MR. NAGER:  Well, it shouldn't.  Under ArlingtonHeights and this Court's cases, the city could be heldliable only if those authorized, in this instance amajority of the city council, had the -- thediscriminatory --          QUESTION:  What if the vote was four to three?          MR. NAGER:  Four -- if it was four to three infavor of the housing project --          QUESTION:  No.  Against the housing project.          MR. NAGER:  If -- if they had discretionarypower, and four of them exercised their discretionarypower against the housing project on the basis of racially91111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005and expressing their views as citizens, and -- and tryingto get other citizens to agree with them as to theirprivate views.QUESTION:  But not --          QUESTION:  Well, supposing, Mr. Nager, that youhave, say, a -- say, a seven-member city council and it's 9   opposed to this because he doesn't want African-Americans10   moving into this area.  The other six members of the city11   council simply treat the thing on the merits.  Does the￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9discriminatory --          QUESTION:  Well, only one had the raciallydiscriminatory motive, one of the four.          MR. NAGER:  Well --          QUESTION:  The other three did it on the merits.          MR. NAGER:  I think there, there would be a goodargument that they would still -- that -- that theplaintiffs would have -- would have satisfied their burdenof showing but for the racially discriminatory motive,10   that the housing project would have been approved.  So11   in -- in that hypothetical, which is not the facts of this12   case, of course, they -- they would have had sufficient13   evidence to state a claim.14             QUESTION:  And your difference in the two cases15   is, one, you have an official action taken.  We deny the16   project.  Here you don't have that.17             But suppose there had been, to take the clearest18   case, a tape of a meeting.  The mayor, the legal director,19   the head of the city council, they all got together and20   say, we want to kill this project and we know that the21   most effective way to do that is through this referendum22   because the people won't like it and they'll vote against23   it.  So they have a deliberate plan to string the thing24   out and then, as the last act, instigate a referendum.25             And as I take it, your argument -- you would --101111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   you're saying even if you have that scenario, there would 2   still be no municipal liability.  Am I correct? 3             MR. NAGER:  That's correct, Justice Ginsburg. 4   It's obviously our hardest hypothetical, but it's also the 5   same answer.  And it -- and one of the reasons it's the 6   same answer is because, remember, under your hypothetical, 7   the notion is that if these city officials, not acting in 8   their -- exercising their official powers, but acting in 9   the role any citizen can, can go out and organize the10   citizens of the community acting in their private11   capacities to get a referendum on the ballot and vote12   against it.  Of course, that's what democracy is about.13141516171819202122232425It's about politicians taking on causes on behalf ofpeople --          QUESTION:  Mr. Nager, I think -- I understandyour argument as it applies to the city, but am I correctthat the mayor is an individual defendant in this case?          MR. NAGER:  He was.  He was granted summaryjudgment by the district court on the ground that therewas no evidence that he in his individual capacity hadcommitted any of the acts that were alleged against him,and that he had not organized the campaign --          QUESTION:  But -- but wasn't that reversed bythe Sixth Circuit?          MR. NAGER:  No, it wasn't.  That issue was not111111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1234   capacity.  He was sued in both his individual capacity and5   in his official capacity.taken up to the Sixth Circuit.          QUESTION:  Why is he a petitioner then?MR. NAGER:  He's only here in his official 6             QUESTION:  I see.  So there's no individual 7   liability at stake here at all. 8             MR. NAGER:  No, not -- not -- 9             QUESTION:  Is -- is the --10             QUESTION:  I'd like to ask a question, which is11   these have been very interesting hypotheticals, but are12   you going to have time to talk about the questions that we13   granted cert on?14             MR. NAGER:  Well --15             QUESTION:  And I'm interested -- what we have in16   front of us now at this point as issues.17             MR. NAGER:  The issue that you have before us is18   the Sixth Circuit's judgment is -- is -- because under the19   Sixth Circuit's view there was allegedly evidence of20   racial bias among the citizens that the municipality could21   be -- somehow be held liable for that.  And that's wrong22   for two reasons.23             One, it's wrong because the municipality itself24   has to have the discriminatory animus, and there's no --25   not only no evidence of that here, it couldn't have been121111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1   the case since they -- of course, all of their actions2   were voting in favor of it, or treating the action3 neutrally.4 5 6 7 8 9Secondly --          QUESTION:  Arguably the discriminatory animus onthe part of the citizens could invalidate the referendum.          MR. NAGER:  If it was voted on and put intoeffect, the alleged animus --               QUESTION:  No.  Even -- even if it wasn't put10   into effect.  It -- if there were that animus, it -- it11   could -- by our past cases anyway, if it could be shown,12   it would -- it would invalidate the referendum.  But your13   point is that whether the referendum was valid or invalid,14   the municipality would have had to stay the project.  It15   wasn't up to the municipality to make the judgment.16             MR. NAGER:  That -- that is correct, Justice17   Scalia.  I -- I do want to make clear that under this18   Court's cases, the Court has never said that -- that the19   First Amendment activity of a petition itself is subject20   to an equal protection challenge.21             What the Court's cases say is if there is a22   vote, either on a bill by elected representatives, or on a23   petition by citizens, that the end product of that, which24   becomes a law, can be challenged, and that private animus25   in that -- is contextual evidence for whether or not the131111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9people who voted on that final product were themselvesmotivated by discriminatory animus.          QUESTION:  You're -- you're talking about peoplewho vote in a referendum?          MR. NAGER:  Well, the -- the question is ifthere's a final product, was the -- the final law, wasthat racially motivated --          QUESTION:  But we -- we've never said -- we'venever tried to examine the motives of -- of the citizenrywho vote in a referendum on that sort of question, have1011 we?12             MR. NAGER:  No, you haven't, Mr. Chief Justice.13   What the Court has said is, is that intent of the law is14   the key test, and what the Court has said in Arlington15   Heights is because you can't look directly at the motives16   of the people who voted on it, whether they be legislators17   protected by the Speech and Debate Clause or citizens18   protected by the -- the secrecy of the ballot in this19   country, they look at other indicia to determine their20   intent.2122232425141111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼          QUESTION:  But Arlington Heights was a citycouncil, or --MR. NAGER:  That's correct.QUESTION:  -- was it not?MR. NAGER:  That's correct.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9              QUESTION:  Did -- did the city have discretion    here to go ahead and issue building permits while the    referendum process was pending?              MR. NAGER:  No, it didn't.  Once the referendum    petition was filed, under the city charter, the -- at that    point, all the city council could do is repeal its own    ordinance or submit the ordinance to a vote of the voters.          QUESTION:  What -- what is --          QUESTION:  And here the referendum failed.          MR. NAGER:  That -- well, the -- we don't knowthe outcome because the respondents asked for the finalvote not to be certified.          But what is important here, I think, to addressthe issue in this case, Justice O'Connor, is that the --the position of the Sixth Circuit here is that themunicipality is somehow supposed to inquire behind afacially neutral referendum petition and determine theintent and motives of people engaged in the First101112   Amendment.131415161718192021   that we are reviewing?  I mean, I want it to be specific.￼22 23 24 25The Sixth Circuit, insofar as its -- insofar as we'reconcerned, we're interested in what the lower courts held.          MR. NAGER:  Correct.          QUESTION:  What, in your opinion, is the claim151111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005QUESTION:  So what is the claim in your opinion1   that they're reviewing?  Is the claim that these three2   individuals, the mayor, the clerk, and an engineer, acting3   in their official capacities, violated the Fourteenth4   Amendment or other parts of the Constitution when they5   refused to issue the permit despite the petition and6   despite the provision?  Is that the claim?  Or is the7   claim they did something else as well?  They stirred up8 910111213141516the petition people, or they did some other thing.          MR. NAGER:  Well, the -- the Sixth Circuit saidit was the former.          QUESTION:  Only the first.          MR. NAGER:  Correct.  Respondents in their briefhave abandoned what the Sixth Circuit held and which wepetitioned and the Court granted cert to review to argue acompletely different theory.￼               QUESTION:  May I ask you, Mr. Nager, is the17   complaint in the record?  I couldn't find it.  In the --     in the papers here?               MR. NAGER:  I don't believe that it is.  No, I18192021   record of the case.  It wasn't reprinted in the -- in the22 23 24 25joint appendix.          Unless the Court has further questions, I'llreserve the remainder of --          QUESTION:  Well, I -- I do.  Weren't -- weren't161111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005don't believe -- I mean, it's -- it's obviously in the 1   there some other questions here, like didn't we grant cert 2   on three questions -- 3             MR. NAGER:  Well, you did -- 4             QUESTION:  Have they given up on the second one? 5             MR. NAGER:  Well, they've abandoned their claim 6   that they litigated and prevailed on in the Sixth Circuit, 7   that they could proceed on the disparate impact theory.8 910   claim.11             QUESTION:  Substantive due process?12   Yes.1314   there was a triable question of fact as to whether or not15   the city had acted rationally in proceeding forward with16   its referendum petition.  And we would say that the simple17   answer to that was at that time, the city charter required18   the city officials to do so and that judgment was adopted19   by three courts until the Ohio Supreme Court several years20   later reversed itself on what the meaning of the Ohio21   constitution was.  But the subsequent reversal of this22   highest court's evaluation of what the law was can't23   change the rationality of the acts at the time that they24   were taken.25             QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Nager.171111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005QUESTION:  And the last is a due process?MR. NAGER:  A -- a substantive due processMR. NAGER:  And the Sixth Circuit held that￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          Mr. Salmons, we'll hear from you.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS              ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,        AS AMICUS CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS          MR. SALMONS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          Respondents challenge only the delay caused bythe city charter's neutral, longstanding provisionsfacilitating the orderly processing of citizen-initiatedreferenda to review ordinances passed by the city council.Such a challenge requires courts to balance the vitalFirst Amendment right implicated in the referendum processwith the equally valid goals of equal protection and fair1011121314   housing.15          In this case, that balance is clear.  The city'sactions in giving effect to the properly filed referendumpetition cannot give rise to liability under the Fair￼161718   Housing Act or the Equal Protection Clause.  It is19   undisputed that the referendum petition was facially20   neutral and that numerous reasonable, non-racial grounds21   supported it.22             It is also undisputed that the city's process23   for handling such petitions was longstanding and24   race-neutral.  Under any conceivable standard, respondents25   have failed to provide any evidence that the referendum181111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1 2 3 4   understand your brief from this point of view.  You were 5   talking about an antitrust analogy.  I mean, imagine a 6   plaintiff in an antitrust case deliberately, to ruin his 7   competitor -- and no one doubts it -- files a case in the 8   court.  Now, no matter how evil that person was, I can't 9   imagine or I haven't heard to date under the antitrust law10   or any other law somebody who would sue the clerk of the11   court because he docketed the -- he docketed the -- the12   claim -- he docketed the complaint.  And according to what13   you've said, that's what's at issue here, that they're --14   they're simply carry -- now, I -- I need some explanation.15   I'm bringing it up because I'm quite honestly confused16   about that part --17             MR. SALMONS:  Yes -- yes, Your Honor.  Yes, Your18   Honor.  To be sure, the analogy to the Noerr-Penningtonprocess was tainted with discriminatory motive either onthe part of the city officials or the petition organizers.QUESTION:  Suppose it was.  I mean, I don't￼line of cases is not perfect in this case, but it -- it --          QUESTION:  I -- I bring it up because I'm19202122   working.  I -- I mean, I suppose if a city has a totally23   evil, horrible petition for a -- for a -- for aconfused as to how in your mind you see this thing24   referendum, a person still could make it and the person25   who's in charge of carrying out the -- the non -- the191111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   ministerial duties himself would not be sued even if that 2   person himself was evil.  So -- so what is the -- what -- 3   what -- how does this all work in your mind? 4             MR. SALMONS:  Yes, Your Honor.  The -- the 5   approach that we recommend in our brief, Your Honor, is 6   that the Court undertake the question as to whether the 7   petitioning at issue was genuine or whether it was a sham. 8   That's the same type of analysis the Court has 9   undertaken --10             QUESTION:  Assume it's a sham.  It -- they're11   evil.  They're horrible.               MR. SALMONS:  Yes.121314151617181920   potentially be held liable.  I think this is not a case21   where the Court has to decide whether the city could ever22   be held liable based on the discriminatory motives of the23   referendum petitioners because it's clear in this case24   that the petitioning was genuine and this isn't a sham.25             QUESTION:  But what -- what --          QUESTION:  They're terrible.  I would think evenan evil, horrible, terrible person has the right to go tothe legislature and petition and that the clerks who areto file that petition are themselves clerks, and they'reto do it even if they're evil themselves.￼          MR. SALMONS:  That is correct, Your Honor.I think there are two ways in which the city could201111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   the First Amendment activity.  The -- the process that --10   that the city here --11             QUESTION:  I just -- this is such a strange12   argument.  Why wouldn't we wait and see if some action was13   taken by means of a referendum, passed and became law?14   Then wouldn't we be able to say that constitutes State15   action at that point and you would subject it,16   conceivably, to an equal protection analysis if the issue17   is raised, and apply rational basis or whatever it is?18   I don't understand why you ever get to this sham action19   and Noerr-Pennington.20             MR. SALMONS:  Certainly, Your Honor, it -- in21   the event that you have a referendum that's actually22   enacted into law, the Court would examine it in the way23   that -- that you have articulated.24             We thought it was important to point out to the25   Court that this process by which a city ordinance is, if211111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          MR. SALMONS:  But in the situation where you dohave a sham --          QUESTION:  What -- what do you mean by sayingthe petition was genuine as opposed to a sham in these --in this context?          MR. SALMONS:  I -- I think genuine here meansthe same it means in -- in the other contexts in which theCourt has used the sham doctrine, namely that it was about￼1   you will, stayed pending resolution of the referendum vote2   is a traditional and important part of the process for3   referendums, but it is also a process that can give rise4   to abuse if you have a petition that is a sham.  It's not5   about the First Amendment process at all.  It's simply --6             QUESTION:  I don't --7             MR. SALMONS:  -- taking advantage of the delay.8             QUESTION:  I don't know what you mean by abuse9   in a situation like this.  I mean, presumably anybody has10   a right to petition, and you know, the fact that maybe11   they won't get the necessary votes surely doesn't make it12 a sham.1314   Your Honor.  But -- but I think there are -- to -- to getMR. SALMONS:  That -- that is certainly true,back to the original question, what I'm trying to --15161718   up, and they're going to say this is a sham.  Okay?19   I suspect.  Now, that's why I want to understand the20   relevance of this.21             And I -- I come into this thinking if it's the22   Nazis, the -- the most terrible racists that steal, the23   most terrible people in the world, if they're Americans,24   they can come in and they can vote and they can go to25   their legislature and they can put anything they want on221111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼          QUESTION:  The reason I'm worried, in about2 minutes from now I'm going to hear the other side get 1   the ballot.  And the -- the people who are mechanically in 2   charge of seeing that those things are voted on, that's 3   their job, they should do it, and if those are evil and 4   terrible and contrary to the Constitution, the courts will 5   strike them down when they get passed. 6             Now, what's -- now, you explain how your thing 7   fits into that. 8             MR. SALMONS:  Yes, Your Honor.  First of all, 9   let me just say that there's -- there would be -- need to10   be both an objective and a subjective component to the11   sham standard as there is in other contexts.12             But to try and address the question that you13   originally posed, it does seem to us that there are at14   least two ways in which the city can be held liable in the15   event that you have sham petitioning.  One would be that     if the city officials themselves were part of the sham,     and the other would be --￼1617181920   sham.  That's -- that's our basic problem.  I don't21   understand what is a sham.  In the antitrust context --22 23 24 25          QUESTION:  You -- you haven't told us.          QUESTION:  In the antitrust context, Iunderstand it because -- because there is the law, and --and you come up with a phony -- a phony law, you know, you231111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005QUESTION:  Well, wait a -- what is --QUESTION:  We're trying to find out what is a1   can say it's a sham.  But there's no law about2   referendums.  You could have a referendum on anything you3   like.  How can you have a wrong referendum --4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. SALMONS:  Well, Your Honor --          QUESTION:  -- and thus a sham referendum?  Itdoesn't make any sense to me.          MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, this Court's shamanalysis has to do with whether or not it's actually aboutthe First Amendment activity or it's just about an effort,in this case, to take advantage of the delay to interfere1011   with someone's housing rights.  We think that same12   analysis can apply here by inquiring as to whether, first13   of all, the -- the referendum petition is objectively14   baseless.  Is there any way that that petition could15   have -- be enacted into law and enforced?16             If, for example, you had a petition that said no17   minorities shall live in the City of Cuyahoga Falls,18   clearly that's a referendum that could never go into19   effect and never be enforced, and therefore, it may be20   strong evidence that the process here is not about21   changing a law of the city --22             QUESTION:  So the clerk in that case -- the23   clerk of the court who says I'm putting this on the24   ballot -- he's violated the law in putting it on the25   ballot?  Of course, if it's passed, it's totally￼241111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051   unconstitutional.  But you're saying that the clerks2   shouldn't even put that on the ballot?  I mean, that would3 4 5 6 7 8 911   understand it, the Ohio Supreme Court said that this was12   not a legal referendum when it got all through with13   things.  And if everybody had known before the -- the casebe quite a novel proposition to me.          MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, I -- I'm notnecessarily saying that the clerk shouldn't put that onthe ballot, but that would be one part of the analysis indetermining whether or not the process was being abusedand it was just a sham.               QUESTION:  Well, isn't -- wouldn't it be a10   sham -- let me just put this on the table.  As Istarted that it was an illegal referendum, that would havebeen a sham, wouldn't it?14151617   strong evidence that it was a sham.  This was about an18   attempt to abuse the process.  It wasn't about any￼MR. SALMONS:  I -- I think that very well may be19   protected First Amendment activity.  And -- and in that20   situation I think there is, in -- in addition to the21   possibility, although I think perhaps unlikely that you22   can hold the city vicariously liable based on the motives23   of the citizens, I think that is a difficult question as24   to whether the actions of -- of the referendum -- the25 petition signers, the 10 percent who signed the petition 251111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   and file it, whether that action is the official action of 2   the city with regard to the petition just as the action of 3   the voters at the referendum vote is an action of the city 4   for which the city can held liable.  This Court need not 5   address that in this case. 6             QUESTION:  May I ask your view on the 7   hypothetical I asked to the other lawyer?  Supposing it 8   was perfectly clear that the mayor and everybody else in 9   this used the referendum as a method of delaying a10   granting of the permit and that they did so for racially11   motivated reasons, would there be any -- any liability on12 anybody?13             MR. SALMONS:  Potentially, Your Honor.  I think,14   again, the -- the way in which the analysis would work is15   the Court would need to inquire as to whether the16   petitioning was genuine in the sense that there was a17   genuine effort to try and change the city's ordinance.18   And if so, then the First Amendment would provide19 immunity.￼202122232425          QUESTION:  Well, there was, but they -- theyfigured it was going to lose in the long run, butnevertheless, let's assume they wanted to delay things for60, 90 days, whatever it might be, because they wanted todelay it on -- on, you know, this -- this project.          MR. SALMONS:  Yes, Your Honor.261111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200059 10 11          MR. SALMONS:  I -- I think you'd need to examineboth the motives in -- in your hypothetical not only ofthe city officials, but also of -- of the petition          QUESTION:  If it -- if it were clear becausethis case is on summary judgment, so really don't knowwhat the facts are --          MR. SALMONS:  Well, but --          QUESTION:  -- but if there were clear evidencethat the mayor and everybody else act up in a raciallymotivated reason, would there be liability in that12345678   situation?12 signers.13             QUESTION:  Everybody.  Everybody.14             QUESTION:  Are you talking about personal15   liability or official liability?16             QUESTION:  Liability --17             MR. SALMONS:  I'm talking about the liability of18   the city, Your Honor.19             QUESTION:  Okay.  So you're talking about20   liability --21             QUESTION:  I'm assuming everybody who opposed22   the project was racially motivated and that could be23   demonstrated with tape recorder.24             MR. SALMONS:  I guess the short answer, Your25   Honor, is that even people with racial motives have the271111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9right to petition their government to change the law.And -- but if they -- what no one has the right to do isabuse the process in order to interfere with someone'sfair housing and equal protection rights.          QUESTION:  So -- so your answer would be noliability in that case.          MR. SALMONS:  If it was genuine petitioning,that is correct.Thank you, Your Honor.QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Salmons.Mr. Kramer, we'll hear from you.10111213141516   presented, the disparate impact question.  Is that correctORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD G. KRAMER  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS          QUESTION:  Mr. Kramer, opposing counsel saysthat you have, in effect, abandoned the second question￼or is it not correct?          MR. KRAMER:  It's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.17181920212223   complicate what really is a very simple case.  What is the24   injury that the plaintiff is complaining about?  The25 plaintiffs have been denied unlawfully their site plan and 281111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005We -- we have waived that claim that had been certifiedby -- by this Court.Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:The city and the Solicitor General has tried to 1   its benefits, including a building permit.  City conduct. 2   Nothing to do with referendums.  Nothing to do with First 3   Amendment rights. 4             The issues of liability in this case, which the 5   Sixth Circuit took up, was did the city and its officers 6   act out of discriminatory motive by delaying this housing 7   project and refusing to give effect to the site plan 8   ordinance to appease racial and anti-family prejudices in 9   violation of the Equal Protection Clause --10             QUESTION:  How could they do that if they had no11   choice?  I mean, if the law told them you have to stop the12   project once the referendum is filed, even if in -- in13   their heart and -- heart of hearts they were delighted for14   racial reasons that this was the case, nonetheless they15   had no choice.16             MR. KRAMER:  We believe that they did have a17   choice and we cite cases to the Court from the Ohio18   Supreme Court on page 25 of our brief that indicates that19   the petitions did not have to be certified by the -- the20   court -- by the city.21             QUESTION:  But didn't the lower -- the lower22   courts didn't adopt that proposition, did they?23             MR. KRAMER:  The lower courts weren't asked that24   question, Your Honor, because we're really talking about25   whether or not the -- there was an official conduct by the291111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1   city.2             QUESTION:  So didn't they go on the basis that3   the -- that the city officials' action was mandatory?  The4 5 6 7 8 9lower courts.          MR. KRAMER:  As I said, I don't really believethe Sixth Circuit approached the -- the case from -- fromthat particular issue.          QUESTION:  So it didn't --               MR. KRAMER:  There was discretion, we believe,10   and we certainly provided evidence.  And again, as -- as11   was indicated by the Court to the Solicitor General, this12   is on summary judgment.  For example, in the record, thereis an affidavit from the law director for the Village ofOrange that we filed with our brief in opposing summaryjudgment that indicated that there was discretion not tocertify the referendum.131415161718192021222324   indicated that that showed that there was discretion.  But25   the Ohio case law indicates there are instances where, if301111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼          QUESTION:  Well, but that -- that's a questionof Ohio law, I take it?MR. KRAMER:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  And the way you sought to prove itwas to get an affidavit from the law director of somesuburb of Cleveland?MR. KRAMER:  As one element of proof, we1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9the subject was inappropriate -- and let's remember theOhio Supreme Court ruled that this was not an appropriatesubject for a referendum.          QUESTION:  Would it be --          QUESTION:  But it rules that way many years --many years after this case was -- went to litigation, didit not?          MR. KRAMER:  Yes, Your Honor.               QUESTION:  And it had nothing to do with whether10   it was racist, sexist.  It -- it had to do with was ithad --administrative or legislative.          MR. KRAMER:  That's correct, and it also only1112131415161718192021   Suppose you had -- that was the referendum.  Is there any22   authority that says that under Ohio law, that couldn't be23   put on the ballot?24             MR. KRAMER:  I don't know of Ohio law, but25   certainly this Court's decision in Hunter versus Erickson311111 14th Street, N.W.

KRAMER:  Well, the -- yes, Justice Ginsburg.          QUESTION:  Suppose -- suppose you had alegislative proposal that members of a certain race willnever be included in any kind of an equal opportunity law.5 6 7 8 9Hunter, this Court said that a municipality cannot makeracial laws subject to referendum and no other laws, whichis quite a different proposition from what you suggest.dealing with an Ohio referendum indicates that that typeof referendum is unconstitutional.1234   correct statement of the holding in Hunter.  I thought inQUESTION:  Well now, I don't believe that's a          MR. KRAMER:  Well, with -- Mr. Chief Justice, weare talking about the -- this Court's jurisprudence thatdeals with the -- simply because it's a referendum, ifthe legislature could not do this, pass a law that says,for example, that African-Americans cannot own property,like in Buchanan versus Warley --10111213141516171819202122232425   Scalia.  And we have not asked for that.          QUESTION:  If a legislature could do that,would -- would we enjoin a legislature from passing anunconstitutional law?￼MR. KRAMER:  And -- no.(Laughter.)          QUESTION:  The Federal -- the Federal Congresspasses unconstitutional laws all the time.          QUESTION:  We've -- we've never been asked toenjoin them.(Laughter.)MR. KRAMER:  And -- you're correct, Justice321111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051             QUESTION:  So there's a difference between2   whether the product is unconstitutional and whether the3   doing of it is unconstitutional.  And the doing of an4   unconstitutional referendum, as far as I know, is not5   unconstitutional.  You are entitled to pass an6   unconstitutional referendum.  We will ignore it, however.7 8 9          MR. KRAMER:  And it may subject, if there isdirect injury, damages to my client, and that is all wehave before this case.               QUESTION:  What -- but wait.  The -- the project11   is built.  Right?               MR. KRAMER:  That's correct.10121314151617181920   give it to you quicker?  There were petitioners who21   they -- a petition and the law prevents us from giving it22   to you quicker because once a petition's on the ballot,23   the law says we can't give it to you.  Now, what's your24   response to that?25 MR. KRAMER: The response is that it was the 331111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          QUESTION:  So -- so you've got your project.And now what you're saying is that they violated theConstitution in not giving you the permit quicker.  Andthey -- am I right?￼MR. KRAMER:  That's correct.QUESTION:  All right.And they come back and they say, how could we 1   city's actions -- we believe the evidence that we've 2   proffered to -- in the summary judgment shows that they 3   took this action as a public-private partnership.  The 4   mayor, city councilpeople looked for -- as they -- one 5   city councilman said, any legal shred to be able to reject 6   this development. 7             QUESTION:  No.  But explain to me a little bit 8   better what -- their response is the reason we didn't give 9   you the permit faster is because here's the provision of10   the law.  It says once a petition for referendum is filed,11   and it says whether it's legal or illegal, we have to12   delay this.  Now, your response to that is -- they say,13   what should we have done that we didn't do once that14   petition was filed.  And your response is?15             MR. KRAMER:  What should be done in a case like16   this is that there is an injury to my client.  The injury,17   whether it was discretionary or non-discretionary, is --18   is not the -- the question.  What was the purpose behind19   denying the building permit?  And under Arlington Heights,20   this Court has indicated one of the things that a court21   can look at as competent evidence is did the city22   officials take action to appease racial bias.  Even if it￼23 24 25was a nondiscretionary act, if the effect of that was topermit private bias, they've committed a violation.          QUESTION:  That's quite a proposition.  If -- if341111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   I have a -- you know, I'm -- I'm a racist and it really 2   makes me happy that this act, which I'm compelled to do by 3   law, hurts someone of a certain race, that renders that 4   act invalid even though I'm compelled to do it by law? 5   I don't think so. 6             MR. KRAMER:  What we're saying is that it may 7   not be invalid, but it may cause liability.  It can be a8 legal act -- 9             QUESTION:  All right.  So what I'm hearing you10   saying -- what I'm hearing you saying in response to my11   question is, I'm the mayor and the other, and I say, what12   do you want me to do?  The statute said, don't give you13   the permit because the petition has been filed.  What14   could I have done?  And your answer to that basically15   seems to be, nothing.  You couldn't have done anything.16   We agree.  But the petition itself was an evil petition.17             QUESTION:  Right.18             QUESTION:  I mean evil being quotes for what we19   all know is going on.  All right?￼          So it's an evil petition.  And therefore, whenyou face this evil petition, even though you couldn't doanything about it, you have to pay damages because the20212223   reason we were delayed was because of that process.  Now,24   is that basically your argument?25 MR. KRAMER: Yes, Justice Breyer. We're -- 351111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   we're saying that even if it was a legal thing to do, if 2   the act of it was because of racial or anti-family bias, 3   that would be a violation of the -- 4             QUESTION:  And now, the reason that that bothers 5   me, of course, is because I can think of a whole range of 6   evil legislative acts, and I can think of quasi-acts that 7   I'm not sure about, and then I can think of a lot of ones 8   I like.  All right.  So -- so -- but I'm worried.  In the 9   first category and the second category, once we got into10   the business of paying damages, because it turns out that11   they are evil, that would, in fact, chill the legislative12   process, which is a democratic process.  And I think13   that's the argument they're trying to make.  So I'd like14   to get your response to that.15             MR. KRAMER:  What I would say, Justice Breyer,16   is that the fact that there was an evil motive behind any17   of these acts -- and by the way, the referendum is only18   the culmination of the acts.  There was a series of19   discretionary acts.  For example, the strategy of the city20   was to do two things.  One was to delay this project21   because they knew that there was a -- a very finite period22   of time for our little non-profit tax-exempt developer to23   build this project or lose their financing.  So they knew24   the longer they could delay, the more likely the project25 would die.361111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1             And second of all, they wanted to make the 2   project more costly.  So, for example, they required, 3   before we even talked about a referendum, a barrier wall 4   to be built before even a building permit that could be 5   issued, a 6-foot earthen wall with a 5-foot fence between 6   two conforming multi-family projects. 7             QUESTION:  Your client agreed to that.  Your 8   client didn't make any objection to that. 9             MR. KRAMER:  My client was willing to do that10   because he was told by the city it would smooth the11   process over.  He certainly did not waive his rights.          And in the depositions, the planningcommissioner, Louis Sharpe, specifically testified thereason he was demanding that was because our project was12131415   going to have a large number of children.  Now, under the16   Federal Fair Housing Act, as amended in 1988, such an act17   may well violate the protection against -- against￼18 children.19             QUESTION:  You said -- but -- but, nonetheless,20   he didn't contest it.21             Then you say the whole object was delay.  And as22   I see this thing unfold, the big delay is during the23   pendency of the referendum because it was at the end of24   February when the planning commission got this.  They had25   conditions on it, but it acted on the very same day.  The371111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051   ordinance was approved on April 1st.  As things go in the6 7 8 9of the reasons for the --          QUESTION:  But the delay -- as far as -- that --zoning area, from February 21st until April 1st is not avery long time, is it?2345   and there was a great deal of public opposition.  And oneMR. KRAMER:  No, but there was three hearingsthat's not -- the delay that you're complaining about isfrom the moment the petition was filed for the referendumuntil when he finally got the building permits.10111213   not being provided to us.  The delay goes to the amount of14   damages we think our client has suffered.  The official15   act that we're talking about is the building permits          MR. KRAMER:  The actual complaint that we are --where we think we were injured was the building permits￼16   being -- not being issued.  And --               QUESTION:  But you couldn't have expected them     to be issued the -- the day you filed the site plan.     I mean, there has to be a meeting of the planning17181920   commission.  There has to be a meeting of the city21   council.22 23 24 25          MR. KRAMER:  That's correct, and we submittedour building permits after the -- the approval by the --the city council.          What we're talking about, Your Honor, is that381111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   the city's actions in denying that building permit -- 2   we're -- at this stage of the proceeding, all we're 3   talking about is summary judgment.  Is there sufficient 4   evidence that a trier of fact would find that the -- the 5   actual denial was racial prejudice of city officials or 6   appeasement by city officials -- 7             QUESTION:  Mr. Kramer, I asked your opponent, 8   but is the -- is the complaint in the papers before us, 9   do -- do you know?10             MR. KRAMER:  Your Honor, the complaint is not in11   the appendix, but it is in the joint appendix that was12   filed with the Sixth Circuit.  You'll find that in13   volume I on page 37 of the record.  But it's -- it's the               MR. KRAMER:  -- which I believe this Court doesSixth Circuit joint appendix --          QUESTION:  I see.14151617   have.18￼          QUESTION:  The thing I was curious about, totell you the truth, did you include a regulatory takingsclaim in your complaint?19202122232425   referendum was?  For example, do you say the relevance of391111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MR. KRAMER:  No, we did not.QUESTION:  You did not.QUESTION:  Mr. Kramer, would you explain to mewhat exactly you think the relevance of the subsequent1   the subsequent referendum to your claim for delay in2   issuing the permit simply is the evidence that it3   furnishes of -- of racial bias ultimately on the part of4   city officials?  Or is -- is its relevance that it5   increased the damages otherwise attributable to the day --6   delay in the permit?7             How exactly should we regard the referendum?8   You -- you understand the problem that we're all having9   with -- with it.  Precisely how does it figure in your10 claim? 11          MR. KRAMER:  It's the latter, Justice Souter.We're saying that the referendum, which was part of anoverall scheme by city officials to delay this project so121314   that it would kill it.  And so the injury that we're15   talking about from -- from the referendum deals with the16   city officials using that as the legal shred to be able to17   deny the building permits.  And the evidence we believe18   that we have proffered to the Court through the summary19   judgment motion is that there was not only citizen bias,20   which under Arlington Heights, this Court has indicated we21   certainly can allow -- it's competent evidence that can be22   looked at of whether or not legislators used that bias to23   be able to take that action.24             QUESTION:  No.  I -- I understand that.25             If -- if there had been no referendum, no401111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1   petition had ever been filed for the referendum and none2   had ever been held, would you still have essentially the3   same claim, though with a different evidentiary basis?4             MR. KRAMER:  Absolutely, Justice Souter, because5   the -- what we are complaining about is the denial of the6   building permit.  That's the injury that --7 8 9          QUESTION:  But there would have been no denialof the building permit absent the referendum, there --          QUESTION:  You could win without the referendum.          MR. KRAMER:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  The referendum's the worst part of101112   your case.  You -- you wish there weren't a referendum.Then they would have had no basis to deny.          MR. KRAMER:  To deny in -- in this case.          QUESTION:  No, but you -- I -- I thought your131415161718   had a claim for that.  Am I -- am I wrong on that?￼19202122   to --2324 25          QUESTION:  And in -- in the absence of thereferendum, how long would that have been?claim was that -- that you would still have been delayedin being issued the permits and that you would still have          MR. KRAMER:  I would say that we had some claimfor the time between when we submitted the request for thebuilding permits and how long it took them to be able  MR. KRAMER:  That would have been a matter --411111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   well, we don't know.  Let me say -- 2             QUESTION:  Why don't you know?  Because you -- 3   there's a 30-day period.  There's a -- the city council 4   acts on April 1st.  That goes into effect in 30 days 5   unless there's an intervening referendum.  So that you 6   would have had by May 1st the building permits. 7             MR. KRAMER:  We don't know because in the record 8   Mayor Robart sent a letter ordering his building 9   commissioner not to issue a building permits, and that10 was --11             QUESTION:  That was --12             MR. KRAMER:  -- even prior to the referendum --13             QUESTION:  But that was in the 30-day period14   when they couldn't be issued because it hadn't become15   effective yet.  The -- the instruction was simply what the16   law was, that the ordinance approved by the city council17   doesn't become law until 30 days after that approval.  So18   that the -- the mayor, to that extent, was just telling19   them to do what the law would require.20             But in understanding your complaint and how you21   are tying in the officials to the referendum, are you22   saying that absent the official prompting, instigation, or23   whatever you call it, that there would never have been a24   referendum, that in -- in fact that the mayor whipped up25   the referendum?421111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼12345678   appeal it.  I mean, he'd be a very bad man for doing that,9   and you might have a cause of action against him.  But I1516171819202122232425about is, is there evidence that we can use to show thatthe ultimate decision, which was to deny the buildingpermit that caused the injury -- is there evidence thatthe mayor participated in -- to appease racial and anti-family bias.          MR. KRAMER:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  We -- webelieve we indicated that this was not something that thecity responded from -- responded to from their citizens,but this was a scheme where city officials, includingMayor Robart with other private citizens, got together andsaid, how can we deny this project.QUESTION:  But you've lost on that and didn't10   don't see any official city action involved in that.11   Is it official city action for the -- for the mayor to12   stimulate a referendum?  How is that official city action?13             MR. KRAMER:  And we're not talking about that14   that's something that caused a damage.  What we're talking￼The --This is really a simple Arlington Heights case.QUESTION:  If it --MR. KRAMER:  -- the problem --QUESTION:  I just want to finish -- But I justwanted, before you finish, if you'd respond to something431111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051   Justice Stevens said, which is about regulatory takings.2   I mean, what is in the back of my mind here, to stimulate3   an answer, is suppose you weren't Section 8 housing.4   Suppose you were building a hotel.  And suppose the5 6 7 8 9referendum wasn't people who might be bigoted -- may,perhaps -- I don't -- but suppose they wereenvironmentalists, and -- and suppose the constitutionalclaim was not --          QUESTION:  What?          QUESTION:  People that didn't want rich peopleto move in the neighborhood.1011121314151617   constitutional claim were a takings claim.  Now, if I18   uphold for you here, if the Court votes for you here,19   wouldn't it then have to say that all these environmental20   cases and so forth -- I -- I don't want to win your case21   for you, but I might be in my question.22             (Laughter.)23             QUESTION:  The -- the -- you see -- see there'd24   be quite a problem about whether a city wouldn't have to25   pay damages every time that they make a mistake in their441111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          QUESTION:  People that didn't want rich peopleto move into the neighborhood.(Laughter.)QUESTION:  Okay, good.The -- the -- you see.  And suppose the￼ 1   environmental regulation and perhaps try to stop a hotel 2   and they thought they could stop it, but it turns out 3   later they couldn't.  You see -- do you see the analogy 4   that's worrying me? 5             MR. KRAMER:  I understand the analogy. 6             QUESTION:  So what do you -- what do you -- what 7   do you say about that? 8             MR. KRAMER:  The difference, Justice Breyer, is 9   that the -- we are asking only for the Court to look at10   the issue of has the plaintiffs proffered sufficient11   evidence that racial bias and anti-family bias was12   involved in the decision to deny the building permit.13   The referendum was part of the -- an overall scheme by14   city officials to delay and ultimately kill this project.15   If that is the case, then the referendum, which Ohio16   Supreme Court has ruled was illegal to begin with -- even17   if it was legal, we believe under your jurisprudence if18   the motivation of the city to use the referendum was19   unlawful, the violation occurs under the Fourteenth20   Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause.21             With regards to your question about the22   regulatory taking, we saw this -- this case under a due23   process -- substantive due process, procedural due24   process -- examination very similar, I think, to the25   situation that's actually the exact opposite to the City451111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1   of Eastlake versus Forest City case, which Justice Stevens2   is the only participating member that was on that3   particular case.4             QUESTION:  Also there were eight other members5   of the Court that disagreed with me if I remember6   correctly --789 Honor.(Laughter.)MR. KRAMER:  But we have a new Court, Your10             (Laughter.)11             MR. KRAMER:  And -- and we believe --12             QUESTION:  Now, you're -- you're now addressing13   the third of the questions presented.  It's the first               QUESTION:  You haven't abandoned that and --               MR. KRAMER:  Absolutely not.               QUESTION:  -- you're still making the duewe've heard about the due process claim.          MR. KRAMER:  That's correct.141516171819   process claim.  Now, you know, this is substantive due20   process we're talking here.  Right?￼21 22 23 24 25          MR. KRAMER:  Well, substantive, or --          QUESTION:  You think it's a fundamental right tohave a building permit granted within a -- within areasonable period?          MR. KRAMER:  We're not talking --461111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  It's fundamental --          MR. KRAMER:  -- about a reasonable period.We're talking about both -- we had raised both proceduraland substantive due process claims in the lower courts.What we're saying is the process was so fundamentallyflawed that it rises to a -- a due process violation.Whether it's substantive or procedural, we don't believeis -- is really the issue here.          We're talking about a process where there was awhole set of procedures set up by the City of Cuyahoga1011   Falls of how to approve this site plan ordinance.  The --12   the site plan procedures were set forth, permitted for a13   record to be developed, and there was a -- planning14   commission meetings.  There was the city council meetings.15   And if the city council or the planning commission had16   denied our right to the site plan ordinance and its17   benefits, we would have had a right under Ohio law to go18   under the Ohio Administrative Procedure Act and get a19   court to review that issue.20             QUESTION:  Because there would have been21   official action.  And that's the problem here, that22   there -- do you -- do you call a referendum that's put on23   the ballot because 10 percent of the electorate had signed24   petitions -- do you call that State action, which is25   subject to the equal protection surveillance?  I had￼471111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9thought that that's a -- that's an initiative of thepeople and it's not action of the city.          MR. KRAMER:  Well, the only reason why thepeople are able to get a referendum is because the citycharter, which is their constitution, permitted that.          QUESTION:  But that permitted it 30 years ago,did it not?          MR. KRAMER:  That's right, but in the -- the dueprocess area, Your Honor, we're not talking about10   discriminatory intent.  All we're talking about is looking11   at whether the procedure set forth is fundamentally flawed12   and does it -- is it arbitrary and capricious and not13   substantially related to the general welfare as -- as this14   Court has talked about ever since --15             QUESTION:  But there are all kinds of nutty16   referendum measures that voters put forward.  I -- your17   theory would seem to subject a State or a city or whatever18   it is to a lawsuit every time there's one of these nutty19   proposals put forward.20             MR. KRAMER:  No.  We're talking about whether21   you have to have a -- a protected property interest and22   you also have to have a situation where there is a23   arbitrary and capricious action.24             In this case, we have ownership of property,25   which under the original intention of -- of the Framers of481111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1   the Constitution, ownership of private property and the2   ability to develop using this property for a lawful3   purpose is protected by the Due Process Clause.  And when4567   was just sort of an arbitrary.  There was an absence of a8   legitimate reason for the delays and the shenanigans and9   so forth.  But it seemed to me the same argument could --you look at the issue --          QUESTION:  But your theory, as I understand it,is that there was -- if it was racially motivated, there10   could be made if they were trying to protect the wetlands,11   and they used the same kind of shenanigans.12             MR. KRAMER:  Well, Your Honor, we certainly13   raised the question about if this was a discriminatory14   motive, that would mean that there would not be -- under15   general welfare.16             QUESTION:  There would be no racial basis.17             MR. KRAMER:  But more importantly, our argument18   is that there is a per se violation whenever you have an19   administrative matter which should be taken up through the20   city council or through the courts or through a -- from --21   from an administrative agency like the planning22   commission.23             And the evidence in the record, as the lower24   courts point out, is that we met all the requirements for25   the city to -- to get our site plan.  And then, when the491111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   city council approved it, when the planning director said 2   we met or exceeded the site plan ordinance, they put it to 3   a referendum and they asked 20,000 voters to approve or 4   disapprove a site plan ordinance, they never saw and 5   the -- and whether or not that site plan ordinance 6   conformed to the building and zoning code that they never 7   read.  If that is not -- 8             QUESTION:  No.  But what your -- what your 9   argument boils down to is to say that there is a10   recoverable substantive due process violation whenever a11   property right of yours is interfered with by a misuse of12   the legislative process, even a temporary one.  Isn't that13   the -- the nub of your claim?14             MR. KRAMER:  I would say we -- we are asking for15   a fairly narrow interpretation.  We're saying if it's an16   administrative matter which should not be subject to the17   decision of voters because this is not legislative --18             QUESTION:  But what -- from the standpoint of19   your claim, why does it matter whether it -- it was a20   legislative use countering an administrative action, or21   whether it was a legislative use with a racial motive?  It22   is an improper use of a legislative procedure.  And you're23   saying, as I understand it, whenever that, in fact, is24   effected, there -- and -- and you can -- you can make a --25   a colorable claim of -- of some economic damage, that you501111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   have a substantive due process right to recover.  Isn't 2   that correct? 3             MR. KRAMER:  Justice Souter, we -- that is 4   something that we have raised in our brief, but we have -- 5   also have raised a much narrower issue which would be 6   simply looking at a site plan ordinance, should it be 7   subjected to a popularity contest?  There -- it's 8   standard-less.  This Court has ruled in -- 9             QUESTION:  You never mentioned procedural due10   process in your brief.  The first mention I heard of it is11   in your argument here, where you say it doesn't matter12   whether it's substantive or procedural.  Your brief wententirely to substantive due process.          MR. KRAMER:  Well, the reason that we didn't13141516   than to substantive due process.  We believe that it17   really subsumes that issue when you look at -- the18   procedure itself is so fundamentally flawed.  It is veryraise that is the Court didn't certify a question other￼19202122232425similar to the -- the situation in the City of Eastlakethat this Court looked at.          QUESTION:  Would you say -- be saying that ifthe Ohio court had stuck to its original position?I mean, it was four/three both times.          MR. KRAMER:  Well, the Ohio court in both cases,Justice Ginsburg, first ruled that it was an511111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005administrative matter.          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Kramer.          MR. KRAMER:  Thank you, Chief Justice.          QUESTION:  Mr. Nager, you have 3 minutes            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GLEN D. NAGER               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MR. NAGER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.12345   remaining.67 8 9          With respect to the disparate impact claim, Iwould just like to clarify that we were the petitioners,and the Court did grant certiorari on the issue and thereis a judgment of the Sixth Circuit against my clients on10111213   that issue.  And while they've abandoned the claim and14   declined to defend the Sixth Circuit's judgment, we would15   request the Court vacate that judgment and instruct that16   the disparate impact claim be dismissed with prejudice.17             With -- Justice Breyer, with respect to your￼18   questions to my opposing counsel, a point we'd like to add19   to what you had to say is simply that if we had done what20   they wanted, we would have been subjected to a damages21   claim.  It would have been a First Amendment claim by the22   citizens seeking to put something on the ballot by23   initiating a petition, and it -- it can't be that in order24   to avoid a Fourteenth Amendment damages claim, we have to25   violate other people's First Amendment rights.521111 14th Street, N.W.
