Sheehan.      Ms. Van Aken.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINE VAN AKENON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMS. VAN AKEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,  Ms. Van Aken, before you goYes, Justice Scalia.  Your petition for ­­ forwrit of certiorari ­­ and it was a petition that hadyour name on it, said on ­­ on the reasons for grantingthe petition, this Court should resolve whether and howthe Americans with Disabilities Act applies to arrestsof armed and violent suspects who are disabled.  Thecircuits are in conflict on this question.  The questionpresented is recurring and important, and Title II ofthe ADA does not require accommodations for armed andviolent suspects who are disabled, and that's the issue3￼1 on which there is a circuit conflict.2 I now look at the Table of Contents of your3 petition. This argument is not made in the petition at4 all. You ­­ you concede that ­­ that Title II does5 apply even to the arrest of ­­ of armed and dangerous6 suspects. You just say in this case, "Modification to7 Sheehan's arrest would not have eliminated the8 significant risk she posed."9 There ­­ there's a technical word for this.10 It's called bait­and­switch. We might well not have11 granted this petition had you not listed those reasons.12 Are we supposed to appoint somebody else to argue the13 point that you asked ­­ asked us to resolve in the ­­14 in ­­ in your petition for15 MS. VAN AKEN:16 San Francisco asked you to17 whether and how the ADA applies to the arrest an armed18 and ­­ of an armed and violent individual, and the19 answer to that question is it only applies where the20 significant threat that the individual poses has been21 eliminated. And ­­22 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's ­­ that's not what23 your ­­ that's not what your petition said. Title II24 does not require accommodations for armed and violent25 suspects who are disabled, period, is what it says. And4certiorari?With respect, Justice Scalia,resolve the question of1 that is not the argument you are ­­ you ­­ you2 your ­­ in ­­ in your principal brief.3 MS. VAN AKEN: Well, with respect,4 Justice Scalia, page 3 of our reply in support5 certiorari ­­ so still at the certiorari stage6 that the issue here is not a fact­intensivemake inof­­ says￼7 reasonableness question, but instead, it's whether an8 armed and violent individual's accommodation is9 required. And the answer to that is no, where the10 significant risk hasn't been eliminated. And our11 arguments at the certiorari stage certainly didn't turn12 on any claim that the ADA simply ­­13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. I ­­ I14 looked at your papers below, and there, there was an15 argument as to whether the ADA applied at all to16 arrests. And nowhere do you raise the direct threat17 argument; nowhere do you raise ­­ raise below the risk18 argument. It was a pure legal question, the one I19 thought we were going to answer.20 But on appeal, you're now using the words21 "direct threat" and ­­ and "risk." What are we supposed22 to do with this?23 MS. VAN AKEN: Justice Sotomayor ­­24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We’re supposed to25 change the ­­ the nature of the case and perhaps reverse5￼1 the Ninth Circuit on an argument that was never2 presented to it?3 MS. VAN AKEN: I ­­ I disagree, Your Honor.4 In the Ninth Circuit, San Francisco argued that the ­­5 the Ninth Circuit should adopt essentially the Fifth6 Circuit's rule, that where there are exigent7 circumstances, that there is no requirement of8 accommodation. There was no argument that the ADA just9 has nothing to do with arrests. It's that in exigent10 arrests, like the Fifth Circuit said in Hainze, then you11 don't ­­ there's not a reasonable accommodation. No12 accommodation is reasonable.13 So in a sense, the ADA doesn't apply, but14 that's because of the exigency as the Fifth Circuit said15 in Hainze, and that was the conflict that we asked this16 Court to take the case to resolve.17 JUSTICE ALITO: Before we get to the18 question that you have briefed and the question that the19 Solicitor General has briefed, there is another question20 that logically comes first. The statute, 42 U.S.C.21 12132, says, "No qualified individual with a disability22 shall, by reason of such disability, be subjected to23 discrimination by any such entity." That's the relevant24 statutory provision, isn't it?25 MS. VAN AKEN: Yes, Justice. Yes.61 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE ALITO: All right. So all we have there is discrimination. In the ­­ is there any provision of the ADA that defines what is meant by discrimination in that context? Not in the employment context, in that context.MS. VAN AKEN: Right. Congress's findings included a statement that discrimination includes a failure to make modifications in some circumstances. So we understand discrimination to include a failure to modify a government program ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Where does that appear? Is that in the statute?MS. VAN AKEN: It's ­­ it's 12101(a)(5), Your Honor. 42 U.S.C. 12101(a)(5).JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.MS. VAN AKEN: And that's a finding that discrimination includes not making an accommodation.And this Court has recognized that accommodation is part of the discrimination analysis. In ­­ in Olmstead, for instance, the Court said that Congress had a broad view of what discrimination meant.      So let ­­ let me return to my originalpoint, which was that ­­ that the case is about anentry, and police officers here sought to reenter aprivate home of a mentally ill woman who had just ­­7￼￼1 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, before you get to2 that, I ­­ I'm still not entirely satisfied with your3 answer about discrimination. We have to answer that4 question before we get to the arguments that you make5 and that the United States makes based on regulations6 that have been issued pursuant to the statute.7 If discrimination means what it means in8 ordinary parlance, which means treating people9 differently, then there would be no basis for those10 regulations. But nobody's briefed this other issue,11 this threshold issue. Now, maybe you're right. But it12 hadn't been briefed.13 MS. VAN AKEN: Well, I ­­ I think14 discrimination includes the failure to make an15 accommodation where it's reasonable to do so, and I base16 that on the findings, as I mentioned. I base that on17 the regulations, which this Court said in ­­ in Bragdon18 were entitled to deference, at least in the ­­ the19 public accommodations context. Congress has recognized20 the reasonable accommodation duty in 42 U.S.C. 12206,21 which ­­ which was subsequently enacted but mentions22 accommodations.23 And I also think it ­­ it sort of follows24 from this context. The public service here is providing25 an injury­free arrest to the extent possible.81 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Ms. Sheehan alleges that because of her disability, shewasn't able to take advantage of that public service tothe extent other people would have been able to, but ifwe had provided her an accommodation, then she wouldhave been able to.  Now, we ­­ we disagree with thatfactually, of course.JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. What ­­ what is the public service that she could not ­­MS. VAN AKEN: An injury­free arrest. An arrest with a minimum of ­­ of force.JUSTICE SCALIA: This is a public service?MS. VAN AKEN: It's an activity, Justice Scalia. And ­­ and it's an activity in the same sense that imprisoning someone is a public activity, and this Court said in ­­ in Yeskey that ­­ that that indeed was. And so therefore, the ADA applied.      The service at issue here, the activity atissue here is an arrest, but the circuits are unifiedthat Title II applies to arrest.  Where they're dividedis how ­­      JUSTICE SCALIA:instead of a service.      MS. VAN AKEN:call it an activity.(Laughter.)   Let's call it an activity Yes, Justice Scalia.  Let's9￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      JUSTICE GINSBURG:preliminary question.I ­­ I have another      JUSTICE GINSBURG:argument that the entity wouldor practice of discrimination,on the beat does?So you're not making thebe liable for a patternbut not what the officer￼      The ADA does not apply to the individualofficers; right?  It applies to the entity.MS. VAN AKEN: Yes.JUSTICE GINSBURG: So this ­­ the scenario we presented are actions taken on the spot by two officers. Is ­­ what is the entity liability? Is this a vicarious liability?MS. VAN AKEN: It's ­­ it's a respondeat superior type of liability, and ­­ and I believe ­­ it's certainly clear in the Ninth Circuit that the city is liable for the individual actions of its officers. The Monell doctrine only applies in the context of 42 U.S.C. 1983.      So we accept for purposes here that wherethe officers are engaged in purposeful conduct on behalfof the entity that the entity is liable for ­­ fortheir ­­MS. VAN AKEN: No. I'm not making thatargument.

VAN AKEN: Yes, Justice Kagan. JUSTICE KAGAN: What is your view of whenyou are liable for monetary damages?  What is thestandard on that?MS. VAN AKEN: Right. So the ­­ the ADA adopts the Rehabilitations Act remedies, which in turn adopts the Title VI remedies, so the city is liable in damages when it has engaged in intentional conduct. And the Ninth Circuit has expanded that to include deliberate indifference as well. And ­­ and we think that here if the conduct is purposeful, if the officers are intentionally making an arrest rather than refraining from making an arrest in a ­­ in the moment, then that conduct is purposeful for purposes of the remedy discussion.JUSTICE KAGAN: As long as they are intentionally making the arrest, do you think that that meets the standards that ­­MS. VAN AKEN: I think if they are on notice that there's ­­ there might be an occasion to provide an accommodation, and they nonetheless make the arrest,11￼￼1 then that meets the standard, I believe. I think that's2 the case in the Ninth Circuit. It's County of Duvall v.3 Kitsap ­­4 JUSTICE SCALIA: It isn't that the5 institution must be purposeful, that it must be a policy6 of the institution? It's enough if the actor, the7 officer in question, acted purposefully?8 MS. VAN AKEN: Well, that was certainly the9 assumption of the Ninth Circuit here, Justice Scalia.10 That ­­ that the entire liability issue in this case11 turns on whether the officers failed to make a12 reasonable accommodation.13 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't ­­ you don't14 challenge that? You think that ­­15 MS. VAN AKEN: Not in this case. We don't16 challenge that in this case. That's a ­­ that's a rule17 in the Ninth Circuit.18 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you ­­ you want us to19 assume that Title II applies, and then to say that in20 this case, however, because of this particular21 individual's behavior, there was an exemption from that22 normal application of Title II. And then we will decide23 in some future case whether it's true that Title II24 applies at all; right? That's ­­25 MS.

If ­­ I think the Court ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: You didn't say so inyour ­­ in your petition.MS. VAN AKEN: I respectfully disagree,Justice Scalia.  We argued about how Title II applies tothis case, and we argued that it did not apply ­­ it didnot create a duty here because of the degree ofexigency.JUSTICE SCALIA: Title II of the ADA does not require accommodations for armed and violent suspects who are disabled.MS. VAN AKEN: Correct. Now, that is not an argument ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: You're not ­­ you're not arguing that here. You are saying in the circumstances of this case, is all you're saying.MS. VAN AKEN: I am arguing that ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it ­­ is it enough that the individual was armed and dangerous? Is that alone enough?MS. VAN AKEN: Yes. That is enough because the individual was armed and dangerous. If there ­­ if the individual had been disarmed, Title II would create an obligation. If the individual were not dangerous, Title II would create an obligation.13￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, what about this case? Suppose that there is an armed and dangerous person who the officer knows is deaf, and the officer says put your hands up or I’ll shoot.MS. VAN AKEN: Yes.JUSTICE KAGAN: And, of course, the deaf person doesn't put his hands up and the officer shoots. Is that ­­ I guess you are saying that the ADA has nothing to do with that case.MS.

VAN AKEN: Any accommodation ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: And there is a circuit conflict on that point; isn't there?MS. VAN AKEN: I believe there is, Justice Scalia, because the Fifth Circuit in Hainze said that anytime there is exigent circumstances, you just don't look to the ADA. And what the Ninth Circuit has really done here, in our view, has given almost no weight to the exigency of the circumstances.      And I think there's two ways the Court canresolve this case.  One is to hold the direct threatregulation applies to situations like this one becausethe significant risk had not been eliminated here, andtherefore ­­      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:brief?￼                                Where was that in your                           I'm sorry.  Which brief?                                Where was ­­ the briefbelow it, to the circuit court.  Where did you use thewords direct threat and parrot the statute?MS. VAN AKEN: Yes ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because you're ­­ you'renot parroting the statute.  The statute says, indetermining whether an individual possesses a directthreat, a public entity must make an individualized15MS. VAN AKEN:JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:I'm sorry,￼1 assessment based on reasonable judgment that relies on2 current medical damage or on the best available3 objective evidence to ascertain the nature, duration,4 and severity of the risk, the probability that the5 potential injury will occur, and whether reasonable6 modifications will mitigate the risk.7 MS. VAN AKEN: That is from the regulation,8 Justice Sotomayor. We did not ­­9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That is the regulation.10 MS. VAN AKEN: ­­ cite the regulation to11 the ­­ to the Ninth Circuit. What we cited was Hainze,12 and Hainze's analysis that in exigent circumstances you13 don't provide an accommodation. Now, we certainly think14 that at least where the exigent circumstances rise to15 the level that they did here, you don't provide an16 accommodation. And the reason for that is that the17 fundamental government activity here is protecting18 public safety.19 And so in that situation ­­ in a situation20 like this one, time is of the essence, and so to21 delay ­­ to delay an arrest as an accommodation where22 time is of the essence isn't a reasonable accommodation23 as a matter of law. And my argument to this Court is24 that because officers are making risk judgments ­­16      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:question?      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:May I finish the    Yes.There is no exit      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:possible, and the police officers knew that.￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425what ­­ I ­­ I ­­ let's assume certain facts.MS. VAN AKEN: Okay.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right? Contrary towhat you're ­­ I will wait for your reply.MS. VAN AKEN: I'm sorry, Justice Sotomayor.MS. VAN AKEN: I'm sorry?JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The police officers knew that there was no way to escape from that apartment. They knew that the building was empty. Could you still defend their decision to go in given that they could have waited and tried to talk her out?MS. VAN AKEN: So if the building ­­ if they knew the building was empty, unlike here, and if they knew there was no exit, unlike here, we still think there would be a question about whether she had other weapons in the room and could be preparing some kind of ambush or some kind of barricade, and that's something that the officers here testified they were concerned about it, page 198 and one 199 of the Joint Appendix.So what they thought was necessary was to get that door17￼1 open so that they could see what Ms. Sheehan was doing,2 so they could see if she were preparing an ambush or3 barricade.4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:5 what they did however.6 MS. VAN AKEN:7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:8 and they rushed in and pepper sprayed her. They ­­ they9 weren't just opening the door to see if she had a10 other instruments of danger.11 MS.

Doesn't ­­ doesn't this require14 if it doesn't change the nature of their service,15 protecting the public, to wait for their backup and to16 wait for the crisis intervention team?17 MS. VAN AKEN: If they knew there was no18 danger from not opening the door, then, yes, that could19 be a reasonable accommodation. They didn't know that20 here.21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:22 fact?23 MS.

VAN AKEN: It's not a jury fact because no reasonable jury could conclude that there was no significant danger here. I ­­ the ­­ what the officers were doing was preventing a danger that they had a reasonable basis to believe existed. They were doing that by opening a door. With respect, they didn't rush in. It was Ms. Sheehan who rushed out and crossed the threshold. What they did is open the door prepared with pepper spray to use it, and then prepared to use their firearms that they needed to, and that's unfortunately what they needed to do.      I'd like to reserve the remainder of my timefor rebuttal.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.      Mr. Gershengorn.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN   ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,   SUPPORTING VACATUR IN PART AND REVERSAL IN PARTMR. GERSHENGORN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      The ADA provides individuals withdisabilities with important rights in their interactionswith the police, including arrest.  However, under thecircumstances here, the Ninth Circuit applied the wrongstandard when it sent to the jury both the ADA claim and19￼￼1 the Fourth Amendment claim, because it gave insufficient2 weight to the safety risks the officers faced when they3 confronted an individual who was mentally ill and armed4 and violent.5 I would like to have touch base first on the6 two preliminary ­­ two of the preliminary questions that7 the Court has identified. First, it is clear that the8 ADA applies to arrests. The ADA applies broadly to any9 department or agency of the local Government, that10 includes the police, and it applies broadly to11 activities, services, and programs which also includes12 arrests.13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: There is no circuit14 conflict on that point?15 MR. GERSHENGORN: There is no circuit16 conflict since Yeskey that it applies to arrests, Your17 Honor, so that is correct. And we think that that makes18 ­­19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, at the common20 law, it was ­­ it was clear that statutes normally did21 not apply to the police, for instance, even though the22 speeding law does not have an exemption for police23 vehicles, a policeman could speed. It was just assumed24 that normal criminal offenses did not apply to a25 policeman acting within the scope of his duties.20￼1 MR. GERSHENGORN:2 of course, is not a criminal statute, and it was an3 intent by Congress to apply quite broadly, as this Court4 recognized in Yeskey, it applies to State prisons. The5 text of the statute doesn't have any exemption at all6 for police activities ­­7 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I'm not talking about8 prisons. I'm just talking about enforcing the law.9 MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, but I do think10 that, again, the statute has no exceptions, and this11 Court ­­ the lower courts are in agreement, and it's12 consistent with the Justice Department guidance, and13 there is a good reason for that. It's along the lines14 of Justice Kagan's hypothetical, that things like15 providing an interpreter during the arrest of a deaf16 individual, as this Court, in the case that was before17 this Court about a decade ago in Gorman, providing18 transportation for a wheelchair bound individual to the19 police station, for conducting sobriety tests, have a20 walk the line test for someone with physical21 disabilities, those are the core kinds of things that22 the ADA is designed to get at.23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And do you also agree24 with Ms. Van Aken that there is vicarious liability,25 because the ADA operates against entities, not21But, Your Honor, the ADA,￼1 individuals, not officers. So do you also accept that2 there is vicarious liability, rather than the3 enterprise, the entity would be liable if it had a4 pattern or practice.5 MR. GERSHENGORN: We do believe that,6 Justice Ginsburg, that there is the effect ­­ the7 effectively respondeat superior liability much of the8 time will only be for injunctive relief, precisely9 because in the absence of an intentional harm, damages10 would not be available. But, yes, we do believe that11 there is the equivalent of respondeat superior12 liability. Of course, none of that has been briefed in13 this case, but if I could just touch on one more issue14 that hasn't been briefed in this case that the Court15 should not resolve is Justice Alito's question about16 reasonable accommodation.17 This Court said in Tennessee v. Lane, both18 in Justice Stevens' majority opinion, and in Chief19 Rehnquist's dissent that reasonable accommodation was20 required by Title II of the ADA. That makes sense.21 Titles I, II, III, and the Rehab Act all require22 reasonable accommodation. Titles I and III do so23 expressly in 21.112 and Section 21.182. And Title II24 does it by reference. What Title II is it broadly25 defines discrimination. And then in Section 12.201, the22￼1 Congress provided that the regulations and provisions ­­2 the protections in Title II shall be the same or no less3 than the protections in the Rehab Act, including the4 regulations in the Rehab Act. So I think it's clear5 that reasonable accommodation occurs ­­ is required by6 Title ­­7 JUSTICE ALITO: It does seem to me that the8 dynamics are different in the arrest context. Now,9 here, I guess the officers had reason to know that this10 individual had a disability, but what happens if police11 officers have to arrest somebody out on the street that12 seems to be behaving in an unusual fashion. How can13 they determine whether that person has a disability, it14 may be someone who is schizophrenic and isn't taking his15 or her medications, or it might be somebody who does not16 have a mental illness, but has taken some kind of17 controlled substance, how do they make those18 determinations on the spot when they're arresting19 someone.20 MR. GERSHENGORN: So, the ADA applies when21 you know or believe that the person has a disability,22 including mental illness. So in some of the23 hypotheticals that Your Honor just poses, the ADA would24 not apply. But, of course, in this case, they did, as25 Your Honor says, they did know. And in fact, the whole23￼1 purpose of the entry was to address a problem of mental2 illness.3 JUSTICE ALITO: But in the case I posited,4 there would be an issue about whether the officers5 should have known that this person was behaving6 bizarrely, had a mental illness?7 MR. GERSHENGORN: We don't believe that8 should have known is the standard in the ADA. So it's9 not a should have known standard with respect to the10 disability.11 With respect to how the Court should12 approach this, and the question that we understand to13 presented and whether it should adopt the Hainze14 approach. We have proposed for the Court that it apply15 the Barnett standard. The root of that standard is the16 recognition that in the mine run of cases like this,17 with an armed and violent individual, it would be a18 great danger to the officers or to the public, and short19 time. And so consistent with the Justice Department20 guidelines, which say the officers' priority is to21 stabilize the situation, and I think with the instincts22 of the courts of appeals, we think the right way to23 operationalize that instinct and map it onto this24 Court's precedent is through a Barnett standard, which25 is to recognize that it will very rarely be the case2425 MR. GERSHENGORN:So, Your Honor ­­￼1 that an accommodation is needed.2 So when might one be needed under Barnett?3 Well, it goes, I think, to Justice Sotomayor's hypo with4 one tweak. It's our view that the rare occasions when5 an accommodation would be needed involves something like6 when it's contained and visible. So a threat that you7 knew there was no opportunity for escape and you could8 see the individual, perhaps if there was a security9 camera in Ms. Sheehan's room, or another example, if you10 had a mentally ill individual with a knife cornered in11 an alley, so there was possibility of escape and the12 officers could retreat. We think those might be the13 rare situations that a reasonable accommodation would be14 needed. The reason for that is a reasonable15 accommodation is not ­­ a reasonable modification is not16 needed, in our view, when it presents significant safety17 risks to the officer or the public.18 JUSTICE SCALIA: What about saying it is19 never reasonable to accommodate somebody who is armed20 and violent?21 MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, that is ­­22 JUSTICE SCALIA: That seems to me a fairly23 sensible statement. It is never reasonable to24 accommodate somebody who is armed and violent, period.25￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA:2 have held.3 MR. GERSHENGORN:4 believe, is the only court to have held that. We don't5 think that that's the right standard, although we think6 their instinct there is a lot closer than what the Ninth7 Circuit has done. We don't think it's right for two ­­8 one legal reason and one sort of practical reason. The9 legal reason is this Court has avoided generally in the10 context of reasonableness the sort of bright line rules11 that the Fifth Circuit has articulated. So that is the12 first reason. With respect to the practical13 consequences, I think it does get to my response to14 Justice ­­15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, but I don't16 accept that. That's not a bright line rule.17 MR. GERSHENGORN: I think if you say it18 doesn't apply at all ­­19 JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't apply ­­ it20 doesn't apply in one particular circumstance, where the21 person is armed and violent.22 MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, we think that23 a ­­ sort of one notch back from that is actually the24 right approach, that it captures the idea that Your25 Honor is articulating, and that drove the Fifth Circuit,26Which is what some courtsThe Fifth Circuit, I￼1 but does it without the absolute rule, which is, I2 think, how many of the other circuits, other than the3 Ninth Circuit, are applying it. They recognize that4 exigency is very, very important, but there will be5 times when the exigency is sort of in an unstable6 equilibrium, where the officers may have an obligation7 to back off.8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you are asking for a9 remand ­­ you say most of the time officers can go10 ahead. But there may be some times when not.11 What is there in the fact picture here that12 would warrant a remand? Remand to determine what?13 MR. GERSHENGORN: So, Your Honor, we do14 think a remand is appropriate, but we will say we're not15 ­­ we haven't seen anything in the record that would16 create that special circumstances. But in fairness to17 plaintiffs, because it is a different standard than the18 one that they faced below, and they prevailed below, we19 think they should have a chance to go through the20 extensive record and make the arguments to the Ninth21 Circuit.22 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Gershengorn, if I can23 just get your understanding. What are the special24 circumstances that we're reserving here? What is the25 reason for not adopting Justice ­­ the Fifth Circuit27￼1 rule?2 MR. GERSHENGORN:3 be times when the exigency is ­­4 JUSTICE KAGAN: Tell me what those facts5 are.6 MR. GERSHENGORN: When you ­­ a paradigmatic7 case is when it is ­­ it's visible ­­ when the suspect8 is visible and contained. So in other words, you can be9 assured that there is no additional risk from waiting,10 and that you can be assured that there is no danger to11 the public. So for example, had there been a clear door12 into Ms. Sheehan's room so they could see what she was13 doing, if she was sort of huddled in the corner, that14 might be a situation in which a reasonable modification15 was appropriate, even though the situation was not16 overcontained in that sense, had she made a break for17 the window, had she made a move for another weapon, they18 could have done something about it.19 THE COURT: Well, but I suppose suicide is20 always a concern in a case like that, right?21 MR. GERSHENGORN: So, Your Honor, there is a22 risk of danger to self, and the officers are allowed to23 take that into account. We think that in a situation in24 which you can see her, that that would be a situation in25 which there were an agreement for a reasonable28Because I think there will1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425modification, but we recognize that harm to self issomething that the officers can take into ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think the standard you just proposed gives no guidance at all to an officer faced with a violent ­­ with a violent person.MR.

Mr. Feldman.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD FELDMAN       ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTMR. FELDMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      The principal dispute in this case is afactual one, not a legal dispute.  It's a factualdispute.JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. I don't know why we took the case.MR. FELDMAN:And I agree entirely with that29￼1 comment, Justice Scalia. And that's why, in our brief,2 we commented that perhaps this is an appropriate3 instance where the Court would dismiss as improvidently4 granted.5 The Hainze discussion is very different than6 what's being proposed here. Hainze got it wrong. What7 Hainze said was that any time there's a ­­ a8 confrontation that's out in the open, we just won't9 apply the ADA. But one of the powers of the ADA, one of10 the strengths is the regulatory framework is so11 comprehensive. And so we have the direct threat12 exception, the direct threat defense, Section 139 of the13 ADA regs. And it addresses all of the issues that are14 before this Court.15 The first and the primary consideration is,16 was there or wasn't there a substantial risk to the17 public. And critically, it doesn't talk about risks to18 the individual. That's not within the ADA regulations.19 We're just talking about, is there a risk to the public.20 And that's the disputed issue in this case. That's the21 issue that the Ninth Circuit set down.22 But there's another part to Section 139, and23 that's whether this ­­ that if there is a significant24 risk, if you can mitigate that risk with reasonable25 accommodations. And that's what Lou Reiter talks about30￼1 in his report, is the various ways that we mitigate a2 risk when we're dealing with someone who is mentally3 disabled.4 But let's go back to the risks, because,5 Justice Sotomayor, I think you hit the nail on the head.6 There was no public risk here. And the reason for that7 is because she was in her room, and she had made clear8 she wanted to be left alone. She didn't chase after9 these officers. She closed the door. The officers had10 climbed up two flights of stairs to get to her front11 door.12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, the actual dispute13 was that Hodge, the social worker, claims he told them14 that this was a second­floor apartment, and there was no15 way to leave, and that the building had been evacuated.16 MR. FELDMAN: Exactly.17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So there's a factual18 dispute between what they say and the witness says.19 MR. FELDMAN: Right. And the only time that20 we get beyond the ­­ the record, I guess ­­ one of the21 arguments that you heard from Ms. Van Aken about, well,22 she might have had a gun, she might have had a23 hostage ­­24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: She might have25 wanted to commit suicide ­­311 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. FELDMAN: Yes.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: ­­ which is areason ­­ I mean, the officers did not go in there to shoot her. They used the pepper spray first. Why isn't that a sufficient justification?MR.

And the second is that ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm not sure I understand that distinction. If you think she's going to harm herself, apprehending her prevents that.MR. FELDMAN: Shooting and killing her is not an efficacious way to prevent ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I ­­ I understand the point. And it's ­­ it's a clever point to make, except, as I said earlier, they used pepper spray the first time. And it was only when the pepper spray was ineffective that they had a necessity of taking armed action.MR. FELDMAN: Right. To get back to your questions, the regulations that have been adopted in ADA, the Department of Justice made a determination that danger to self was not a consideration under the ­­32￼￼1 under the direct threat defense to the ADA. That was a2 decision that the Department of Justice made. So that3 determination is not relevant here, but that, too, was4 hotly disputed.5 Remember that Hodge, when he filled out the6 form, he checked "greatly disabled." He checked "danger7 to others." He did not check "danger to self." And8 what he testified to was that he did not give these9 officers any reason to believe that she was a danger to10 herself. Greatly disabled ­­11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I12 understand ­­ I understand the factual dispute in this13 case. But is your position that based on the Justice14 regulations, that danger to self is never a15 justification for approaching and trying to apprehend16 and subdue somebody in this situation?17 MR. FELDMAN: Under the ADA, that's clear.18 And the reason for that is the ADA contemplates19 providing reasonable accommodations as a way of avoiding20 discrimination. It would be inconsistent with the ADA21 if officers were to, as in this case, pepper spray, take22 people into custody as a way of preventing them from23 doing harm to themselves.24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't know why you25 wouldn't think the pepper spray, instead of the weapons,331 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425in the first instance wasn't a reasonable accommodation. MR. FELDMAN: If they had gone in withpepper spray, it might be a very different case.  Butthey went in with pepper spray with their gunsunholstered.      JUSTICE KENNEDY:clear ­­MR.

FELDMAN: And that's the determination4 that the Department of Justice made ­­10 everybody ­­ all the parties here have relied on11 Section 139, because it's what governs this issue. And12 it doesn't ask the police officers whether or not13 somebody is a harm to their self.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But this case is about15 danger to the police ­­ police officers. This is ­­16 this is a case where a social worker says, she17 threatened to kill me.18 MR. FELDMAN: Yeah. And I think that's a19 very good point. I ­­ I don't think this Court has to20 reach out and address what might or might not be the law21 in a situation involving22 or a harm to themselves.23 JUSTICE KAGAN:24 agree with the Solicitor25 you just disagree on thesomeone who might be a threat   Mr. ­­ Mr. Feldman, do youGeneral's standard here, andfacts, or do you disagree with35￼1 the Solicitor General's standard?2 MR. FELDMAN: No. We disagree very3 strenuously with any notion that a special circumstances4 test should apply here.5 Looking at the U.S. Airways case, the Court6 adopted that test for very good reasons. And it was7 because, in that case, there was a direct conflict8 between the proposed accommodation and the employer's9 seniority rules. So in that circumstance, the Court10 added a burden to the plaintiff.11 That isn't our case. In our case, we have12 symmetry between the proposed accommodation, on the one13 hand, and the way that San Francisco trains its officers14 and also universally accepted methods for dealing with15 mentally disabled individuals. So we're not in a16 situation where we need to adopt a special circumstances17 test. And as was noted earlier, I don't know what it18 means, and I don't know how a police officer can19 possibly figure that out.20 What I said earlier about the direct threat21 exception, and how powerful it is and how useful it is,22 that's what's in the regulation. And that's language23 that police officers understand because they are doing24 that already in the Fourth Amendment. Is there a direct25 threat here? Can it be mitigated through reasonable36￼1 accommodations? Police officers aren't trained, and I2 don't know that they ever would be, to figure out what a3 special circumstance is.4 So we have a regulation. It's been adopted5 through notice and comment rulemaking. It's expressed6 in language that police officers can understand. It's7 been applied by the lower courts. This just isn't a8 case in which we should be adopting a special9 circumstances test, particularly since it wasn't10 addressed below. The Ninth Circuit didn't address any11 special circumstance test. And from what I know, no12 court in this country has ever decided whether to adopt13 that special circumstance test. So I think that ­­14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what did ­­ I15 thought that the government said if somebody is armed16 and dangerous, the presumption is no modifications are17 required.18 MR. FELDMAN: Under Hainze, if a person is19 armed and dangerous, then the ADA doesn't apply.20 That's a different issue that, as Justice21 Scalia has mentioned, hasn't been raised here. The22 argument that the Government is making, as I understand23 it, is that if somebody is armed and dangerous, then24 there is a presumption that the direct threat exception25 is satisfied. And that's the only way to see that37￼1 argument and ­­ and have it make sense in the2 regulatory ­­3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I ­­ I have a hard time4 actually understanding if there's much of a difference5 between the reg and the Government's special6 circumstance, because the ADA, as a matter of course,7 doesn't say you have to change your procedures unless a8 reasonable accommodation can reduce the risk or can9 eliminate the risk. So what's the difference between10 that and special circumstance?11 MR. FELDMAN: The ­­ the Government is12 putting their thumb on the scale. That's the13 difference.14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There I ­­ I agree with15 you. Any time we start creating tests, I think it16 complicates things when you just go by the language.17 The issue always for the jury is, could they have18 eliminated this risk.19 MR. FELDMAN: And I agree with that.20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That is what the21 statute ­­ that's what the reg says.22 MR. FELDMAN: Right, right. But it should23 not be necessary for a plaintiff in an ADA case to also24 have to show that there were special circumstances. All25 the plaintiff needs to show is what the reasonable38￼1 accommodations would be to prevent discrimination, and2 the ­­ the burden then shifts to the defendant to make3 the showing of direct threat, if that's the defense that4 the defendant wants to assert. And throwing the special5 circumstances test in the middle of that, it ­­ it6 violates and ­­ and undermines the regulatory framework.7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but I think the idea8 of the government's test, Mr. Feldman, is this is an9 extraordinary circumstance in which the government is10 facing somebody who has a weapon, somebody who may be11 violent at any time, and that we shouldn't turn every12 case into an inquiry about, was this the absolute best13 thing that the police could have done. You know,14 there's ­­ there's a lot of uncertainty in these15 situations, and some reason to give the police officers16 who have to deal with them the benefit of the doubt.17 MR. FELDMAN: Well, if ­­ if you see it that18 way, Your Honor, then I think we're back to where we19 started, and the point that Justice Sotomayor was20 making, there wasn't a threat here. So if we're going21 to have a special circumstances test ­­22 JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. But then that's,23 again, just the question of does this meet the special24 circumstances or does it not meet the special25 circumstances? I guess what I was trying to sort of39￼1 figure out was the reason why you object to the2 government's test in the first instance.3 MR. FELDMAN: I think the best way to put it4 is that they put their thumb on the scale, and it's a5 scale that has been carefully balanced in the6 regulations and the statute, and there isn't any reason7 for this Court to start changing what the regulatory8 framework is. It's not an issue that the lower courts9 have had an opportunity to develop. I don't know what10 circumstances it might or might apply in. It may be11 very well an issue that the Petitioners here can raise12 in the district court on summary judgment, and an issue13 that this Court can decide at a later date. But the14 issue before the Court today is really just this fact15 issue that I started with, which is, was there a direct16 threat here. And all of the ­­17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what ­­ if you18 were giving the two­sentence guidance in the ­­ in the19 education course to the police about what to do in a20 situation where they confront somebody who is mentally21 unstable, what would you tell them to do?22 MR. FELDMAN: If the direct threat defense23 is not satisfied, then you must accommodate that24 individual's disability.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that doesn't40￼1 give ­­ I mean, that throws a lot of legal terms at2 them. I mean, in terms of their actual on­the­ground3 guidance, can you do better than saying you must4 accommodate the disability?5 MR. FELDMAN: Well, they're trained in6 accommodation techniques, so I don't think that's really7 the issue. There's no dispute that the way to interact8 with mentally disabled individuals is through9 communication and time. Police officers know that, and10 they're trained that way. I think the difficulty that11 the Solicitor General and the Petitioners are12 identifying is that these are difficult circumstances13 and potentially dangerous.14 But that's what the direct threat defense15 governs. And to put English onto the direct threat16 defense, the police officers have to be asking17 themselves, as I think they already do under Graham v.18 Connor, is there an immediate threat to the public, and19 is that a threat that we can eliminate somehow?20 And if it can be eliminated by, for example,21 here leaving the door closed, bringing in a negotiator,22 giving Sheehan time to deescalate, that entire risk that23 the officers here confronted was avoidable. And one of24 the things that Section 139 asks is what is the25 likelihood of ­­ of ­­ of the threat, and ­­ and what is41￼1 the extent of the threat? Because whatever the risks of2 de­escalation here, the course that these officers picked3 led to the certainty of a violent confrontation with a4 mentally ill and agitated woman who is standing behind5 this door with a knife. And they knew that when they6 went in with their pepper spray.7 It was reasonably foreseeable that when they8 went in with their pepper spray, and they sprayed9 Ms. Sheehan, because she was going to still be there10 with a knife, the stage had been set, it was reasonably11 foreseeable that they would need to shoot her.1213 would14 spray151617 spray 1819 Ninth ­­20 JUSTICE SCALIA:21 spray? What was ­­ what was22 MR. FELDMAN: The Ninth Circuit has been23 quite good about explaining that nonlethal force does24 not work in the intended way when we're dealing with25 mentally disabled individuals.42JUSTICE SCALIA: Gee, I ­­ I would ­­ I have thought it was foreseeable that the pepper would disable her.MR. FELDMAN:JUSTICE SCALIA:If she wasn't ­­   Isn't that what pepperis supposed to do.MR. FELDMAN:It is.  And ­­ and theWas this defective pepperthe matter here?￼1 If I get shot with pepper spray, I'm on the2 ground dropping whatever knives I have, but when3 mentally ill individuals get shot with pepper spray,4 they don't always process it the same way. Sometimes5 they see that as a threat, and sometimes they act6 irrationally.7 JUSTICE ALITO: What would you say to8 officers who encounter a person on the street about9 determining whether the person has a disability?10 MR. FELDMAN: I think that's a difficult11 issue that isn't presented here, but police officers are12 trained to recognize disabilities. And the ­­ the13 learning materials that Lou Reiter discusses in his14 report include how to identify somebody who is of15 diminished capacity or mentally disabled. Again, that's16 not our case. These officers knew that she was disabled17 because they weren't called to the scene to arrest her,18 they were called to the scene ­­19 JUSTICE ALITO: I understand it's not this20 case, but our decision would have implications in other21 contexts. So you would tell the officers, well, you22 have to determine whether this person is substantially23 limited in a major life activity, and if so, that person24 has a disability, what would you do?25 MR. FELDMAN: I would say that if you know,43      JUSTICE SCALIA:he took drugs.      MR. FELDMAN:take drugs ­­      JUSTICE SCALIA:      MR.

FELDMAN: I ­­ I think that's right.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And ­­ but they ­­ but they have to be treated differently.is present, right?  All right?  Why do they havetreated differently?  One ­­ one would assume that ifsomeone's dangerous and violent, and there's no way tomodify dealing with them, does it matter whether they'redisabled or not or what the cause is or not?  The issueis, don't resort to violence automatically if there's away to mitigate the risk.  Isn't that the answer?      Now, whether you'll be liable for potentialdamages or an injunction or anything else, that dependson whether you knew the person was disabled.  That's adifferent issue altogether.MR. FELDMAN: I agree with ­­ with what you said. The difference is whether there's liability under the ADA. That turns on whether the officer knew or45to be￼1 should have known that the individual was disabled. The2 Fourth Amendment issues, you're absolutely right. When3 an officer confronts somebody who is of diminished4 capacity for whatever reason, the officer has to use5 reasonable force. And ­­ and in a totality of the6 circumstances test, the diminished capacity is one of7 those circumstances. And it's not just for the8 protection ­­9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:10 MR. FELDMAN:11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:12 whatever the cause is, if the person's violent and13 there's no way to mitigate the risk, it doesn't matter14 whether they're disabled or not.15 MR. FELDMAN: Correct, because of Section16 139. And again, that's the strength of Section 139 is17 it tells the police officers exactly what they need to18 know.19 So we have a very robust regulatory20 framework and it comes back down to this very simple21 issue of whether there was a risk. And things like22 guns, there is no evidence of any guns; things like23 hostages, there was no evidence of any hostages. The24 officers were able to look into her apartment. They25 didn't see hostages. Hodge was in her apartment, he46      If you know about it.Right.But if you don't, and￼1 didn't see a hostage. He told them that the apartment2 building was empty. In terms of a risk of flight, they3 knew that they were on the second floor. Hodge had said4 to them that they needed a ladder to get in.5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Hodge also said there was6 probably a fire escape. He was wrong about that, but he7 did say that.8 MR. FELDMAN: He didn't say that to them at9 the time, he said that in his deposition, and what he10 said was he doesn't know whether there is or isn't a11 fire escape. So all these officers knew at the time is12 that they were in a second floor building, with a second13 floor and Hodge had said to them very specifically, you14 need a ladder to get in. That was the evidence. That's15 the best available objective evidence that was available16 to these officers. And under this Court's Fourth17 Amendment jurisprudence, that's what we look at,18 objective evidence. Under the ADA, again, Section 13919 uses that phrase, "best available objective evidence."20 JUSTICE KAGAN: And ­­ and, Mr. Feldman, I21 guess I'm still trying to figure out exactly who's22 advocating for what legal standard and how those23 standards are connected with each other. But if ­­ if24 you are using this direct threat regulation, do you25 understand you and the City to be advocating for the471 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425same legal standard?MR. FELDMAN: I think so. I think whatdifferentiates the City on the one hand and us on theother is not what testifies, but whether it's satisfiedhere.JUSTICE KAGAN: Because you're both looking to the regulation as the test.MR. FELDMAN: Right.JUSTICE KAGAN: And the City says it's satisfied; you say it's not.MR. FELDMAN: Right. And ­­ and the interesting thing is they're supporting the amici cite the same regulation. Our supporting amici cite the same regulation. That is the regulation that governs whether there is or isn't a defense to a failure to accommodate.JUSTICE KAGAN: So the only party who is not saying that that's the standard is the Solicitor General, whose stand ­­ whose regulation it is.MR. FELDMAN: Well, the Solicitor ­­ that's right. That's right.(Laughter.)MR. FELDMAN: But ­­ but the Solicitor General does have a footnote in their brief that says that even after the ­­ the special circumstances analysis is conducted, the direct threat analysis might48￼￼1 also be applicable. And I don't quite understand how2 that is the case, but as I said, I don't think this is3 the right case for this Court to ­­ to be thinking about4 whether a special circumstances test make sense. It5 just hasn't had an opportunity to be vetted below. But6 what we're left with is pretty wide agreement that the7 direct threat defense governs these issues.8 And so if the Court doesn't have any more9 questions about that, I'll briefly address qualified10 immunity.11 The issue on qualified immunity is ­­ is12 also a narrow one. It's not whether there is a Fourth13 Amendment violation, but whether the actions here14 violated clearly established law. And in the Ninth15 Circuit, we have two cases that involve substantially16 similar facts, and they're both cited by the Ninth17 Circuit in its decision below. One was Alexander and18 the other was Diorro.19 Alexander is a particularly interesting case20 because the defendant there was the City and County of21 San Francisco. So if they were aware of any case, you22 would think that would be one of them. The plaintiff in23 Alexander was mentally ill. The officers arrived at his24 house to execute an administrative warrant, and rather25 than allow them to do it, the plaintiff there threatened49￼1 to shoot anyone who entered his house. And it's the2 exact same circumstances we have here. The situation3 was contained, there was no need to immediately enter4 and the officers made the decision to go in in5 circumstances that led to a violent outcome. And the6 Ninth Circuit held that the officers there were not7 entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law8 because the extent of the threat was unknown and9 disputed. So it ­­ it raised a jury question.10 Diorro is the other case that the Ninth11 Circuit cited. Diorro stands for the proposition that12 where an officer knows that an individual's mentally13 disabled, that's something that has to be considered in14 determining what force is appropriate under the Fourth15 Amendment. And we have very clear testimony from the16 officers here that at least when Reynolds made the17 decision to force their way back into Sheehan's18 apartment, they didn't consider Sheehan's disability.19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought in Diorro, the20 plaintiff was unarmed, had not attacked or touched21 anyone, had generally obeyed instructions.22 MR. FELDMAN: Well, what the Court said is23 that he was unarmed in the sense that he didn't have a24 knife or a gun. What he had, though, was lighters25 fluid. And so he had a dangerous instrumentality and ­­50￼1 and the issue is the same, the police officers forced a2 violent confrontation when there wasn't a need to do so.3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's very hard when4 you have such a fact­intensive inquiry, and I think that5 was part of your submission, to say that the law was6 clearly established as to how they should function in a7 particular circumstance, which I think is important when8 you're talking about making the officers personally9 liable.10 MR. FELDMAN: Yeah. Although this Court has11 looked at whether the facts of a previous case are12 substantially similar or sometimes it's ­­ it's13 described as being fundamentally similar. The facts14 don't have to be the same. Substantial similarity15 doesn't require exact similarity. But the facts of16 Alexander, in particular, are very, very close to the17 facts in our case. So whether it's fact specific or18 not, we ­­ we've got ­­19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Only facts in the same20 jurisdiction ­­ of cases in the same jurisdiction are21 relevant?22 MR. FELDMAN: I think that's a bigger23 issue than what we ­­24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. Well, I mean, suppose25 this officer knows that in ­­ in some jurisdictions or51￼1 at least in the Fifth Circuit, boy, you know, if this2 person's armed and violent, I don't have to accommodate3 at all. So, you know, you could say that the point4 was ­­ was not clear. I mean, how can you say that ­­5 that it was clear under ­­ at least under Supreme Court6 law?7 MR. FELDMAN: Well, the Supreme Court's8 decision in Wilson v. Lane and Hope v. Pelzer, both look9 at whether there's precedent in the controlling circuit.10 These are officers who are in San Francisco within the11 jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit, and unless and until12 this Court takes a case and reverses something that the13 Ninth Circuit has said, I think that they're duty bound14 to comply with Ninth Circuit precedent.15 JUSTICE ALITO: On the qualified immunity16 issue, could we consider the question whether there was17 a Fourth Amendment violation at all? Assuming the18 City ­­ assuming that counsel for the officers raised19 that argument?20 MR. FELDMAN: Well, yes, absolutely. They21 did not raise it in their Petitioner's brief or the22 reply brief. They focused instead on the second prong23 of the qualified immunity analysis, but certainly, this24 Court has the discretion to reach the Fourth Amendment25 principles instead.52￼1 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, do you think they2 waived that argument?3 MR. FELDMAN: I think there's an argument4 that they did, but again, it's ­­ it's an issue that I5 think the Court has discretion to do what's appropriate.6 But I think it would be unusual for the Court to7 address ­­ and I think the Solicitor General makes this8 point, too ­­ to address an issue that hasn't been9 adequately briefed.10 If I could just conclude. I think the Court11 knows that this is a case with enormous policy12 implications. One of our amici, and we've got several,13 one of our amici counts among its members a family that14 called the police to get help with their mentally15 disabled son. And the police showed up, and they, I'm16 sure, intended to help that individual, but instead,17 they hurt it. And we see this in the news day after18 day, week after week, where the police arrive to help19 somebody and they wind up hurting them.20 And, Your Honors, it's only when officers21 and public entities are held accountable for actions22 like those that occurred here that we can expect to see23 a change in that pattern. So we ask that this Court24 affirm the Ninth Circuit.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.53￼1 Ms. Van Aken, you have three minutes2 remaining.3 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINE VAN AKEN4 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS5 MS. VAN AKEN: I'd like to make two points6 in my very brief time. The first is that I think7 the Court took this case because there's a division in8 the circuits about the weight that they give to exigency9 and safety concerns in dangerous arrests like this one.10 I don't think there could be any question that in the11 Fifth Circuit, in the Fourth Circuit, where exigency has12 a lot of weight in the reasonableness analysis, that13 this case would have come out differently. And I think14 that's the fundamental legal difference between the15 circuits and between the parties.16 What I heard Mr. Feldman say ­­ this is my17 second point, and it goes to the reasonableness of an18 accommodation. I heard him say that it would only be19 reasonable to accommodate her if they could have20 eliminated the risk, but the risk was eliminated when21 the door was closed. And with respect, I agree with the22 Solicitor General. He's incorrect that the risk was23 eliminated, because ­­ Mr. Feldman is incorrect that the24 risk is eliminated because Ms. Sheehan, whether or not25 she was fully contained, whether or not they had been54￼1 told by Mr. Hodge that there was no other exit, she2 certainly was not visible. And behind her closed door,3 she could have been gathering her other knives,4 preparing an ambush, she had a cluttered room full of5 household items, maybe there was a cup of bleach she6 could throw in the face of the officers. The point is7 that the officers knew that they meant ­­ she meant them8 harm, they knew that she did not intend to go peacefully9 to the hospital, and they knew that at some point10 someone was going to have to go back in that room and11 deal with the situation. And so delay behind a closed12 door could have been allowing her time to calm down, but13 the officers had no way to know that.14 The final point I want to make is that ­­15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't that the point of16 the treatment, though, to try to give it a chance? I17 mean, what your adversary has said is, we can't assume,18 unless we want a society in which the mentally ill are19 automatically killed, there's 350 people a year,20 estimated, who are shot by police officers and killed,21 who have mental illness. And this is not to minimize,22 there's a hundred police officers who are killed, almost23 half of them from ambushes, and the other 50, I'm not24 sure what the circumstances were, but not ambush25 circumstances. The point is, isn't the ADA ­­ and the551 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425House report makes this very clear ­­ intended to ensurethat police officers try mitigation in these situationsbefore they jump to violence.MS. VAN AKEN: Not where it increases safety risks to the officers. The nature of the activity at the point where they were deciding whether to go in or not was to resolve a safety risk. So any accommodation that increases a safety risk isn't reasonable as a matter of law. Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.(Whereupon, at 12:03 p.m., the case in theabove­entitled matter was submitted.)￼56Page 57￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Aable 9:2,3,5 46:24aboveentitled 1:12 56:13absence 22:9 absent 29:9
