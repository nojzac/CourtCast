United States.      Mr. Srebnick.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD SREBNICKON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. SREBNICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:      When the government restrains privateproperty, the owner of that property has the right to beheard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.For a criminal defendant who's facing a criminal trial,whose property has been restrained, that time is now,before the criminal trial, so that he or she can usethose assets, that property, to retain and exercisecounsel of choice.JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I ­­ you know, I ­­ I Find it hard to think that ­­ that the right of property is any more sacrosanct than the ­­ the right to freedom of the person, and we allow a grand jury indictment without ­­ without a separate mini­trial to justify the arrest and ­­ and holding of ­­ of the individual. And if he ­­ if he doesn't have bail, he's permanently in3￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425jail until the trial is over.  And we allow all of thatjust on the basis of a grand jury indictment.  Andyou're telling us it's okay for that ­­ maybe you thinkit's not okay for that.      But I think you're saying it's okay forthat, but it's not okay for distraining his property.I ­­ I find it hard to ­­ to think that it's okay forthe one and not okay for the other.JUSTICE ALITO:Well, that's ­­ I'm sorry.￼      MR. SREBNICK:for either.      JUSTICE SCALIA:case than I thought.(Laughter.)      MR. SREBNICK:bail, that is, the right not to be detained all the wayuntil trial, under this Court's precedent in UnitedStates v. Salerno, the Court provided proceduralsafeguards to ensure that, before someone is held allthe way until trial, they would have a hearing, ahearing which would include a right to challenge theweight of the evidence and other factors.We ask for something no different. Indeed, the indictment itself can justify the detention of the body and the detention of the asset until such time ­­4Justice Scalia, it's not okay  Ah, okay.  This is a biggerThe right to be released on￼1 That's pretrial detention without bail. I thought2 Justice Scalia's question had to do with detaining3 someone who was indicted, but couldn't make bail.4 MR. SREBNICK: Every person is limited by5 their own financial wherewithal, and so long as bail is6 set not as an excessive bail, he or she must rely on the7 assets that he or she owns.8 JUSTICE ALITO: But why, in that situation,9 would the defendant not have the constitutional right to10 have a determination by a judge as to whether there was11 probable cause?12 MR. SREBNICK: In the context of a bail13 hearing, a judge does make that determination.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does it? There are15 several factors that are taken into account. One of16 them is weight of the evidence. Are you equating those17 two things, probable cause to believe that the defendant18 committed the offense and weight of the evidence as one19 of several factors, to take account over the bail20 determination?21 MR. SREBNICK: Yes, we are, Justice22 Ginsburg. In the United States v. Salerno, this Court23 upheld pretrial detention because there were procedural24 safeguards, a right to be heard, shortly after the25 arrest. In the context of the restraint of assets, as5￼1 it stands now in the Eleventh Circuit, there is no right2 to be heard at any time until ­­3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Right to be heard ­­4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your5 answer might have been that, yes, in fact, the property6 is entitled to greater protection because it's going to7 be used to hire counsel that will keep the person out of8 jail long term, even if he can be put in jail pending9 the trial.10 MR. SREBNICK: Mr. Chief Justice, we've11 certainly made that argument in our brief. Some might12 find it more important to have those assets to retain13 counsel of choice than having their liberty deprived14 temporarily. In either case, the right to be heard15 should include the right to be heard by a judge, a judge16 who would have the authority to provide relief.17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is this only in the case18 where the person has no other assets, where all of his19 assets are seized, so that he can't ­­ he can't hire20 counsel? Suppose only half of his assets are determined21 to ­­ or asserted by the government to have been the22 product of criminal activity, and he has a lot of other23 money with which he can hire an attorney. Is that a24 different case? And we're not ­­ that's not before us25 here.6￼1 MR. SREBNICK: That's not this case. So2 long as ­­3 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you have a hearing on4 whether he has other money, right?5 MR. SREBNICK: Such ­­ such a hearing took6 place in this case, indeed. But nevertheless, the7 Petitioners, the Kaleys, did not have sufficient other8 funds to retain counsel of choice.9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If your ­­ if your10 position prevails, there would be nothing to stop the11 defendant from using those assets for something other12 than paying an attorney. If the assets are unfrozen,13 freely available to the defendant, the defendant might14 say, I will settle for a legal aid lawyer, I want to use15 this money for something that I care more about. It ­­16 there would be no control on that, would there?17 MR. SREBNICK: Justice Ginsburg, I believe18 there could be and should be. Indeed, if the court were19 to modify the restraining order to allow funds to be20 paid to counsel, the court would supervise the release21 of those funds to ensure that, indeed, the funds were be22 using ­­ were being used for the exercise of the right23 to counsel of choice.24 We are not asking for a vacation of the25 restraining order, so that the monies can be used for7￼1 other purposes.2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:3 strongest argument as being that um the grand jury finding4 of probable cause is sacrosanct, and a hearing like the5 one that you are proposing would call the validity of6 that finding into question.7 Why don't you address that because we­we ­­ you8 were talking about, in bail, the validity of the charges9 are not at issue, just one factor in the court's10 determination of whether to restrain him or her is the11 strength of the government's case. Are you trying to12 draw a similar analogy here?13 MR. SREBNICK: Justice Sotomayor, what we14 are proposing ­­ and indeed it's been a hearing that's15 taken place in several of the circuits for some 25 years16 now ­­17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There is at least five18 who are ruling similarly to yours.19 MR. SREBNICK: So for 25 years, the courts20 in those circuits have been holding these hearings. And21 what these hearings look like are similar to a pretrial22 detention hearing, they are similar to suppression23 hearings, they are similar, indeed, to what Rule 5.124 preliminary hearings might look like. And all these25 hearings require is a presentation by both sides.8I—I  see the government's1 Each side makes its presentation. Of2 course, the grand jury is a one­sided presentation. Of 3 course, the grand jury does not give the defendant an4 opportunity to be heard. Indeed, the grand jury doesn't5 6 7 8 9give the defendant an opportunity to have his adversarypresent exculpatory evidence to the grand jury based onthis ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG: And how do you get at ­­13141516   the charge.  We are simply saying the grand jury doesn't17   have the power to initiate and hold for the periodconcept of fundamental fairness is.MR. SREBNICK: Justice Scalia, we are notquarrelling with the power of the grand jury to initiate18   between indictment and trial, the ­­19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then there ­­ then20   there is the anomaly that the grand jury has said there21   is probable cause, this defendant can be prosecuted, and22   then you would have the judge make a determination that23   there isn't probable cause to believe. So  you are asking a24   judge who has determined there is no probable cause to25   preside at a trial because the grand jury has found that9￼JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's terrible. We10 shouldn't allow that. We shouldn't even hold the11 fellow. We've been doing it for a thousand years,12 though, and –and it's hard to say that it violates what ­­ what our￼1 there is probable cause.2 And how ­­ how could a judge allow a trial3 to go on? If the judge concludes there is no probable4 cause to arrest this defendant for this crime, how could5 the judge then conduct a trial? The judge would be6 overriding the grand jury's determination, right?7 MR. SREBNICK: Justice Ginsburg, I don't8 believe so. What's at issue at the hearing is what the9 government presents at that hearing as compared to what10 the defense presents at that hearing, no different, I11 submit, than in civil cases, under Rule 65, where a12 judge holds an interim hearing on the entry or nonentry13 of an injunction, that doesn't define the outcome of the14 case.15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In your view, what weight16 does the court ­­ the trial court in this hearing, give17 to the fact of the indictment?18 MR. SREBNICK: I believe the indictment19 authorizes the initiation of the restraint and not more.20 The government ­­21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So no weight. We've now22 had a hearing, I ignore the indictment, and let's have a23 trial. That's your position?24 MR. SREBNICK: Justice Kennedy, if the25 defendant makes a presentation at the hearing ­­101 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      JUSTICE KENNEDY:government has the burden of proof.MR. SREBNICK: If the defendant is entitled to the hearing because the defendant needs assets to retain counsel of choice, and the government rests on the indictment and the defense presents nothing more, I submit the government would prevail at that hearing if nothing is ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about ­­ what about a detention hearing? Same rule?MR. SREBNICK: Under the statute ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: It would be the government under a detention hearing ­­ pardon me. The trial court under the detention hearing ignores the fact of the indictment?MR. SREBNICK: Under the Bail Reform Act, there is a rebuttable presumption in certain offenses where an indictment has been returned that the person is a flight risk, but it is a rebuttal presumption. We are asking for the same opportunity to rebut the entry ofthe restraint.  So we, in nothe prosecution is preventedway, are submitting thatfrom proceeding to trial.But a grand jury indictmentthat there is probable￼      JUSTICE SCALIA:doesn't ­­ doesn't establishcause to believe that the person is a flight risk.  That11No.  I would think the￼1 doesn't contradict what the grand jury found. You're2 asking the judge here to contradict what the grand jury3 found.4 MR. SREBNICK: We are asking the judge to5 make an independent finding based on what's presented to6 that judge at the hearing, the very hearings that have7 been occurring for 25 years.8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wouldn't the next step be9 that the judge would then dismiss the indictment? The10 judge has found there is no probable cause to charge11 this man with this offense. And yet, you're going to12 ask that same judge to try the case that ­­ it would13 seem to me that the logic of your position is, if there14 is to be this hearing on probable cause and the judge15 finds that there is no probable cause, then the judge16 dismisses the indictment.17 How could you ask a judge who thinks there18 is no probable cause to then conduct a trial.19 MR. SREBNICK: Justice Ginsburg, what the20 judge might conclude is, at that hearing, at that moment21 in time, the government didn’t satisfy its burden, on22 that one day in time. It doesn't mean that the judge23 has gone back to look at what occurred before the grand24 jury.2512JUSTICE ALITO:At these hearings, when they21 who was allegedly involved22 that was not the case? In23 what would happen?24 MR. SREBNICK:in the scheme.  But what ifthe more ordinary situation,￼1 have been conducted, what do they look like? The rules2 of evidence would not apply, I assume, so the government3 could call, let's say, a case agent who would provide a4 summary of the ­­­ some of the evidence ­­ enough of the5 evidence that was submitted to the grand jury to6 establish probable cause in the opinion of the7 prosecution, and then what would happen?8 MR. SREBNICK: Justice Alito ­­9 JUSTICE ALITO: You could call witnesses.10 Could you subpoena witnesses? Could you require the11 disclosure of the names of government witnesses?12 MR. SREBNICK: Justice Alito, what we are13 proposing and what, indeed, happened in this case ­­ in14 the case of the Kaleys, the defense presented15 transcripts of testimony. All we asked the judge to do16 is to consider it. Indeed, the judge had presided over17 a trial of a co­defendant, who was acquitted.18 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, this was an unusual ­­19 that's a somewhat unusual situation where you had20 been ­­ there had already been a trial of someone elseIn the more ordinary25 situation, the defense ­­ if it chose to offer evidence,13￼1 it would be subject to the rules of the standard for2 issuing subpoenas under Nixon, only if there were3 material exculpatory evidence that needed to be4 presented. This would not be a discovery exercise.5 This would not be an effort to simply learn6 identity of witnesses. Indeed, the government could and7 does rely upon hearsay witnesses, case agents, to8 summarize the case.9 But where the defense, as here, offers the10 judge evidence of innocence, where the judge himself has11 presided over the trial of a co­defendant and sees the12 defect in the indictment, sees the defect in the theory13 of prosecution, we believe due process does not allow14 the judge to close his eyes to that ­­15 JUSTICE SCALIA: And in the next case we16 have, if we agree with you, will be somebody saying due17 process does not allow you to proceed with a trial when18 it has been found by an impartial judge that there is no19 probable cause. That will be our next case, right? And20 you may well argue it.21 To tell you the truth, I would prefer ­­ to22 save your client, I would prefer a rule that says you23 cannot, even with a grand jury indictment, prevent the24 defendant from using funds that are in his possession to25 hire counsel, don't need a hearing, just ­­ just it's14￼1 unconstitutional for the rule to be any broader than2 withholding money that the defendant does not need to3 defend himself.4 Would you like that? I­I really prefer it to5 yours. I think yours leads us into really strange6 territory.7 MR. SREBNICK: Justice Scalia, I believe8 that was the issue in Monsanto and Caplin & Drysdale,9 where this Court held a 5­to­4 decision that assets that10 are demonstrably tainted can be restrained over the11 objection of the defendant who needs those assets to12 retain counsel of choice. Today, I'm asking the Court13 not to allow the restraint of those assets that are14 demonstrably not tainted.15 JUSTICE KAGAN: Can I ask what the prospects16 of success at a hearing like this are? You know,17 there's an amicus brief which lists 25 cases in the18 Second Circuit, in which this kind of hearing was held.19 My clerk went back and found that, in 24 of those cases,20 the motion was denied, and in the 25th, the motion was21 granted, but then reversed on appeal.22 So, then ­­ you know, it's not surprising23 really. I mean, probable cause, it's a pretty low bar.24 So what are we going through all this rigamarole for,25 for the prospect of ­­ you know, coming out the same way1525 JUSTICE GINSBURG:But you said something￼1 in the end?2 MR. SREBNICK: Justice Kagan ­­3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just as a footnote, one4 in a million, which might be your case. I think that's5 the point.6 MR. SREBNICK: Actually, I believe that the7 brief of the New York Council of Defense Lawyers that8 Justice Kagan refers to points out that there are many9 other cases where, at the courthouse steps, the parties10 resolve the question of the restraint of those assets.11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:12 the government knows it's got to go13 where it has to lay out part of its14 decide at that point it's not worth15 or 25. Who knows how many hundreds16 government would have sought to seize the assets, but17 didn't because they knew they would have to justify it18 at a hearing.19 MR. SREBNICK: Mr. Chief Justice, that may20 be so, but it appears that the government does exactly21 that, every day, in Federal court during pretrial22 detention hearings, when it proffers its case in order23 to convince a judge to detain a defendant, and we're24 asking for something no different.16And I suppose, ifthrough a hearingcase, it may wellit, so it's not 24of times the￼ 1   about plainly tainted assets.  I thought that the 2   hearing was given on the traceability of the assets to 3   the crime.  So on­on that part, the­ the defendant isn't allowed 4   to challenge the connection between the assets and the 5   offense, right?6 MR. SREBNICK: Yes, Justice Ginsburg.7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Everybody agrees with 8   that.  So there is a possibility to say, you said we 9   have untainted assets, but the defendant in this case10   said, I concede that these assets are related to the11   charged offense.12 MR. SREBNICK: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. We13   distinguish between tainted and traceable to.  The court14   below granted us a hearing to determine whether the15   assets restrained were traceable to the conduct in the16   indictment.  What we would like to show at a hearing ­­17   indeed, I think we have shown it on the record before18   district court, is that, even though the assets that are19   under restraint are traceable to the conduct, the20   conduct is simply not criminal.21 And we'd like the court to hold a hearing22   which would not bind the court at trial.  Again, no23   different than courts hold in civil cases with Rule 65,24   this interim decision is not a determination of whether25   the grand jury got it right or wrong.  It's a17￼1 determination of whether the government presented a2 sufficient case on that day to satisfy its burden.3 JUSTICE ALITO: There's been a suggestion4 that, if the judge were to find that there was a lack of5 probable cause, the prosecutor would be under an ethical6 obligation to dismiss the charges. Do you agree with7 that?8 MR. SREBNICK: Justice Alito, not9 necessarily. It would depend on why there was no10 so­called probable cause. If it was based on a ­­11 something known to the prosecutor that would constrain12 him or her ethically, perhaps.13 But if it was simply because the prosecutor,14 on the day of the hearing, only presented one witness15 instead of all five, that would not constrain the16 prosecutor ethically in any way.17 The prosecutor retains the discretion to18 decide how strong a presentation to make at this19 hearing, no different than the prosecutor would have to20 make that same decision at a preliminary hearing, at a21 pretrial detention hearing or plaintiffs have to make at22 a Rule 65 hearing.23 JUSTICE ALITO: And what if it's the same24 evidence ­­ the same evidence is introduced before the25 grand jury? Let's say it's a credibility determination.18￼1 The grand jury finds the prosecution witness credible,2 the judge finds the prosecution witness not credible.3 Is there, then, an ethical obligation to dismiss the4 charges?5 MR. SREBNICK: Justice Alito, again, not6 necessarily. People can differ about credibility.7 We're not talking here about knowingly presenting8 perjured testimony or anything of that sort, that might9 raise ethical constraints.10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We would, presumably,11 if ­­ like here ­­ if there's a legal dispute and the12 government thinks the judge is wrong, they would try the13 case and go up on appeal and say to the appellate court14 the judge below was wrong initially.15 MR. SREBNICK:16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:17 money in that case, but ­­18 MR. SREBNICK:19 me. Justice Sotomayor, I believe the government could20 have ­­ and I haven't studied whether they would have a21 right to an interlocutory appeal from that unfreezing of22 the assets. I ­­ I suppose they would just like we did.23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does this hearing include24 an assessment of the reasonableness of attorneys' fees?25 I mean, if you're only withholding the amount of money19I believe, yes, Justice ­­     You would have lost theJustice Sotomayor, forgive￼1 necessary for the defense, what if this fellow wants to2 hire Clarence Darrow? Does ­­ does that give him all3 the money? How ­­ how do you decide that issue?4 MR. SREBNICK: Justice Scalia, I think it's5 decided the same way courts every day decide the6 reasonableness of fees and the legitimacy of fees. So7 long as the money is being used for bona fide legal8 fees ­­9 JUSTICE SCALIA: But does he know his10 lawyer ­­ is his lawyer there saying ­­ you know, this11 is the lawyer I'm going to12 going to charge?13 MR.

So counsel of choice had already18 estimated fees, disclosed them to the Court, all a19 matter of record.20 There was never a dispute about the21 reasonableness of the fees, the bona fides of the fees,22 the legitimacy of the fees.23 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you ­­ you acknowledge24 that that could be ­­ that could be an issue in the25 hearing in other cases.20hire and here's the fee I'mIn this case, yes, becauseretained two years before the￼1 MR. SREBNICK: Yes, Justice Scalia.

I don't even know who the lawyer's going to be.7 This defendant just comes in and says, I want to hire a8 lawyer. And the court says ­­ you know, any particular9 lawyer? No, I just want a lawyer. The court's going to10 have to make up a fee, I assume, right?11 MR. SREBNICK: Justice Scalia, we're talking12 now about the right to counsel of choice. The lawyer13 would have been chosen by the defendant. The lawyer's14 fees would be disclosed to the court, and the court15 would then have information upon which to make a16 decision about whether the fees are reasonable and bona17 fide.18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. He has to choose a19 lawyer before this hearing, right?20 MR. SREBNICK: If the defendant is seeking a21 particular amount to be unfrozen at the time of the22 transfer of funds, of course, the court would need to23 know who the lawyer was and how much the fee was. And24 so there's no problem with the court administering those25 issues.21￼1 Indeed, the courts, on a daily basis,2 supervise the payment of appointed lawyers. And so all3 that the defense here is asking for is an opportunity to4 be heard in a meaningful manner, not simply about5 whether the asset restrained is traceable to the6 conduct. This Court's precedence has never limited due7 process to a tracing inquiry as suggested by the courts8 below.9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you say that, in this10 case, because counsel had been retained two years11 earlier, that the court was presented with how much the12 lawyer was going to charge to represent the defendants13 at trial?14 MR. SREBNICK: Yes.15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The ­­ the dollar amount16 was known, so that the court could then say, well, we'll17 unfreeze assets to that extent but no more.18 MR. SREBNICK: Yes, Justice Ginsburg.19 So there is no mystery in this case. Who20 counsel is, what the estimate of fees are, that's not21 the issue in this case. The issue in this case is22 whether the Petitioners have an opportunity to be heard,23 so as to challenge this restraining order that purports24 to remain in effect ­­ indeed, has remained in effect25 for six years.221 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      JUSTICE GINSBURG:figure?  Counsel was identified.MR. SREBNICK: Yes.JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was ­­ what was the amount of money that the defendants wanted spared from the seizure order?MR. SREBNICK: The estimate was a fee of up to $500,000 for two lawyers and the entire investigation costs, consultants, experts, et cetera. That was the budget. There was no actual dollar figure set in stone. It was a budget in order to allow the defense to have their counsel of choice.JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it was a case with very substantial documents, et cetera?MR. SREBNICK: Yes, Justice Kennedy. And there was never a question by the district court or, indeed, by the government as to the reasonableness of that budget, if the case were to go all the way through trial.JUSTICE SCALIA: Tell me something because I don't know the answer.

If he is convicted, he gives the money back?MR. SREBNICK: Justice Scalia, in this case, if the hearing would go forward, the only way the lawyers would be paid is if there would be a finding by the court that the conduct at issue will not give rise to forfeiture.      And so the lawyers would, of course, try torely upon that judicial decision to establish the bonafides of their accepting that fee in the event that thedefendants were convicted and the government soughtforfeiture.

DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      For over 200 years, the rule in this Court24￼I think they can, too.  So￼1 and in all lower courts have been that the grand jury's2 determination of probable cause is conclusive for3 purposes of the criminal case, and that rule has been4 extended, not only to bringing the defendant to trial,5 but also depriving the defendant of liberty, imposing6 occupational restrictions on the defendant, imposing7 firearms restrictions on the defendant.8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But none of that9 goes to his ability to hire his counsel of choice. I10 mean, that seems to me to make this case quite11 different. It's not that property is more valuable than12 liberty or anything like that. It's that the property13 can be used to hire a lawyer who can keep him out of14 jail for the next 30 years, so the parallels don't15 strike me as useful.16 MR. DREEBEN: Well, the parallels, I think,17 Mr. Chief Justice, illustrate that the process for18 determining probable cause by a grand jury has been19 deemed sufficiently reliable, so that further judicial20 inquiry is not warranted. And that is borne out by two21 features of the grand jury: One, the way it operates;22 and, the second, the empirical realities of what it has23 produced.24 The grand jury is set up as an independent25 body to protect the defendant from unfounded25￼1 prosecutions. It is structurally independent from the2 prosecution and the courts. And it's composed of ­­3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand the4 theory. In reality, it's not terribly ­­ it's not great5 insulation from the overweaning power of the government.6 MR. DREEBEN: Well, it is a protection in7 the following sense, Mr. Chief Justice: If the court is8 seriously considering departing from the universal rule9 up till now in its cases and in other English­speaking10 courts and allowing a review of whether there is11 probable cause after the grand jury has found it, it12 ought at least to have a good reason for doing so,13 namely some reason to think that defendants will prevail14 in a ­­15 JUSTICE BREYER: They do that, fine, done.16 What we interpret the statute as saying, under17 constitutional compulsion, it uses the word "may," and18 if the magistrate concludes that there is ­­ after all,19 the basic principle of hearings is you don't need a20 hearing where there's nothing to have a hearing about.21 So unless the defendant demonstrates that22 there is a sound reason to believe that the grand jury23 was wrong, they only heard one side of the story, and24 that there is no probable cause, you don't have to give25 him a hearing.26￼1 But the word is "may." And so, like five2 circuits, Mr. Magistrate, if you think that there is a3 good chance ­­ phrase that as you want ­­ that they can4 show that the grand jury was wrong and they want the5 money to pay a lawyer ­­ by the way, without a good6 lawyer, they're never going to make their case ­­ and7 then, under those circumstances, the magistrate may.8 Now, that's a narrow exception. It9 preserves the lawyer. It's consistent with the words of10 the statute. It respects the grand jury, at least to11 the same extent that bail hearings ­­ and when you12 have ­­ oh, yes, and probably, I could think of a few13 others or something. But the ­­ it's not undercutting14 the grand jury.15 What's wrong with it?16 MR.

There is no further judicial reviewof whether the defendant's liberty may be restrained.And so that's ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that how they interpret weight of the evidence at this ­­ the Bail Reform Act says that the trial judge must determine weight of the evidence.

DREEBEN: In a certain class of cases,13 Justice Kennedy, the indictment itself creates a14 presumption that no conditions will assure the safety of15 the community and the appearance of the defendant.16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But ­­ but that's two17 different things.

DREEBEN: The court will look at theweight of the evidence under the Bail Reform Act.  It'snot revisiting the question of probable cause.  That'swhat's at issue in this case.JUSTICE KENNEDY: No ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? Why do we haveto decide it that way? I mean, I don't like casting into doubt the judgment of the grand jury, but why couldn't we say that, when you're taking away funds that30￼1 are needed for hiring a lawyer for your defense, you2 need something more than probable cause? Couldn't we3 make that up?4 MR. DREEBEN: That would ­­5 JUSTICE SCALIA: And then say due process6 requires something more than probable cause?7 MR. DREEBEN: That's squarely contrary to8 what this Court held in United States v. Monsanto.9 Monsanto, considered against the backdrop of Caplin &10 Drysdale, which said forfeiture of funds that were11 desired to be used for attorney’s fees is constitutional,12 then turned to the question of can those funds be13 restrained, so they will be available for forfeiture at14 the end of the day.15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't see what16 this case, frankly, has to do with the grand jury at17 all ­­ or review of the grand jury determination. You18 don't have to put forward, in this hearing, what you put19 forward before the grand jury at all. You could put20 forth different stuff. You could put forth less of it.21 Maybe you don't want to show your ­­ your22 whole hand. Maybe the party, on the other side, they23 don't want to show their whole hand, too, so they don't24 want to show all this other evidence that's going to25 prove ­­ prove their innocence.31￼1 It­ It's an entirely separate proceeding. Now,2 maybe the fact of the grand jury indictment should be3 given some weight or not, but it's not reviewing a4 particular determination. It's the judge making a5 determination on what he or she has before him at that6 particular hearing.7 MR. DREEBEN: It's seeking to contradict the8 determination of probable cause ­­9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. It's not, in10 the sense that, before the grand jury, you say, okay,11 here, we showed the grand jury these six things, and12 they said yes. You look at those six things; that’s there's13 the probable cause.14 At this other hearing, you say, I've got ­­15 I'm going to show you these two things, and the other16 side has these three things. And the judge, at that17 point, says, well, you don't have enough to restrain the18 property.19 It's not reviewing the other determination.20 It's an entirely separate proceeding.21 MR. DREEBEN: But it is seeking to22 contradict the other determination because it's asking23 the judge to find that there is no probable cause when24 the grand jury has found that there is probable cause.25 And the grand jury's determination not only allows the32￼1 government to bring the defendant to trial, which would2 be very odd if the court had found that there is really3 no probable cause for these charges, they are legally4 invalid.5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you have to go6 that ­­ I mean, your adversary just said that there was7 a judicial finding of no probable cause. I­ I don't know8 why that judicial finding has any legal effect, other9 than to release the money at issue. The judge is10 basically saying, like he does in a bail hearing, this11 evidence is not the strongest I've seen.12 In balancing the government's desire for13 restraint and the fundamental right to hire a lawyer of14 choice, it's not strong enough in this situation with15 what I've been presented to continue restraining the16 money.17 I don't see it, as a legal determination, of no18 probable cause. I see it as defining the word "may" in19 the statute. If the judge has discretion, that20 discretion has to be informed by something.21 MR. DREEBEN: I think United States v.22 Monsanto essentially rejected the argument that there is23 any discretion not to restrain the funds.24 JUSTICE BREYER: It didn't actually. What25 it says is, we reject the discretion in the context of33￼1 Judge Widener having said that, even where there is2 probable cause, we are going to balance a lot of3 factors, and what it says then at the ­­ wait, I had it a4 second ago. I'll find it again.5 It says, at the top of the next page, it6 says that the "may" thing refers to that. I'll get it7 for you later.8 MR. DREEBEN: I understand that, Justice9 Breyer. There was analysis of the statute ­­10 JUSTICE BREYER: Here it is. It says,11 "Thus, it's plainly aimed at implementing the commands12 at 853(a) and cannot sensibly be construed to give the13 district court discretion to permit the dissipation of14 the very property that 853(a) requires to be forfeited15 upon conviction." Okay?16 MR. DREEBEN: Exactly.17 JUSTICE BREYER: Exactly. That's what it18 says. So the claim here is this is property that19 850(a)(3)(A) does not require the defendant to­to forfeit20 upon conviction, for there can be no conviction because21 there is no evidence, and, therefore, I don't find that22 that sentence in Monsanto destroys the use of the word23 which Congress put in, "may."24 MR. DREEBEN: I­I don't think that there is25 any serious question that Monsanto meant to preclude34￼1 free floating discretion. What it did was focus on the2 question of probable cause, and the Court squarely held3 that assets in the defendant's possession may be4 restrained in the way that they were here, based on a5 finding of probable cause to believe that the assets6 were forfeitable.7 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So far, this is very8 conceptual, which is absolutely fine. I just want to9 leave that plain for a moment, and if I leave the10 conceptual plain, what I find is that they have a pretty11 complicated case.12 They are saying that this ­­ the defendant13 took some medical devices with permission from hospitals14 that were old and used, and he didn't return them to the15 manufacturer, who didn't want them. And what he did is16 he figured out this way of selling them and making17 money.18 Now, they are saying that's not that, and19 you're saying it is that, and so to make the arguments20 is complicated. You can't do it without a good lawyer.21 He has some money here to hire a lawyer, and you say,22 oh, but it will undercut the grand jury. You say, this23 has been the law in five circuits, and the government24 has not come to the end of its prosecutions, it hasn't25 injured prosecutions.35￼1 So as a purely practical matter, First2 Amendment, no real harm to the government that I can3 see. And so let's impose some kind of statutory4 limitation on use of this, but where there is a good5 claim for it, let it be used.6 MR. DREEBEN: Let­ let me start with the fact7 that I think that there is harm, and there is very8 little benefit, and I want to turn to both sides of that9 empirical equation. Before the Court concludes that,10 for the first time, a grand jury indictment can be11 contradicted by a judicial finding that there is no12 probable cause, albeit on different evidence, the Court13 should have a good reason to think that grand juries go14 awry in a sufficient number of cases, so that this15 hearing which will have costs, as I'll describe, is16 worth doing.17 There is no evidence to that effect in the18 20 years since Monsanto. Petitioners can point to not a19 single instance in which a court has concluded there is20 no probable cause, even though the grand jury found that21 there is probable cause.22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's because they23 didn't have the good lawyers they wanted to hire.24 (Laughter.)25 MR. DREEBEN: They do this, Mr. Chief36￼1 Justice, usually with the lawyers who want to get the2 funds, so they­ they can be hired. And they try to get3 hearings, and as Justice Kagan pointed out, we have 254 reported cases. I would amend Justice Kagan's statement5 about those cases in only one respect. In 24 of them,6 the defendants lost outright. In the 25th one, they7 won, and they were reversed on appeal. That is8 accurate.9 But the district court did not actually find10 that a grand jury had erred in finding probable cause11 because that case involved a civil complaint, not a12 grand jury indictment. What we have is thousands of13 indictments ­­ hundreds of thousands of indictments over14 the 10­year period that Respondents have canvassed in15 talking about Hyde amendment fee awards where courts16 have found no probable cause for a prosecution.17 He has pointed to four cases. There have18 been 660,000 indictments during that time period. The19 ratio between the cases in which the system didn't work20 and the grand jury malfunctioned and the cases where it21 did and where the defendant gets the opportunity for22 discovery, fishing expeditions ­­23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Are you24 talking about cases in like the Second Circuit and the25 D.C. Circuit, where you do have these hearings?37￼1 MR. DREEBEN: I'm talking about two things,2 Mr. Chief Justice. First of all, in the D.C. Circuit,3 Second Circuit, Seventh Circuit, and elsewhere in the4 country, where the law is not established, defendants5 can seek these hearings. In the 20 years that they have6 been available to be sought, not one has produced a7 finding of no probable cause.8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I­ I raised this point9 earlier. It may be because the government, particularly10 when it may have tenuous probable cause basis, decides11 it's not worth it to go through this hearing to seize12 and retain the assets.13 And it just seems that the statistics are14 phony, in the sense that, where the impact of this is15 going to be is not in reported cases; it's going to be16 when the U.S. attorney says it's not worth it, it would17 jeopardize the trial on the merits, and so they don't18 even go through the process of restraining the assets.19 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I20 agree with you that those cases exist. Anecdotally,21 they exist, where the government determines that the22 cost of exposing its witnesses, the dangers to23 witnesses, the potential undermining of the integrity of24 the trial, makes it too high a price to go through this25 hearing or ­­38￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: More that the facts,2 since the funds are traceable, anyway and they'll have3 an opportunity to get them at the end, even if they4 don't get their restraining order, makes it not worth5 it.6 MR. DREEBEN: No. That doesn't always work,7 Mr. Chief Justice. Let's keep in mind that this statute8 operates, in its core, in drug trafficking cases, in9 serious organized criminal cases, where the exposure of10 the identities of the government's witnesses can lead to11 serious problems of obstruction of justice. This is the12 real cost of these kinds of hearings.13 JUSTICE BREYER: Has that happened in the14 circuits that have permitted this?15 MR. DREEBEN: The government is unlikely to16 jeopardize the safety of its witnesses ­­17 JUSTICE BREYER: You know, I think, in the18 circuit, you've now given us some statistics. So in how19 many cases in the circuits that have permitted what they20 want or my version of it, the circuits that have21 permitted some form of allowing the magistrate to look22 behind the grand jury indictment in appropriate cases23 and find that if it's there, there is no probable cause, so24 you can use this to hire a lawyer.25 There are a bunch of circuits that have had391 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425rules like that.  In how many cases in those circuitshas the government faced the serious risks that you'retalking about?MR. DREEBEN: We do face them. I cannot quantify them ­­JUSTICE BREYER: Can you give me a guess? You are ­­ I mean, you make a huge point of how this will put the government at a disadvantage, so someone in your office, probably you, asked people in the Justice Department, do you have any examples? Or how many cases have there been where these serious problems arose?      And you probably got some kind of answer, soyou probably have some kind of idea.MR. DREEBEN: You're correct, I did ask, and I received anecdotal responses.JUSTICE BREYER: How many anecdotes? (Laughter.)MR. DREEBEN: I received several specificanecdotes of instances in which the government electednot to proceed with a hearing.JUSTICE BREYER: In a number of cases, several specific. Is that more like four? Or is it more like 24?MR. DREEBEN: There are group numbers, in which offices reported, we have encountered this a40￼￼1 number of times.2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're making it3 sound like you would lose the whole case. This, to some4 extent, is a little bit of a side show. You want to5 send the Kaleys to jail, and you want the assets that6 you think are traceable to it, and that's all well and7 good. But it's not like the whole case falls apart8 depending on whether or not you can restrain the assets9 or not.10 MR. DREEBEN: No, it's­ it’s not just that,11 Mr. Chief Justice. These assets are generally used to12 pay restitution to victims of crime.13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but they're ­­14 MR. DREEBEN: And if the assets are paid out15 to attorneys, although in theory, as Justice Scalia16 explained, it is possible, under the relation back17 principle, to go into the attorneys' files and into18 their assets and recover them, in practice, it is not so19 easy to do because ­­20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure. But now,21 you've touched on something that I think is very22 pertinent. They are used to pay restitution to the23 victims. I mean, the whole point here ­­ and24 presumably, it's something that your friends on the25 other side would raise in one of these hearings, is411 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425there are no victims, right?  That's the theory.      And maybe it will fall apart, and the judgewill say, of course, there are victims, but as Iunderstand it, the hospitals ­­ you know, gave them tothe people; the companies didn't want them back becausethey would have to give a credit.      You know, I'm sure the government has adifferent view of the facts, but that's a good example.Okay, this is going to be used to pay restitution to thevictims.  They come in and say, well, just give me fiveminutes, Your Honor, you'll see there are no victims.      What's wrong with that.MR. DREEBEN: What's wrong with it is that it basically compels the government to try the entire case in a preliminary hearing before the case has even resulted in a ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How often has that happened in the five circuits?MR. DREEBEN: The frequency of these hearings is limited, in part, because it's rare that defendants are able to show that they have no other assets ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And that's the whole point, which is you talk about compulsion on the government, but the compulsion of the defendant not to42￼￼1 have a hearing because they are required to say2 something that could put them at greater risk, whether3 it's because of the enhancements for obstruction of4 justice or merely from losing the advantage of their5 defense at trial, that's why these hearings are so rare.6 I think it's less about the government not7 wanting to disclose its case and more about the8 inducements against the defense wanting to preview its9 case.10 MR. DREEBEN: And also, the stark11 unlikelihood that the defense will prevail, unless the12 government is forced not to go through with the hearing13 because of concerns about which ­­14 JUSTICE BREYER: Can I15 question, since it came up? I was16 much of this forfeiture money gets17 best we could do is looking up three years, and on the18 basis of the figures that I got out of the DOJ on that,19 about 25 ­­ 20 to 25 percent goes to a category called20 third­party interest.21 Now, the third­party interest includes22 mortgagees, it includes other creditors, it includes23 States, who want taxes, et cetera. And if you subtract24 all those, a rough guess would be 5 or 10 percent goes25 to victims. Now, do you have a better estimate?43ask you a relatedcurious as to howto victims.  So the￼1 MR. DREEBEN: I­ I don't, Justice Breyer. I do2 know that one of the main purposes in seeking funds for3 forfeiture, particularly in white collar cases like4 this, is to pay restitution.5 JUSTICE BREYER:6 look at the actual amount in7 at issue here are, one, this8 lawyer, so the person can prove that there is not even a9 claim against him; and it risks, of course, sometimes10 of depriving the recipients of the forfeiture monies,11 and those would normally be, almost entirely, the DOJ12 for the expenses of going to the forfeiture expense of13 the trial.14 It would ­­ various criminal justice15 organizations on the prosecution side, States, and who want16 taxes, very little is being deprived of victims. Is17 that a fair comment?18 MR. DREEBEN: No, I'm not sure that it is a19 fair comment. In this case, for example, the government20 does believe that the medical providers from which these21 medical supplies were obtained and then sold into the22 black market by agents of a company are victims of the23 crime. They received restitution in the prosecution of24 one of the co­conspirators in this case, and that is the25 way the government is planning to proceed.44That is what the ­­ if yougeneral, but the interestsmoney goes to pay for aMR. DREEBEN: If the defendant seeks one, 10 yes. And there was the opportunity in this case for a￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9111213141516171819202122232425      If the defense is able to come up and, basedon case law that really has very little to do with anysituation like this, has to do with the idea that publicofficials who receive bribes haven't deprived the Stateof its entitlement to that bribe money ­­ that's thelead case that the defendants argue.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you concede that there must be a traceability hearing?hearing and the defendants ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, in the general runcase, so you agree that due process does require atraceability hearing?MR. DREEBEN: Yes. The defendants are entitled to show that the assets that are restrained are not actually the proceeds of the charged criminal offense or another way ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: And the defendants have the burden of proof in that hearing?MR. DREEBEN: That would be up to this Court's decision.JUSTICE KENNEDY: What­ what is your view as to what the Constitution requires in that respect?MR. DREEBEN: I'd be happy to have the45￼1 defendants bear the burden of proof, but I think the2 courts, typically, have placed the burden of proof on3 the government to show traceability, and the government,4 therefore, presents limited evidence, but it's all5 against the background of the crime not being called6 into question.7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. Dreeben, one other8 question. It's the question I asked before. I still9 don't understand. Under the Bail Reform Act, the issue10 is pretrial detention. The defendant says, Your Honor,11 under the Bail Reform Act, you must determine the weight12 of the evidence, and this is a skimpy case. The judge13 says, the grand jury is all I need as probable cause.14 Can and do judges say that? Does that15 suffice to comply with the statute?16 MR. DREEBEN: I think typically, Justice17 Kennedy, the government makes a proffer of the evidence18 that it intends to use. The proffer is very limited,19 it's hearsay, it's a description of the crime, rather20 than a detailed evidentiary21 that Petitioners want here.22 JUSTICE ALITO:23 MR. DREEBEN: I24 typically resting on the indictment alone will satisfy25 the weight of the evidence factor. But the hearing that46presentation of the kind Well that’s what  ­­ I'm sorry.do not think that ­­￼1 is provided for in Salerno is not a hearing that this2 Court has said, you must do as a matter of due process.3 It is what Congress has established as a requirement in4 the Bail Reform Act. When it comes to due process ­­5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if it's required6 anyway, then certainly the due process argument that you7 make is much less weighty. If we have to go through8 this anyway for detention, why not do it for distraint9 of property?10 MR. DREEBEN: It's not the same inquiry.11 The Bail Act hearings are usually very summary. They12 don’t involve calling witnesses. They do not involve13 sworn testimony.14 JUSTICE ALITO: But that's what it seems to15 me this case is all about. All the talk about16 whether ­­ about defendants being exonerated, that the17 judge is going to find a lack of probable cause,18 that's ­­ you know, that's fantasy land for the most19 part.20 But what it's really about is about21 discovery. Prosecutors hate preliminary examinations.22 When do they ever occur in Federal felony cases? They23 are always ­­ almost always eliminated by indictment.24 The defense bar hates grand jury proceedings. They25 would like to have a preliminary hearing, where they get47￼1 some discovery of the government's trial case, and2 that's what this is all about.3 So it seems to me that what's important is4 the nature. If there is going to be any kind of a5 hearing, what is going to take place at this hearing?6 And what typically happens beyond what I­I mentioned7 before, a case agent taking the stand and providing some8 summary of the ­­ of the evidence that was provided to9 the grand jury?10 How much further do they go? Is the defense11 entitled to any discovery? Do they subpoena witnesses?12 MR. DREEBEN: They can do both of those13 things. This is largely within the discretion of14 district courts. The Second Circuit, which probably has15 the most experience with these hearings under Monsanto,16 has held that hearsay evidence is sufficient to meet the17 government's burden of probable cause.18 What happens, then, are frequently19 excruciating fishing expedition, cross­examinations of20 the government agent in the defense efforts to attempt21 to find out more about the government's case, to ask for22 additional documents, to make later claims that Brady23 evidence wasn't produced in connection with the Monsanto24 hearing and various sanctions should fall on the25 government.48￼1 And the hearings do generally take the form2 of efforts by defense to obtain some strategic3 advantage. They have never resulted in the finding of4 no probable cause. And the­ the court's question, I think,5 here is, really, is there anything on the defendant's6 side of the scale, other than the abstract desire to use7 money that the government says is forfeitable to pay for8 attorneys?9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: On that point,10 Mr. Dreeben, would you clarify what happens at the end11 of the road, if the defendant is convicted? I think you12 said, in theory, you could go after the lawyers to13 recoup the fee, but that would be difficult.14 Can you explain what is the difficulty? We15 know how much the fee was.16 MR. DREEBEN: The difficulty is that we have17 to actually trace the specific assets into the18 defendant's own accounts , and if the defendant's lawyer19 has spent that money and has used ­­ you know, paid it20 out in salary, paid it out in expenses, it's gone, the21 government can't make that tracing argument.22 It can't forfeit substitute assets from the23 attorney, so it has to go under some State law theory24 and then sue the lawyers and then argue that the funds25 were held in constructive trust for the government.49￼1 State law varies widely on this. It's a big, messy,2 uncertain project, and as a result, it doesn't happen3 very often.4 Typically, if the funds are released to the5 attorneys, they will be gone. And if the defendant is,6 at the end of the day, convicted of a serious financial7 crime and the government wants those assets available to8 compensate investors, to compensate victims of Food and9 Drug violations, the funds are not there. They have10 been spent on an attorney.11 And under this Court's decision in Caplin &12 Drysdale, those funds were never the defendant's funds13 at all. What happens is that they may have been14 released because the government chose, at a hearing, not15 to contest probable cause because it would suffer the16 kinds of ill effects that Justice Alito referred to, and17 that kind of ­­ "blackmail" may be too strong of a word,18 but it does put the government in a very ­­19 JUSTICE BREYER: We could deal with that,20 couldn't we, by imposing conditions surrounding the use21 of the word "may" with conditions that would reject ­­22 you would say they rejected it. The magistrate thought23 this was just a fishing expedition for evidence. That's24 not a ground. He has to believe it's not a fishing25 expedition for evidence and that there is good cause to50think that the defendant will succeed.MR. DREEBEN: Well, that would be ­­ JUSTICE BREYER: Under those￼1234   circumstances ­­ under ­­ which is pretty  limiting , under5   those circumstances, then he has discretionary authority 6   to grant a hearing at which the defendant will be able 7   to show ­­ you know, that there is not probable cause to 8   believe a crime was committed by his client.9 MR. DREEBEN: Those high bars would be10   helpful.  But once the defendant clears them, the11   government faces the same pressures.  And at the end of12   the day, the same consequence is going to occur, that if13   the judge does find in that one in a million case, which14   has not yet been encountered, that there was no probable15   cause for the indictment, you will have the defendant16   proceeding on to trial in a judicial system that is17   honoring the finding of the grand jury after the judge18   has concluded to the contrary.19 And ­­20 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, it's about a21   different subject.  It's not we work through osmosis22   here.  It's about the subject of quashing a warrant, or23   it's about the subject of injunction.  Now, grant you, a24   grand jury thinks it's there, but it's also there, when25   you're talking about certain bail hearings.511 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. DREEBEN: It's different in the bail context because the ­­ the judge at the bail hearing is never questioning probable cause. He's only questioning whether the evidence is sufficient to justify restraining the defendant.Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Dreeben.      Mr. Srebnick, you have three minutesremaining.     REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD SREBNICK       ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. SREBNICK: The government is asking for an extraordinary remedy. We're asking for limited relief.      Justice Alito, we're asking for the kind ofhearing that Federal courts do every day.  This is not afishing expedition.  This is not a discovery exercise.JUSTICE ALITO: What do you mean this is the kind of hearing that's held every day? I thoughtthese ­­ in some circuits, it is. But it's held occasionally.MR. SREBNICK: The hearing looks very similar to a pretrial detention hearing. And in 2008, in front of the D.C. Circuit, the government was asked52￼￼1 the question that this Court asks today, what would be2 the prejudice to the government ­­ or what has been the3 prejudice to the government in holding these hearings?4 And I quote from the D.C. Circuit, "The5 government could not identify any harm to its law6 enforcement efforts in the Second Circuit that has7 resulted from the Monsanto standard." 521 Fed 3d at8 419, footnote 1.9 Today, we hear fears of lawyers abusing the10 process. We have a record. All we ask is the judge to11 read the trial record that he presided over and come to12 a conclusion that will not bind the court at trial. It13 will not bind the government at trial.14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I think15 your quotation from the D.C. Circuit was ­­ was not16 quite on point. My understanding is the court was17 asking for empirical evidence that this has caused a18 particular problem, not whether they could point to any19 concerns. I think we've seen the concerns laid out20 today.21 MR. SREBNICK: I understand the hypothetical22 concerns that the prosecution raises. I understood the23 D.C. Circuit to say, is there any empirical evidence?24 In Matthews, the case that we cite and that we believe25 controls, this Court said, "Bare statistics rarely53￼1 provide a satisfactory measure of fairness of a2 decision­making process."3 And so, rather than rely on statistics, we4 rely on the Due Process Clause, guarantee that you have5 an opportunity to be heard when the government wants to6 freeze the equity in my client's home and say to her and7 say to her husband they can't use the equity in their8 home to retain counsel of choice, when they've shown the9 court that they can prevail.10 The government says the judge must close his11 eyes. The judge can't consider the trial that he12 presided over. Instead, he must be constrained by a13 one­sided proceeding that the judge never observed, the14 grand jury. We say the grand jury is enough to make my15 client go to trial. We'll be there, if we have to be16 there. But we say she and he should have the right to17 use their assets to retain their counsel of choice.18 After all, this Court has held that the19 right to counsel of choice is a structural right. It is20 per se reversible to deny someone their counsel of21 choice. I ask that this Court not rule that the22 government can beggar a defendant into submission. I23 ask this Court not to rule that the government ­­ that24 the government can impoverish someone without giving25 them a chance to be heard through their counsel of541 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425choice.      If there are no further questions, I wouldsubmit the case.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
