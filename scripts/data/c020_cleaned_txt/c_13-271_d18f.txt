KATYAL,ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERSMR. KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:      The complaints in this case claim, as theLearJet 1 says, quote, Defendant's conspiracy directlyaffected prices for natural gas.  The mechanism for thatconspiracy, they say, was false reporting to two commonindices, Gas Daily and Inside FERC.      These publications take in jurisdictionaland non­jurisdictional sales data, and push out salesinformation for the entire market for bothjurisdictional and non­jurisdictional sales alike.That's the fundamental reason why these complaints arefield preempted.  The NGA, which is found in our bluebrief at Page 1A, gives states control over threethings, over the transportation or sale ofnon­jurisdictional gas, as well as to it's production orgathering.31 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the new regulations, but at the ­­ at the time of thesetransactions, 2000 and 2001, could FERC have punishedthese retail sellers for the consumers?MR. KATYAL: They couldn't punish, Justice Sotomayor, retail sellers as retail ­­ true retailer sellers. Here, these complaints are not directed at retail sellers. They are directed at jurisdictional sellers. All ten of the defendants in this case, as the District Court found at Petition Appendix pages 85 to 98A, are jurisdictional sellers.      And, yes, FERC could regulate them, and,indeed, did regulate them in the code of conduct, notjust for their jurisdictional sales ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that code of conduct came after this ­­ these transactions.MR. KATYAL: It did. It came in 2003. That's correct.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So ­­ so let's start with at the beginning. Could the consumers have come and complained to FERC?MR. KATYAL: Absolutely. The consumers can come and complain to FERC and, indeed ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Retail consumers.MR. KATYAL: Sure, retailers ­­ you know, if ­­ if there is manipulation that is directly4￼￼1 affecting, as it is here, both simultaneously the2 wholesale and retail market. The remedy for states or3 retailers is to complain to FERC and ask them to4 regulate.5 But what can't happen is what happened here,6 which is the state coming in, and through these state7 causes of action, and directly regulating practices that8 are common to both the retail and wholesale markets.9 That's the crucial feature of this case.10 JUSTICE BREYER: That is the crucial11 feature, and as I'm a little bit out of date on this.12 But as I think and understand the briefs, let's take13 El Paso as an example of a jurisdictional seller. It's14 a pipeline. It gathers gas from the field, or it used15 to, and then they resell it both to retail companies who16 give it to your house and are regulated by states, and17 sometimes directly to a company, a manufacturer, or a18 hospital, for example.19 Is that right so far?20 MR. KATYAL: Yes.21 JUSTICE BREYER: I take it here we are only22 focusing on the thing I mentioned last, the direct23 sales.24 MR. KATYAL: Well, Your Honor, I think25 that's the way that they're trying to claim their5complaints, I looked through their briefs, Ithrough your briefs.

That's actually not how thecomplaints are written, as I just read to ­­JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I looked through theMR. KATYAL: That's what they want to talk to.JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Let's talk about what they want to talk about.      Now, we have El Paso going in northernArizona to a manufacturer, and it says, I am going tosell you a thousand cubic feet of natural gas at $48 athousand cubic feet.You say, oh, my God, that's very high. I'm imagining very high price. I have no choice. I have to take it. But that, to me, is a very unreasonable price.      Is there anyone I can complain to?MR. KATYAL: So and I may not understand the hypothetical. If it's purely about the ­­JUSTICE BREYER: The hypothetical is that the jurisdictional seller in a direct sale sells the gas at a price that is unreasonably high.MR. KATYAL: Exactly.61 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE BREYER: Is there anyone that the buyer can complain to?MR. KATYAL: There ­­ there is in that circumstance, Your Honor, because in that circumstance, if the reason the rate is high is not a common practice, that affects both markets simultaneously ­­JUSTICE BREYER: The reason thatit's high ­­ I'll tell you that it's ­­ why it's high. It's high because the owner of El Paso has worked out he can make more money that way. That is the only reason.MR. KATYAL: And ­­ and, Your Honor ­­JUSTICE BREYER: And I want to know if the customer that used to be able to complain to somebody, but can they complain now?MR. KATYAL:JUSTICE BREYER:MR. KATYAL:Yes, Your Honor.    Who?￼                         So they can complain, in yourhypothetical, to the state itself why ­­      JUSTICE BREYER:      MR. KATYAL:can't complain to FERC.      JUSTICE BREYER:was a direct sale of gas gathered by the pipeline,transported from the field, and sold by the pipeline toa manufacturer.7    But not to FERC?Well, if it's retail sales, theyI'm saying what it is.  ItJUSTICE BREYER:MR. KATYAL:JUSTICE BREYER:    Correct.­­ that's a retail sale ­­      MR. KATYAL:Justice Breyer ­­      JUSTICE BREYER:That ­­ that is incorrect,    All right.­­ because the this is￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. KATYAL: Right. So in that circumstance, it sound ­­ if they are selling it not for resale but selling it for their own use ­­                             That is their point.  Theysay there is no FERC regulating this.  In fact, mostplaces, there is no state regulating this.  We think thethis, i.e. the $48 per MCF is set as a result ofactivity that is unlawful under our state antitrust lawand, therefore, we would like to sue.      MR. KATYAL:different in your hypothetical and in this case.  Inyour hypothetical, it is true retail rate regulation.1(b) gives that power directly to the states, andcrucial to our theory is the idea that if this is eithertransportation or production or regulation of the saleof the rate, which Louisiana Power is what ­­ saysthat's what that proviso is, the states can undoubtedlyregulate that.Here's the difference in this ­­JUSTICE BREYER:Your point, I take it, is818 JUSTICE KAGAN:19 JUSTICE BREYER:20 further.21 JUSTICE KAGAN:22 true, Mr. Katyal, that they are trying to regulate a23 means that's a common practice to both markets. And24 let's assume that because of that, FERC clearly does25 have authority to regulate in this area.9￼1 that the this happens to be the reason that the price is2 higher; is not because the owner of El Paso said, ha,3 ha, ha, let's make a lot of money. But, rather, the4 owner of El Paso, in addition to that, said that the way5 to make the extra money is to go out and manipulate6 the ­­ the journals, the little gas journal, by lying to7 them, and that happens to be the same way that they8 would also get wholesale prices higher.9 MR. KATYAL: But, Justice Breyer, that is10 precisely the difference. That is what this Court has11 said time and again. For example, in Northern Natural12 it said, look, the ­­ you know, the ­­ the particular13 means chosen by the state is the crucial thing for14 preemption analysis. The means that my friends on the15 other side are seeking to regulate is a common practice16 to both markets ­­17 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.  I got my answer.So let's assume ­­I won't interrupt youLet's assume that that's      JUSTICE KAGAN:      JUSTICE GINSBURG:      JUSTICE KAGAN:question.Well, then what's the ­­   It's not exclusive ­­­­ this area is the￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      The question is whether FERC's authorityshould be exclusive or whether it could be concurrent,not field preemption.  Right?MR. KATYAL: Right.JUSTICE KAGAN: There would still be a kind of rule of the road, even when field preemption runs out, conflict preemption takes over, and it might be that if the state regulation interfered with the goals and objectives of the federal regulation, the federal regulation would trump.      But I don't really see a reason in this kindof case why you would exclude the state entirely, evenif nothing the state was doing was conflicting withfederal regulation or federal policy.MR. KATYAL: But, Justice Kagan, you asked a similar question in Kerns, and I think the answer in Kerns is the same as the answer it is here. Indeed, it's stronger here, which is that this is a field in which this Court has said time and again is field preempted. When FERC acts in this area, it does provide exclusive jurisdiction ­­10￼1 MR. KATYAL: Yes.2 JUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, yes, there is some3 field preemption, but why should the field preemption4 carry into a sphere where the practice being regulated5 is commonly affected, both wholesales sales, which are6 clearly in the bailiwick of the federal government, and7 retail sales which are just as clearly in the bailiwick8 of the state?9 MR. KATYAL: Well, precisely what this Court10 said in Mississippi Power, page 374, quote, "We have11 long rejected the sort of case­by­case analysis of the12 impact of the state regulation upon the national13 interest and power regulation cases."14 Congress has drawn a bright line between15 state and federal authority in the setting of wholesale16 rates and in the regulation of agreements that affect17 wholesale rates. States may not regulate in areas18 where FERC has properly exercised its jurisdiction ­­19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you agree that20 FERC does not have the exclusive authority because you21 have conceded that a federal antitrust claim would be22 okay. So FERC is not the sole regulator. There's room23 for federal antitrust claims.24 MR. KATYAL: Justice Ginsburg, we absolutely25 agree that federal antitrust actions are available and11￼1 would have been the remedy for any problems in this case2 except for the litigation forfeiture by the other side.3 We don't think that that somehow makes FERC ­­ ousts4 FERC from being the exclusive regulator. I think time5 and again this Court has said there is a big difference6 between displacement of federal statutes which have to7 do with canons against implied repeal and the field8 preemption analysis.9 Indeed, in Connell v. Plumbers, this Court10 said with respect to antitrust claims specifically,11 preemption of federal ­­ of state statutes would be ­­12 would be the ruling of this Court, but not federal.13 Why? Because federal statutes can be harmonized one to14 another by federal courts, but states don't have quite15 that same experience. That's what Connell v. Plumbers16 says.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, suppose the state18 law ­­ and I think this is true of many states ­­ just19 mirrors the federal antitrust law, it's the same. It's20 the same substantive regulation.21 MR. KATYAL: We ­­ we disagree with that for22 any number of reasons our brief points out. But even if23 it were the same, I think two things would follow. One24 is, then there would be no need for the state lawsuits25 anyway because you already have a federal remedy, and125 same as the Sherman Act,6 question, and I would be7 MR. KATYAL:8 complementary authority,9 opinion in Arizona vs. United States decried. Once￼1 the state ­­2 JUSTICE KENNEDY:3 interested in a hypothetical. Let's assume that someone4 sues just under state law. The state law is exactly theWell, may ­­ and I'mand that's Justice Ginsburg'sinterested in it.And I think that iswhich, Justice Kennedy, your10 we're in the field, once Congress has said to a federal11 agency, as it is here, FERC is regulating the very12 practice that they are seeking to regulate three13 different ways, then you can't tolerate states in the14 area. Why? Because states will have all sort ­­15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, on ­­ on that point,16 let me ­­ this is a point that Justice Kagan was getting17 at, too. Let's assume that you do not prevail on18 conflict preemption. We say that the field has been19 preempted but does not include the practices here. Do20 you have any argument that there is conflict preemption21 on the facts of this case?22 MR. KATYAL: We do. It would be something23 that would be sorted out on remand, but ­­24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What is it?25 MR. KATYAL:It is that FERC is regulating13￼1 in this area, specifically, and, indeed, is encouraging2 the practice of index ­­ of index reporting. And if you3 have states coming in, then they will play ­­ then4 natural gas companies would play to the lowest common5 denominator and won't be able to report.6 The FERC report goes through any number of7 examples of how things that look like wash trades, like8 paragraphs 55 and 56, practices such as sleeving, may be9 regulated by the states because they ­­10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What would be left of11 the states' power to regulate prices if ­­ if the retail12 price controls the wholesale price? That's what it13 sounds like this industry has created. Is there14 anything left to the states' ability ­­15 MR. KATYAL: Absolutely.16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ because retail prices17 will always influence the wholesale price?18 MR. KATYAL: Absolutely, Your Honor, almost19 everything. So my answer to Justice Breyer was states20 have the power in 1(b) to regulate retail rates21 themselves, rate regulation, and as well they have the22 ability to regulate other things in which FERC can't23 isolate a practice that directly affects jurisdictional24 rates. So my friend's hypotheticals about wage and hour25 laws, or as you said, Justice Sotomayor ­­141 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:jurisdictional ­­ non­jurisdictional sellers can doanything they want in terms of the ­­ of the consumer,and consumers will always pay the cost of that.￼MR. KATYAL:      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:they can recover from.      MR. KATYAL:non­jurisdictional seller, Your Honor, states have fullpower in the area.Here is our test for preemption. It's very simple. It says two things. It's a who and a what to us. The who is, is the state regulating jurisdictional sellers. Here the complaints are they're directed atten jurisdictional sellers.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But they are both. There are jurisdictional sellers, and then there are non­jurisdictional sellers. You're trying to characterize them as one. But they’re –MR. KATYAL: Your Honor, but the way the Act works is once you are a jurisdictional seller, you continue to be a jurisdictional seller; and that's why FERC is regulating these ten entities with respect to even their retail reporting. That's what the code of conduct does. Why? Because that's the way the Gas Act15So basicallyNo, not at all, Your Honor.       Because they have no oneNo, not at all.  If it's a￼1 works. You don't take your hat off as a jurisdictional2 seller down the road if you are engaged in retail sales.3 So that's why that language from Mississippi4 Power I read to you is so important, because that was a5 case in which the State was regulating retail. They6 were trying to regulate retail rates.7 And what this Court said is, no, it doesn't8 matter, that ­­ you know, you can characterize it as hat9 or not. It doesn't matter. That's a practice that10 simultaneously and directly affects both rates.11 Therefore, FERC has exclusive jurisdiction in the area.12 Now, all these hypotheticals about wage hour13 laws and so on are solved by the fact that 5(a) is very14 limited. It only gives power to FERC over practices15 that directly affect the rates. The agency is coming16 before you saying, this is a legitimate interpretation17 of our authority. Indeed, it's the way they've18 interpreted their authority over time; and that's19 entitled to the highest form of deference, Chevron20 deference.21 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Katyal, suppose the22 following hypothetical: Suppose there is a company and23 it has ten customers and five of the customers are24 wholesalers and five of the customers are retailers, so25 it is a jurisdictional seller. And it says to the16￼1 retailers, We're going to charge you whatever we charge2 to the wholesalers plus 20 percent. That's what it says3 to the retailers. And then it lies to the retailers4 about the price that it's charged the wholesalers. All5 right?6 Do the States have power to regulate that,7 that fraudulent communication to the retailers about8 what they're charging the wholesalers?9 MR. KATYAL: I think if the State is ­­ if10 it's truly about the rates, Louisiana Power says that11 they can regulate true rate regulation. What they can't12 do is regulate practices that directly affect the rates.13 So FERC may have something to say ­­ and,14 indeed, I would expect would have something to say about15 that, and 5(a) says the remedy in a circumstance of16 divided authority in which ­­ excuse me, divided in17 which both markets are affected, the remedy is ­­ the18 first line of 5(a) says States should complain to FERC.19 Here you have got Federal antitrust20 remedies ­­21 JUSTICE KAGAN: Just to make sure I22 understand, you are essentially saying my hypothetical23 is like this case and the States would be divested of24 authority because ­­ even though the company is having25 this direct interaction with the retailers because it's171 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425pegged to wholesale rates?MR. KATYAL: No, no, I may notunderstand the ­­ but if it's one indivisible practiceas it is here, a common practice of index manipulation,that is something only FERC would have authority over,not the States.If I could reserve.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yang.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG,      ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES,AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERSMR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      This case concerns FERC's jurisdiction toregulate a practice of a jurisdictional seller thatdirectly affects the wholesale price for natural gas.      Now, Justice Kagan, your example ­­ I thinkthere might have been some confusion in the interchange.Your example is a practice that would directly affectthe retail rate, not a jurisdictional rate.  And in thatcontext, that would lie within the rate­settingauthority of the State.      But here we have something that is quitedifferent.  We have juris­ ­­ indices for which the18￼￼1 indices are based on both jurisdictional and retail2 trades. Then those indices are used by common practice3 in the industry, and not just by these Petitioners, to4 set wholesale rates and retail rates. That's done in5 advance.6 Particularly when we're talking about longer7 term contracts, the market participants end up often8 pegging their sale price based on the floating price9 that is reported in these indices. And where you have10 both, the input is going into the index, wholesale and11 retail, and the outputs that are both wholesale and12 retail. And FERC has jurisdiction over the entities;13 that is, the jurisdictional entities that are actually14 playing in both fields.15 FERC, in our view, has authority to regulate16 under Section 5 and Section 1 the practices of those17 jurisdictional sellers that directly affect the18 wholesale rate; that is, the rate over which FERC has19 exclusive jurisdiction.20 JUSTICE KAGAN: But you are saying,21 Mr. Yang, that even if the regulation is directed toward22 a retail transaction, if it directly affects the23 wholesale rate, you have field preemption over that?24 MR. YANG: These have ­­ I'm not exactly25 sure what your hypothetical is getting at.191 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE KAGAN: Does the ­­ the State is regulating a transaction with the retailer, and you are saying because that transaction has these direct effects on the wholesale market and wholesale prices, that that gives you field preemption, that that falls within the category of things which the State is simply not allowed to do irrespective of whether there is any conflict with Federal law or policy.MR. YANG: I don't think I actually agree with that characterization of our opinion ­­ position.JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. So tell me what it is.MR. YANG: So if the State were limited simply to regulating the retail rate, just because a retail rate might have some impact ­­JUSTICE KAGAN: No, no, no. They are regulating a transaction with a retailer. It's not a price thing. They are regulating a transaction in the way that they are in this case.      I mean, all these false sales, some of themare coming out of wholesale sales, and some of them arecoming out of retail sales.  And the States here areregulating transactions that involve ­­MR. YANG: Actually, I think we disagree with that premise. I think there may even be further20￼7 JUSTICE KAGAN:8 these were false sales9 MR. YANG:     Well, I thought a lot ofthemselves.Well, there’s two things.  Like￼1 disagreement, but let me just deal with the premise2 first.3 What we're talking about are practices that4 postdate the transaction. So when we're dealing with5 the false reporting of a sale, that is after the sale6 has been completed. And that false reporting ­­10 there's wash trades as11 false reporting, that can be either with a real trade12 that they are, after the fact, reporting it to be13 something that it wasn't or ­­14 JUSTICE KAGAN: And some of those real15 trades are real trades with retailers.16 MR. YANG: That's true, but the trade itself17 is completed, and so the market manipulation deals with18 future things that might be affected by the index.19 Now, the index, of course, affects retail20 rates that use the index just as it affects wholesale21 rates that ­­ that use the index. But, in our view,22 where you have got this partial merge ­­ and this is a23 very unusual aspect of this case. Where you have a24 partial merging of the wholesale and retail rates ­­ the25 retail markets here, Congress would have intended,21well.  So with respect to the￼1 through Section 5(a), which grants FERC authority to2 regulate practices directly affecting wholesale rates so3 it's not just limited to the rates itself for the4 wholesale sales ­­5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can FERC give a remedy to6 the consumers who are involved with the Plaintiffs in7 this case?8 MR. YANG: The answer is no and yes, and9 it's a little complicated. First, as we note in our10 brief, there is a remedy in Federal antitrust law, which11 would be outside of FERC. We also think that there may12 well be contract­based remedies outside that would be13 available. But with respect to ­­14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But FERC at this time.15 MR. YANG: With respect to FERC regulation,16 FERC has authority to grant disgorgement as has been17 held by the courts under Section 16, and complaints are18 brought often by States and municipalities and others on19 behalf of retail customers.20 The western energy crisis is an example.21 There are a number of complaints brought to FERC which22 FERC adjudicated. They have resulted in settlements.23 Those settlements with the jurisdictional sellers have24 involved payments to retail parties. There's an open25 question, and I think it might be very hard outside the22￼1 settlement context to determine if FERC would have2 direct authority to order that. But at least in the3 context of adjudicating disputes brought by States4 against jurisdictional sellers involving wholesale5 trades, there can be sometimes a pass­through.6 That said, we're not relying on the7 availability of a FERC remedy for retailers here. We8 think there is an adequate remedy at Federal9 antitrust and that's particularly true ­­10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you explain ­­ can11 you explain something? The government recommended that12 we deny cert in this case, and the government's reason13 was the case lacked prospective importance.14 So what is the situation today with the15 Energy Policy Act?16 MR. YANG: Well, the reason why it lacks ­­17 it lacked, in our view, prospective importance is18 because whatever the question was about FERC's authority19 before 2005, Congress expanded that authority in the20 EPA. Congress granted FERC not only jurisdiction over21 jurisdictional entities, which I ­­ which is an22 important limitation to our position here, pre­2005, it23 granted authority over entity ­­ any entities. So going24 forward, you know, that's a separate question on how far25 the EPA Act of 2005 goes.23￼1 But with respect to the questions here, we2 think that would be controlled by the EPA Act and not by3 the authority that existed prior to 2005.4 That said, prior to 2005, our view is FERC5 did have authority to regulate the jurisdictional6 sellers with respect to these practices that directly7 affect wholesale rates over FERC ­­ which FERC has8 exclusive authority. And this Court in, for instance,9 both Schneidewind and recognized this as ­­ the Court10 recognizes as well in Northwest Central, it said that11 the exclusive authority of FERC extends not just be ­­12 not beyond just the sales, but the practices that are13 affecting the sales. And this ­­14 JUSTICE KAGAN: Can I ask Justice Kennedy's15 question again to you, Mr. Yang, which is if ­­ if this16 were a conflict preemption regime, is there a conflict?17 MR. YANG: We haven't analyzed this under a18 conflict preemption regime, and so it would kind of19 depend on an analysis of what the state law prohibitions20 were vis­à­vis the federal prohibitions. We think that21 if you were to adopt only a conflict preemption type of22 a ­­ a regime, then you would have to at least have the23 state's accept a FERC determination of the lawfulness of24 these types of practices and then take that as a given25 in determining whether there is further conflict.24￼1 JUSTICE KAGAN: Sure, that seems right. But2 I mean, is there anything that FERC has said now about3 these practices that would suggest a conflict with this4 state regulation?5 MR. YANG:6 and it's difficult for7 litigation where there8 characterization of what the state laws claims are and9 there's not been adjudication of what the state lawIt's ­­ we have not analyzed it,us at this point in theseems to be flux in the10 requires for us to determine whether there is conflict11 preemption. That's ­­ it's not a position that ­­ an12 issue that we feel that we have a dog in the fight in.13 So that said, you know, the question of14 field preemption versus conflict preemption always ­­ as15 you noted before, you always have conflict preemption.16 This Court, however, has repeatedly determined that the17 Natural Gas Act ­­ in the Natural Gas Act, Congress18 intended field preemption to apply because Congress19 wanted to have national uniformity ­­20 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, it intended field21 preemption to apply as to wholesalers. It didn't intend22 field preemption to apply as to a retailers.23 MR. YANG: No, actually I think the Court24 has recognized in Northwest Central, for instance ­­ we25 cite this in our brief ­­ that the regulation over the25￼1 wholesales extends that power, extends beyond just the2 wholesales themselves. And in Section 5(a), which3 the Court cited both in Schneidewind and then recognized4 I think in Northwest Central, Section 5(a) extends that5 power.6 This is an extension that Congress did not7 have any ­­ an analog with respect to the states. It8 goes beyond the sales itself to practices affecting the9 sales. And we have here the effective merging of a10 state and federal market where, in our view, the states11 could, if they wished to, carve off their own markets12 for regulation. They have not done so.13 But where you have that merging and both the14 practices that are going into the index with respect to15 manipulation are both whole ­­ related the wholesale and16 retail matters, and then you are coming out and you are17 directly affecting wholesale and retail rates, Congress18 would have expected the field preemption that is a19 single federal standard regulated by FERC to govern the20 practices in that context. It's ­­21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How ­­ how is ­­ how22 is the state supposed to separate out the jurisdictional23 and non­jurisdictional regulation?24 MR. YANG: If I ­­ if I might briefly25 answer.267 only on those indices that meet certain8 The state could do something analogous.9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: AllFERC standards.right. Thank￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You may.2 MR. YANG: The state could require that all3 retail sales be based on an index that is exclusively4 retail­based.

YANG: Thank you.12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr.13 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY FISHER,14 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS15 MR. FISHER: Thank you, Mr.16 and may it please the Court:17 This is an anti­trust case, and the18 plaintiffs claims here are very simple. It's that they19 paid too much in retail transactions for natural gas20 because the defendants conspired to fix prices. And21 this is important for two reasons, each of which22 independently saves the claims from preemption.23 First, because the state regulation here is24 retail ­­ is regulation of retail prices, it falls25 squarely within Section 1(b) reservation of power in the27Fisher.Chief Justice,￼1 Natural Gas Act. And, secondly, the claims necessarily2 fall outside any field FERC could possibly regulate3 because, as my opponents have conceded, FERC has no4 power over antitrust ­­ it falls outside the agency's5 power under Otter Tail and California v. FPC.6 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I'm not sure. It may7 be an exaggeration to say it ­­ it falls squarely within8 the exception given to the states. This is not a state9 regulation of prices. It's ­­ it's state regulation of10 a practice that affects state prices, retail prices, but11 also affects wholesale prices. It's a little different.12 MR. FISHER: Well, Justice Scalia, let me13 say two things about that that are very important.14 First, the statutory word is "sales." What Section 1(b)15 reserves to the states is the power to regulate retail,16 quote, sales. And in that regulatory power, this Court17 has twice spoken directly to what that means, first in18 the 1947 Panhandle case and second in the 1997 General19 Motors v. Tracy case. And in both those cases,20 the Court made very clear that the state's power to21 regulate sales goes far beyond setting a price22 themselves. It's regulating the terms of service, the23 terms of ­­24 JUSTICE BREYER: All that is true, but it25 might depend on how. That is, the way I'm thinking28￼1 about this which is out of date but perhaps analogous.2 We have El Paso, it picks up gas in the Permian Basin.3 It ships it up to Ohio. It sells it to a retail4 distributor in Toledo. Classic. FERC regulates the5 sale for resale, and the local regulator regulates the6 price to the distributor.7 Now, there is what used to be a further8 bizarre and unusual occurrence which is now common. On9 the way, El Paso sells directly to a manufacturer. And10 that seems to be at the heart of your case.11 MR. FISHER: Right.12 JUSTICE BREYER: Right. So now I'm thinking13 we're back to cost of service ratemaking. Suppose under14 cost of service ratemaking, you have FERC which said15 El Paso is charging too much money for sales for resales16 because it doesn't do its depreciation properly. Okay.17 You'd better load them.18 Now, suppose a state via antitrust or any19 other way said the reason that the sales that are direct20 to the manufacturer are unlawful under state law is21 because it doesn't do its depreciation properly, and22 suppose that the depreciation the state is talking about23 is identical to the depreciation that FERC is talking24 about.25 I would say absolute preemption. And if I'm2919 JUSTICE BREYER:20 preemption ­­21 MR. FISHER:22 JUSTICE BREYER:23 MR. FISHER:    But that is conflictRight.  So let ­­    ­­ not field preemption.￼1 right about that, in this case, we don't have2 depreciation rules, but we have price setting by3 consulting Joe's Gas Journal. And here, what the state4 is saying is the consultation with Joe's Gas Journal5 that the state wishes to make unlawful is identical to6 the consultation with Joe's Gas Journal that FERC wants7 to make unlawful and upon which rests FERC's wholesale8 price determination. Okay? Just like the depreciation.9 And if the one is field preempted, so is the other.10 Now that's the analogy I've been going11 through in my mind, just waiting to ask you, because I12 would be very interested in your response.13 MR. FISHER: So that's the best version of14 the other sides argument, but it's not this case. You15 just described Mississippi Power, Justice Breyer, where16 the state wanted to second­guess what FERC had done.17 Here, the state has no second­guessing. FERC has said18 this is terrible what happened, as do the states.That's exactly right. And so 24 it's critical, but let me explain why we're in conflict25 preemption, and I turn back to Justice Scalia's question30"In the present case, it      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:number?      MR. FISHER:      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:      MR. FISHER:Northwest Central.  It'sis argued" ­­       Can you give me a pagePardon me.       Page number you're ­­This is on page 517 of                   Footnote 12.In this case, the Court says, "In the￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425about Section 1(b).  This Court has addressed in themost recent Natural Gas Act case what happens when youhave a unitary practice that has effects on both thewholesale and retail market.      Entire part 2(b) of Northwest Central isabout that very problem.  I want to read you whatthe Court said in that case, and this at Footnote 12where it summarizes the holding of the case.  They said,present case, it is argued that each agency acts withinits assigned sphere, and the Court has observed there isno provision in the statute itself to resolve suchjurisdictional tensions."      And here is the solution, "Only by applyingconflict preemption analysis can we be assured that bothstate and federal regulatory schemes may operate withsome degree of harmony."      And I would tell you there is no other31￼1 outcome that could possibly square with the statute. If2 you look at the statute, and this is in the first page3 of both the blue brief appendix and the grey brief4 appendix. Section 1(b) says, and I'm quoting from the5 beginning, The provisions of this chapter shall apply,6 and then it goes on to say to wholesale transactions and7 the like. And then towards the end, it says, but shall8 not apply to any other transaction or sale of natural9 gas.10 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes, but wait.11 Suppose, in our classical system years ago, that El Paso12 Gas gets a price set for resale at FERC equal to three13 dollars a thousand cubic feet, and then the Ohio14 regulator, in regulating the price of the distribution15 company, forces it down for the reason that it thinks16 that three dollars for the wholesale part is too high.17 Not close.18 MR. FISHER:19 JUSTICE BREYER:20 reason for thinking that the price or the sale ­­ they21 can't regulate the sale any way they want. They can't22 regulate it in a way that would interfere with and23 probably is, or is field­preempted by, FERC's authority24 to set wholesale rates.25 MR. FISHER: Those are two very different32They couldn't do that? That's right.So it depends on their￼1 points, Justice Breyer. We wholeheartedly agree the2 State could not regulate retail sales in a way that3 conflicted with FERC's authority. But we disagree, and4 this is the holding of Northwest Central, and it's the5 only reading of the Act that gives meaning to the6 provision that says that States maintain authority, and7 it says no provision of this chapter, which would have8 to include Section 5(a), can apply to retail9 transactions.10 and so the only way to harmonize those is to give ­­ is11 to give meaning to both and to apply conflict12 preemption. That's the square holding of Northwest13 Central.14 And in Mississippi Power ­­ I just want to15 stress this ­­ in Mississippi Power, the problem was the16 State was ­­ the whole point of the, quote, "prudency17 review" in that case was to second­guess the power18 allocation that FERC had made. So, as the Court itself19 said, that conflicted with FERC's authority.20 So once you understand that, the only ­­21 JUSTICE KAGAN: So as I understand your22 argument, Mr. Fisher, you are rejecting the Ninth23 Circuit's analysis. Because the Ninth Circuit ­­ it's a24 little bit confusing, but I read the Ninth Circuit to25 say that FERC just had no authority over these33￼1 transactions.2 MR. FISHER: The Ninth Circuit didn't3 explicitly say, but I think the reading of the Ninth4 Circuit opinion, proceeding from the premise that my5 friends are proceeding today, which is Section 5(a) is6 coterminous with field preemption. The Ninth Circuit, I7 think, held what you say it held, which is probably why8 the solicitor general was concerned with that case. It9 holds that FERC doesn't have power.10 We don't have to fight FERC's power here.11 If Section 5(a) gives the FERC power over this practice12 because it affects wholesale rates, so be it. But what13 Northwest Central says and what the statute says is that14 you can't oust the States. So all you’re left with­­15 JUSTICE BREYER: So you can't ­­ let me16 think of a better ­­ the ­­ the State, it faces a three17 dollar cost of goods sold to the wholesale pipeline, to18 El Paso, plus an additional claimed dollar in expenses,19 including reasonable profit. They're asked for $4 at20 the ­­ in your house. The State says, no, we're not21 going to give you $4, and the reason is that the $3 is22 too high.23 Now, you say that conflicts with FERC. No,24 it doesn't. FERC made a mistake. They will be25 delighted when they see that we've gone into the34￼1 depreciation rules more thoroughly than their own rules2 and they should have said 2.50 instead of 3. And when3 they read our opinion, they're going to jump for joy.4 To prevent that, we have field preemption, not conflict5 preemption.6 MR. FISHER: No, Justice Breyer, we're not7 second­guessing anything. We are not even asking to8 second­guess anything FERC has ever held.9 First of all, FERC didn't even have10 regulatory power over these practices at the time they11 have heard.12 JUSTICE BREYER: That's a different13 argument.14 MR. FISHER: Now, my friends have described15 themselves as jurisdictional sellers, but what the16 statute says is you're a jurisdictional seller or not17 depending on what kind of sales you are, quote, "engaged18 in." So when you are selling jurisdictional, you are a19 jurisdictional seller, but when you are making retail20 sales, you are a retail seller. And we're not asking to21 second­guess anything FERC has said. FERC, to the22 contrary, came in with this 2003 code of conduct and23 said, absolutely not, you cannot do these kinds of false24 reporting in wash sales.25 So all you're left with, once you understand35￼1 that it's conflict preemption, if I could turn back to2 Justice Scalia's question, is whether you fall under the3 Section 1(b) reservation of power. And I've explained4 to you that Panhandle and General Motors v. Tracy5 clearly show that we do.6 The only thing that our opponents cite in7 response, which is a brand­new argument, never made in8 the District Court, never made in the Ninth Circuit,9 never even made in the cert papers, is they cite10 Louisiana Power for the supposed proposition that all11 states have this regulatory ability over rate setting,12 but that's not the holding of Louisiana Power.13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you go back to one14 point? I'm sorry to interrupt you. But the indices at15 question, they report both retail prices and wholesale16 prices?17 MR. FISHER: Theoretically, yes. Of course,18 in this case, Justice Sotomayor, also completely false19 transactions.20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, no. I know21 that. But so the ­­ so Old Paso ­­ El Paso company was22 reporting fake consumer prices ­­ this is your23 allegation, I know ­­ fake consumer prices and fake24 wholesale prices?25 MR. FISHER: Well, the reality is they were361 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425simply reporting fake prices. I don't think ­­ JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yeah ­­ no, no, no. MR. FISHER: Now, it shows whether or notthey were supposed wholesale transactions or supposedretail transactions.  But the important point is howthey're used on the other side.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure how the indices ­­ the indices set both prices; is that what you're saying?MR. FISHER: Well, the indices don't set any prices. They simply ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, no. But the industry sets the same price for both?MR. FISHER: That's right. And certainly the industry commonly uses the indices to set retail prices. They also voluntarily, wholly voluntarily, at least sometimes, use the indices at the ­­ time question here ­­ to set wholesale prices.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are they the same, those two prices?MR. FISHER: No, not necessarily. Becauseyou use the ­­ you use the index prices as a peg, but then you can add and subtract to that depending on what kindof sale and the volume and the like. But even the actof using it as a peg, Justice Sotomayor, is an important37￼￼1 insight, because it is wholly voluntary that they even2 use it for wholesale transactions.3 And so if they are right, then as soon as a4 given practice affects wholesale rates, and it's their5 completely voluntary decision to make that so, you would6 be giving them a get­out­of­jail­free card if you turn7 Section 5A into a field preemption statute. Because8 whatever practice they're engaged in with retail sales,9 all they have to do is do it a couple of times in a10 wholesale transaction and then be out from under state11 jurisdiction. And my friend tried to explain ­­12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You could say the13 same for setting prices of anything at all. I mean,14 that's kind of the idea, is that if it affects ­­ if the15 price is affecting sales, then it is preemptive. The16 fact that they may engage in certain practices that17 affect sales is not a bad thing in the abstract.18 I mean, you ­­ the case is proceeding on the19 ground that you are dealing with a practice that is, you20 know, offensive in both contexts. But the state and21 FERC may have different views on that. So the fact that22 the jurisdictional sellers engage in a practice that23 affects wholesale rates is not ­­ shouldn't be regarded24 as problematic.25 MR. FISHER: No, it shouldn't, if all you38￼1 are doing is asking whether FERC has authority to2 regulate it under Section 5A.3 What we're saying is, if you transform4 Section 5A into a field preemption statute, you would5 have the difficulty of giving the defendants themselves,6 or any malefactors themselves in the market, complete7 control over how they write their own contracts. They8 could even peg their contracts to retail prices9 directly, as ­­ Justice Kagan, I think that's what you10 were getting at ­­ even to taxes.11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:12 field.13 MR. FISHER: Yes.14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:15 would you define what the field is?16 MR. FISHER: The field is what the Court17 said in Schneidewind, which is the field is practices18 relating to wholesale transactions. So all state19 regulation that is directed at that field is preempted.20 Now, as I've explained, it is field preempted if the21 state cannot bring themselves under the Section 1(b)22 proviso. However, we can bring ourselves under the23 Section 1(b) reservation of power. Then you end up with24 a simultaneous regulatory system where conflict25 preemption is the solution.39Mr. Fisher, there is aDefine the field.  How￼1 But if I could turn to the second argument2 in our case, is that the words "directed at" are very3 important, because that's the words the Court used in4 Schneidewind, which my opponents say is their best case.5 All state regulation directed at FERC's field of6 wholesale transactions is field preemption.7 For two reasons, our anti­trust claims are8 not directed at FERC's field. First, they are generally9 applicable state anti­trust cases ­­ claims, that is.10 The Court has never used the Natural Gas Act, in all of11 its history, to preempt in a field preemption manner a12 generally applicable state law. And the reason is13 simple: Because it's not, as the Court put it in14 Schneidewind, aimed at the natural gas industry. So15 FERC protects ­­ I'm sorry, the Natural Gas Act protects16 that turf, but it doesn't protect the state to protect17 companies against generally applicable laws. That is18 what the Court said in footnote 11 of Schneidewind, and19 that has to be right. As the American Antitrust20 Institute points out in its amicus brief, what if the21 way the scheme was perpetrated was simply by bribing the22 publishers of the indices? Certainly they wouldn't23 claim that it would be field preempted, but that would24 be ­­ or they shouldn't be able to, but that would be25 the conclusion of their argument; now even more so, even40￼1 if you weren't inclined to accept that all generally2 applicable state laws survive. And it would be fully3 consistent with the Court's cases to say so, because4 they only two cases they cite are Louisiana Power and5 Arkansas Louisiana, both of which are conflict6 preemption cases. But even if you wanted to make a7 narrower holding, you could simply limit it to antitrust8 law. Justice Kennedy, you asked, I think, about the9 relationship between our antitrust claims and Federal10 antitrust law, and it's very important. We've said time11 and again, and they have never disputed, the substance12 of our claims is exactly what would be prohibited under13 the Federal antitrust laws.14 So under this Court's holdings in Ottertail15 and California v. FPC, it falls ­­ and I will use this16 Court's own words in California v. FPC. There is no17 pervasive regulatory scheme, including the antitrust18 laws, that has been entrusted to the commission. So19 FERC has no power over antitrust violations. It's the20 exact opposite of Kurns, which they say is their ­­21 another one of their best cases. Even Kurns ­­22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's ­­ it's not this23 case. You don't have to argue it, but just so that I24 understand ­­ if this conduct, these transactions, had25 occurred after the FPC code of conduct, would the case41￼1 be substantially different, in your view?2 MR. FISHER: No. No, it would be the same.3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And is that because you4 rely on a conflict preemption theory?5 MR. FISHER: That's the proper way to go6 about this, and nothing in the code of conduct conflicts7 with anything that we're asking for. And remember, what8 Ottertail and California v. FPC hold is that FERC would9 lack the power to condone these actions. It's not just10 that they didn't; it's that they would lack the power.11 So this is why the ­­ the contrast I wanted12 to draw with Kurns. In Kurns, they ­­ this Court said,13 in a very, very broad field preemption holding, it said14 that what Congress had done there is give everything to15 the agency. The agency had full power to decide any16 locomotive practice that would be regulated, and so17 therefore the States couldn't tread on the field that18 Congress had given to the agency.19 Here, Congress hasn't given antitrust20 regulation to FERC. It's a very odd claim to come in21 here and say the Natural Gas Act field preempts a claim22 that the agency has zero power over. But that is the23 claim they are making today. And not only do they have24 zero power over it; they have zero power to give any25 remedy to our ­­ to our cause. These ­­421 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      JUSTICE SCALIA:transactions that you are complaining about, thetransactions that are the subject of the suit.MR. FISHER: No, they do not have any power over the retail transactions. And even when ­­ even when the code of conduct was enacted, Justice Scalia ­­ and I want to correct something that was said earlier ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: But ­­ but wait ­­MR. FISHER: ­­ FERC said it did not have authority over retail transactions.JUSTICE SCALIA: The gravamen of your complaint is the fiddling with the reporting.MR. FISHER: Yes.JUSTICE SCALIA: That is the antitrust violation, that conspiracy to report false amounts and to make false sales.      There is no doubt that the Natural Gas Actplaces that within the control of the commission.  They­­ it does have the power to regulate those transactionsand to punish violations of those transactions.MR. FISHER: You are using the word￼"transactions."  I just wantthe reporting?      JUSTICE SCALIA:reporting.  The ­­ the essence of the conspiracy that43They have power over theto be clear.  Do you meanOh, I'm sorry.  The￼1 you are complaining about in the antitrust case, the2 actions that you are complaining about in the antitrust3 case, are actions that come within the jurisdiction of4 the commission.5 MR. FISHER: So two things, Justice Scalia.6 One is, to the extent that is so, that only puts you7 into conflict preemption. That's the holding of8 Northwest Central, because the indices as we are9 complaining about them were used exclusively in retail10 transactions.11 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, actually, Louisiana.12 It's the same point, but in addition, you just said you13 agreed that they had field preemption over the setting14 of wholesale rates; that is, sales for resale.15 MR. FISHER: Yes.16 JUSTICE BREYER: And they're saying that17 it's the reporting to Joe in his magazine, the false18 reporting to Joe in his magazine.19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.20 JUSTICE BREYER: That is what we use to set21 the wholesale rate, the reporting of Joe to his22 magazine. And so what they're suing about is the very23 single fact that we use to set the wholesale rate, and24 therefore, it falls within our wholesale jurisdiction.25 That's their argument. And you say the ­­ that's their441 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425argument, not yours.MR. FISHER: It's just not factuallyaccurate, because if we win this case, they can pick upthe phone tomorrow and lie to indices all they want andState antitrust law would not prohibit it.  It's onlyprohibited if it's used as a mean to fix prices.  Andthat's what we're complaining about, is price­fixing,not the mere reporting.THE COURT: Thank you, counsel.      Mr. McAllister.    ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER,     FOR KANSAS, ET AL., AS AMICI CURIAE,        SUPPORTING RESPONDENTSMR. McALLISTER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      The States have two strong and primaryinterests in this case.  First, the States have longbeen leaders in the development and enforcement ofantitrust law.  Many of the State antitrust lawspredated the Sherman Act, and they certainly predatedthe Natural Gas Act.      Over the past century, State attorneysgeneral have invoked State antitrust laws on a number ofoccasions to challenge anticompetitive practices in thenatural gas industry.  The States urge the Court not to45￼￼1 adopt an interpretation of the NGA that will foreclose2 the attorney generals from that traditional State role.3 The second interest the States have is an4 interest in maintaining the longstanding historical5 division of authority between the Federal and the State6 governments in this area. It's important to understand7 the history. If you want to talk about the original8 intent of the NGA, the only reason the Federal9 government got involved was because there were decisions10 of this Court that said there was certain territory the11 States could not reach, in particular interstate12 transportation and wholesale transactions. So the13 States urge the Federal government to fill that gap so14 that consumers and others wouldn't be taken advantage of15 by the companies, just as they have been in this case.16 The Federal government, the Congress,17 adopted 1(b) as a very clear, and unusual in some ways,18 if you will, division of authority provision, and it19 says quite clearly that the Federal government gets20 power over transportation and wholesale sales, but the21 rest of it is reserved to the States, as it always was22 the States' prerogative.23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, not just the24 sales, but the practices affecting the wholesale, which25 is kind of the key to their argument.46￼1 MR. McALLISTER:2 is being argued here, in the State's view, is a massive3 expansion of anything Congress ever intended in the4 Natural Gas Act. 1(b) is the division of authority.5 And if you go back to the Court's earliest Natural Gas6 Act decisions, the 1940s, the Panhandle cases ­­ there7 are a series of them, even into the early 1960s ­­ you8 can find numerous quotes where the Court says the9 subsequent sections ­­ 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, you name it ­­10 they help FERC implement the authority we've given, but11 they are not intended to expand the scope of section12 1(b). They are not intended to diminish what is13 reserved to the States. And that is exactly what the14 United States and the ­­ and the defendants here are15 arguing for.16 The States have no problem with FERC having17 authority to address manipulation in the wholesale18 market. We are absolutely comfortable with that. But19 what we do have a problem with is saying we can't use20 more than century­old traditional antitrust laws that21 are not targeting the natural gas industry to protect22 consumers and businesses in our States that are paying23 way too much at retail because of a price­fixing24 conspiracy.25 The defendants go so far as to suggest there47Mr. Chief Justice, 5(a) as￼1 may be some uncertainty about what is a competitive2 market. Well, there is no uncertainty about this one.3 Under any legal regime, under any economic theory,4 price­fixing conspiracy is per se unlawful. And the5 States are not interfering with FERC here. FERC was6 never asked to bless the conspiracy. FERC would not7 have blessed the conspiracy, could not have blessed the8 conspiracy. And we agree fully with my colleague Mr.9 Fisher and the plaintiffs that the analysis should be10 conflict preemption here, not field preemption.11 Conflict preemption will more than adequately protect12 any and all Federal interests at stake.13 And the cases that have come up prior to14 this can be certainly explained as conflict preemption.15 Northwest Central, in some ways the Court's most recent16 statement on this issue, a Kansas case involving17 production, I believe gives you the blueprint, if you18 will, for deciding this case. The argument in Northwest19 Central was the production requirements Kansas was20 imposing had an effect on wholesale prices, and they21 probably did.22 But the Court said that doesn't mean they23 are field­preempted. The Court said the field of24 production is reserved to the States. Here the field of25 retail sales is reserved to the States. The Court went48￼1 on to say, well, does the Kansas regulation conflict2 with Federal goals and purposes, concluded that it did3 not.4 We're absolutely comfortable with that sort5 of analysis here. We're not targeting States under6 antitrust laws, would not be necessarily wholesale7 sales. But what we are particularly interested in is8 protecting, consumers both large and small from9 anti­competitive price­fixing conspiracies. And I would10 just reiterate that I don't think you can fully11 appreciate ­­ you can look at ­­ I guess I will put it12 this way. You can look at four things perhaps in13 deciding the scope of section one 1.b. certainly start14 with the text; and to the States, the text is very clear15 about the division of authority.16 But importantly it's a statute that one may17 not fully understand without looking at the history that18 led up to it. The Federal government was supposed to be19 the gap filler, acting only where the States couldn't,20 not taking over everything and pushing the States to the21 side.22 Thirdly, the structure of the statute is23 such that 1(b) is the provision. It says the ­­ the24 provisions of this chapter shall apply to these things25 and shall not apply to these things. So it only makes491 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425sense that 4, 5, 6, 7, everything that comes after, isnot intended to alter the scope of Section 1(b).      And then, again, going back to numerousdecisions of this Court, particularly the decisionscloser in time to the enactment of the NGA, is quiteclear that that was how the Court originally understoodthe scope of Section 1(b).      So the States would respectfully ask thatthe Court affirm the Ninth Circuit's decision.  ToJustice Kagan's but we're not necessarily arguingthat FERC shouldn't have the authority to reach thepractices that effected wholesale rates.  That ­­ that,we're fine with.  But what we do not think is that theretail sales here are field preempted.  They should besubject to conflict­preemption principles at most.      MR. MCALLISTER:      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:four minutes left.Unless there are questions ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:￼     REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL,       ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERSMR. KATYAL: My friend says the field is, quote, practices relating to wholesale transactions. We agree.50       Thank you, counsel.Thank you very much.Mr. Katyal, you have￼1 That means the only question is whether2 1(b) ­­ these lawsuits fall within 1(b). They don't,3 and here's why: Imagine these lawsuits went forward,4 for example, in Wisconsin and Kansas. If they won these5 lawsuits, the result would be a rate of zero, a full6 refund. That is not rate regulation. That is something7 else.8 If in the other States that don't have full9 refunds, will be treble damages. Treble damages is not10 just in reasonable compensation the way that rate11 setting is ­­ rate setting is.12 This Court, in Louisiana Power, was as clear13 as day that 1(b) is limited­­ is limited just to the14 setting of rates. And, indeed, in this case, the15 complaints themselves illustrate why these aren't sales.16 After all, their own complaints don't even allege that17 all of the defendants sold to all of the retailers.18 Now, my friend says, Oh, we're not19 second­guessing FERC with these ­­ with these lawsuits.20 No. Quite to the contrary.21 Imagine that liability phase of the trial if22 it were allowed to proceed. It would be second­guessing23 everything FERC did. Indeed, it would look just like24 the FERC proceeding: What were the rates, what was the25 scheme of manipulation, what was done, what was carried51￼1 out, what would those rates been otherwise?2 FERC has in its code of conduct a very3 careful and fine­tuned analysis of when index4 manipulation in wash sales are appropriate, when they're5 not ­­6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's ­­ that's no7 problem, I mean, they say that. That's conflict8 preemption.9 MR. KATYAL: Exactly. And the difference10 is, Justice Scalia, that if you allow their11 conflict­preemption argument, you are letting 50 States12 adopt their own rules with respect to this 50 different13 lay juries. This is something the Court has never done.14 The best they can come up with is Louisiana15 Power, and Louisiana Power ­­ and if you look if the16 footnote and the text around it ­­ is very clear why17 there was no preemption in that case. It was because18 the regulation there was directed at producers, at19 non­jurisdictional entities.20 These lawsuits are directed at21 jurisdictional sellers. That's what the District Court22 found in 15 pages of findings. They aren't contesting23 that.24 So this would be the first time this Court25 has ever adopted a rule that says there was simultaneous52￼1 jurisdiction and conflict preemption in a circumstance2 in which you are dealing with jurisdictional sellers.3 It's never happened. And to do so here, I think, would4 be a real break from this Court's field preemption5 precedence.6 My friend's argument for why you should do7 it is, he says, well, people will be able to pick up the8 phone and manipulate prices. Absolutely not. The9 Sherman Antitrust Act would bar every allegation in this10 complaint if they were proven to be true. FERC11 regulates in this area and is regulating right now ­­12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Your point about juries13 would apply to the Sherman Act as well.14 MR. KATYAL: It does and just as I15 was saying before, Justice Ginsburg, Connell v. Plumbers16 says it's very different when we're dealing with Federal17 juries which can harmonize Federal statutes and States.18 Here, Congress has a comprehensive scheme that puts FERC19 in charge. This Court has never countenanced a result20 that says you can have divided authority over21 jurisdictional sellers, and that's what this is.22 JUSTICE KAGAN: I think that goes a lot23 further than anything we've ever done. I mean, the24 jurisdictional sellers, as I understand this industry,25 that there are a lot of companies that sell both to53￼1 wholesalers and to retailers and always before, I think,2 we've looked at the transaction and said, Where is the3 transaction, is the transaction a wholesale transaction4 or a retail transaction? Not, oh, look. You engaged in5 one wholesale transaction last year, and that insulates6 you from everything.7 MR. KATYAL: Justice Kagan, you don't look8 at the transaction, you look at the practices. That's9 the word 5(a) and that's what the Agency here is saying,10 is that the practices here, or the common and11 inseparable practice of index manipulation directly12 affects both markets. And so, absolutely, we agree with13 you.14 If there is some other circumstance in which15 there isn't a direct effect on the wholesale market,16 that's one the States have authority to do. This Court17 hasn't dealt with that situation; but, absolutely, we18 will give you that.19 But this is a circumstance that I think now20 my friends on the other side are conceding is within21 FERC's wheelhouse. FERC is here before you saying, we22 have exclusive authority in this area. It should be23 deferred to.24 THE COURT: Thank you, counsel.25 The case is submitted.541 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      (Whereupon, at 12:02 p.m., the case
