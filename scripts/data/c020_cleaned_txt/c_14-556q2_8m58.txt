HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      The Question 2 Petitioners are alreadymarried.  They have established those enduringrelationships, and they have a liberty interest that isof fundamental importance to these couples and theirchildren.      A State should not be allowed to effectivelydissolve that marriage without a sufficiently importantjustification to do so.      These Petitioners have built their livesaround their marriages, including bringing children intotheir families, just as opposite­sex couples have done.But the non­recognition laws undermine the stability ofthese families, though the States purport to supportjust such stability.JUSTICE ALITO: I was somewhat surprised by the arguments you made in your brief because they are51 largely a repetition of the arguments that we just heard2 with respect to Question 1.3 I thought the point of Question 2 was4 whether there would be a ­­ an obligation to recognize a5 same­sex marriage entered into in another State where6 that is lawful even if the State itself,7 constitutionally, does not recognize same­sex marriage.8 I thought that's the question in Question 2. Is ­­ am I9 wrong?10 MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER: It is the question11 in Question 2, and this Court's decisions establish that12 there is not only a right to be married, but a right to13 remain married; that there is a protected liberty14 interest in the status of one's marriage once it has15 been established under law.16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Even ­­ even if that17 marriage is ­­ is not lawful under ­­ under the18 receiving State's law; right?19 MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER: That's right.20 There is definitely ­­21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that right? No22 matter ­­ I mean, suppose ­­ well, let's say someone23 gets married in a ­­ in a country that permits polygamy.24 Does a State have to acknowledge that marriage?25 MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER: Well, of course,￼      JUSTICE SCALIA:      MR. HALLWARD­DREIMEIER:recognizing such ­­      JUSTICE SCALIA:justification be?  That it's contrary to the State'spublic policy, I assume; right?MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER: Well, no, Your Honor. I think that the justification would be that the State doesn't have such an institution. The ­­ a polygamous relationship would raise all kinds of questions that the State's marriage laws don't address.JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it would be the same argument. We don't have such an institution. Our marriage in this State, which we constitutionally can have because the second question assumes that the first question comes out the way the United States does not want it to come out, the State says we only have the institution of heterosexual marriage. We don't have the institution of same­sex marriage.MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER: No. The institution is the institution of marriage, and the experience of those States ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you're saying that,Okay.  So ­­        ­­ for not­­ what would the6￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the State could assert justifications for not doing so,and I think there would be justifications ­­7￼1 but the State doesn't. The State says the only2 institution we have is heterosexual marriage.3 MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER: The ­­ the point4 I'm making, Your Honor, I think is demonstrated by what5 has happened in those States where, by court order,6 States have had to permit same­sex couples to marry.7 All that has happened under their laws is8 that they have had to remove gender­specific language9 and substitute it with gender­neutral language.10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, could I ­­ could11 I ­­ because I don't ­­ if you want to finish answering12 Justice Scalia's ­­13 MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER: I was going to say14 that ­­ that plural relationships raise all manner of15 questions that are not addressed by this State's current16 marriage laws.17 JUSTICE ALITO: What if it's not a plural18 relationship? What if one State says that individuals19 can marry at the age of puberty? So a 12­year­old20 female can marry. Would a State ­­ would another State21 be obligated to recognize that marriage?22 MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER: I ­­ I think23 probably not. But the State would have, in that24 instance, a sufficiently important interest in25 protecting the true consent of the married person.81 And ­­ and most States don't recognize minors' ability2 to consent, certainly not to something that is as3 important as marriage.4 But what we see, in fact, is that, quite in5 contrast to the non­recognition laws at issue here, the6 States do recognize the marriages of person who, by age,7 would not have been able to marry within their own8 States.9 That is the long­standing practice of all of10 the States, precisely because of the abomination, as it11 was referred to in the old treatises, of the notion that12 a ­­ persons could have a different marital state in13 some jurisdictions than others.14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Sir, how about the15 consanguinity situation? Virtually all states would16 recognize cousins through marriage getting married, but17 there's at least one State that doesn't; right?18 MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:20 State is ­­21 MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:22 the ­­ that the constitutional test is the one that the23 Court set forth in the Zablocki, which is does the State24 have a sufficiently important interest not to recognize25 it? And certainly in the case of incest, the State does￼     Well, I ­­Are you saying that thatI think that9￼1 have a sufficiently important interest.2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This is not incest.3 They're not biologically tied.4 MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER: Well, the States5 that I'm aware of that have the rules against cousin6 marriage do so under their incest statutes, and they7 simply define incest in a broad way that would encompass8 cousins to marry.9 At some point, certainly the familial10 relationship is too extenuated that I don't think the11 State would have a sufficiently important justification.12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But Justice Alito's13 question points out, the assumption of his hypothetical14 is ­­ and ­­ and of the way these cases are presented,15 is that the State does have a sufficient interest so16 that you need not allow the marriages in those ­­ in17 that State.18 So there is a sufficient interest, under our19 arguendo assumption here, to ­­ to say that this is not20 a fundamental right. But then suddenly, if you're out21 of State it's different. Why ­­ why should the State22 have to yield?23 MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER: Well, at the very24 least, you would have to analyze differently the25 interest that the State might assert for not allowing10￼1 couples to enter marriage versus the ­­ the interest2 that they assert as related to a couple who is already3 married.4 For example, Kentucky has asserted that its5 interest in only permitting opposite­sex couples to6 marry is to increase the birthrate. Well, now apply7 that theory to same­sex couples who are already married.8 They are already married in the States where they were9 married. They are already married in half the States in10 the country.11 Kentucky would have the Court believe that12 it is a sufficiently important interest to have that13 couple disregard their existing marriage vows and14 obligations to each other to marry someone else in15 Kentucky in order to procreate biologically even though16 the couple may already have children together. That, I17 would dare say, is not a rational justification, much18 less a sufficiently important one.19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think ­­ I think20 what Kentucky is saying is that the long­term effects of21 having same­sex couples in Kentucky will be, which22 you ­­ you didn't agree with, but what ­­ what counsel23 for Respondent argued in the prior case, will be a ­­ a24 reduction in ­­ in ­­ in heterosexual marriages and a ­­25 a reduction in the number of children born to those11￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425marriages. I mean, that ­­MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER: Your Honor, thisCourt has rejected that type of speculation as a basisfor drawing these distinctions before as it did inLoving.      The State in Loving argued that it was toosoon to know what the effect of interracial marriageswould be and what the stigma would be on their childrenif not the biological ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: But we will not have rejected it if we come out the way this question presented assumes we have come out.MR. HALLWARD­DREIMEIER: Well, the State ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Mainly, saying that it's okay for a State not to permit same­sex marriage.MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER: The State asserts that it has an interest in the ­­ the stability that marriage provides for children. That interest does not justify extinguishing marriages that already exist.JUSTICE GINSBURG: May we clear this one thing. If the Petitioner prevails in the first case, then the argument is moot; right?MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER: That's ­­ that's absolutely right, Your Honor.JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you are supposing a7 State that allows it, and then comes8 again?9 MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:right back homeNo, Your Honor.  I121 situation where the Plaintiffs do not prevail, and so a2 State can retain its ban on same­sex marriage.3 The question is has ­­ does it have to4 recognize marriage from out of State? Would it make any5 difference if the couple came from the State where there6 is a ban on same­sex marriage, goes to a neighboring￼10 don't think that there would be such11 And, in fact, none of these four States draws that kind12 of line that Your Honor presupposes. And that's one of13 the points that's so important here, is that as the14 Court observed with respect to DOMA in Windsor, the15 nonrecognition laws here are a stark departure from the16 State's traditional practice of recognizing out­of­state17 marriages even though they could not have been18 celebrated within the State. It's precisely that19 circumstance where the laws diverge that the issue20 arises.21 And the ­­ the three States that have this22 issue, Tennessee, Ohio, and Kentucky, are, between them,23 able to identify only 5 instances in which they did not24 recognize a marriage that was valid outside the State,25 even though it could not have been celebrated inside.a distinction.131 And those instances are incest, which we think the State2 would have sufficiently important justification not to3 recognize, miscegenation laws, not a precedent on which4 I think the Court would want to rely in this instance,5 or other interests that I think probably would not6 survive today, such as the ­­ the rule against allowing7 a divorced person to remarry.8 So they're ­­ and ­­ and more importantly,9 the most recent of those cases is from 1970. So the10 rule that the States cite about their ability to11 disregard, to effectively dissolve marriages that12 already exist, around which people have already begun to13 build their lives, is less applied than the Federal14 government's own authority to define the ­­15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. But, again, I16 think you're avoiding the presumption on which we're17 starting, on the assumption, which is that the State's18 policy for same ­­ supporting same­sex marriage is19 sufficiently strong, that they are ­­ they can, as a20 matter of public policy, prohibit that in their own21 State. And yet you're saying it's somehow so much22 weaker when you're talking about marriages from other23 States.24 MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER: I ­­ I think there25 are a couple of points that I'd like to make in order to￼16 consideration. And that's ­­17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:18 MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:19 here.It certainly ­­ ­­ what we have141 distinguish this situation from the ­­ the question in2 the first case.3 In the first case, it was very significant4 that Respondents' counsel was emphasizing that he5 thought it was merely rational basis scrutiny that would6 apply. But that was to the question of whether people7 should be allowed to marry in the first instance.8 Our Petitioners on Question 2 are already9 married. We know from Windsor, because the Court held,10 that once married, a couple has a constitutionally11 protected liberty interest in their marriage.12 We also know from Windsor that where a ­­ a13 sovereign disregards that marriage in a way that would14 be extraordinary and out of character with tradition,15 that that requires, at the very least, careful￼20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:21 undermines the State interest that we would, assuming22 arguendo, have recognized in the first case, to say that23 they must welcome in their borders people who have been24 married elsewhere. It'd simply be a matter of time25 until they would, in effect, be recognizing that withinIt certainly15￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the State.MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER: Well ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because we live in avery mobile society, and people move all the time.MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER: And ­­ and ­­ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, itwould kind of ­­ it ­­ one State would basically set thepolicy for the entire nation.MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER: Well, of course, there would be many fewer such couples raising children within their borders than heterosexual couples who are raising children who are not biologically linked to them.      I have to say that I think that thearguments that the State has made are so over andunderinclusive at the same time, that they leave the ­­the feeling that it can only be pretext.  And we knowthat that's true, because the State not only can't drawthe lines that they are purporting to, they don't drawthe lines that they're ­­ would suggest, and they wouldnever draw the lines that they afford to ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Wait. I ­­ I've lost you there. What ­­ what lines are you talking about?MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER: A line, for      MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:never done that.

At the present time, what is the next11 most dramatic variation in the marriage laws of the12 States?13 MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER: It probably is age.14 JUSTICE ALITO: And what is the ­­ what ­­15 what's the range?16 MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER: The ­­ the ­­ I17 think it goes from 13 to 18. And ­­ but ­­ but as I18 said before, the tradition of the States ­­ the issue19 does not come up that much, but the tradition of the20 States is to recognize a marriage that was entered into21 by someone of an age that could not have been entered22 within the State, because of the nature of the marriage23 once it's established, recognizing that the fundamental24 nature of that relationship is not one that the State25 should put asunder.191 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I thought you answered2 me earlier that a State could refuse to recognize a3 marriage in ­­ contracted in another State where the4 minimum age was puberty.5 MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER: Well, they ­­ they6 could, and I do believe that if, in the individual case,7 it was shown that it was because of lack of consent,8 the ­­ the State could decide not to recognize the9 marriage. But with respect to the categorical nature ­­10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It would have to be11 shown, I think, the presumption would be in such a12 State that someone age 13 can't consent.13 MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER: The age 13, I think14 probably you're right, but if it is a matter of 1515 instead of 16, that the courts probably would recognize16 it, especially if, in reliance on their marriage, the ­­17 the couple had already conceived of a child, it would do18 no one any good to destroy that marriage and the stable19 environment that it might provide for the children, just20 as it does no one any good ­­ it certainly doesn't21 advance the interests of the children of opposite­sex22 couples to destroy the marriages that provide stability23 to the children of same­sex couples who are already24 married under the laws of other States.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think your ­­ your￼      MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:so at ­­ at all, Your Honor.  And ­­ and I think thatwhat's ­­ what's essential and common between us is thatwe recognize that the marriage that our Petitioners haveentered into is a marriage.

Theargument that was presented against them is, you can'tdo this, we've never done this before, recognizedsame­sex marriage.      And now you're saying, well, they can't notrecognize same­sex marriages because they've never notrecognized marriages before that were lawfully performedin other States.      MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER:      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:one or the other if you win. Well, what ­­You've got to decide211 States do not have to recognize same­sex marriage as a2 marriage.3 So assuming you've lost on that, I don't see4 how your argument gets ­­ you can't say that they are5 not treating the marriage as a marriage when they don't6 have to do that in the first place.7 MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER: Well, I ­­ I think8 that that actually highlights one of the problems of9 trying to decide the ­­ the two cases differently,10 because, of course, deciding against Petitioners on11 Question 1, even if the Court decides in favor of12 Petitioners on Question 2, would forever relegate those13 marriages to second class status and would raise all14 kinds of questions whether those marriages could be15 subjected to laws that are not quite so favorable as16 opposite ­­17 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're rearguing Question 118 now?

In 2009, they adopted two children.14 Now, in reliance on the protection that is afforded by15 marriage, Mr. Espejo was willing to give up his job to16 become the primary caregiver of their children.17 Mr. Mansell is the primary breadwinner. His job in an18 international law firm was transferred from California19 to Tennessee, and the cost of that transfer for that job20 for them was the destruction of their family21 relationships, all that they had relied on in building22 their lives together.23 And in support of that, the States offer24 exactly nothing. There is no reason that the State25 needs to disregard that marriage. No reason the State23 1 needs to destroy the reliance that Mr. Espejo has had in￼2 giving up his career to look3 are doing everything ­­4 JUSTICE SCALIA:5 would have been the argument6 first question; namely, that7 marriages erodes, erodes the8 regarding heterosexual marriages.9 MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER: As I say ­­ as I10 say before, Your Honor, I ­­ I don't think that that11 holds up because opposite­sex couples who have no12 children, who may be beyond childbearing years, when13 they move into these States, their marriages are14 entitled to respect, and yet they are situated precisely15 as our Petitioners are. Our couples, likewise, have16 marriages. They may not be able to procreate17 biologically together, but they are able to procreate18 through assisted means, through adoption. They bring19 children into their families just as opposite­sex20 couples do. And when, in reliance on their own State21 where they live, they move into these States, that22 marriage is destroyed.23 This Court relied on Federalism, the24 vertical kind, in Windsor to identify something that was25 highly unusual. In this case, it's horizontalafter their children.  TheyIt would have been ­­ itmade with respect to thethe existence of same­sex­­ the feeling of society24￼1 Federalism, I think, that identifies something that's2 highly unusual. As part of a Federal form of government3 in which the States are equal, the States have ceded4 some form of their authority. And one is to ­­ to5 recognize that when another State creates an enduring6 relationship, encourages people to, in reliance on the7 protections the law affords, to establish families, that8 it is not that other States are simply free to disregard9 that which those States have created.10 In the corporate context, once a corporation11 is established under the laws of one State, that12 corporation exists in all other States. Certainly, the13 families that our Petitioners have established are14 entitled to at least that same respect.15 I think that, Your Honor, it is quite16 interesting to note that in the first argument, Michigan17 was forced to argue some positions that I think are18 quite astonishing, that the State could limit marriage19 to couples who are capable of procreation without20 assistance or indeed, that it could abolish marriage21 altogether.22 It's our clients who take marriage23 seriously. They took vows to each other and bought into24 an institution that, indeed, as this Court has said,25 predates the Bill of Rights, that is the most important25￼1 and fundamental in their lives, and the State should2 offer something more than mere pretext as ground to3 destroy it.4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The State's rationale is5 we ­­ we treat outsiders the same way we treat insiders.6 MR. HALLWARD­DRIEMEIER: Well, thank you,7 Your Honor. They ­­ they certainly have offered that,8 but what the State ignores is that these so­called9 outsiders are already married. The State, it's true,10 says, well, we have same­sex couples in our State, and11 we don't allow them to marry, so we're going to ­­ to12 treat you the same way.13 Well, they ignore that our clients have14 already formed those relationships, and I think that it15 would be, in terms of the interests that distinguish16 between the two questions, it's ­­ it's helpful to think17 again, perhaps, about heterosexual couples. We don't18 think that a State could limit marriage to only those19 couples who are capable of procreation. We don't think20 it could preclude marriage by women who are 55, but it21 would be quite a different and distinct constitutional22 violation for the State to dissolve the marriages of23 opposite­sex couples when the woman reaches 55.24 I don't think that that's constitutionally25 permissible. The States don't do that and, of course,26￼1 they never would do that, because the essential2 protection against arbitrary laws is that the majority3 has to live under the same laws that they would subject4 the minority to. And there is no chance that the5 majority would subject themselves to such a law as that.6 I'd like to reserve the remainder of my7 time.8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.9 Mr. Whalen.10 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH F. WHALEN11 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS ON QUESTION 212 MR. WHALEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it13 please the Court:14 The Fourteenth Amendment does not require15 States with traditional marriage laws to recognize16 marriages from other States between two persons of the17 same sex.18 JUSTICE SCALIA: What about Article IV? I'm19 so glad to be able to quote a portion of the20 Constitution that actually seems to be relevant. "Full21 faith and credit shall be given in each State to the22 public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every23 other State." Now, why doesn't that apply?24 MR. WHALEN: Your Honor, this Court's cases25 have made clear that the Court draws a distinction      MR. WHALEN:Your Honor.      JUSTICE SCALIA:      MR. WHALEN:that's ­­ that's essentially right.  There has beenunder the jurisprudence with regard to AllstateInsurance and Alaska Packers and so forth thatthere's ­­ there's a minimal due process requirement todecline to apply another State's substantive law.JUSTICE SCALIA: We ­­ we can say the only marriages we acknowledge in ­­ in New York are marriagesThat's essentially correct,    Really?Under this Court's decisions,27￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425between judgments between States and the laws of eachState.  And the reason in part that the Court'sdecisions have said that is that otherwise, each Statewould be able to essentially legislate for every otherState.JUSTICE SCALIA: Public acts? It would include the act of marrying people, I assume.MR. WHALEN: My understanding of this Court's decisions as the reference in the Constitution to public acts is that each State's laws.JUSTICE SCALIA: So there ­­ there's nothing in the Constitution that requires a State to acknowledge even those marriages in other States that ­­ that are the same.                         If I'm understanding your ­­ ifI'm understanding your question correctly.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What case is that?

I might as well getanother one.      (Laughter.)JUSTICE BREYER: What ­­ what is the case that holds that the State of New York has the right to recognize only marriages made in New York? And when ­­ if you’re married in Virginia, New York has the constitutional right to say, we treat you as if you weren't married, whoever you are.MR.

I don't ­­ JUSTICE SCALIA: New York can say the onlymarriages we acknowledge in New York are those marriagesthat have been made under the laws of New York.MR. WHALEN:JUSTICE SCALIA:MR.

I mean, you canget married to your own wife, et cetera, but you can'tmarry two other people, but the District of Columbia hasthe opposite law.  So if I marry two people inWashington D.C. and they happen to move to New York, youare saying that New York doesn't have to recognize thatmarriage because it doesn't comport with the marriage ofNew York; is that your point?MR. WHALEN: Yes, Your Honor. I think that's ­­JUSTICE BREYER: And then what case says29￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425whether New York could decline to recognize anout­of­state marriage that did not comport with NewYork's law.JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not what I said.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because it is clear that if the law of the two States is the same, that was used against Fedder, that the State cannot say we won't apply the other State's law, even though it's the same as our own.30￼1 that? I think there are a few people going to get2 nervous about this.3 (Laughter.)4 MR. WHALEN: My ­­ my answer is based on5 essentially this Court's decision in Nevada v. Hall,6 because the State's own law sets its own policy and the7 other State's law would be in conflict with that State's8 policy.9 JUSTICE BREYER: But here the policy would10 be we distrust Federal judges from outside the State.11 And even that, they would get away with, in your view,12 because I'm next going to ask, and what is the13 difference between that kind of policy and the policy14 that says, well, we don't recognize the gay couple's15 marriage for the reason that we fear that if gay couples16 get married, even if they have children and adopt them,17 and even if we allow people who are not gay to get18 married and they don't have children, despite all that,19 this policy, which I've had a little trouble20 understanding, warrants not recognizing it? Did you21 follow that question? It was a little complicated.22 MR. WHALEN: I ­­ I probably did not, but23 I'm going to try to answer. I ­­ I think the underlying24 focus is not just that there's a policy, but that25 there's a legitimate policy. And as this Court's10111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SCALIA: But none of this has anything to do with Article IV, right? None of this has anything to do with Article IV?

So ­­ 89JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you don't see ­­3 MR. WHALEN:4 JUSTICE GINSBURG:5 distinction.6 MR. WHALEN:7 so, in ­­ in essence, by deciding whether or not to8 recognize another State's marriage, the ­­ the State is9 deciding whether or not to recognize the other State's10 law under which that marriage was performed.11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. You don't12 see a fundamental difference between creating a marriage13 and recognizing a marriage? You don't think there's any14 difference in terms of the rights of people? If States15 regularly don't say that the prerequisites to marriage16 in our State are not necessarily against public17 policy ­­ and they have said it for age differences,18 they have said it for a lot of things, why ­­ why would19 the gay marriage issue be so fundamental that that can20 lead them to exclude a whole category of people from21 recognition?22 MR. WHALEN: It goes, Your Honor, to the23 essence of what I think, in fact, both ­­ both questions24 before the Court today get at. And that is that ­­ the25 fundamental notion of what marriage is. And ­­ and let­­ full faith and creditYes, Your Honor.      That ­­ that's theYes, Your Honor.  And ­­ and32￼1 JUSTICE GINSBURG:2 has never been interpreted to apply to choice of law.331 me answer the question, if I could, in this way. The ­­2 the comparison between how States have operated with3 regard to recognizing or not recognizing marriages4 before, in other words, before there was any idea of5 same­sex marriage, can't be compared at all to how6 States are responding across the board with regard to7 the phenomenon of same­sex marriage.8 And here's the reason: commentators have9 observed that when all States are on the same page about10 what marriage is, that's where the place of celebration11 rule evolved from, that every State had the same12 definition. Every State shared the same interest, and13 so there was a liberal policy of recognizing marriages14 from one State to the other because ­­￼15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:16 JUSTICE SCALIA:17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:18 laws?19 MR. WHALEN:20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:21 decrees are closer to laws than they are to judgments?22 MR. WHALEN: I do ­­23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I mean, you need to get24 a judgment to divorce. And I think that, in my mind,25 that makes the decree much closer to a judgment than it   You think marriage ­­That's just not ­­   ­­ decrees are closer toI'm sorry?       You think marriage34￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425does to a law.MR. WHALEN: I ­­ I think that the ­­ theperforming of a marriage is closer to law is because, inessence, when the marriage is performed, all the rightsthat flow from that State's laws evolve to that couple.And it's different than judgments and so does notdeserve the same kind of treatment that judgments would,under the full faith and credit jurisprudence, becauseof the reason that this Court has drawn that distinction.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what is an order under the Constitution, or ­­MR. WHALEN: I ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ act under the Constitution that's not a judgment?MR. WHALEN: I didn't catch the first part of your question, Your Honor.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you separate out the terms that Justice Scalia gave you? They're not all judgments.MR. WHALEN: No. I ­­ I ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Three different terms were used, or four different terms were used.MR.

And marriages have always been treated as a conflict of law matter throughout all the years ­­ in fact, it ­­ it gives rise to the entire conflict of law doctrine on ­­ on which Petitioners rely here, which is Joseph Story's Commentaries ­­ Commentaries on the Conflict of Laws.JUSTICE ALITO: This second ­­     CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Outside of the presentcontroversy, when was the last time Tennessee declined torecognize a marriage from out of state?MR. WHALEN: Any marriage, Your Honor? CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Any marriage. MR. WHALEN: 1970 is the last one that Icould point to. That involved a stepfather and stepdaughter.     I would ­­ I would hasten to add, though,because of where ­­ what I was starting to describe withregard to how we got to this point, while ­­ whileStates were all playing along under the same definitionof marriage, what they confronted in an unprecedentedfashion was some States changing the rules of the game,35￼1 if I can extend the metaphor, and so ­­2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but they3 weren't playing along with the same definition. There4 have always been distinctions based on age and family5 relationship. So they weren't playing along under the6 same definition. And still, despite that, it apparently7 is quite rare for a State not to recognize an8 out­of­state marriage.9 MR. WHALEN:         It ­­ it was and is quite rare,talking about what marriage is, so longabout the fundamental man and woman10 so long as we're11 as we're talking12 marriage. And that ­­ and that's my point, is that as13 soon as States were confronted with the reality that14 some States were going to redefine marriage or expand15 the definition of marriage to include same­sex couples16 for the first time, then it's unsurprising that they17 would determine, in keeping with their own laws, that18 they would not recognize those other States' marriages19 in ­­ in Tennessee.20 JUSTICE ALITO: This second question puts21 both you and Mr. Hallward­Driemeier in a very unusual22 situation, because, first of all, we have to assume that23 this first question has been decided against the24 Petitioner, or we wouldn't get to the second question.25 So we have to assume that we would hold that36￼371 a State has a sufficient reason for limiting marriage to2 opposite­sex couples. And Mr. Hallward­Driemeier3 acknowledged that a State could refuse to recognize an4 out­of­state marriage if it has a very strong public5 policy against that marriage, if it's a polygamous6 marriage, if it's a ­­ a marriage of very young7 individuals.8 So the question is whether there could be9 something in between. So there ­­ there's a ­­ a10 sufficient reason to ­­ for the State to say, we're not11 going to grant these licenses ourselves, but not a12 strong enough reason for us not to recognize a marriage13 performed out of state. I suppose that's possible,14 isn't it?15 MR. WHALEN: Well, let me answer it this16 way, and hopefully I'll ­­ I'm answering your question17 in doing so. Let me be clear. The ­­ the18 justifications that have grown over time and the19 requirement for a strong public policy reason to decline20 to recognize a marriage have grown up around the21 man­woman definition.22 Our position is that so long as we're23 talking about a marriage from another State that is not24 the man­woman definition, that it is simply the State's25 interest in maintaining a cohesive and a coherent￼                                 The prerequisites arealways a State's judgment about marriage, about whatshould be a recognized marriage.MR. WHALEN:JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:MR. WHALEN:But, Your Honor, the ­­ the ­­       They make exceptions.                          ­­ the difference here, Ithink, is ­­ is the ­­ the landscape that we find38￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425internal State policy with regard to marriage thatjustifies not recognizing those marriages.     Otherwise, as ­­ as the question that wasput earlier indicated, any resident of the State couldgo to another State, get married, come back and demandto have their ­­ their marriage recognized.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That happens already. People who are not permitted to be married in a lot of States go and do that, and they come back to their home States, and the home States follow the rule of marriage celebration.MR. WHALEN: And ­­ and, again, we're talking about the fundamental distinction between marriage as the States see it, the traditional definition, and the same­sex marriages that other States have ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:MR. WHALEN:JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:       Well, they have ­­­­ have adopted.39￼1 ourselves in. Tennessee, Ohio, Kentucky, and other2 States with a traditional definition of marriage have3 done nothing here but stand pat. They have maintained4 the status quo. And yet other States have made the5 decision, and it certainly is their right and6 prerogative to do so, to expand the definition, to7 redefine the definition, and then to suggest that other8 States that have done nothing but stand pat now must9 recognize those marriages imposes a substantial burden10 on the State's ability to self­govern.11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It is ­­ it is odd, isn't12 it, that a divorce does become the decree for the13 nation? A divorce with proper jurisdiction in one State14 must be recognized by every other State, but not the act15 of marriage.16 MR. WHALEN: I ­­ I understand the point,17 Your Honor, and, again, I think it falls within the18 Court's recognition of a distinction between judgments19 and laws. And here I think we're dealing only with20 laws, and, again, it would allow one State initially ­­21 literally one State, and now, a minority of States to22 legislate fundamental State concern about marriage for23 every other State quite literally. That's ­­ that's an24 enormous imposition and an intrusion upon the State's25 ability to decide for itself important public policy401 questions and to maintain ­­ particularly when you're2 talking about recognition. There ­­ there is an impact3 that occurs when one State is asked to recognize another4 State's same­sex marriage because of the fact that its5 entire domestic relations policy has been built around￼6 the expectation and the7 man­woman relationship.8 recognized and observed9 of the State's ability to regulate domestic relations.10 And to give you one concrete example that11 is ­­ that it comes up in this case itself. One of the12 incidents of marriage is the child ­­ the presumption of13 parentage that comes with a marriage. And for the State14 to be required to recognize another State's marriage15 where there is a child of that marriage in a same­sex16 situation would fundamentally alter the State's17 definition of parentage, which I can tell you ­­18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I don't19 understand your argument. I understand your argument20 that it's a fundamental public policy question about21 whether you're going to recognize same­sex marriage or22 not. But I don't see the difficulty in following the23 consequences of that under domestic relations law as24 treating a couple as married. And it ­­ and so the25 first question is a big step, but after that, it seemspresumption that there is a  That ­­ in Windsor, this Courtthat marriage is the foundation411 to me that the question of how you apply the domestic2 relations law is pretty straightforward.3 MR. WHALEN: Well, it ­­ that's part of the4 reason why I wanted to mention this in particular5 because a large part of the Petitioners' focus has been6 on the impact on the children that are involved.7 And ­­ and I think it's important for the Court to8 recognize that in many States ­­ and I can tell you in9 Tennessee that the definition of parent has always been10 biologically­based. That marital presumption of11 parentage has its foundation in biology. It has its12 foundation in the man­woman relationship.13 So when and if a State were required to14 recognize a same­sex marriage and so therefore, change15 the pronouns and change the terminology to apply ­­16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Oh, but you do that for17 adoptions. What's ­­ what's the problem?￼18 MR. WHALEN:19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:20 big deal?21 MR. WHALEN:22 Honor, because you are changing the way the State23 defines a parent.

They moved there, and3 Dr. Tanco has given birth to their daughter in4 Tennessee.5 Now, as a result of the nonrecognition laws,6 when, as occurred last week, their daughter is7 hospitalized, Tennessee would treat Dr. Jesty not as8 mom, but as a legal stranger with no right to visit her9 child, no right to make medical decisions for her.10 These laws have real import for real people.11 And although, I think that counsel was suggesting that12 Federalism and allowing States to make different laws,13 if you choose to get married in your State, just don't14 move to ours. That's the cost of Federalism.15 Well, Sergeant Dekoe and his husband,16 Mr. Kostura, didn't have a choice. The United States17 Army moved them to Tennessee, and given the location of18 Army bases in this country, it's almost a certainty that19 anyone serving in the Army for any length of time will20 be stationed at some point in a State that would21 dissolve their marriage as a matter of State law.22 I want to get back, Justice Sotomayor, to23 your comment about categorical and how unprecedented it24 is, because even in the age of anti­miscegenation laws,25 the States would give effect, for some purposes,￼47￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425interracial marriages such as for purposes of estate,giving out the ­­ the proceeds after a death or ­­ orotherwise.Here, however, the State statutes providethat a marriage shall be given no effect for any reason. Even Jim Obergefell's husband's death certificate will not reflect the fact that he was married or the name of his husband. The State has no legitimate interest for denying them the dignity of that last fact regarding his life.The real import of the State's argument is,I believe, this: That even when same­sex couples are married, they are not, in their view, married for constitutional purposes; that the States can discriminate against these marriages even in ways that the Constitution would not permit the States to disregard the marriages of opposite­sex couples.     I urge the Court not to enshrine in ourConstitution a second­class status of these Petitioners'marriages.Thank you very much.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Case is submitted.(Whereupon, at 12:29 p.m., the case in theabove­entitled matter was submitted.)Page 48￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼A ability 8:1 13:1039:10,25 40:9 able 8:7 12:23 16:223:16,17 26:1927:4 31:15
