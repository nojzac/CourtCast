The Coca­Cola Company.      Mr. Waxman?      ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMANON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      The Lanham Act provides a remedy forbusinesses whose market is misappropriated bycompetitors that misrepresent the character of the goodsthey sell.  This case presents an egregious violation ofthe law.  Coca­Cola's label grossly misleads  consumers ,as Coke anticipated, but Coke says that it need notanswer under the Lanham Act because its label isauthorized by FDA regulations.  The label is not, infact, authorized for reasons we explain and with whichthe United States largely agrees, but even if it wereconsistent with FDA regulations that would not strip POMof its right to prove a willful Lanham Act violation.      Courts are obligated to give full effect toCongressional enactments wherever possible.  HereCongress has never precluded or conditioned enforcement3￼￼1 of the Lanham Act in food labeling cases, and it is2 entirely possible, in fact, entirely easy for Coke to3 comply with both statutory obligations.4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If there is no private5 cause of action to enforce the FDA label standards, only6 the FDA can bring a proceeding to say that an ad7 violates its regulations, how does a Court below,8 without interpreting the regulations, go about deciding9 whether or not a particular ad doesn't comport with the10 regulations and hence would be subject to the Lanham11 Act?12 MR. WAXMAN: Justice ­­13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Maybe that's a better14 question for the SG, but I'm trying to figure out ­­15 MR. WAXMAN: Well, let me take a shot at it16 and, you know, the SG can and Ms. Sullivan can, as well.17 There's no question under ­­ as this Court18 explained in Buckman, that there is no private cause of19 action to enforce provisions of the FDCA. Now, this20 Court in Buckman distinguished Medtronic v. Lohr, which21 provided and held ­­ and did not and save from preemption a22 state law that was­ that imposed parallel requirements, and in23 that instance, and this is not a case involving an24 attempt to enforce parallel requirements under state law25 or any other law. In those circumstances, as the424 JUSTICE KENNEDY:25 question, though.Thank you.     I want you to answer the5￼1 government explains, of course a court is going to be2 required to ascertain what those parallel requirements3 are, and whether they were or weren’t complied with.4 But this is a case involving a different5 statute. Our submission is that it is entirely6 irrelevant whether or not the Coke label, in any7 particular, is consistent with a regulation that8 implements criminal prohibitions by announcing when and9 under what limited circumstances the FDA will forebear10 from exercising its criminal and regulatory penalties.11 Even in that instance, with respect, Your Honor, as this12 Court explained in Wyeth, misbranding provisions are, in13 fact, adjudicated by courts even under the FDCA.14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And so do you concede that15 under the Lanham Act, plaintiff could not challenge16 aspects of the a food label that the FDA said is17 required?18 MR. WAXMAN:19 JUSTICE KENNEDY:20 case.21 MR. WAXMAN:22 Let me just say, not only is that not this23 case because the FDA has never examined ­­Well, Justice Kennedy ­­     I know that's not this￼1 MR. WAXMAN: My answer to the question would2 be, under Wyeth, under this Court's decision in Wyeth,3 the FDCA and the FDA's regulations interpreting it and4 applying it, supply a floor and not a ceiling. And the5 FDA would have no authority ­­ if the FDA said, This6 label is fine and you are required to use this label,7 the question would be, does it have the statutory8 authority to essentially create an immunity from9 enforcement of another federal statute that protects a10 different purpose and a different class of victims? The11 answer would be no.12 JUSTICE KAGAN: Justice Kennedy's question,13 I think, was different. He said, suppose that it said14 you are required to use this label and only this label,15 then you would acknowledge that there is an16 impossibility issue; is that right?17 MR. WAXMAN: Yes. Unless, as in Wyeth,18 there was, in fact, some possibility to change the19 label, but if ­­ and I apologize if I didn't understand20 the question. If the FDA said, counterfactually, we've21 examined this label, you are not only permitted to use22 it but you are required to use it, and unlike what we do23 with respect to pharmaceuticals, you are not allowed to24 make any changes. In that instance, there would be an25 irreconcilable conflict and a Court would have to decide6￼1 which of two opposite­facing canons of construction to2 give primacy to, but that would be impossibility.3 JUSTICE KAGAN: Why isn't there a different4 kind of conflict here? Let's just focus on the name,5 which is what the solicitor general says the FDA has6 considered and has specifically permitted. They went7 through this very long and involved process, and they8 decided exactly what kind of names were permitted for9 this kind of product and what were not permitted,10 because they constituted misbranding. And essentially11 the FDA has said, This is what counts as misbranding,12 nothing else counts as misbranding. And now you're13 coming in and under a Lanham Act claim saying, no, the14 FDA is wrong. This is misbranding. That seems ­­ why15 isn't that a problem?16 MR. WAXMAN: Why isn't that a problem?17 JUSTICE KAGAN: Yeah. That the FDA said18 it's not misbranding, you're saying it is misbranding.19 That seems a quite direct conflict as to what the FDA20 says versus what you are alleging under the Lanham Act.21 MR. WAXMAN: So we know that that is not, in22 fact, how the FDA construes its regulation, and we know23 that because just by examining the FDA's own limited24 enforcement history, all the parties have cited the25 Court ­­7￼1 JUSTICE KAGAN:2 let's say that the FDA said3 misbranding, that this name4 regulations, that they did not count as misbranding.5 MR. WAXMAN: So we're challenging the label6 as a whole, which is covered by ­­ under the ­­7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Right. So I understand8 that, you would have some claims about different parts9 of the label. But I'm only asking about your10 claiming as ­­ your claim as to the specific thing that11 the FDA ruled on.12 MR. WAXMAN: Right. And the question is13 whether Congress gave any indication and it would have14 to, in this context where the Lanham Act is an express15 statutory enactment that Congress was well aware of when16 it enacted the Nutrition Labeling Act and, in fact, was17 told, not just by the industry, but by OMB, in18 testimony, that the Lanham Act was being used to police19 misrepresentations of the character of food products,20 you would have to conclude that Congress intended to21 allow the FDA to supply, if you will, the substantive22 rule of decision under a different statute that uses23 different words and ­­ and protects a different class of24 people when ­­ and here again, I think it's an important25 indicator why Congress didn't mean that. The FDA, the8Well, just hypothetically,that this name was notwas fine under their￼1 misbranding provisions of the FDCA are prohibitions.2 They are not permissions. And the rules that the FDA3 has promulgated announce essentially an enforcement4 forbearance. They don't represent a judgment and the5 Federal Register provisions that we've cited that6 accompanied the promulgation of the juice naming7 regulations make this as clear as day. They do not8 represent a pronouncement that for all purposes, for all9 statutes, the name on ­­ the name ascribed to the10 product is okay. In fact, they say although for11 purposes of our forbearance under our government12 enforcement authority, we will allow you to do one or13 the other ­­ and this is 2919 and 2920 of Federal14 Register 58, We warn manufacturers that even compliance15 with this, where there is a small amount of the16 non­predominant juice name has great capacity to mislead17 and we encourage ­­ twice in the rulemaking, we18 encourage manufacturers, nonetheless, to name the juices19 in the product. Under those circumstances, the notion20 that Congress intended this type of regulation to21 preclude a case in which ­­ and these are the facts as22 the Court ­­ as they come to the Court ­­ Coke well knew23 and intentionally designed a label that, in fact,24 grossly misleads consumers to the economic disadvantage25 of the company that, in large part, created the market.9￼1 And the notion that Congress wanted to allow the FDA to2 apply substantive rules of decision in that very3 different inquiry using very different language in a4 different statute, I think, is completely unsupported.5 I mean ­­6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What would be the7 components of the injunctive relief that you would seek?8 Assuming you have a Lanham Act claim, what should Coke9 have done to make its product non­misleading?10 MR. WAXMAN: Well, we have in ­­ in the11 course of our complaint, we didn't specify ­­ I mean,12 the injunction that we would seek is ceasing to use the13 label as it currently exists, and of course ­­14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Without saying what label15 would be lawful?16 MR. WAXMAN: That's correct. It's just as17 in criminal actions under the FDCA and civil actions18 under parallel state laws and actions under the Lanham19 Act, juries aren't required or permitted to give20 prescriptive judgments. All that they may ­­ all they21 do is make a judgment about whether or not on balance,22 there is substantial evidence that to the harm of the23 competitor, a substantial number of consumers are24 misled, and if so, was it willful. And that is no more25 of a problem in this particular case than it is in any10￼1 of these cases, whether they involve food or anything2 else. In Wyeth versus Levine, the plaintiff had all3 sorts of reasons ­­ all sorts of different theories4 about what the warning label should or shouldn't say.5 The jury simply decided that it violated the common law6 of the state of Vermont to use that particular label.7 And the FD ­­ I'm sorry.8 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose the percentage were9 a lot higher. Suppose it was 50 percent pomegranate and10 blueberry.11 MR. WAXMAN: It's hard to see how we12 would have a ­­ it's hard to see how we would have a ­­13 could possibly prevail in a Lanham Act case. I mean, we14 have to come up with ­­ we have to adduce, it's our15 burden, substantial evidence to show that a substantial16 number of competitors ­­ of consumers are not only17 misled, but misled to the detriment of our product. I18 don't think we could establish it. But Coke's argument,19 and for that matter the government's argument, with20 respect to the name itself, would apply if, unlike the21 eyedropper's worth of pomegranate juice that's in the22 half­gallon bottle, there were two microns. I mean,23 this ­­ the question simply is whether a manufacturer24 like Coca­Cola can design something that it knows runs a25 substantial risk, quote, "from a misleading1125 safety.￼1 perspective." And the evidence shows that over a third2 of consumers who look at this label believe that3 pomegranate and blueberry juice, in fact, are the4 majority juices.5 JUSTICE ALITO: What if it were the ­­ what6 if it were the case that there were very small number of7 people who were allergic to one of these ingredients?8 I'm not suggesting it's true. For all I know, it's not.9 But let's say there are a few people who are very10 allergic to pomegranate juice or blueberry juice. And11 so the FDA says, if you put even an eyedropper full of12 that in your blend, you have to put that prominently on13 the bottle so that these people will not inadvertently14 get an allergic reaction. Could you have a Lanham Act15 claim then?16 MR. WAXMAN: Well, of course, pome17 only thing that consumers know is that ­­ from18 label is that there is pomegranate ­­ arguably19 pomegranate juice and blueberry juice in here.20 question would be whether they had to disclose21 label whether there was also .01 percent strawberry22 juice or 99.4 percent apple and grape juice. That's the23 kind of judgment that we want the FDA to make, because24 the purpose of the FDCA is protect public health and12­­ thethe frontSo the on the￼1 What the FDA doesn't do, particularly given2 the criminal nature of its sanctions, is regulate or3 interpret, apply its forbearance authority with an eye4 toward, well, what kinds of things are going to so5 mislead consumers that they think there is going to be a6 substitute in the marketplace where there isn't.7 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what I'm saying is8 suppose it's the case that for 99.999 percent of the9 population, the more pomegranate juice, the better, you10 just can't drink enough of it. The more you drink, the11 healthier you are. But for this tiny percentage of the12 population, it could produce an allergic reaction. And13 so the FDA says, you've got to put that on there even if14 there is just a tincture of pomegranate juice. Could15 you have a Lanham Act claim on the ground for the vast16 majority of your potential customers, they are going to17 be misled, because they want pomegranate juice and they18 are buying this stuff that just has a little bit of it19 in it?20 MR. WAXMAN: Well, I think the vast ­­21 presumably, and we're talking about a hypothetical22 regulation, presumably the FDA would promulgate a23 requirement that, in fact, you must name each of the ­­24 each of the constituent juices in case there is an25 allergy. I mean, we wouldn't have an objection ­­ the13￼1 argument wouldn't be that consumers are misled by that2 fact alone. What's misleading consumers here is they3 have no way on God's green earth of telling that the4 total amount of blueberry and pomegranate juice in this5 product can be dispensed with a single eyedropper. It6 amounts to a teaspoon in a half gallon. And the FDA7 has ­­ the FDA has explained in this case that it has no8 expertise, it has no warrant to interpret or understand9 or apply judgments about what kind of words and symbols10 and the combination thereof, to use the language of the11 Lanham Act, will have a tendency to misrepresent the12 nature or quality of the goods from the perspective of13 the competitor. And that's ­­14 JUSTICE KENNEDY:15 brought this suit under state16 preempted?17 MR. WAXMAN: We think it certainly would not18 be preempted under state law.19 Justice Kennedy, is Section 110660 of the California20 Health and Safety Code, which ­­ the language of which21 is in haec verba with the very first subsection of the22 misbranding statute 343(A), which declares misbranded23 any label which is false in particular ­­ false and24 misleading in any particular. That subsection is not25 even the subject ­­ it's excluded from the limited14Do you agree that if youlaw, it would beThe state law provision,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425preemption provisions of the NLEA.  So it certainlywouldn't be preempted.  There might be an open questionif one of the things that we were challenging in thecourse of that state lawsuit was the name itself, andthe question then would be is this name, in fact,compliant with the FDA regulation?      Now, we've explained in our brief that thereare three reasons why it is not compliant.  And theUnited States agrees that a remand would be appropriatein any case to determine whether it is compliant.  Butgenerally speaking, our state law claim wouldn't bepreempted at all.  Not only is it parallel to themisbranding provision, but the provision that it'sparallel to is not preempted.      Unless the Court has further questions, Iwould like to reserve the balance of my time.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.      Ms. Sherry.    ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY,     FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,       SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTYMS. SHERRY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      If I could start with the naming aspect ofthe case.  Justice Kagan, you are exactly right.  We15￼￼1 have a circumstance here where we have two Federal2 statutes that cover the same subject matter that apply3 functionally the same standard to the same words on the4 same product label.5 Under the FDCA, we have an authoritative6 interpretation of that language by the FDA. 102.33 is a7 regulation that was reached after extensive rule­making8 proceedings over the course of 25 years. The FDA9 considered the exact same question that is being raised10 here. It looked to figure out what an appropriate11 common or usual name was for a juice blend that had a12 small amount of a highly flavorful and expensive juice13 in order to allow consumers to know ­­ in order to14 prevent consumers from being misled as to the juice15 content of that particular product.16 JUSTICE ALITO: What public health benefit17 is served by this regulation? This is what puzzles me18 about it.19 MS. SHERRY: The regulations comes under the20 misbranding provisions of the FDCA. So 343 focuses on21 misbranding. It has a number of subsections, one of22 which gives the FDA authority to establish common or23 usual names of products. And the purpose of that is to24 have some form of standardization so that when a25 consumer goes to a marketplace to purchase a particular16￼1 product, it knows what is going to be in the product.2 And, in fact, that was the purpose of the very3 regulation at issue here, the idea being by allowing4 manufacturers to choose to name their juice product5 based on the juice that flavors the product as opposed6 to based on the juice that is predominant by volume,7 that consumers will come to understand that when a juice8 says pomegranate and blueberry flavored, what it means9 is that the juice is present as10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:11 that ­­ I mean, the argument is12 these flavors. That's their point. And you are taking13 a contrary point, that the flavor doesn't mean what you14 taste, flavor means something else.15 MS. SHERRY: No, no. The point is ­­ and I16 think the argument that Petitioner is making has to do17 with the particular facts of this case. The argument is18 because there is only 0.3 percent of pomegranate juice,19 that it is not actually enough to flavor the beverage.20 And that's a factual question that could be resolved on21 remand. But Petitioner's argument with respect to the22 name would be exactly the same, Justice Alito, if there23 was 10 percent of pomegranate juice in this product or24 there was 15 percent. In Petitioner's view, a Lanham25 Act claim could still go forward in those circumstances17a flavor.Excuse me.  I'm not sureyou can't even taste￼1 because there would be no irreconcilable conflict.2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then, Ms. Sherry, you ­­3 the government is taking the position that it's okay for4 District Courts to determine whether labels, in fact,5 comply or don't comply with FDA regulations?6 MS. SHERRY: Yes.7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:8 don't comply, that's when they can could permit a Lanham9 Act claim?10 MS. SHERRY: That's correct. And let me try11 to explain why I don't think that’s inconsistent with12 the notion of the FDA having exclusive enforcement13 authority with respect to the FDCA. This is still a14 Lanham Act claim. So the only thing that is being15 enforced is the Lanham Act. The FDCA and the FDA16 regulations come up by virtue of the preclusion defense17 that is being raised by Respondents here. And so in the18 course of adjudicating that defense, we agree that19 district courts can look to the FDA regulations to20 determine compliance, of course, by applying all the21 normal rules of deference that would otherwise apply in22 those circumstances. And as my colleague ­­23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do I understand your24 position to be that then if the label is specifically25 authorized, then the Lanham Act is precluded, but if the18And if they decide they￼1 FDCA has just simply failed to forbid it then it's not?2 Is that your distinction you draw.3 MS. SHERRY: I think so. If I could just4 articulate it ­­5 JUSTICE KENNEDY:6 it's very hard to work with.7 MS. SHERRY: And I will try to articulate it8 slightly differently and explain why we don't think it9 is difficult to work with. What we're saying is that if10 the FDA or the FDCA provisions have specifically11 permitted something here, they've specifically permitted12 this type of name in certain circumstances, that that is13 something that should preclude a Lanham Act claim. To14 the extent the FDCA or the FDA has not spoken to the15 particular issue with any degree of specificity, we16 don't see a problem with17 forward, because in that18 guessing any judgment ­­19 JUSTICE GINSBURG:20 to this case, so we have21 pomegranate and blueberry flavored, but you say the22 label is something different from the name and the23 Lanham Act can apply to the label. So what parts of the24 label are you saying are not touched ­­ are not25 preempted by the FDA laws?19Because if it is, I thinkthe Lanham Act claim goingcase you're not really second­      But, Ms. Sherry, applied­­ you said the name is okay,￼1 MS. SHERRY:2 when we say the name, we3 themselves, "pomegranate4 juices." When we talk about the label more generally,5 we mean how those words are presented on the label and6 other aspects of the label.7 And if I could point the Court to the Nestle8 warning letter, it's discussed in a number of the9 different briefs and it's cited at footnote 7 of our10 brief. I think my colleague was going to bring it up11 earlier. I actually think this letter proves the very12 distinction that we're trying to make. What the FDA13 said in that letter was that the juice labels at issue14 there were misleading, not because of the name, but15 because how the words of the name were displayed on the16 label, because the words "orange tangerine," for17 example, were placed next to the picture of an orange,18 because they were in close proximity to "100 percent" ­­19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the label20 just had the name on it, nothing else? Could they still21 sue on the ground that the label was misleading?22 MS. SHERRY: Not unless they are able to23 point to something else on the label that was misleading24 aside from the actual words in the name. The difficulty25 we have with the naming aspect of the Lanham Act claim20We're drawing a distinction ­­mean the actual wordsblueberry flavored blendified10 governing the label? Or11 what I would expect, you12 concerns?13 MS. SHERRY:is it limited solely to the,know, the health and well­beingIt absolutely took into account￼1 here is the arguments that Petitioner is making that2 they should have instead named this "apple grape juice,"3 that they should have instead included the percentage4 declarations, are arguments that the FDA5 specifically considered when it adopted this rule and it6 ultimately objected.7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does the FDA ­­ does8 the FDA take into account purely commercial confusion9 when it issues ­­ when it issued its regulations14 ­­ into account consumer15 with respect to this particular regulation, and the16 commenters were consumers saying that they were17 concerned that they were being misled with respect to18 the juice content.19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What does the FDA20 know about that? I mean, I would understand if it was21 the FTC or something like that, but I don't know that22 the FDA has any expertise in terms of consumer confusion23 apart from any health issues.24 MS. SHERRY: I'm not sure that is right.25 The misbranding provisions, 343(a)(1), speak generally21confusion.  There were comments￼1 about labels that are false or misleading in any2 particular. And in adopting the common or usual name3 here, that is something that the FDA was specifically4 focused on.5 The other point I would make is, in6 the court of appeals in the reply brief at page 23, the7 Petitioner acknowledges and argues that the misleading8 standard for the Lanham Act and for the FDCA are not9 materially different from one another.10 Another point I would make with respect11 to the regulation ­­12 JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Sherry, you know, there13 is no irreconcilable conflict if we view what the FDA14 has done as just setting a floor. And you talk a lot15 about how, oh, the FDA specifically considered this and16 it decided not to do this. You put a lot of emphasis on17 process.18 And I guess my question to you is, is that19 the way you are saying we should know whether the FDA20 has only set a floor or instead has also set a ceiling,21 that we're supposed to look to the process and figure22 out whether the FDA specifically rejected a more23 extensive proposal, a more aggressive proposal?24 MS. SHERRY: No. I think you look to25 whether or not allowing the claim to go forward would2225 JUSTICE ALITO:You don't think there are a￼1 complement what the agency has done or would actually2 conflict with what the agency has done. And here, we3 think there is a real conflict. We're not talking about4 supplementing the agency's enforcement resources. We're5 talking about supplanting their regulatory judgment in6 the area.7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I guess I don't8 understand that. Why wouldn't it complement? You've9 said here is the floor to make it not misleading, but,10 you know, we are not saying that there are some things11 that, you know, wouldn't mislead a lot of consumers12 anyway, and then the Lanham Act can come in and13 supplement that and really put us in a position where14 nothing is misleading at all.15 MS. SHERRY: Oh, for two reasons. Number16 one, because the agency considered why manufacturers17 would want to actually name their product based on the18 flavor, because consumers actually do care about the19 flavor and they care about the taste. If the product20 had the name "apple grape juice," for example, and it in21 fact tasted like pomegranate blueberry juice, a consumer22 might be very surprised when he came home and had a sip23 of that juice and realized it tasted like something very24 different than what he expected.23￼1 lot of people who buy pomegranate juice because of ­­2 they think it has health benefits and they would be very3 surprised to find when they bring home this bottle4 that's got a big picture of a pomegranate on it and it5 says "pomegranate" on it, that it is ­­ what is it, less6 than one­half of one percent pomegranate juice?7 MS. SHERRY:8 JUSTICE ALITO:9 would mislead consumers?10 MS. SHERRY:11 reasonable argument that12 to the second part of my13 talking all about the naming part of the claim at issue14 here. We agree with Petitioners that the remainder of15 the Lanham Act claim shouldn't be allowed to proceed,16 that it is complementary. We agree with Petitioners17 that the Ninth Circuit decision here adopted an overly18 broad understanding of preclusion.19 Now respondent suggests it doesn't defend the20 Ninth Circuit's decision here in footnote 5 of their21 brief, but it's a little bit hard to see what daylight22 there actually is between the Ninth Circuit's23 approach and that of Respondent. Respondent relies on24 the express preemption clause here, but the express25 preemption clause applies only to State or local law.24And I think ­­   The FDA didn't think thatI think ­­ I think there is ait may.

SULLIVAN                    not deal just with health.Section 341 makes clear that it also and with respect tothe labeling requirements at issue here, quote,"promotes honesty and fair dealing in the interest ofconsumers."  And here, the most important data we haveabout what Congress did that's barely been mentioned byPOM or the government, is the enactment in 1990 of theNLEA, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act, and itsexpress preemption provision.      Now, Justice Kennedy, our position is thatif POM's suit had been brought as a State law lawsuit,it would be precisely preempted by the terms of thatexpress preemption provision.JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the NLEA provision doesn't preempt all State law claims, only some State law claims.MS. SULLIVAN: That's correct, Justice25￼1 Ginsburg. And it preempts precisely these claims if2 they had been brought As state law claims, because let's3 look at the language of the express preemption4 provision. And To be clear, Coca­Cola's position is very5 narrow. Our position is that were these claims that POM6 is making brought as State law claims, they would be7 expressly preempted, and it cannot be that Congress8 meant to preempt these claims if brought as State law9 claims designed to go above the Federal floor, but10 meant to say never mind ­­11 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, why can't it be? I12 mean, there are plenty of statutes which say you can't13 bring State law or Federal law claims. Congress knows14 how to do that. And instead, it said you can only15 not bring State law claims.16 MS. SULLIVAN: In fact, Justice Kagan, it's17 very rare that Congress actually says no State or18 Federal claims.19 JUSTICE KAGAN: They just say no claims or20 no ­­ notwithstanding any law to the contrary.21 MS. SULLIVAN: Fair enough, Your Honor. But22 you have said in numerous cases in which you have found23 a prior or more general law narrowed by a subsequent or24 more specific law, you have said Congress should not be25 put to the burden every time it enacts a statute of26￼1 looking to the four corners of the U.S. Code and2 figuring out what it might displace. And there is no3 reason ­­4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you have an example,5 Ms. Sullivan, of a case where Congress precluded some6 State claims and said nothing at all about Federal laws7 in which this Court has held that the express preclusion8 of State law claims implicitly precluded Federal claims?9 MS. SULLIVAN: I cannot, Justice Ginsburg,10 though I can cite to you the most relevant and unbroken11 line of court of appeals authority, which are the12 Federal Railroad Safety Act cases. The Federal Railroad13 Safety Act expressly preempted State law negligence14 claims, and the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Circuits have15 held, without a competing circuit, that therefore,16 Federal FELA negligence claims must be deemed to be17 precluded, because otherwise, the national scheme of18 uniformity in Federal railroad safety would be19 undermined. So, too, here.20 And if I could just go back, Justice21 Ginsburg, to make sure I answer the question. The22 passage of the NLEA and its express preemption provision23 in 1990 was all about national uniformity. In fact,24 what Congress aimed at in passing that statute was25 the ­­27￼1 JUSTICE KENNEDY:2 narrow position that national uniformity consists in3 labels that cheat the consumers like this one did?4 MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Kennedy, you have5 perhaps succumbed to Mr. Waxman's attempts to argue his6 jury argument here. We're on a motion to dismiss.7 There is no record. We've put in a brief ­­8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think it's important for9 us to know how the statutes work. And if the statute10 works in the way you say it does and that Coca­Cola11 stands behind this label as being fair to consumers,12 then I think you have a very difficult case to make. I13 think it's relevant for us to ask whether people are14 cheated in buying this product. Because Coca­Cola's15 position is to say even if they are, there's nothing we16 can do about it. Do you still have this ­­ do you still17 have this label?18 MS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Your Honor. It's19 changed in non­material aspects. There is no aspect20 covered by the claims here that has changed.21 But I just want to be very, very clear on22 what POM is arguing here. POM is arguing ­­ and,23 Justice Sotomayor, they are not arguing your24 hypothetical. POM is arguing here that it may challenge25 Coca­Cola's name and label under the Lanham Act even if28Is it part of Coke's￼1 that name and label complies with the FDCA and all the2 relevant implementing regulations. So, Justice Kagan,3 this is exactly your case, where POM said it can say4 misbranded under the Lanham Act, even where Coca­Cola5 has complied with all of the authorizations set forth in6 the FDA.7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But maybe the two acts8 are serving different purposes, Ms. Sullivan. The law9 that you are relying on is supposed to be concerned with10 nutritional information and health claims, not a11 competitor is a competitor losing out because of the12 deception. The consumer is able to buy the Coke product13 much cheaper and the14 consumer thinks that15 buy the cheaper one.16 MS. SULLIVAN:17 me be clear: Safety18 Safety warnings are especially carved out. Justice19 Alito, if there is a worry about allergies; Chief20 Justice Roberts, if there is a worry about health.21 That's not what we're about here. In fact, the NLEA22 especially ­­ expressly in 6(c)(2) carved out safety23 warnings from the preemption clause. We're not talking24 here about safety.25 we're talking here about labeling so that29POM product costs more; thethey are both the same, so they'll      First, Justice Ginsburg, letis not at issue in this case.￼1 consumers have adequate information, at the same time as2 manufacturers are not put to the burdens and3 inefficiencies of having constantly shifting labeling4 standards imposed by juries, which ultimately will cost5 more to the consumer.6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, let's ­­ let's7 assume the following. The FDA just wanted to know what8 the name should be. That's all they are regulating.9 That's the only requirement. And it's not even a10 requirement.11 MS. SULLIVAN: It's an authorization.12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's an authorization.13 And that's where I'm having a little bit of difficulty,14 because it's not that you have to use this name, you're15 permitted to use this name under their regulations. But16 why are you permitted to use it in a misleading way?17 That's really the ­­ I think the government's position,18 which is, if you're using the name in combination with19 other factors in a misleading way that's not a subject20 to the regulation, just the name, then it's actionable21 under the Lanham Act.22 MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Sotomayor and Justice23 Kennedy, I need to make very clear that we believe that24 under the FDCA and the FDA regulations, Coke's label is25 as a matter of law not misleading. And once we reach30￼1 that conclusion under FDCA and FDA, Lanham Act can't2 come in from the side and say, oh, yes, it is, because3 that would undermine the express preemption provision4 that was designed to create national uniformity.5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could the government ­­6 I think what the government is saying nothing about our7 permission goes to the size of the name on the label ­­8 MS. SULLIVAN: Well, Your Honor ­­9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ that you can break up10 the name of the juice into two different sizes so that11 you are deemphasizing it. It also says that the12 vignette is misleading because it shows products that13 have potentially nothing in their regulations say14 anything about vignettes ­­ and how they display them.15 It's ­­ nothing in the regulations talk about using16 purple instead of whatever that color is that the juice17 is, that blue, purple, whatever, instead of the color of18 apple juice. If you use the color of apple juice and19 grapes, it would be a light color.20 MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Sotomayor, there are21 five different attacks that POM has made on our label,22 only two of which were addressed in the lower court.23 And we say that we comply with FDA regulations as to all24 five of them. But more important, compliance doesn't25 matter; what matters is are these of the type covered by31￼1 the provisions of the NLEA preemption provision ­­2 sorry. Are these of a type covered through the NLEA3 preemption provision?4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You basically are5 talking about field preemption.6 MS. SULLIVAN: Absolutely not, Your Honor.7 Let me make absolutely clear we do not argue for field8 preemption. We argue that where the NLEA express9 preemption provision would make POM's claims expressly10 preempted under State law, it follows as a matter of11 inference from the national uniform scheme that Congress12 set up, that Lanham Act claims are precluded to the13 extent and only to the extent the state claims would14 have been preempted under if they were brought as state15 law claims.16 Now, Justice Sotomayor, all five of POM's17 issues here ­­ name, vignette, font size, multiple18 lines, and coloring ­­ name, vignette, font size,19 multiple lines, and coloring ­­ every one of those is of20 the type required by certain enumerated sections in the21 NLEA express preemption provision. And POM wants22 something that is not identical.23 Justice Ginsburg, POM doesn't just want to24 enjoin our label. POM at JA61 said: You should have25 called it apple grape juice, not pomegranate blueberry32￼1 juice.2 JUSTICE GINSBURG:3 clarified that that's not what4 just want to say your label is5 there ­­ what statute or regulation of the FDA says that6 compliance with the permissive regulation of the FDA7 necessarily renders the label non­misleading?8 MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Ginsburg, every9 single aspect of their misleadingness claim is covered10 by specific provisions of the FDCA that have preemptive11 force. Under ­­ I just want you to focus, if on nothing12 else, because my colleagues on the other side haven't13 even mentioned it, on 21 USC 343­1)(a)(2) and (3), the14 express preemption provision. The express preemption15 provision says ­­16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where is that set17 forth in the ­­18 MS. SULLIVAN: It's set forth, Mr. Chief19 Justice, in the red brief addendum at page 5A.20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.21 MS. SULLIVAN: And if you look at the22 express preemption provision, which is notably called23 "National Uniform Nutrition Labeling," Section (2) and24 Section (3) on 5A over to 6A, set forth those portions25 of the FDCA that will and won't have preemptive force.33Well, Mr. Waxmanthey are seeking.  Theymisleading.  And is￼1 We are living in this case entirely within two sections2 that have preemptive force under this statute, and those3 are sections 343(i) and 343(f). "Name" is covered by4 343(i). "Vignette" is covered by 343(i) because, as the5 Federal Register makes clear, name and vignette were6 thought of together.7 "Font size" is covered by 343(f), which goes8 to the presentation of the name and other printed matter9 on the label. "Multiple lines" is covered by 343(f),10 and "coloring" is covered by 343(i)(2).11 JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Sullivan, can I ask ­­12 if this gets you away from the argument you want to13 make, I apologize for that. But suppose we thought that14 the preemption provision here was utterly irrelevant,15 that it applies to state law and not Federal law, and16 that you can't go around broadening the statute just17 because the purposes behind that statute might be18 thought to apply to something else. So suppose I just19 put that aside. Do you still have any kind of argument?20 MS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Your Honor, we still win21 because of your more general approach to preclusion by22 one Federal statute of another, because the FDA23 regulations as to misbranding here are far more24 specific. Let me back up. The statute of the FDCA and25 the regulations promulgated thereunder are more specific347 Act because that's for the8 MS. SULLIVAN:9 position here, Your Honor,FDA.We do ­­ we do not take thatbecause it's not presented­­   I thought that was ­­ I￼1 than the general misrepresentation provisions of the2 Lanham Act.3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you say that even ­­4 I ­­ I take it I'm characterizing your position right.5 You say that even if there's a violation of the FDA6 regulations, they still couldn't sue under the Lanham10 here. We said there might11 JUSTICE KENNEDY:12 thought that was at Page 39 in your brief in a footnote.13 MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Kennedy, let me be14 clear. In this case we believe the Lanham Act claim is15 precluded because POM wants to go above the floor set by16 the FDCA and the FDA reg. POM has said repeatedly in17 this case, right through the reply brief ­­ right18 through its reply brief at Page 17, and I quote, and19 this has been their position the whole time, POM's20 challenge does not depend on the FDCA or FDA's21 regulation.22 Justice Sotomayor, POM is not bringing your23 hypothetical suit where they come in to enforce the FDCA24 and the FDA. Had they done so, we think there might be25 a serious question for you to resolve another day about35￼1 whether that's an end run around 337(a)'s restriction of2 enforcement to the United States and prohibition of3 private lawsuits, but that's not this case.4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I understood them to say5 they were making a Lanham Act challenge. And there is6 no judicial review of the FDA regulations. There's no7 private right of action under the FDA.8 MS. SULLIVAN: Correct, Your Honor.9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So they are not saying,10 We're bringing an action under the FDCA or the NLEA.11 They say, We're bringing a Lanham Act.12 MS. SULLIVAN: Correct, Your Honor.13 But what I'm trying to say here is, to the14 extent their Lanham Act claims seeks to say, as Justice15 Kagan said before, You are misbranded for16 misrepresentations under the Lanham Act, even though17 Coke has not been misbranded and has not made18 misrepresentations under FDCA and the FDA regulations,19 that is a conflict that should be resolved by this Court20 in the usual manner that statutory construction21 conflicts are resolved by making the statutes make sense22 together.23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't know why ­­24 I don't know why it's impossible to have a label that25 fully complies with the FDA regulations and also happens36￼1 to be misleading on the entirely different question of2 commercial competition, consumer confusion that has3 nothing to do with health.4 MS. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, as I said5 before, the FTC in Section 341 as codified expressly6 refers to maintaining honesty for the consumer as well7 as health. But just let me suggest why there is still a8 conflict, and irreconcilable conflict is not the9 touchstone. You have never required irreconcilable10 conflict in ­­ in all the cases we have cited in our11 brief, Fausto and Elgin, Keogh, Romani, Daystar. You've12 never required irreconcilable conflict. You've13 recognized that one federal statute, if more specific,14 may narrow the scope of a more general statute where15 there is a conflict.16 And there is a conflict here, Your Honor.17 Just to be clear, what Congress wanted was national18 uniformity so that a manufacturer could print one label19 and sell in the 50 states and not have its juice legal20 when you leave on the flight in California and21 illegal when you land in D.C. That national uniformity22 bill ­­23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the Lanham ­­ the24 Lanham Act applies nationally.25 MS. SULLIVAN: Correct, Your Honor, but the37￼1 falsity standard ­­2 JUSTICE KENNEDY:3 state preemption and then say we should apply the same4 principles to two federal statutes ­­5 MS. SULLIVAN:6 JUSTICE KENNEDY:7 different point.8 MS. SULLIVAN:9 Justice Kennedy. I'm saying after the NLEA express10 preemption provision, a state cannot say that11 pomegranate­blueberry­flavored blend of five juices ­­12 which is perfectly consistent with the naming13 regulations, as the U.S. agrees. Why is that? Because14 the naming regulations, Justice Sotomayor, said, you can15 name your minority juice, your non­predominant juice in16 either of two ways. You, as a manufacturer, may either17 mention a percentage or ­­18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You want us to ­­ you want19 us to write an opinion that said that Congress enacted a20 statutory scheme because it intended that no matter how21 misleading or how deceptive a label it is, if it passes22 the FDA, it cannot ­­ it ­­ there can be no liability.23 That's what you want us to say?24 MS. SULLIVAN: We do not, Your Honor. We25 would want you to say that what misleading is when it is38So you're ­­ you used aWe do, Your Honor.   ­­ but that's a quiteHere's what I'm saying,￼1 defined by FDA in specific regulations pursuant to a2 specific statute that specifically seeks national3 uniformity, in the sense that the manufacturer picks one4 label and doesn't, as the American Beverage Association5 brief says at Page 7, create a logistical nightmare that6 you have to change your label in response to every jury7 verdict. We're saying that once your ­­8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's suppose there were9 a consumer survey, as there was, but ­­ and ­­ and say10 it was a valid survey. And overwhelmingly, consumers11 said that they are misled, that they thought that they12 were getting pure pomegranate, and they were just13 astonished to find what they were getting was apple14 juice with, what Mr. Waxman told us, a dropper of15 blueberry.16 MS. SULLIVAN: Justice ­­17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose ­­ suppose the18 reality is that consumers are misled.19 MS. SULLIVAN: If I suppose that, Your20 Honor, then the proper procedure for a consumer or a21 competitor is to go to the FDA and seek FDA's change of22 its rulemaking. Your Honor, in the red addendum ­­ red23 brief addendum at Page 17(a) over to 18(a), you'll see24 that in 21 CFR 102.33(d) FDA said, Your juice will not25 be misleading if it uses the word "flavored."391 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      And in fact, over on 18(a), if you want tosee the closest thing to an express authorization of ourlabel here, it's the example that FDA gave on 18(a).  Itsaid, You can use either flavor or a percentage, and itwon't be misleading.  Why?  Because we don't think thatconsumers are quite as unintelligent as POM must thinkthey are.  They know when something is a favored blendof five juices, non­min­ ­­ the non­predominant juicesare just a flavor.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Don't make me feel bad because I thought that this was pomegranate juice.(Laughter.)MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Kennedy ­­ Justice Kennedy, it's pomegranate­blueberry­flavored blend of five juices. I've found that oftentimes ­­ well ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: He sometimes doesn't read closely enough.(Laughter.)MS. SULLIVAN: Yeah, pomegranate­blueberry­flavored blend of five juices. And the key point here ­­      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:with Wyeth?      MS. SULLIVAN:      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:      How do we square this Your Honor ­­      Wyeth, the FDA actually40￼￼1 approves, looks at the label and says, this one is okay.2 Not only is it not misleading, but it complies with all3 health requirements, and because the producers of drugs4 have the ability to change the label without FDA5 approval, there was ­­ we found no preemptions and no6 impossibility.7 How is Wyeth any different? The FDA here ­­8 it's even worse, this case. The FDA doesn't approve the9 labels. It never looks at them and says they are okay10 or not okay unless they decide to enforce the statute.11 How is this better than Wyeth?12 MS. SULLIVAN: Two important distinctions,13 Your Honor, but let me first disagree with the premise.14 It's true that FDA doesn't pre­approve the label, but15 they couldn't have gotten closer here, Justice Kennedy,16 than solving your difficulty by saying that17 ras­cranberry juice, it's okay if you call it18 raspberry­and­cranberry­flavored juice drink. You don't19 have to put the percentages in.20 So this is ­­ it's not a preapproval21 requirement, but these regulations are very specific.22 Justice Sotomayor, Wyeth, as you said, as23 this Court said, did not involve an express preemption24 provision. It is the express preemption provision here25 that says that Congress wanted nationally uniform41￼ 1   labeling regulations whereby a manufacturer could pick 2   one label and stick with it.  This is Guyer, not Wyeth.3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You assume people would 4   pick a label and stick with it.  The Lanham Act would ­­ 5   if a Lanham Act claim is bought, and it's upheld, you 6   change the label nationally.7 MS. SULLIVAN: Oh, but, Your Honor, that's 8   one thing if the FDA decides to adapt its rulemaking. 9   Suppose Justice Ginsberg's consumers or competitors10   showed up and said, Excuse me, we don't think11   ras­cranberry is clear enough.  Justice Kennedy said it12   wasn't.  Please change your rulemaking.13 When the FDA issues guidance or changes its14   rules or issues a new kind of interpretation, that's one15   agency speaking nationally.  What Mr. Waxman wants to do16   is invite plaintiffs to walk into every court in the17   land under Lanham Act claims and create one jury saying,18   I think you should have called it apple­grape juice, and19   another saying you should have had the percentage.20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Sullivan, I would like you to21   respond to this question:  In the real world, the FDA22   has a tremendous amount of things on its plate, and23   labels for juices are not really high on its list.  It24   has very limited resources.  You are asking us to take25   what it has said about juice as blessing this label,42￼1 saying it's not misbranding, when its regulations aren't2 reviewed by the Court, when there is no private right of3 action, and say that that overtakes the Lanham Act.4 It's ­­ it's really very hard to conceive that Congress5 would have done that.6 MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Ginsburg, precisely7 for the reasons you say, you should affirm here and go8 with us in precluding the Lanham Act claims. And the9 reason is that Congress has authorized a very specific10 regulatory regime here. Of course you don't want the11 FDA deciding is pomegranate­blueberry or ras­cranberry12 clear ­­ that's why they gave specific regulations. And13 contrary to what Mr. Waxman said, the FDA does not just14 have criminal jurisdiction. It has adjudicatory15 jurisdiction. It has civil authority. It can issue16 warning letters, which, as the amicus brief of17 Mr. Friedman points out, are very effective.18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the point is that it19 is doubtful that FDA has sufficient resources to police20 food and beverage labeling. I think that was the thrust21 of Justice Ginsburg's question. I had the same concern.22 And this is relevant because we want to see what the23 likely intention of Congress was with reference to these24 two statutes.25 MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Kennedy, the U.S.43￼1 position is unworkable, as you said before. And the2 U.S. hasn't said that they lack sufficient resources.3 What we would respectfully suggest you look at is not4 FDA's latest amicus brief through the U.S., but FDA's5 authoritative statement about whether its labeling6 regulations were being implemented.7 In the red brief at Page 7, we cite to the8 rulemaking in which the FDA found after the three­year9 study ­­ remember the express preemption provision10 couldn't go into force until there was a three­year11 study by the IOM. And if you look at Page 7 of the red12 brief, three­quarters of the way down the page, you'll13 see FDA in its authoritative statement, irrespective of14 its amicus brief here, found that 343(f), the15 presentation regulation, and 343(i), the naming16 regulation, were being adequately implemented.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that's contrary to its18 current position, and I think we have to take it ­­ the19 FDA is ­­ is ­­ the government is representing the20 current FDA position.21 MS. SULLIVAN: But, Your Honor, you don't22 give our deference to an amicus brief when there's an23 authoritative prior statement by FDA that these24 implementation ­­ for the very reason you suggest, the25 FDA has other things to do.44￼1 JUSTICE GINSBURG:2 regard to deference, we don't resurrect the statement3 that they no longer support.4 MS. SULLIVAN: Well, Your Honor, they5 haven't disavowed that statement. We would respectfully6 suggest that just as it's too late for Mr. Waxman to7 change his theory, as you said in Riegel, to a ­­ we're8 enforcing the FDA theory ­­ and he doesn't purport to do9 it here ­­ it's ­­ the FDA, it's too late now to say in10 an amicus brief that they didn't mean it back in 1993.11 JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think, Ms. Sullivan,12 that there are any Lanham suits regarding food labels13 that are allowable?14 MS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Your Honor. Putting15 aside the private enforcement 337(a) problem that16 Justice Sotomayor raised before, we believe that Lanham17 Act suits are not preempted ­­ would not be preempted as18 state law claims, and, therefore, are not precluded as19 Lanham Act claims, if they fall outside the specific20 provisions of FDCA that have preemptive force. So21 343(a) ­­ may I finish, your Honor?22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.23 MS. SULLIVAN: If there is something that is24 not covered ­­ name, vignette, font, multiplized are25 covered.

WAXMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.      I need to correct a few misstatements by mycolleague, Ms. Sullivan.  First of all, this three­yearstudy that she's referring to, as we pointed out in ourbrief, the IOM and the FDA made absolutely clearrepeatedly in that study that they did not look at FDA'senforcement capabilities, its enforcement efforts.  Ithad ­­ it simply was a judgment about whether thespecific forbearance regulations that they promulgated,in fact, adequately accomplished what Congress's46￼￼1 objectives were.2 Number two, we ­­ we are not saying that3 this is a misbranded product. We are not trying to4 enforce the FDCA. And the FD ­­ and the FDA itself has5 made clear, not only in its brief in this case and not6 only in its enforcement action in the Nestle case, but7 in the Federal Register discussion of the juice naming8 regulation, that the fact that the juice may comply ­­9 and here it probably doesn't ­­ may comply with the10 naming convention does not mean that it is misleading.11 The FDA said over and over again in that12 rulemaking that we strongly caution manufacturers that,13 in fact, mere compliance with this does not mean that14 the label is misleading and ­­ and that manufacturers15 are under an obligation to ensure that the label is not16 misleading. Now, as to the question of ­­17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Where ­­ where is that18 statement contained?19 MR. WAXMAN: That is in 58 ­­ the statements20 that I'm quoting are in 58 Federal Register, Pages 2900,21 2919, and 2920.22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Thank you.23 MR. WAXMAN: And also, indeed said,24 nonetheless, we encourage manufacturers to name all of25 the juices in a multiple juice product specifically47￼1 because it was concerned about this.2 Now, Ms. Sullivan says, well, you know, not3 all Lanham Act claims are preempt ­­ precluded. They4 wouldn't be precluded if the parallel cognate state law5 enforcement of an identical standard wouldn't be6 precluded.7 This is ­­ the closest cognate here is8 343(a), which provides that a food is misbranded if it9 is false ­­ if the label is false and ­­ false or10 misleading at any particular. That isn't in this sort11 of Swiss cheese exception ­­ exemption­filled preemption12 provision of the NLEA. That one isn't preempted. There13 is nothing whatsoever that preempts any person from14 going into state court and enforcing a state law15 provision that recites in haec verba 343(a).16 Now, Ms. Sullivan says, okay, we're not17 worried here. The FDA wasn't worried here about health18 or safety. That's not what's going on here.19 That is the point. That is the point. It's20 because there were concerns about health and safety with21 this juice naming regulation that they said, in the22 exercise of our sovereign enforcement authority, we are23 not going to go after you for complying with this naming24 convention, because, as they've explained, we don't know25 anything about how to protect competitors. We don't48￼1 purport to know what is in the competitive marketplace.2 And we aren't about writing regulations3 criminal provisions.4 And Ms. Sullivan is right.5 enforcement mechanisms, but they're all6 juries. We aren't going to go this way7 not our job. It's not our expertise. And yet,8 interesting ­­9 JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Waxman, I take it that10 Ms. Sherry said that the FDA views itself as having a11 job beyond health and safety, that they view themselves12 as at least ­­ not thinking about competitors' welfare or13 lack thereof, but at least thinking about consumer14 understanding of labels.15 So if that's the case, is the determination16 under the Lanham Act different from the determination17 under the FDCA?18 MR. WAXMAN: Very definitely, and for ­­ for19 some of the reasons that this Court discussed in the20 Lexmark case, where you were talking about who can sue21 under the Lanham Act and who's protected. And the Court22 noted that, of course, consumer confusion itself can be23 the engine for a competitive harm.24 But the former is not what the Lanham Act is25 about, and the latter, the FDA has made perfectly clear49under theseThere are civilenforced bybecause this is25 JUSTICE KENNEDY:Any authority that the FDA￼1 is not what the FDCA is about.2 And interestingly, even with respect to this3 naming provision, and, you know, we ­­ the government4 agrees with us far more than it disagrees with us, but5 our disagreement about the preclusive effect of their6 judgment is important.7 You know, they say, okay, we ­­ we spent a8 lot of time on these regulations, and we are entitled to9 chevron deference. And we think they are entitled to10 Chevron deference with respect to interpreting the11 misbranding provisions that they are in fact ­­ that12 they do enforce.13 They're asking as ­­ their submission here14 is not ­­ not ­­ not just in an FDA action, enforcement15 action in court, will we get chevron deference for our16 interpretation of what the meaning of 343(i)(1) is.17 But in a Lanham Act case, we get chevron on18 steroids deference. We get to basically keep you of out19 of court entire ­­ you're not even allowed to make that20 claim.21 That is an astonishing proposition, and it22 is one that there is nothing whatsoever in the23 legislative history, the language of the statute,24 anything at all to indicate that Congress wanted ­­50￼1 interpretation gets deference is presumed to be correct,2 or presumed to be not misleading? Has there ever been3 any scholarship or commentary or cases saying that?4 MR. WAXMAN: Well, certainly not in the5 Lanham Act context. There's been no suggestion that6 they have anything whatsoever to say about the Lanham7 Act. Knowing the professoriate, I'm sure there must be8 some commentary about whether they do or don't get9 chevron deference. But Ms. Sullivan says that they10 don't and the government says that they do. And there11 must be a scholar at least on each side of that12 position, but I simply don't know. I will make one13 final point.14 JUSTICE SCALIA: If there is a Lanham Act15 suit and the regulation is brought forward to prevent16 the suit, cannot the party against whom it's brought17 forward say the regulation is ­­18 MR. WAXMAN: We certainly intend to say that19 if it becomes relevant, absolutely.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: So it's not on steroids21 then. You can still apply ­­22 MR. WAXMAN: Well, I ­­ right. I think that23 it doesn't apply at all. The government would take the24 position that it has preclusive authority.25 Thank you.511 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.
