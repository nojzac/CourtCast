C.O. Churner.          Ms. Winkelman.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF NANCY WINKELMAN               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MS. WINKELMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          This case involves an excessive force actionbrought by a State prisoner under Section 1983 that wasdismissed on the grounds that the prisoner had notexhausted the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's three-tieredprison grievance system.  The case turns on an issue ofstatutory construction, whether when first enacting andthen amending Section 1997e(a), to limit the exhaustionprovisions to, quote, such administrative remedies as are101112131415161718    available.19              Congress intended to require a prisoner, whose20    remedy is one for monetary damages, to address a past-21    completed constitutional violation to exhaust a prison22    grievance system that cannot provide such a remedy.  Of23    course, the backdrop of this case is that there's no24    general exhaustion requirement in Section 1983.  But what25    is key here is that when Congress first enacted the3                                                                                                                                 1    Section 1997e exception in 1980 and then when it amended 2    Section 1997e in 1996, while dramatically strengthening 3    and changing the exhaustion provision in many respects, it 4    retained the key words, such administrative remedies as 5    are available. 6              QUESTION:  But they also took out the words 7    about effective, did they not? 8              MS. WINKELMAN:  That's correct, Your Honor. 9    Congress took out the words plain, speedy and effective in10    1996, along with making exhaustion mandatory rather than11    discretionary, removing the stay provision and a number of12    other changes.  The purpose of taking out plain, speedy13    and effective, though, those words did not drive the14    result that we're seeking here.  They didn't drive the15    inquiry of whether, in fact, the prison grievance system16    could provide the relief.  What those words -- what the17    work that those words did in the prior statute, and this18    is evident from looking at the present statute, which is19    reprinted on page 5A of Respondent's brief.20              QUESTION:  In this case the statute says, no21    action.  It doesn't say particular claim for something.22    It says no action shall be brought until such23    administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.24    Your client, I take it, brought an action and in that25    action, he wanted a transfer of records, a bunch of4                                                                                                                                 1    different things, as well as damages.  So at least as far 2    as this case is concerned, why wasn't there for that 3    action remedies to exhaust, namely all the transfer part, 4    all the other parts? 5              MS. WINKELMAN:  Your Honor, when Mr. Booth 6    brought his claim, it's true that he sought both what we 7    know as injunctive relief and money damages and in fact 8    that was the basis upon which Respondents opposed our 9    petition for writ of certiorari, that this was a mixed10    case.  But the question that we presented was a money11    damages only case and that's the question that's before12 --13              QUESTION:  Just looking at the statute, the14    statute, though, and the statute refers to action and this15    is a mixed action.  And I would think there's a very16    strong argument that whatever you think about somebody who17    runs into court and files a claim only for money damages,18    where a prisoner asks for both, he shouldn't be able to19    bring his money claim in court until after he's exhausted20    his prison remedies in respect to what there is to exhaust21    and there's a lot.22              MS. WINKELMAN:  Actually, Your Honor, the Courts23    of Appeals have taken a different approach.  The Tenth24 Circuit --25              QUESTION:  So that's what I want to know, what's5                                                                                                                                 1    the rationale for allowing a person who has the mixed 2    claim to go to Federal court at all, if he doesn't first 3    go and exhaust what he has to exhaust? 4              MS. WINKELMAN:  The Courts of Appeals haven't 5    explained their reasoning in the decisions, but one 6    possibility would be a practical one, which is if in a 7    mixed claim situation the prisoner has to go back and 8    exhaust both the injunctive and the monetary part, it's 9    likely that their monetary claim -- they would risk10    -- face a high risk of forfeiting their money claim11    because it would be too late to exhaust that through the12    prison grievance system.  Pennsylvania's, for example, is13    five days.  It's 15 days for bringing your initial14    grievance.  So if Mr. Booth's case had been dismissed, he15    would have been out of time, in all likelihood by that16    point, to pursue the money claim through the grievance17    procedure, which is why I think the Courts of Appeals had18    approached the issue and dealt with this problem by19    permitting --20              QUESTION:  I don't follow that if he hadn't come21    to court at all.  If the rule is, if you want more than22    one kind of relief, you must go to the administrator23    within five days, whatever.  So the idea is, I think what24    Justice Breyer was suggesting, that is if you have a mixed25    claim, this -- what you're trying to present, you said,6                                                                                                                                 1    the question we presented is damages only.  You want this 2    Court to treat this case as though there were never any 3    claims, anything else other than money damages and I 4    understand that that's how you would like this case to be 5    treated, but if we take this very case, I am not following 6    your argument that there would be any loss of time and a 7    time bind for the defendant if you must go swiftly to the 8    prison system and name everything. 9              MS. WINKELMAN:  My argument Justice Ginsburg is10    that when he brought his -- he brought his mixed action,11    that is true.  If he had been -- if that action had then12    been dismissed, go back and exhaust because there are13    injunctive claims in here that need to be exhausted, he14    would have been, he would have been time-barred from15    pursuing the money damages claim then in Federal court16    because he had to bring his grievance, under17    Pennsylvania's grievance procedure, within 15 days of the18    incident.  By the time he brings his action in Federal19    court, the Federal court then dismisses.  He's too late.20              QUESTION:  But the point is he should never have21    come to a Federal court.  On the interpretation that22    you've got a mixed claim, don't come to Federal court,23 exhaust.24 25     MS. WINKELMAN:  If our interpretation is right on themoney damages point, and I'd like to go there, if that's7                                                                                             1    right then the approach that the Tenth Circuit took in the 2    Miller case, I think, addresses the concern.  The prisoner 3    brings a mixed claim.  The court allows the money damages 4    aspect of the claim that the Tenth Circuit agrees does not 5    have to be exhausted to go forward, thereby avoiding this 6    problem of the prisoner perhaps losing the money damages 7    claim all together because they could never exhaust the 8    claim.  It's too late. 9              QUESTION:  May I ask you about that?  Is it your10    position, let's say, it was, you were seeking nothing but11    money, that it is not required even to take the first12    step.  Here there were three steps in the grievance13    procedure, the first was taken.  There was an14    administrative complaint filed.15              MS. WINKELMAN:  That's correct, Your Honor.16              QUESTION:  But then the prisoner said, I'm not17    going to go on to steps two and three.  But I take your18    argument to be, if you want money, you don't even have to19    take step one.  You can go directly to court.  You don't20    have to complain within the prison system at all.21              MS. WINKELMAN:  It's not exactly if you want22    money.  It's if what you are seeking and the relief that23    you're seeking, that the prisoner's seeking in the 198324    action, is not available, cannot be provided --25              QUESTION:  I'm just asking you to answer that8                                                                                                                                1    question yes or no.  On your theory, am I right, is not2    available, you don't even have to take step one?3              MS. WINKELMAN:  That's correct, Your Honor.4              QUESTION:  I don't understand how you get there5    from the statute.  I mean, you would have the statute read6    until such administrative remedies providing the same7    relief are exhausted and it doesn't say that.  It says8    until such administrative remedies as are available.  I9    mean, that's a very broad phrase, such administrative10    remedies as are available.  It could be all sorts of11    remedies, damages, injunctions.  On what basis do you want12    it limited to only those remedies that provide your client13    the same relief he wants in the 1997e action.  I don't14    understand that.15              MS. WINKELMAN:  I think the answer to that16    question, Justice Scalia, lies in the whole purpose of17    administrative exhaustion.  What are we talking about18    here?  We're talking about, in any context, prisoner19    context, or security context, any other context, an20    individual going to an administrative agency when that21    agency can provide the relief.  Here there's no question22 -- 2324259                                                                                                                                          QUESTION:  I understand that.  That may well bewith respect to those exhaustion requirements that aredevised by the courts without any statutory requirement, 1    but it is entirely conceivable that an exhaustion 2    requirement would have other purposes as your opponents 3    claim here, simply making the prisoner go through a 4    lengthy procedure that may satisfy him even though the 5    relief is not the same or that may persuade him that the 6    factual basis for his claims are so insubstantial that 7    it's no use troubling the Federal courts with them.  There 8    are a lot of other reasons for making him go through these 9    hoops before he is one of the, what, 45,000 prisoners a10    year who run into Federal court right away.  That seems to11    be a perfect valid purpose and it seems to me that the way12    the statute reads.13              MS. WINKELMAN:  Your Honor, if Congress had14    intended to require exhaustion in every case, a blanket15    exhaustion rule, it would have and could have written such16    a statute, but it didn't do that in 1980 and when Congress17    had the opportunity in 1996, and I want to go back to the18    question about effective because I don't think I answered19    that completely.20              When Congress had the opportunity in 1996 to21    create this kind of blanket exhaustion, we want all22    prisoner problems to go through the prison grievance23    system, it didn't do that, it retained the six words.24              QUESTION:  I don't know what possible language I25    would use if I were writing a statute to demand precisely10                                                                                                                                 1    that result, other than the language, until such 2    administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.  I 3    mean, that seems to me to do precisely what you say 4    Congress hasn't done. 5              MS. WINKELMAN:  Let me suggest to you what we 6    -- that the kind of the statute that we would think would 7    be this blanket exhaustion, exhaustion every case, it's a 8    good thing for prisons.  The statute is at issue in 9    McNeil, the Federal Tort Claims Act, an action shall not10    be instituted under the FTCA unless the claimant shall11    have first presented the claim to the appropriate Federal12    agency.  So this statute could have said Congress could13    have, rather than advertently leaving in the words, until14    such administrative remedies as are available, Congress15    could have written a broad exhaustion statute.16              QUESTION:  Well, I'm not sure that that would17    work.  It seems to me that the statute that the Congress18    has here is better.  There may be cases, not just as19    Justice Scalia indicated where the claim is insubstantial,20    there may be cases where it's very substantial.  But the21    courts are certainly helped by having a -- suppose they22    had a hearing, the guard was disciplined, reprimanded.23    They restored whatever disciplinary demerits or they24    erased any disciplinary action that was taken against the25    Petitioner.  That would be very helpful to the court.  Now11                                                                                                                                 1    maybe they can't give damages, but that's the next stage. 2              MS. WINKELMAN:  It might be -- 3              QUESTION:  And you're saying that it's just 4    irrelevant to the courts, that there are some disciplinary 5    mechanisms that the prisoner -- that cover this incident. 6    It's not saying that he has to apply for library 7    privileges or something.  It is to cover this incident and 8    help clarify and crystallize the situation.  Then he goes 9    and asks for damages.10              MS. WINKELMAN:  Justice Kennedy, it's not --11    this isn't a general prison notification.  There may be12    benefits to having prisons know about problems in the13    first instance.  We don't dispute that.  We don't dispute14    that there are benefits to prison grievance systems, but15    the point here and our argument is that Congress kept in16    these words.  It didn't create an FTCA type statute and17    what's important --18              QUESTION:  The FTCA statute doesn't work because19    you don't make a claim for damages.  What the Congress is20    saying here is there are other benefits besides simply21    processing this claim.  We want to have the entire22    incident investigated first and you can't make that23    parallel between the FTCA and this statute.  This statute24    served purposes that are not served by the FTCA example25    you put out and this statute is -- it doesn't seem to me12                                                                                                                                 1    that the Congress could have taken the FTCA analogy to 2    accomplish the result that it wants to accomplish here. 3              MS. WINKELMAN:  If the result is that all prison 4    complaints and all prison problems are aired through the 5    prison grievance system first, then I submit that Congress 6    could have created that type of statute, but Congress 7    didn't do that. 8              QUESTION:  Well, I would agree with you that 9    Congress perhaps could have been clearer about it.  But I10    want to ask you just a textual question to see whether we11    disagree on that.  I will admit that when I first looked12    at the statute I thought remedies referred to form of13    relief.  But after reading the briefs and reading the14    statute a few more times, I came to the conclusion that,15    in fact, remedies was an ambiguous word.  It could either16    mean form of relief or it could mean administrative17 process.18              And one of the textual clues, it seems to me,19    that's in there to indicate that Congress meant20    administrative process was its use of the word exhaust.21    We don't normally speak of exhausting the relief that you22    get.  I mean, like running through the money damages and23    having a good time, that's what -- I mean, exhaustion24    usually refers to exhausting a particular process.  So25    just at kind of step one, the textual point here seemed to13                                                                                                                                 1    me probably to make a better argument or support a better 2    argument, that what Congress was talking about when it 3    used relief was administrative process rather than -- a 4    remedy rather.  It was using administrative process rather 5    than particular relief awarded.  Would you comment on6 that? 7              MS. WINKELMAN:  I agree that there's some 8    ambiguity in the word remedy and procedure and it's 9    something certainly that we've struggled with, with the10    word remedy in the statute, that sometimes it can mean an11    administrative procedure and sometimes it can mean the12    right.  Where we've come out is that in this statute it's13    probably doing double duty in some sense, but when it --14              QUESTION:  Well, if it's doing double duty,15    doesn't that nix your case?16              MS. WINKELMAN:  I don't think so, Your Honor,17    because it's still an administrative remedy as are18    available.  It means both procedure and it means something19    that can actually give you the right, the relief that you20    seek, something that can actually redress the wrong.21    That's the meaning of remedy.22              QUESTION:  One of the practical difficulties of23    your interpretation is that I gather a prisoner by simply24    saying he wants money damages in any case can avoid the25    grievance system entirely even though money damages might14                                                                                                                                 1    not be a major part of what he wants. 2              MS. WINKELMAN:  Chief Justice Rehnquist, this 3    problem of bypass, I think, is a little, somewhat 4    overblown in some of the briefs.  It's conjectural.  In 5    fact, the empirical evidence would point to the contrary 6    that in the Circuits, in the Fifth and the Ninth Circuits, 7    that have held our away on the money damages point, there 8    hasn't been this bypass and this explosion of litigation 9    and that makes sense because if what the prisoner wants,10    the prisoner can, in fact, get through the prison11    grievance process, then just like the State's amicus brief12    points out, numerous grievances are resolved in a13    prisoner's favor.  They would go there.  I need a14    different cell.  I need to be housed without a smoker.15    Why would they give up the injunctive relief that they16    want simply to get into Federal court where they have to17    today pay a filing fee, at least in installments, where18    they risk losing one of their three lifelong strikes if,19    in fact, their proceeding IFP and their case is dismissed?20 So --21              QUESTION:  Ms. Winkelman, I wanted to get a22    clearer handle than I now have on the nature of the claim23    you think you have.  You were candid in saying before, if24    you have this kind of claim, you can go directly to court25    with no administrative filing at all.  Suppose the15                                                                                                                                 1    administrative process does include some kind of monetary 2    relief, but it's got a cap, say a thousand dollars capped. 3    And your client's view is they beat me to a bloody pulp 4    and a thousand dollars wouldn't begin to compensate me for 5    my injury.  Could such a person, in your view, go directly 6    to court because there's no available remedy?  There's a 7    monetary remedy but it's capped. 8              MS. WINKELMAN:  Your Honor, in that situation, 9    Justice Ginsburg, the prisoner would have to go through10    the prison grievance system because the prison grievance11    system, while it couldn't provide the one-to-one12    correlation of the relief could provide the category of13    relief and certainly our position wouldn't preclude a cap14    such as the one that you posit your hypothetical.15              But in that situation there is a monetary16    damages remedy available.  It may not be a perfect remedy.17    It may not be the one-to-one fit, but the difference18    between that case and our case, is that in our case there19    was no monetary damages remedy available at all and that's20    why Mr. Booth, as a matter of administrative exhaustion,21    didn't have to go through that process.22              Remember, when we're talking about23    administrative exhaustion and Congress can be presumed to24    have been legislating when it chose and then retained25    these words, such available -- such administrative16                                                                                                                                 1    remedies as are available, that there's a long-standing 2    jurisprudence in the administrative law area about the3 futility -- 4              QUESTION:  I'd like to ask you now, I understand 5    the nature of the claim you're asserting.  Suppose I were 6    of the view, this statute is nor crystal clear.  It could 7    be read either way.  It could be read to say, if there's 8    administrative process, you have to exhaust it or it could 9    be read to say, only if the kind of relief you're seeking10    is available must you exhaust.  Then when the text doesn't11    tell me which one of those is right.  Why isn't the proper12    perspective what Congress was trying to do?  One thing we13    know Congress was trying to do, is to curtail prisoner14    litigation.  Why wouldn't it be appropriate for a court to15    say well that's going to be how I break the tie?  The text16    could be read either way, but I know that Congress wanted17    to curtail prisoner litigation so I'm going to read it the18    way that will keep cases out of court.19              MS. WINKELMAN:  Certainly that was a purpose of20    the Prison Litigation Reform Act.  We acknowledge that and21    there are numerous provisions in the PLRA that go to that22    point, the filing fee, the three strikes provision, all23    the enhanced mechanisms for a district court's screening24    of prisoner complaints.  And even this very statute was25    amended in significant respects to channel far more17                                                                                                                                 1    grievances and complaints through the grievance system 2    before they could come to court. 3              It's mandatory rather than discretionary. 4    There's no more stay.  There's no more Federal oversight 5    of the adequacy of the State procedures, but Congress fell 6    short we believe when it retained those words against a 7    backdrop of administrative law jurisprudence about 8    futility.  When it retained those words, Congress intended 9    to preserve that avenue for prisoners and, in fact, there10    are other parts --11              QUESTION:  Ms. Winkelman, when Justice Ginsburg12    followed up on her question, I thought she was going to13    follow-up by asking what if the damages available in the14    prison grievance procedure were only $50?  I presume your15    answer would be the same since there is a damage remedy16    available in the administrative procedure you have to17    exhaust, which means that, you know, that what you're18    proposing to us besides not, in my view, corresponding to19    the text of the statute doesn't even have the virtue of20    providing fairness it seems to me.  Why should it be if I21    can get $50 I have to go through the prison grievance22    procedure when I'm claiming $10,000 of actual damages?  It23    doesn't make any sense.24              MS. WINKELMAN:  Certainly, Justice Scalia, there25    would be some threshold at which the prison grievance18                                                                                                                                 1    system's damages might be so nominal as to not be the kind 2    of relief that we're talking about.  I don't know exactly 3    where that line is.  But the other point in terms of 4    statutory interpretation is that, if all Congress meant to 5    do was to say that prisoners have to go through every 6    prison grievance system, then these words would be 7    superfluous.  What could they mean, such administrative 8    remedies as are available?  Certainly, if there's not a 9    procedure in existence, Congress wasn't trying to say a10    prisoner has to go through that.11              QUESTION:  If you're right, Ms. Winkelman,12    Federal judges are going to have to say, does this prison13    system allow for damages?  And maybe it won't always be14    clear whether it does or not.  And secondly, what is the15    cutoff point in damages, which you say there must be,16    between just allowing enough to require exhaustion and not17    requiring it and not awarding enough.  So, you're putting18    more uncertainty into the Act it seems to me.19              MS. WINKELMAN:  I think actually, Chief Justice20    Rehnquist, we're putting less uncertainty into the Act21    than Respondents' reading is because, even Respondents22    don't take the extreme position that such administrative23    remedies as are available means any procedure in24    existence.  Even Respondents acknowledge that the25    procedure has to be, the administrative remedy has to be19                                                                                                                                 1    capable of addressing the subject matter of the prisoner's 2    complaint. 3              And with that in mind that would create more 4    work on the district courts because instead of just 5    looking at what the prisoner is seeking, what relief and 6    then is that available in the grievance system, they're 7    going to have to parse through the subject matter of the 8    complaint, parse through whether the grievance system can 9    actually address that, which I think it would create more10    work for the district courts.11              QUESTION:  But, I mean, as is opposed to12    applying for a library card, is there really going to be13    much doubt about whether a prison system can address a14    type of grievance?15              MS. WINKELMAN:  But if that's the case, Your16    Honor, then I'd go back to the point then the words are17    superfluous, why are they in there if there's no doubt?18              QUESTION:  What words?  I don't understand.  You19    did say that before and I didn't understand what you20    meant.  What --21              MS. WINKELMAN:  If all Congress meant was, is22    there a procedure in existence or does the procedure23    address the subject matter, it didn't need to say such24    administrative remedies as are available because certainly25    it goes without saying that there would have to be a20                                                                                                                                 1    grievance procedure in existence and that that procedure 2    -- 3              QUESTION:  Why does it have to go without -- 4              MS. WINKELMAN:  Because Congress couldn't have 5    been intending to write a statute that would require a 6    prisoner to exhaust if there was no procedure in existence 7    to begin with. 8              QUESTION:  No, but the argument is -- as are 9    available, as we'll hear the complaint.  I mean, obviously10    they'll hear it, but I take it that they're willing to11    hear it.  He has a complaint about something, guard hit12    me, as are exhausted.  I mean, do you see the obvious13    thing?  Am I -- what's the answer to that?14              MS. WINKELMAN:  But available means --15              QUESTION:  Available means they'll hear it.  Of16    course if they won't hear, you don't have to go there.17    Will they hear it in your case or not?18              MS. WINKELMAN:  In that case, again I think it19    goes without saying, I think that those words then aren't20    necessary.  Certainly if the prison grievance system -- if21    there's no grievance procedure or if it won't hear this22    type of complaint, then nobody's suggesting that the23    prisoner would have to go through it.  Congress didn't24    need to add those six words and retain those six words if25    that's all it meant to do.  I'd like to reserve the21                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9remainder of my time for rebuttal.          QUESTION:  Very well, Ms. Winkelman.          Mr. Pappert, we'll hear from you.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF GERALD J. PAPPERT               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS          MR. PAPPERT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          In the PLRA, Congress changed the exhaustionscheme that it had previously imposed upon prisonersbecause it had not worked.  It had not controlled theexplosive growth in prisoner litigation.  Congress amendedthe scheme by deleting the requirements that theadministrative remedies be plain, speedy or effective andby withdrawing from the courts the discretion to determinewhether or not exhaustion is required.1011121314151617181920    need.21              QUESTION:  And what does that mean?  I mean,22    that's the -- I mean, I imagine this is a case, which it23    isn't, which is only money damages were at stake.  There's24    nothing else at stake.  What does it mean to exhaust a          In light of these changes, it is clear thatCongress wants prisoners to exhaust their prisonadministrative processes whether or not those processescan provide the prisoner the relief he or she says they25    process where all you want is money and they can't give                                  22                                                                                                                                 1    you any money, what does that mean? 2              MR. PAPPERT:  Your definition of available, Your 3    Honor, is ours.  If the prison will in any way accept the 4    prisoner's complaint and address it. 5              QUESTION:  And what does it mean?  What does it 6    mean to accept it and hear it when the prisoner's only 7    asking for money?  What does that mean?  Can you give 8    content?  I know I wanted to hear her response, but I'm 9    still puzzled by my own question.10              MR. PAPPERT:  What it means, Your Honor, is what11    Congress wanted and that is that there is a presumption12    that underlies, I think, the Petitioner's point and your13    initial question, which is that, just because money's not14    available there is nothing that this process can do for15    the prisoner.16              QUESTION:  Well, his complaint is not money.17    His complaint is that a guard whacked him over the head or18    something of that sort.19              MR. PAPPERT:  Yes, Your Honor.20              QUESTION:  And the way the statute reads, it21    says with respect to prison conditions, no action shall be22    brought with respect to prison conditions until such23    administrative remedies as are available are exhausted and24    I gather the condition here is the fact that guards go25    about whacking people over the head and the remedies for23                                                                                                                                 1    that are presumably whatever remedies the prison provides 2    for when you get whacked over the head, which might 3    include money damages, but might not. 4              MR. PAPPERT:  Well, remedy in this statute means 5    process, Your Honor.  Congress wanted the inmates to 6    exhaust their administrative process. 7              QUESTION:  Even though there's nothing at the 8    end of it?  You mean it's just a process.  We, you know, 9    we're not going to give you anything but we're going to10    have a hearing and then an appeal and then a second11    appeal.  Of course, you can't get any relief.  Surely it12    doesn't mean that.13              MR. PAPPERT:  No, it doesn't.  No, it doesn't,14    Your Honor.  And where I respectfully differ with your15    question is again the presumption that it means nothing.16    The process means nothing if there isn't money at the end17    of the line and the reason that that is not correct is18    that there is an indefinite and almost endless list of19    ways that the prison could satisfy the prisoner, short of20    money.  There is always a possibility that the prison can21    satisfy the prisoner short of giving him or her money22    because in essence the currency equivalence isn't money.23    Money has a value within the prisons, but the currency of24    prisons is in-kind relief.  And there are many things25    within a prison that money can't buy and that are very24                                                                                                                                 1    valuable to the prisoner. 2              QUESTION:  Well, come on, this is a sort they 3    likes-to-but-what kind of an argument.  What -- if indeed 4    what the prison can provide is more attractive to the 5    prisoner than money presumably you wouldn't need this 6    statute to make him go through the prison procedure.  He 7    would use it. 8              MR. PAPPERT:  You would still need the statute. 9    Again because Congress wanted as many of these claims10    going through the administrative process as possible11    because they wanted as few --12              QUESTION:   Well, that's a different argument.13    Don't tell me that you're helping the prisoner because14    there a lot of things that he would think even more15    valuable than money.  If he would think them even more16    valuable than money, he'd use them.  This is forcing the17    prisoner to go through the prison procedure, which18    presumably he doesn't want to go through.19              MR. PAPPERT:  He says he doesn't want to go20    through it, Your Honor, but again I think we make a21    mistake to equate what the prisoner says he wants or needs22    when he files a grievance, with what the prisoner says he23    wants once he files his civil rights complaint.  And the24    entire premise upon which the Petitioner's interpretation25    is based is that there's absolutely nothing the process25                                                                                                                                 1    can do for him and that's simply not true. 2              There are many things the process can do for 3    him, but Your Honor, in your hypothetical if the prisoner 4    goes through the process, if he doesn't accept any of the 5    various forms of relief that he's offered, if his 6    allegations, of course, are found to be true by the 7    prison, he can still go to court.  We have no problem with 8    that.  This is just a mechanism to try to weed as many of 9    the court claims out as possible.10              QUESTION:  And I assume the statute of11    limitations on his money claim or any other claim that he12    cannot get in the prison grievance system would not start13    running until the exhaustion of the administrative14 remedies?15              MR. PAPPERT:  I do not think so, Your Honor.  I16    believe the statute of limitations claim may start to run17    earlier and if it does, that is just something that18    Congress took into mind when it imposed no doubt a19    dramatic difference in how they wanted prisoner litigation20    handled.  Such that, you know, as long as he goes through21    the process, he conceivably can still file a Federal court22    claim.  The administrative process will be over with in23    most cases before a statute of limitations on an24    underlying claim --25              QUESTION:  But if it's not -- you're saying,26                                                                                                                                 1    tough luck.  You're saying Congress built a process, which 2    the prison -- if the prison wants to defeat ultimate 3    relief in court, could just string it out till the time 4    limit is up and say, well, too bad, we got you. 5              MR. PAPPERT:  Your Honor, I agree with part of 6    your question and respectfully disagree with the second 7    part.  There may be an instance where there is a harsh 8    result following the prison process and if the statute of 9    limitation expires it's for a number of reasons.  First of10    all being that Congress wanted to leave the setting of the11    deadlines to the discretion of the States and the12    departments of corrections and the local institutions.13 So --14              QUESTION:  I could understand the deadlines for15    within the prison process.  I don't understand something16    that says we give you -- the clock starts ticking when the17    event occurs, when the alleged assault occurs.  And even18    if you're in the twirls of the administrative process, it19    continues to tick and if the time is up while you're still20    in the administrative process, too bad, you can't get to21    court, but that's what you're telling me this statute22    does.  And I don't see the rationale to that.23              MR. PAPPERT:  Well, the rationale is, Your24    Honor, first of all, the second part of your prior25    question ties into my answer to this question.  That was,27                                                                                                                                1    you indicated that the prison could in effect drag the2    process out.  We would not agree with that.  And we would3    say that if the administrative process is not honored by4    the prison, the prisoner will still have a remedy.  We are5    not saying that courts do not have the discretion under6    this statute to determine whether exhaustion has, in fact,7    taken place.89 -- 10QUESTION:  Well, if that's so, why doesn't it111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  A court might well say that a remedy,which took a greater length of time than the statute oflimitations, was not available since the idea ofexhaustion of remedies is to get ready to go to court.          MR. PAPPERT:  Well, the idea of exhaustion ofremedies, Mr. Chief Justice, is to prevent having to go tocourt, as Congress wanted this statute to work.          QUESTION:  Well, at any rate a predicate togoing to court.  It contemplates the idea that at the endof the administrative road, the prisoner may still want togo to court.          MR. PAPPERT:  Yes Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Why do you take the position -- theremay be a very simple answer to this, but I don't know whatit is.  Why do you take the position that it, why youassume that the statute of limitations on the damage28                                                                                             1 2 3 4 5 6    Ginsburg. 7              MR. PAPPERT:  Right. 8              QUESTION:  Could have eliminated the last couple 9    of minutes of a very difficult discussion.10              MR. PAPPERT:  I was honestly trying to get to11    that, Your Honor, and that is, that that's my point behind12    the fact that courts do not lose the discretion here to13    determine whether exhaustion has taken place, which means14    that the prisoner's put in the position that Justice15    Ginsburg referred to and for no good reason that the16    prison simply dragged out the process.  The prisoner can17 still --18              QUESTION:  Justice Souter was saying less than19    that.  Justice Souter was saying, and I confess I don't20    know any other situation in which you are compelled to21    exhaust and the statute keeps on running while you're22    exhausting.  That seems to be a very unusual situation.23    Justice Souter was suggesting that the statute of24    limitations is simply tolled while you're exhausting and25    you think that is conceivable too, isn't it?29                                                                                                                                action cannot be tolled?          MR. PAPPERT:  I wouldn't assume that, YourHonor, and that was the point I was leading to.          QUESTION:  If you don't assume that then youdon't have the problem that you got into with Justice 1              MR. PAPPERT:  We believe that the prisoner could 2    make an equitable tolling argument at the appropriate 3    time, yes, Your Honor.  But another point here though is 4    that, under the Petitioner's interpretation, we still have 5    the problem Justice Ginsburg referred to.  If there's a 6    short deadline for the bringing of the claim to the 7    administrative process, whether or not there's relief at 8    the end of the line that the Petitioner wants, they still 9    may have that very situation.  So the Petitioner's10    interpretation of the statute doesn't satisfy some of the11    problems that could come.12              QUESTION:  Well, I'm somewhat concerned about13    your cautious answer.  You said, well he could make14    argument that there's equitable tolling.  That indicates15    to me that the State at some later time is to going take16    the position there's no tolling and that's of great17    concern.  If that's your position, I'd like to know it.18              MR. PAPPERT:  That was in the context, Your19    Honor, of what I thought was Justice Ginsburg's hypo of20    the prison unreasonably dragging out the process for the21    purposes of blowing the statute of limitations.  And what22    I was saying in response to that is, that in situations23    like that, we would determine that exhaustion -- we would24    feel that exhaustion has taken place if, for example, the25    prisoner submits his claim, the prison sits on it, they do30                                                                                                                                1    not honor their deadlines under the exhaustion process.2    Exhaustion has taken place under that and what I am saying3    is there's no prohibition on a court recognizing that.4              QUESTION:  I am concerned about the fact that5    there's no general tolling of the statute of limitations.6    Suppose the State in all good faith is behind, and -- how7    long is the statute of limitations for filing on the8 court. 9          MR. PAPPERT:  In Pennsylvania under these facts,it would be two years, Your Honor.10111213    tolling.14              MR. PAPPERT:  Well, if the deadlines in this15    process are honored by Pennsylvania, the process would16    take on average probably under 90 days, Your Honor.  If17    the deadlines have not been honored and the prison has, in18    effect, sat on the grievance, the prisoner would have a19    remedy, yes.   The Petitioner's interpretation of the20    statute I think most importantly would reintroduce the21    effectiveness requirement that came out in some prior22    questions.23 24 25          And it would also allow the prisoner to bypassthe process simply by manipulating the relief that herequests.  And there's no better example of that, I think31                                                                                                      QUESTION:  All right.  I can see a court, prisonsystem taking 18, 19 months and you say there's no 1    in response to a question, we heard that it's not just 2    money.  Money might not be the only issue and we get to 3    the questions of the caps and that is that next time it 4    may be that the prisoner wants the prison regulations be 5    declared unconstitutional. 6              And he says that you can't declare it 7    unconstitutional, prison, so I have to go the Federal 8    courts.  There will be different ways to evade the process 9    other than by saying that money is all that the prisoner10    really wants and that is a risk here.  And that, in fact,11    happened in one of the cases cited by the Petitioner in12    the Fifth Circuit where the prisoner filed a mixed claim,13    as in some of the prior questions, the magistrate14    recommended dismissal of the claim based on failure to15    exhaust.  The prisoner quickly amended his claim and made16    it solely a money damages case and the Fifth Circuit17    allowed that.  I mean, that's a clear example of empirical18    evidence of how a prisoner got around the exhaustion19    requirement and that we know is contrary to what Congress20    wanted in this statute.21              QUESTION:  May I ask you to clarify one other22    thing?  As I recall, in your brief, you said one of the23    virtues of the administrative process is that it can24    establish a factual record, but I think part of this,25    isn't it part of the Pennsylvania rules that whatever's32                                                                                                                                1    developed in the grievance system cannot be used in court?2              MR. PAPPERT:  Yes, Your Honor, and that's - it3    is.  Under the Pennsylvania process it's almost as though4    a provision tries to foster use of the grievance process5    by putting it into the context of settlement negotiations.6    We were not speaking in terms of a factual record as a7    lower court would deliver to an appellate court.  But what8    we meant there was there can still be an investigation.9    There can be the gathering and preservation of evidence by10    the prison, all of which can narrow the claims that do11    make it to court and that's what we meant by the value in12    a record sense of exhausting the process.13              QUESTION:  May I just clarify one thing in my14    own mind about your position?  I understand if the15    prisoner files a case in which he just asks for damages16    and nothing else, it's accusing a guard of beating him up17    on a particular occasion.  You'd say he must exhaust and18    maybe you can satisfy him by transferring the guard or19    moving or something like that, but supposing the guard is20    dead and there's nothing that could be done to remedy a21    situation except money damage, do you still say he should22    exhaust?232425                                                                                                                                          MR. PAPPERT:  Yes, Your Honor.  Yes, Your Honorbecause --QUESTION:  And why again in that hypothetical?                  331 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. PAPPERT:  In that hypo, even though therecould be no action taken against the guard, there couldstill be something that the prison could give the prisonerthat would satisfy him.  The problem with the Petitioner'sinterpretation of the statute is, we will never know that.We don't know that in this case before the claim gets toFederal courts and we will not know that in all the casesthat are similar to this that follow because we never gavethe prison the chance to try.1011121314151617181920212223    there.2425          MR. PAPPERT:  Your Honor, there are -- yes, YourHonor, and I'll assume under your question that there's34                                                                                                      QUESTION:  Could you give me an example of this.My hypothetical is he sues because he was assaulted by aguard who since died and nothing else he wants but money.          MR. PAPPERT:  Yes.          QUESTION:  What could the prison give him thatwould help him?          MR. PAPPERT:  The types of relief that theycould try to satisfy him with, Your Honor, again, could beone of any -- a single -- a better cell assignment, asingle cell, extra privileges.          QUESTION:  Let's add to the mix and say theprison transferred the prisoner immediately to anotherprison so there's nothing at all they can do for him 1    absolutely nothing the prison can do for that prisoner. 2    Congress focused more broadly in this statute and there 3    still things that can benefit the other inmates who remain 4    at the prison and the prison itself by putting the prison 5    on notice of the problem and giving the prison the first 6    opportunity to correct it.  So those are benefits that can 7    flow generally from exhaustion of the process.  Even 8    though under your question, Your Honor, that particular 9    prisoner was not satisfied.10              QUESTION:  Do you consider that to be an11    administrative remedy, even though it doesn't give any12    benefit to the inmate at all.  That's pretty tough13    statutory construction.14              MR. PAPPERT:  Well, again, our --15              QUESTION:  Until such administrative remedies as16    are available are exhausted, I'd be inclined to say that17    if the prison can't give me any satisfaction that's going18    to do me any good, there is no administrative remedy19    available.202122232425          MR. PAPPERT:  Well, we define remedy as process,Your Honor.  Remedy is not relief --          QUESTION:  Oh, that's nice.          MR. PAPPERT:  -- under this statute.          QUESTION:  It doesn't say process though, itsays remedies.35                                                                                            1              MR. PAPPERT:  The words are used interchangeably2    in the statute and when we do speak of exhaustion of3    remedies we don't, as I believe Justice Souter pointed4    out, we don't speak of exhaustion of the money or the5    injunctive relief, we speak of exhaustion of the process.6    So I would respectfully differ with you there, but again7    even in your question --89 relief. 10QUESTION:  It means a process that providesMR. PAPPERT:  Yes.111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Then what if your prison system,describing the procedure, says the following relief can begiven and they give a bunch of examples, but none of theminclude the hypothetical you've given me.  You'resuggesting there's sort of an undefined category of reliefthat might be granted by the warden independently, not asa result of a particular proceeding as I understand it.          MR. PAPPERT:  I'm not sure I understand whatyou're referring to, Justice Stevens.          QUESTION:  Well, my hypo was the dead guard.          MR. PAPPERT:  Yeah, oh, okay.          QUESTION:  And you say well they might give hima different cell or they might give him library privilegesor something like that, but if none of that is prescribedin the procedure, that is, you know, the prison36                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9disciplinary remedy procedure, can you still say that's apart of the available remedies?          MR. PAPPERT:  Yes, Your Honor.  The procedureitself does not list in it what a prison can or cannot --          QUESTION:  Supposing the procedure has a limitedset of remedies that it does authorize.          MR. PAPPERT:  Okay.          QUESTION:  And then you're still saying, butthat still would not be exhaustive.  Is that what you're10 saying?11              MR. PAPPERT:  We are still saying that the12    prisoner under you question, Your Honor, would have to13    exhaust the process because one, there still may be14    something that can satisfy him.  Two, even if there isn't,15    there may be something that can benefit the prison and the16    other inmates and three, that even if all the above fail,17    the prisoner can still go to court and that's all Congress18    really wanted.19              QUESTION:  But you're not saying that there20    would be a satisfaction of the statue in the case in which21    the prison literally simply provided a forum for22    complaints and said we'll never do anything about them,23    but if you want to get them off your chest, sure you can24    come in and tell us.  You're not claiming that that would25 satisfy?37                                                                                                                                 1              MR. PAPPERT:  That would not, Your Honor, and 2    again that gets to our definition of available.  If the 3    prison will accept and address the complaint, he has an 4    available remedy.  Under your question, the prison -- 5              QUESTION:  In other words, if some remedy of 6    some sort is available, that's what you're saying. 7              MR. PAPPERT:  It doesn't hinge as much on 8    remedy, Your Honor, as it does on whether the prison will 9    take the complaint and address it in any way and under10    your question --11              QUESTION:  Okay, but if it -- when you say12    address, I assume address with the object of providing13    relief if there is merit in the complaint, some kind of14 relief.15              MR. PAPPERT:  No, that would more be the16    Petitioner's interpretation of the statue as meaning that17    the prisoner has to get what he wants, that would not be18    our interpretation --19              QUESTION:  No, I mean that is the prison's20    argument, but I mean, I'm suggesting that perhaps the21    prisoner would have a good argument here if the prison22    said, we have a system that does not provide relief.  We23    simply have a system in which you can come up and make24    your complaints and feel better for having talked to25    somebody.  The prisoner would say there surely, in that38                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9case, we don't have to go through the -- under the statutedoes not require us to go through --          MR. PAPPERT:  That would not be an availableremedy, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Why not?  It's a procedure.  It's aprocedure and it's available.  I thought you say remedymeans procedure.  You can't have it both ways.          MR. PAPPERT:  It is not, Justice Scalia, as I'minterpreting the question.  I'm interpreting the question10 -- 111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  You're saying procedure leading tosome conceivable relief.          MR. PAPPERT:  No, I'm just saying, will theyaddress it all?  And under your question, Your Honor, theprison is saying, you can bring us the complaint.   We'renot going to do anything about it, but if it makes youfeel better, you can drop it on our doorstep, there is noavailable remedy there.  That is almost -- that's anexclusion of the claim.          QUESTION:  What about a chaplain in the armedforces, which perhaps sometimes serves that purpose, youknow you go talk to the chaplain, nothing much happens.Thank you, Mr. Pappert.          MR. PAPPERT:  Thank you, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Mr. Gornstein.39                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425           ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN              ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES       AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS          MR. GORNSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          The PLRA requires an inmate to exhaust availableadministrative remedies without regard to whether theyoffer the relief that the inmate seeks in court.  So if aninstitution responds to legitimate complaints aboutexcessive force through such means as disciplining theofficer involved --          QUESTION:  May I just, so I'll be sure I havetime to get your answer.  What if the system doesn'tprovide any relief at all for the particular grievances inmy example?          MR. GORNSTEIN:  Then we would say that noadministrative remedies are available.          QUESTION:  You would.  So you would just agreewith the State on that point.          MR. GORNSTEIN:  On that small point and I don'tthink it would come up very much because almost often --almost in all cases there would be something that theadministrative process could do about the complaint andhere we're talking about a complaint about excessiveforce.  So the available remedies that have to be in40                                                                                             1    existence is just something that addresses complaints 2    about excessive force and it could be transferring the 3    inmate to another area, it could be disciplining the 4    officer involved and directing the officer not to repeat 5    that conduct and that would show that administrative 6    remedies are available and an inmate would have to 7    exhaust, even if he only wants to seek money in court. 8              Now that conclusion follows when the textual 9    changes that Congress made in the statute.  Before the Act10    was amended, exhaustion could only be required when the11    available administrative remedies were effective.  And12    this Court said in McCarthy against Madigan that13    administrative remedies are not effective when the inmate14    seeks only money and the administrative process does not15    offer that specific form of relief.16         QUESTION:  And it was dictum there, of course.17         MR. GORNSTEIN:  Of course, it was dictum, but when18    Congress is reviewing a statute and are attempting to19    amend it, it's very unlikely that Congress is going to20    make fine distinctions about whether this Court had a21    holding or an analysis that was necessary to the holding22    or that it was dicta.  What Congress was faced with was an23    interpretation of the term effective and the Court24    interpreted it to mean then when administrative remedies25    do not offer money and the inmate is seeking money, the41                                                                                                                                 1    administrative available remedies are not effective and in 2    that context, Congress's elimination of the term effective 3    shows that Congress intended to require inmates to exhaust 4    available remedies in all cases, including ones like that 5    in McCarthy, in which the inmate seeks only money and the 6    available remedies do not offer money. 7              So what we have, what the statue essentially 8    says to an inmate, is if you have a complaint about prison 9    conditions and the administrative process will address it10    in some way, you must give the administrative process a11    chance to do it to your satisfaction and if they cannot do12 that --13              QUESTION:  Your interpretation of the word14    remedy is more than process then, it's some relief.15              MR. GORNSTEIN:  I think it's some relief, but16    that's what I think is implicit in a grievance procedure.17    I would just use the word grievance procedure.  A18    grievance procedure is something that offers some relief19    for the kind of complaint that an inmate is complaining20 about.21              And the reason Congress made the particular22    changes that it made here is it wanted to reduce the23    enormous burden that these kinds of cases were placing on24    Federal district courts and the change that it made25    accomplishes that in two important ways.  First of all, an42                                                                                                                                1    inmate may start out wanting nothing other than money and2    he may end up being satisfied with something else.  And3    second of all, you have cases where the inmate receives a4    decision on the merits and he decides after seeing that5    decision that this is not a claim that's worth pursuing in6 court.7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          And finally, it's important to note that veryfew State administrative programs offer money for anythingother than personal property loss.  So the consequence ofaccepting the Petitioner's construction here would be thatan inmate would have the ability in a wide range of caseto avoid the exhaustion requirement simply by formulatinga complaint that seeks only money.  If the Court hasnothing further --          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Gornstein.  Ms.Winkelman, you have three minutes remaining.           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NANCY WINKELMAN                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MS. WINKELMAN:  And I have three points, YourHonor.  Number one, there's been a lot of discussion aboutthe types of remedies, disciplining the guard, apologiesand so forth.  I would point out and emphasize that noneof what has been mentioned is a remedy to the prisoner forthe particular wrong.  In this case, Mr. Booth wasassaulted by prison guards.  The only remedy available to43                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425address that wrong to him is money damages.          Transferring the prison guard is not going toprovide redress to Mr. Booth for the wrong that wasinflicted upon him.  And as counsel for the Respondentconceded, Mr. Booth has a high risk of forfeiting hismoney damages claim under Section 1983 completely for noreason.  The prison grievance system cannot remedy thatwrong.  He has everything to lose.          QUESTION:  How is that a forfeit?  How does heforfeit it?          MS. WINKELMAN:  Because if he misses one ofthese short time frames through the prison grievancesystem as is pointed out in McCarthy --          QUESTION:  That's the part I don't understand.Suppose it's 15 days, all right he has to file in 15 days,what's the problem?          MS. WINKELMAN:  If he -- the prison grievancesystem has three levels.  If he misses one of those timeframes as this Court pointed out in McCarthy, he has ahigh risk of forfeiting his Federal claim all togetherbecause when he --          QUESTION:  That's true of any claim that he hasto -- I mean, that would be true of every claim --          MS. WINKELMAN:  That's true, but in theinjunctive context, he has something to gain.  Here he has44                                                                                             1    nothing to gain.  The second point is, is that in terms of 2    what about couldn't it just mean that the prison grievance 3    will hear the complaint.  I would return this Court to the 4    words in First Iowa of 55 years ago.  When Congress 5    intends for a litigant to do something futile, it has to 6    be explicit about it.  Here Congress was far than explicit 7    about it.  Under our view, we think it was said the 8    opposite.  At best it was ambiguous, but certainly 9    Congress didn't explicitly require a prisoner to do a10    futile act.11              And the final point on the deletion of the word12    effective, I would point the Court to the prior statutory13    scheme because the words plain, speedy and effective in14    that scheme right on the face of the statute went only15    towards the procedural aspects of the State grievance16    procedure.  Did it prevent against reprisals?  Could it17    deal with things quickly enough?  That's what Congress18    took out.  But what Congress left in was such19    administrative remedies as are available, which we believe20    have force and in this situation the only remedy available21    was to pay damages.22              QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Winkelman.23              MS.
