SMITH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleaseP ROCEEDINGS                                              (10:03 a.m.)          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argumentnow in Number 99-936, Crystal Ferguson v. The City of12345    Charleston.101112131415161718192021    effective.22              Second, the searches were conducted here in the23    context of the private, physician-patient relationship and24    thus there was no diminished expectation of privacy,the Court:          This case involves pregnant women who soughtmedical care at a public hospital and who then weresearched by their doctors for evidence of crimes andarrested, seven of them right out of their hospital beds.The special needs exception does not apply to this case toexcuse the lack of warrants for three reasons.          First, unlike every other special needs case,the threat of law enforcement, the use of arrest asleverage was the key element of the policy.  It was, inthe respondent's own words, what made the policy25    again, unlike the other special needs cases.                                   3 1              And finally, the defendants here skirted the 2    warrant and probable cause requirements without 3    demonstrating impracticability. 4              QUESTION:  Ms. Smith, with respect to the first 5    of your reasons you point out that it is quite true, in a 6    sense, that the law enforcement component of the whole 7    scheme was necessary for success.  I think success as 8    you're using it is success in getting people into the drug 9    treatment, the counseling program and finishing whatever10    course of counseling there is, and I understand that.11              But isn't there a special need, independent of12    that, in the sense that the treating physicians need to13    know -- regardless of whether anyone takes counseling or14    not they simply need to know whether there is drug use15    involved, because that affects the risks to the mother and16    the risks to the fetus, and those are the things that they17    need to provide for.18              So my question is, even if we assumed there were19    no law enforcement component and there were no counseling20    scheme, wouldn't they have a special need to know and, in21    fact, didn't they demonstrate that before the law22    enforcement component was even added to the mix?23              MS. SMITH:  If there were no law enforcement24    scheme there would be a search that was being done, but it25    would be a search that was only done for medical purposes,41 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Your Honor, and therefore, as it was before the policywas --          QUESTION:  Right.  Right.  Yes.          MS. SMITH:  -- implemented, right, and thereforeit would have been consented to, because there was consentto treatment in that context.          But as soon as they incorporated a criminalsanction and made the policy what it was, they had tocomply with the Fourth Amendment, and what the warrant --          QUESTION:  Well, they had no -- I'll grant youthat the treating physicians had no special need, I guess,to get people into drug treatment programs, necessarily,but they did have a special need to discover the factsand, in fact, to get the evidence that ultimately wasturned over to the police.  That is correct, isn't it?          MS. SMITH:  In some cases there may have been aneed to do medical testing.  In some cases --          QUESTION:  Well, didn't they do it -- maybe I'mwrong.  Didn't they do it routinely?          MS. SMITH:  They did medical testing prior tothe policy for about 3 to 6 months, Your Honor.  They hadjust started to do testing --          QUESTION:  Okay.          MS. SMITH:  -- pursuant to a listed protocol.          As soon as they adopted the policy they -- 35 1    months later, approximately, they expanded the protocol in 2    order to find more people and really what this policy was 3    about was using arrest as leverage, and they've admitted 4    that in their brief. 5              QUESTION:  Suppose they had reasons -- 6              MS. SMITH:  Yes. 7              QUESTION:  -- to have arrests. 8              MS. SMITH:  Mm-hmm. 9              QUESTION:  They had turned this information over10    to the Social Services Department --11              MS. SMITH:  Mm-hmm.12              QUESTION:  -- to the people who act as13    counselors to women who are receiving public assistance.14    Would that have involved any Fourth Amendment violation in15 your view?16              MS. SMITH:  I don't believe it would have been a17    violation, Your Honor, if they were testing for medical18    purposes and discovered evidence of drug use during19    pregnancy.  At that point they have some level of20    individualized suspicion and reporting to DSS, as they21    did, for every other substance, for heroin, for22    methamphetamines -- they didn't report any of those to the23    police.  Reporting those to DSS may meet some kind of24    reasonable ground standard.25              QUESTION:  What is DSS, please?61              MS. SMITH:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.  It's the2    Department of Social Services, to the civil child abuse3    authorities.4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Why does individualized suspicionhelp?  In cases like Sitz, the roadblock case, one of therationales for sustaining it is that it's random.          MS. SMITH:  That's right, Your Honor, butSitz is --          QUESTION:  They were work both ways, therandomness and the individualized search, and it seems tome that the policy of testing everyone to see if some needcounseling is perhaps more sustainable than theindividualized suspicion --          MS. SMITH:  Well, in fact --          QUESTION:  -- argument that you're making tous --          MS. SMITH:  If I understand Your Honorcorrectly, in Sitz, for example, it's a standardized,nondiscretionary policy, and that I think is what savesit.  It's also a minimal intrusion, not a search like wehave here, and there's also the diminished expectation ofprivacy that drivers have, and that this Court hasdiscussed in a number of cases, including Opperman, and inSitz, whereas in this case we have a discretionary list ofcriteria where some women who met the criteria were71 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425tested.  We know in --          QUESTION:  So it would be more sustainable ifthey did this for everybody?          MS. SMITH:  I believe on some levels it wouldbe.  On the other hand, this is not like Sitz for theother reasons I mentioned.  There's a search, not a --          QUESTION:  Well I mean, which would you say, theindividualized suspicion helps or hurts, because you werearguing a moment ago that individual suspicion makes thismore suspect --          MS. SMITH:  But I don't -- I'm sorry.          QUESTION:   -- and now you're telling me that itwould have been better without it.  Well, I need toknow --          MS. SMITH:  I don't believe that there wasindividualized --          QUESTION:  -- which is the more appropriatepolicy for a hospital to use, to do this for everybody, orjust with individualized suspicion.  Which of the two?          MS. SMITH:  If there was true individualizedsuspicion, and a search was done and -- just for civilpurposes, Your Honor, that might meet Fourth Amendmentstandards.  The lower courts have held civil searches to alower level than the probable cause standard.          QUESTION:  Is DSS civil purposes?                             81 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MS. SMITH:  Yes, Your Honor, I'm sorry.  TheDepartment of Social Services is the civil child abuseinvestigatory agency.          QUESTION:  Well, let me put another hypotheticalto you, then.  Many States, maybe most States requirephysicians who in treating someone, find some indicationof criminal activity --          MS. SMITH:  Mm-hmm.          QUESTION:  -- you can't get treated for agunshot wound, for example, without having that beingreported, be reported to the police.          Now, how does that differ from -- let's assumethey're just doing routine urinalyses of pregnant women tobe sure that they don't have drugs which would make thedelivery more difficult and possibly hurt the child, andthey find drugs in someone.  Are they allowed to reportthat to the police?          MS. SMITH:  If there was a routine program, asYour Honor is presenting it, without a targeted list ofcriteria, as they had here, a discretionary list ofcriteria, which is what makes this program so different --          QUESTION:  I don't understand.  Why does thatmake it different?          MS. SMITH:  Because when you have a lawenforcement --91 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Didn't they do it to everybody?          MS. SMITH:  No, Your Honor.  They didn't searcheveryone.  They looked at a targeted list of criteria thatincluded discretionary elements such as inadequateprenatal care, and there's evidence in the record thatsome people who had inadequate prenatal care were testedand some people who had inadequate prenatal care weren'ttested, precisely because the word inadequate is so --          QUESTION:  Is there not a routine urine specimencollected for someone in the hospital and tests employed?I mean, that seems rather routine.  Is that not done forpregnant women entering a hospital --          MS. SMITH:  Not --          QUESTION:  -- in connection with a birth?          MS. SMITH:  Not in -- not to be tested fordrugs, Your Honor.  If you mean just in general are urinesamples taken, at some point during the course of prenatalcare, I believe they are, but not --          QUESTION:  Yes, and wouldn't that routinely showup something like this, or --          MS. SMITH:  No.          QUESTION:  -- do you have to apply special --          MS. SMITH:  You have to look for it.          QUESTION:  -- analysis?          MS. SMITH:  You have to search for it, Your10 1    Honor, which is what they did here. 2              QUESTION:  And is that not routine in today's 3    world, where drug use is more common, and the doctor might 4    need to know what to look for with the child? 5              MS. SMITH:  Absolutely not, Your Honor.  It's a 6    special test that would need to be run on top of what's 7    normally done and, in fact -- 8              QUESTION:  Could a doctor today, when he 9    thinks -- he has a pregnant woman, and he thinks the10    woman's taking drugs.  Doctors won't look at the urine to11    see if she's taking drugs?12              MS. SMITH:  They might, Your Honor.  I13    understood Justice O'Connor's question to be, just as a14    routine matter is it always done.15              QUESTION:  Well, I don't know if it's a routine16    matter or not.  Where I'm having the problem is, if you17    came in and told me, or the other side did, that doctors18    normally test pregnant women for drugs, that would sound19    okay to me, and moreover, if you told me no, that's not20    what they do, they normally don't, but if they think the21    woman's taking drugs and she's pregnant they do, that22    would sound all right to me, too.  I mean, after all,23    they're supposed to be looking after the health of the24    mother and the baby.25              QUESTION:  And I don't know why the latter111 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9doesn't make this more defensible than the former.          MS. SMITH:  Because what happened here was, theyincorporated a criminal sanction.          QUESTION:  Ah, all right.          MS. SMITH:  The reason they were doing thetesting --          QUESTION:  Now, if it's a criminal sanction thatmakes the difference --          MS. SMITH:  Yes, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  -- which is what I thought the casewas about, then I would like to know your response toJustice Scalia's question.1011121314    Honor?15              QUESTION:  The question was, as I understood16    it -- he's better at repeating his question than I, but I17    thought  --1819202122232425          (Laughter.)          QUESTION:  I won't resist the chance.          (Laughter.)          QUESTION:  The question, as I took it, is, it'sa normal thing, I believe, in the medical world, at leastfor psychiatric social workers and for doctors, they'reall told that if during a medical examination you discoverthat the patient is going to hurt some other person by12MS. SMITH:  Could you repeat the question, Your1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425killing, or -- you know, is going to kill the teller,they're planning a robbery, you have an obligation to tellthe police.          And of course, that's relevant, because theother side is saying that's just what's happening here.We're learning that the woman has put this viable fetus, aperson, at risk, all right.  These are children about tobe born, and they're at serious risk, and so why doesn'tthis apply.          Now that, I think was -- is that fair, that thatwas roughly the question, and why doesn't that apply?          MS. SMITH:  That's not the case here, YourHonor, because this is not a case where they were treatingpeople and in the course of medical treatment they cameacross evidence of a bullet or evidence of drug use.  Theysearched for it.  They joined with the police to determinewhat criteria they were going to use to do the search.  Itwas not a --          QUESTION:  Well, Ms. Smith --          MS. SMITH:  Yes.          QUESTION:  -- the vehicle for the discovery wasa urine sample, was it not?          MS. SMITH:  That's right, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  And I suppose you have to decide whenyou have a urine sample you could look for different131 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425things in different ways.          MS. SMITH:  That's right, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  And you say they have made a specialsearch for this kind of thing.          MS. SMITH:  Absolutely.          QUESTION:  To determine anything from a urinesample you have to make a special search, don't you?          MS. SMITH:  Well, that's true, Your Honor, butthe difference here is that the search is donespecifically to use arrest, to use the criminal sanctionand incorporate that into their treatment.          QUESTION:  So your complaint is not that it wasdone for drugs, but that the use of the discovery would beused for arrest.          MS. SMITH:  That's right, Your Honor.  As soonas they started to search, as soon as they becameessentially the police, searching for evidence of a crime,in order to use arrest as leverage they took on a new roleand they had to -- they became like a police officersearching a suspect.          QUESTION:  I gathered from some of your previousanswers to questions that you're objecting that this testfor drugs was something so highly specialized that itselfit raised a flag, but it's only that it was used inconnection with a desire to bring law enforcement to play141 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9that you object to it.          MS. SMITH:  I don't know if I understand whatyou're saying, Your Honor.  I'm sorry.          QUESTION:  Well, you know, you take a urinespecimen, and I think physicians can look for any numberof things in the urine specimen.  Each one requires aspecific procedure, and I don't think looking for drugsrequires any different sort of procedure than to look forany number of other things in the urine sample.          MS. SMITH:  Well, it requires a separate test,Your Honor.          QUESTION:  A separate --          MS. SMITH:  Is that what you mean, or --          QUESTION:  No.  I had thought that you could use          MS. SMITH:  That's true, yes, you can test10111213141516    sample.17a urine sample and test for any number of things with that181920212223    leverage.24              QUESTION:  You mean, so far as this procedure25    was concerned?15for --QUESTION:  And one of them would be drugs.          MS. SMITH:  And one of them would be drugs, butit's a specific extra step that's not done unless you meetthe criteria, and unless you want to use arrest as 1              MS. SMITH:  As far as this policy goes. 2              QUESTION:  Okay, but those criteria would be the 3    same criteria that would determine whether it was likely 4    that this woman was endangering her health and the health 5    of the child.  Are the criteria any different? 6              MS. SMITH:  Well, the criteria were changed 7    after the policy was instituted. 8              QUESTION:  Well, that doesn't -- 9              MS. SMITH:  And there's --10              QUESTION:  Are the criteria any different from11    what would be reasonable criteria to determine whether the12    woman was at risk because of drug use or was endangering13    the fetus because of drug use?14              MS. SMITH:  Absolutely.  They are not reasonable15    criteria, Your Honor --16              QUESTION:  Why?17              MS. SMITH:  -- and the experts have testified18    that criteria like inadequate prenatal care, lay prenatal19    care, preterm labor, these are medical complications of20    pregnancy --21              QUESTION:  Why doesn't the --22              MS. SMITH:  -- or they're more apt to be23    indicators of poverty than they are of drug use.24              QUESTION:  Well, why doesn't that put the woman25    and the child at greater risk --161 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MS. SMITH:  For drug use?          QUESTION:  -- that there's been inadequateprenatal care?  I mean, the drug use would be all the moredangerous for the woman and the child.          MS. SMITH:  It may have put her at greater riskfor other -- not having gotten prenatal care, but itdidn't give us any reasonable suspicion, reasonablegrounds, probable cause, whatever level of individualizedsuspicion you're looking for --          QUESTION:  Ms. Smith, may I go back --          QUESTION:  May I ask, Ms. Smith, was this thesame program instituted at any other hospital?          MS. SMITH:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  What about the other hospitals in theCity of Charleston?          MS. SMITH:  No other hospitals --          QUESTION:  Do they follow the same procedures?          MS. SMITH:  No, Your Honor and, in fact, that'sone of the things that shows the discretion.  The lawenforcement officers in this case went to the one publichospital, joined with doctors at the one public hospitalto enforce this policy.  They did not enforce this policyat the private hospitals, and they did not --          QUESTION:  Well, you're saying they didn't havethe arrangement with law enforcement at other hospitals.171              MS. SMITH:  That's right.2              QUESTION:  But you're not saying that other3    hospitals as a matter of course ignored the possibility,4    if they had reason to suspect it, they ignored the5    possibility of drug use among pregnant women.6              MS. SMITH:  Nobody at another hospital --7              QUESTION:  We --8              MS. SMITH:  That's right, Your Honor --9              QUESTION:  Yes, okay.10              MS. SMITH:  -- but nobody at another hospital11    searched their patients in order to use arrest as12    leverage.13141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Well, all right, but it's the arrestas leverage then.          MS. SMITH:  Mm-hmm.          QUESTION:  If the doctor -- as I understand it,if the doctor, acting without any prearrangement with thepolice --          MS. SMITH:  Mm-hmm.          QUESTION:  -- had said, I think we have reasonto worry about drug use in this patient, test the urine tosee if there is an indication of drug use, and thehospital had done so, they had found such an indication, Itake it in your judgment there would be no constitutional18QUESTION:  Ms. Smith -- 1    problem if they then called the police and said, we have 2    evidence that patient X is using drugs. 3              MS. SMITH:  And I think the reason why, Your 4    Honor, is because there's probable cause there.  There may 5    be a lower level of suspicion, depending on the 6    circumstances, to report to a civil authority like a 7    Department of Social Services. 8              QUESTION:  A hospital knows that it's operating 9    in an area where there is a lot of drug use, and it just10    says, as a matter of sound policy, we're going to test all11    of the patients who come in.  We have a very high12    percentage.  We don't want to take a chance.13              MS. SMITH:  Your Honor, the same reasoning --14              QUESTION:  We're doing urinalyses anyway, we're15    going to add drug use to the --16              MS. SMITH:  The same reasoning would apply to17    searches of people's homes.  There's a high crime area, we18    know there's a lot of drug sales that go on here, we don't19    like the look of these houses, they meet a criteria20 that --21              QUESTION:  But this is being done for medical22    purposes.  That's why the hospital does it.  We're23    concerned that there is a high incidence of drug use in24    this community.  We know that.  Now, you know, it's hard25    to tell who is and who isn't, but to be sure of being able191 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425to treat the woman and the child properly, we're going togive a urinalysis to everyone who comes in for drug use.          MS. SMITH:  But they can't -- the differencehere, Your Honor, is that they set out to target certainpeople, to test certain people in order to use arrest asleverage, not simply for medical purposes any more, andthe criteria, the list of criteria is a discretionary listof criteria that's now being applied in the context of apolice search, which is what made Delaware v. Prouse animproper program.          QUESTION:  What's hard for me is to figure outwhat you mean by this leverage point.  The -- imagine youhave a community with a high incidence of tuberculosis.          MS. SMITH:  Mm-hmm.          QUESTION:  Is there anything wrong with doctorssaying, you know, we're just going to regularly test ourpregnant women to see if they have it?          MS. SMITH:  Without their consent?          QUESTION:  There -- you feel -- I don't know --the consent's a separate issue here, and I suppose thatdoctors normally do get consent --          MS. SMITH:  If they were testing people --          QUESTION:   -- for the test anyway.          MS. SMITH:  If they were testing people formedical purposes and they had consent to medical care,                            201234 use. 5              MS. SMITH:  Right. 6              QUESTION:  Okay. 7              MS. SMITH:  It's not -- it is a problem, Your 8    Honor, if the purpose of the search -- 9              QUESTION:  But I'm -- just follow my reasoning.10              MS. SMITH:  Yes, I'm sorry.11              QUESTION:  All we're doing is testing the woman.12    For tuberculosis it's okay, right, with consent?then there's not a problem.          QUESTION:  Fine.  All right.  Now, suppose thatthe same -- it's not tuberculosis, but it's simply drug1314 Yes.15              QUESTION:  Same with drug use.16              MS. SMITH:  If it's medical treatment --17              QUESTION:  All right, fine.18              MS. SMITH:  -- and there's consent to do that,19 yes. 2021    course of a test that the person's about to commit a22    crime, he can report it to the police, right?23              MS. SMITH:  At that point he has probable cause24    or individualized suspicion.25              QUESTION:  All right.  So if you're that far21MS. SMITH:  If it's medical treatment, yes.QUESTION:  Now, if the doctor discovers in the1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425down the road --          MS. SMITH:  Uh-huh.          QUESTION:  -- then you give the test, youdiscover the result, and now you report it to the police,and you're saying all that's okay, and so if there'ssomething -- if you're saying all that's okay, what'sdifferent about this case?          MS. SMITH:  What's different here is that thesearch was conducted without probable cause.          QUESTION:  Those are conclusions, but what Iwant to know is, what's different from -- what happened inthe world that's different from what I just said?          MS. SMITH:  What s happened --          QUESTION:  They give the test, they discoverthere's the drug use, and they report it to the police.          MS. SMITH:  What happened that's different isthat different people are tested, because we havediscretionary criteria that are being applied in a lawenforcement setting, so we have --          QUESTION:  Well, let me ask you this withreference to this question of Justice Breyer.  I thought,and correct me if I'm wrong, that the district court foundthe hospital personnel conducted the urine drug screensfor medical purposes, wholly independent of an intent toaid law enforcement efforts.  Now, has that been221    determined to be an invalid finding?2              MS. SMITH:  He instructed the jury, Your Honor,3    that there was a dual purpose to the test, that as soon as4    there was also a law enforcement search, then the field5    changed, the search changed, and the Fourth Amendment6    applied.789          QUESTION:  But was there a finding at the -- bythe district court that it was conducted for medicalpurposes, independent of the intent to aid law10    enforcement?11              MS. SMITH:  In the context of jury instructions,12    where he then said these were conducted for both purposes,13    Your Honor, yes.14              QUESTION:  Did you, or did your counsel at the15    trial level if it wasn't you, ever ask for a finding by16    court or jury that any of the criteria used to determine17    the urine -- that this test would be made of the urine18    samples was not a criterion that was medically19    appropriate?20212223    Chasnoff.24              QUESTION:  But we don't have any finding on it25    by court, or by implication of the jury verdict, one way          MS. SMITH:  I don't believe there was a requestfor a finding, but there certainly was medical testimonyon that fact, Your Honor, from Ira Chasnoff, from Dr.23 1    or the other? 2              MS. SMITH:  That's right, Your Honor. 3              QUESTION:  Okay. 4              MS. SMITH:  The jury verdict -- 5              QUESTION:  Ms. Smith, I wish you would clarify6 one point -- 7              MS. SMITH:  Okay. 8              QUESTION:  -- because it's gotten terribly 9    confused here.10              MS. SMITH:  Okay.11              QUESTION:  I thought that you said the only12    thing that's wrong with this program was that it was13    driven -- it was a means that the police were using to14    apprehend people engaged in criminal conduct.  You said in15    answer to my question, I thought, if a doctor's just16    testing for drugs so they'll know how to treat the woman17    and the child, that's okay.  If the doctors took that test18    and gave it to the Social Service people, that's okay.  So19    all of that is okay, and we shouldn't, I think, go back20    and qualify that unless you mean to.21              I thought when you started out you said this was22    a program driven by the police.  It was their way of23    getting people who had taken drugs.  That's one thing.24              MS. SMITH:  Mm-hmm.25              QUESTION:  So I thought you said that's what24 1    makes -- infects this whole thing.  If you didn't have the 2    police driving it, it would be okay for medical purposes 3    and for social welfare purposes.  Now, is that your4 position? 5              MS. SMITH:  That is my position, Your Honor, and 6    I didn't mean to change from that.  All I meant to do was 7    clarify why I thought it was okay, and not a Fourth 8    Amendment violation, to then turn it over once you have 9    some evidence and you can meet the standards of the Fourth10    Amendment.  But it s a different --11              QUESTION:  Did the police approach the hospital,12    or did the hospital approach the police to set this13    program in --14              MS. SMITH:  The original call that went, Your15    Honor, was from the hospital to the police, but then it16    was a very preliminary inquiry, and a task force was17    formed consisting of members of all the departments, and18    the task force was actually chaired by law enforcement, by19    the Chief of Police and by the Solicitor, and the policy20    as first written was written by law enforcement, by the21    police.22              QUESTION:  But the initiative came from the23    hospital.24              MS. SMITH:  The question --25              QUESTION:  The police didn't show up at the251 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9hospital one day and say, you know, we'd like to find someway to bust your patients here.          MS. SMITH:  No.  The --          QUESTION:  It was somehow the doctors who wereconcerned that there was a problem with drug use bypregnant women.          MS. SMITH:  The question -- that's right, YourHonor.  The question originally came from the hospital tothe police, but the answer, the answer of how to cope withthis came from the police, and they wrote the policy, andthey taught the hospital how to maintain the chain ofevidence at the beginning of the search for people whofell within a list of discretionary criteria, and theyenforced this policy at this one hospital and not at anyother hospital.          QUESTION:  Okay --          QUESTION:  Suppose I thought that there wereprobable --          QUESTION:  -- could extend the policy to other          MS. SMITH:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Was there ever any effort made toextend the policy to other hospitals?          MS. SMITH:  No, Your Honor, there was not.          QUESTION:  Was there any explanation why not?261011121314151617181920    hospitals?21 22 23 24 25 1              MS. SMITH:  No, Your Honor, there was not. 2              QUESTION:  I take it that had there not been the 3    formality of the prearrangement, the agreement with the 4    police, that the result would be different in this case. 5              In other words, if they had made the phone call 6    and the police hadn't said, yeah, the way to do it is to 7    maintain the chain of custody and so on, on your own 8    reasoning there would be no constitutional violation in9 this case.10              MS. SMITH:  I think that's true, Your Honor, but11    the purpose of the warrant requirement -- at least for the12    people who tested positive and they then were reported,13    but for the people who didn't test positive and who were14    searched, we don't know who those people were, there was15    certainly a constitutional violation there, because they16    were being searched for -- no, I'm sorry, Your Honor, I'm17 wrong.18              QUESTION:  Okay.19              MS. SMITH:  Because they weren't being searched20    for law enforcement purposes.21222324    effect --25QUESTION:  So there's -- there --MS. SMITH:  You're right.QUESTION:  It is simply the agreement, inMS. SMITH:  It's the agreement, and --                  27 1              QUESTION:  -- that makes the difference between 2    constitutionality and unconstitutionality. 3              MS. SMITH:  And it's a list of discretionary 4    criteria being applied by police officers.  It's the 5    difference between Delaware v. Prouse and Sitz. 6              QUESTION:  No, but I mean, as I understand -- 7    maybe I misunderstood your answer to Justice Ginsburg a 8    minute ago.  You said in so many words it's the police 9    component of this scheme that taints it, and I understood10    that to at least imply sort of the same point that I was11    getting at with my question, that there's no finding here,12    there's no reason for -- we cannot assume here that the13    criteria for taking samples or for testing samples were14    criteria that were not medically appropriate.15              Maybe not all of them were used before, but we16    have to -- I think we have to assume, as the case comes to17    us and as you present your argument, that the reasons the18    hospital used for determining that a sample would be taken19    and the criteria for testing that sample for drug presence20    were medically appropriate criteria.21              MS. SMITH:  Well, there's no finding on that22    from the district court, and the only testimony shows that23    it's a list of discretionary criteria that is not liable24    to really find people who use cocaine --25              QUESTION:  So when you say that in so many words281    it's the police component of the scheme that taints it,2    what you mean to say is that part of the very -- the very3    determination of whether to test or not was modified from4    a medically appropriate set of criteria to at least a5    partial law enforcement set of criteria.  Is that your6    argument?78910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION:  No, but wait a minute.MS. SMITH:  Yes.QUESTION:  I want to understand you.  Yes or no,          MS. SMITH:  I think the difference is, YourHonor, that the --is that your argument?          MS. SMITH:  I think it's not quite my argument,because the issue I think is that the discretion when it'sused by a doctor for medical purposes -- doctors havediscretion and that may be appropriate in the context ofmedicine, but once discretion is used by police officersfor a law enforcement purpose, the world changes.          QUESTION:  You're saying the doctor has become apolice agent.          MS. SMITH:  Absolutely, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  So that the doctor must be treated asa police officer.          MS. SMITH:  Absolutely, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Okay.291 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MS. SMITH:  I'd like to reserve the rest of mytime for rebuttal.          QUESTION:  Very well, Ms. Smith.          Mr. Hood, we'll hear from you.              ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. HOOD               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS          MR. HOOD:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleasethe Court:          The issue presented is whether urine drugscreens for medical purposes were reasonable under thespecial needs doctrine and as consensual searches.          QUESTION:  May I just, at that very point, Ithought we had to assume for purposes of analyzing thisissue that there was no consent.          MR. HOOD:  Your Honor, we raised the issue ofconsent at trial.  We proved that each and every plaintiffconsented.  The jury found they consented.          QUESTION:  The jury found consent.          MR. HOOD:  Yes, sir.          QUESTION:  But then in affirming the juryverdict the court of appeals did not reach the issue ofconsent and said --          MR. HOOD:  Correct.          QUESTION:  -- and in fact held that even ifthere were no consent, these searches were proper under3012345678    verdict.9the special needs doctrine, is that not right?          MR. HOOD:  Yes, Justice Stevens.          QUESTION:  So don't we have to assume forpurposes of analyzing the legal issue that there was noconsent, and if there's an issue to be -- if we disagreedwith the court of appeals, in other words, we'd send itback to say whether there was evidence supporting the jury          MR. HOOD:  Well, sir, I don't agree with that,because I believe under the United States v. New YorkTelephone Company, decided in 1977, the Court is notlimited to affirm on an issue that is not really --101112131415161718192021222324    consent.25              MR. HOOD:  Correct, and that's what the Fourth31QUESTION:  Well, no, we could affirm --MR. HOOD:  Yes, sir.QUESTION:  -- on the ground that there wasconsent, but the special needs -- and then we wouldn'tneed to reach the issue of special needs.MR. HOOD:  Correct.          QUESTION:  But if we were to confront the issueof special needs, we do that on the assumption that wedon't have to decide whether there was consent or not,which is tantamount as a matter of law to saying weassume, in analyzing this issue, that there was no 1    Circuit did, Your Honor. 2              The policy purpose was to prevent pregnant women 3    from using cocaine. 4              QUESTION:  How did that work when the woman in 5    question was no longer pregnant, had given birth to the 6    child, and was taken from the hospital just after birth? 7    You can't prevent anything when a child is born. 8              As I understand it, most of these plaintiffs 9    were women who did not come in for prenatal care, but were10    tested at the time they came into the hospital to give11    birth, and then one day after the birth were removed to12    the jail.  Is that not the case, that most of these13    arrests took place after a child was born?14              MR. HOOD:  No, Your Honor.  Most of them were15    not after birth.  Several of the women -- four of them16    were before the policy became the protocol of Medical17    University, so what was going on with those four was, they18    were turned over to substance abuse, or DSS.  Because they19    were tested positive for cocaine, it was child abuse.  The20    protocol went into --21              QUESTION:  I may have misspoken when I said22    most.  Were there women among these plaintiffs who were23    tested at the time of childbirth and who were sent to jail24    the day after the child was born?25              MR. HOOD:  Yes, Your Honor, there were.321234 done. 56 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. HOOD:  The purpose there, Your Honor, waschild abuse.  The child had been subjected to cocaine, wasborn a cocaine baby with brain damage and other damagefrom the cocaine.   The Department of Social Services tookover --          QUESTION:  Was that part of the showing, thatthese children were, in fact, brain damaged?          MR. HOOD:  I didn't hear the premise.          QUESTION:  Was there a determination that thechild was, in fact, brain damaged in any of these cases?As I understand it --          MR. HOOD:  If we didn't have time --          QUESTION:  -- no one inspected the child.          MR. HOOD:   -- for the life of the policy, toanswer that question, we didn't do the follow-up studieswith these individuals, 10 individuals.          But of these 10, only five of them were actuallyunder the protocol adopted by the board of trustees ofMedical University on November 27, 1989 and each of thosefive signed a letter, when they tested positive, from theSolicitor that said, I understand that if I test positive33However --          QUESTION:  So at least as to those women I don'tsee a protective purpose.  Whatever damage was done was 1    again, I will be arrested and I will be prosecuted. 2              They went home.  They came back a week, or two, 3    or three later, tested positive again, Justice Ginsburg 4    and yes, they were arrested.  They were put in jail, not 5    only for the illegal crime of using cocaine themselves, 6    but for what they were doing to their child, and they knew 7    they were going to be arrested in each instance. 8              QUESTION:  But I thought that was irrelevant in 9    the case, because you -- perhaps I have the facts wrong,10    but I thought they were women who did not come in before,11    who came in to give birth, tested positive, the only thing12    that they signed was the kind of consent form that we all13    file when we go to the hospital for a procedure --14              MR. HOOD:  Well, Your Honor, the -- one or two15    of the women meet that category, and those women were16    before the Medical University board adopted this protocol.17    The protocol was medical.  The doctors wrote the protocol.18    There were nine criteria.  The district court found that19    those criteria were medically valid and good.20              The district court found that as to consent, we21    had to make one step further than that Solicitor letter.22    We had to show that each of those 10 plaintiffs knew that23    they could be arrested.  The jury found that they knew24    that.  That issue was briefed to the Fourth Circuit.  The25    Fourth Circuit went and affirmed the case on special341 needs. 2              This case is so much stronger than any opinion 3    the United States Supreme Court has written on special 4    needs for two reasons.  We have a medical, independent 5    clinical reason to test here.  We have child abuse, and a 6    reporting statute that's involved.  We're not just 7    stopping someone to see if they're drunk or not.  We are 8    trying to stop a woman from doing irreparable, major harm 9    to her child in utero.10              QUESTION:  I still don't see how that works out11    when the woman has had a child.  I can see if you were12    making an argument about intervening at an early stage in13    pregnancy to help the woman, but I don't understand that14    argument at all when the child is already born.15              MR. HOOD:  Well --16              QUESTION:  You say there are no such children17    except before the protocol was adopted?18              MR. HOOD:  Yes, Your Honor.  The -- if you would19    like, we can go through each one of these individuals, and20    I'm prepared to do that if you want to, but what I wanted21    to say about special needs and what the Fourth Circuit did22    and what this Court's done with special needs is, what23    we're dealing with here is a tragic crisis in society in24    1989, a true medical epidemic.  In the words of the25    plaintiffs --356 7 8 910111213141516171819    yes.2021 22 23 24 25          QUESTION:  And they did not, they did not adoptsuch a policy.          MR. HOOD:  Correct.          QUESTION:  Because of the pending lawsuit here.          MR. HOOD:  Yes, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Well, we don't know why.  I mean, you36          QUESTION:  But in only one of the city'shospitals, as I understand it.          (Laughter.)          QUESTION:  But in only one of the city's          MR. HOOD:  Your Honor, we only have one teachinghospital in Charleston.  It's the Medical University ofSouth Carolina.  It's owned by the State.          QUESTION:  How about other hospitals wherepregnant women came to give birth?          MR. HOOD:  The Solicitor at the time approachedthe other hospital, large hospital in our community, wrotethe hospital.  This lawsuit came along and everything wasstopped at my request.          QUESTION:  The Solicitor asked the otherhospital --          MR. HOOD:  If they would consider adopting theirboard of directors, of trustees would adopt the policy,12345    hospitals.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9can --QUESTION:  You said that was the reason.          MR. HOOD:  I can't -- there's no testimony inthe record to answer your question, but --          QUESTION:  Yes, so you're -- you're making --          MR. HOOD:  -- if I could be allowed to testify,I believe that's the reason.          QUESTION:  There's also no testimony in therecord that any other hospital was approached.          MR. HOOD:  Your Honor, there is a reference onpage 1128 where there's testimony, Justice Scalia, aboutDavid Swacky, the Solicitor at the time, approaching Roper          QUESTION:  And Roper Hospital refusing.          MR. HOOD:  Not as to what they did, just thatthey were considering it.  Then the lawsuit came along.          QUESTION:  Did Roper Hospital have anycomparable protocol of testing, not of informing theDepartment or the police, but did they have any comparableprotocol for testing pregnant women prior to the time theywere approached by the Solicitor?          MR. HOOD:  Justice Souter, Roper Hospital is acharitable hospital owned by doctors, and there are noother State-owned hospitals in Charleston where --          QUESTION:  I don't care whether it's State-                            3710111213    Hospital.1415161718192021222324251    owned or not.  The point I'm trying to get at is the2    medical appropriateness, or the lack of an indication of3    medical appropriateness for what was being done here, and4    my question is, if you know, or if it's in the record, is5    there any indication that Roper Hospital was following6    some kind of a protocol for treating for drug use among7    pregnant patients before they were approached by the8 Solicitor? 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. HOOD:  The answer is yes.  Every hospital inSouth Carolina follows the child abuse statute.  Thedoctors are absolutely required to.          QUESTION:  Well, the child abuse statute, as Iunderstand it, requires reporting.          MR. HOOD:  Correct.          QUESTION:  But does the child abuse statuteimpose a protocol of medical testing on doctors who treatpregnant women?          MR. HOOD:  No, it does not.          QUESTION:  Okay.  So what is the indication thatat Roper Hospital they were following a protocol oftesting urine for drug use when a pregnant woman came in?What's the record tell us?          MR. HOOD:  There's nothing in this record --          QUESTION:  Okay.          MR. HOOD:  -- but every hospital tested urine of381    every pregnant woman because they need to know what's in2    her body so they can treat her.  They're going to give her3    anesthesia.4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  All right.          QUESTION:  For drugs?  Do they test it fordrugs?  I mean, you know, it isn't an omnibus test.  Youhave to decide what you're going to test for.  Do they alltest for drugs?          MR. HOOD:  If the doctors suspect the use ofdrugs in any hospital, hopefully in this country, theytest for drugs --          QUESTION:  Well, I'm --          MR. HOOD:  -- so they can treat the patient          QUESTION:  I expect that is so, but the protocolhere went far beyond a particularized suspicion as areason for doing -- running that urine test, and I take itthat the answer, and I don't want to spend a lot more timeon this, but I take the answer is, the record does nottell us whether Roper Hospital was following any kind of acomparable protocol of testing most urine samples of mostwomen coming in for prenatal care, is that correct?          MR. HOOD:  Correct, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Okay.  One last question.  Youindicated that there were findings or determinations of391011121314    properly.1516171819202122232425 1    some sort with respect to the hospital in this case that 2    the criteria were medically appropriate.  Where do we find 3    those determinations? 4              MR. HOOD:  By the district judge himself. 5              QUESTION:  What did -- did he make specific 6    findings of fact? 7              MR. HOOD:  Yes, sir.  Judge C. Winston, our 8    senior district judge in South Carolina, on page 1415 of 9    the joint appendix states, Medical University adopted10    these medically valid criteria to avoid the very11    subjective test about which the plaintiffs complain.12              Judge Houck, at the conclusion of this 5-week13    trial, made very -- and it's in those pages, the 140014    numbers -- about each and every issue that was raised in15    this case.  He took us one step further on consent than I16    think this Court requires.  He required us to convince the17    jury that each person understood that their -- if they18    tested positive, they would be arrested.19              QUESTION:  And that -- but that -- the -- far as20    the consent is concerned, it was an argument which, as you21    said, the Eleventh Circuit didn't address, that there was22    insufficient evidence of that consent, and I looked at the23    consent form.  It doesn't say anything about police.24              MR. HOOD:  The consent form says, I consent to25    having -- to the testing of drugs, and there are two40 1    consent forms, one in the hospital, one in the clinic. 2    They both say the same thing.  Every patient signed that. 3              Then, when they suspected under this nine 4    medical diagnoses, these differential diagnoses, that the 5    patient was using cocaine, then a counselor met with the 6    patient, showed her a video, explained to her the 7    consequences, the dire, staggering consequences to her 8    child and herself of using cocaine, basically pled with 9    her to stop doing it, got her to sign this Solicitor10    letter, and sent her to substance abuse, and if she went,11    great, and that's what happened to 90 percent of them.12              QUESTION:  What happened to the people who13    didn't come in for prenatal care, who came in at the time14    of labor, and -- well, you tell me -- and tested?15              MR. HOOD:  If they tested positive they were16    given what I just said, and --17              QUESTION:  Well, tell me when they were given18    that, because it seems it would be rather stressful19    situation in which to try to get informed consent from20 someone.21              MR. HOOD:  Well, you have to put it in the22    context of what was going on.  The reason they were told23    is because it was mandatory.  The hospital board of24    directors adopted a protocol that was mandatory and25    nondiscretionary, once you met that criteria, those41 1    medical criteria. 2              QUESTION:  Yes, well, you're stepping over to 3    another question.  The one I asked concerned the argument 4    that the Eleventh Amendment didn't address the sufficiency 5    of the evidence of consent, and I was simply suggesting to 6    you that there might be a question of the sufficiency of 7    evidence of consent in the case of women who never came to 8    the hospital for prenatal care, who came in while they 9    were in labor, and what they consented to, what they10    signed at that point, there might be reason to suspect the11    legitimacy, the informed nature, the voluntary nature of12    such consent.  That's all I meant to indicate.13              MR. HOOD:  Yes, Your Honor.14              QUESTION:  Mr. Hood, I can't find your --15              QUESTION:  Well, I thought that we established16    that we take this on the assumption there was no consent.17    The court of appeals didn't address it, and for purposes18    of deciding special needs we just assume no consent.19    Isn't that correct?  You already admitted that.  Is that20    right?212223242542          MR. HOOD:  No, Your Honor, I don't concede therewas not consent.  In fact, I argued --QUESTION:  No.  No, you misunderstand me.MR. HOOD:  I'm sorry.QUESTION:  For purposes of deciding the issue on 1    which we granted certiorari, special needs exception -- 2              MR. HOOD:  Yes, Your Honor. 3              QUESTION:  -- we assume for purposes of deciding 4    that there was no consent, because consent was not 5    reviewed by the court of appeals.  The court of appeals 6    decision just said this was reasonable under the Fourth 7    Amendment.  Is that right?  I thought we aired this with 8    Justice Stevens at the outset, and yet we're getting 9    bogged down in consent, and I just want to know where we10 are. 111213141516171819202122232425          MR. HOOD:  Justice O'Connor, in my humbleopinion we have to affirm the lower court special needs.We have consent.  We have dual purpose but we do not --State actors --          QUESTION:  I thought that for purposes ofdeciding the question on which we granted certiorari wesimply assume there was no consent.  It will go back tothe court of appeals, depending on how we resolve it, todetermine whether there was consent.          Suppose we say it was unreasonable.  It would goback, then, for review of consent.  I assumed that thatwas how we were deciding it.  I thought that's what youreviewed with Justice Stevens when you began yourargument.  Am I wrong?          MR. HOOD:  You're correct, Your Honor, in that                            43 1    certiorari was granted on one issue, and that is correct. 2              QUESTION:  Yes, okay, and on that issue what 3    support in our case law do you find that supports a 4    special needs exception where law enforcement is tangled 5    up with the search?  Is there any case of ours where we 6    have so held? 7              MR. HOOD:  Your Honor, each of the special needs 8    cases apply directly, starting with the opinion of the 9    Court in TLO and Your Honor's own concurring opinion10    there, with Justice Powell.11              QUESTION:  Yes, well, we reserved the answer to12    the question in TLO, whether it would be the same answer13    if law enforcement were involved.14              MR. HOOD:  We then jump to the Griffin case from15    Wisconsin, the Sitz case, and in those opinions law16    enforcement was involved, and in our case the role of --17              QUESTION:  Not in the conduct of the search,18    were they --192021 it? 2223    involved at the time of the search.  They had nothing to24    do with the search.25              QUESTION:  Well, I thought the procedure was44MR. HOOD:  Nor was it in our --QUESTION:  -- or in the determination to haveMR. HOOD:  In our case law enforcement was not 1    developed with the assistance of the police, in part, to 2    ascertain whether there was drug use so that people could3 be charged. 4              MR. HOOD:  That's the other side's argument. 5    That was not the proven facts.  The facts -- 6              QUESTION:  As I'm thinking about this at the 7    moment on this exact point, that if you have an 8    unconsented turning over of private medical information to 9    the police, there must be something special about the10    circumstance.11              Now, the AMA, and the most famous case in this12    area, called Tarisoff, both try to define that13    circumstance, and that circumstance, as the AMA, or as14    Tarisoff defined it, involves when a patient threatens to15    inflict serious bodily harm to herself or a third party16    and there is a reasonable possibility that the patient17    will carry out that threat, so I thought that you either18    have to bring yourself within that exception, or you lose,19    and what I'm worried about at the moment is how can you20    bring yourself within that exception when you're faced21    with all the material in the amicus briefs and all the22    studies that suggest that this type of program does not23    help third parties, namely the fetus.24              Rather, there is a question as to how much25    cocaine abuse hurts the fetus, particularly compared to45 1    the situation where the mother does not request prenatal 2    care, and that this kind of program, because of the later 3    problem, the latter problem, probably hurts more fetuses 4    than it helps. 5              Now, faced with that kind of data, and I see no 6    data on the other side, I don't see how you can bring 7    yourself within the Tarisoff exception, and if you can't 8    do that, I don't see how you win the case.  That's my9 question.10              MR. HOOD:  Your Honor, we come within the11    requirements that you have outlined.12              QUESTION:  Mm-hmm, all right.  You come within13    Tarisoff.  Then you're arguing that you're within14    Tarisoff.  Fine.  How do you get there, given this mass of15    data that -- you know, that they refer to in the amicus16    briefs, that -- and I've tried to look up a little17    independently, where I've come to is the conclusion -- I'm18    not a doctor or an epidemiologist, but it seems to me that19    the studies on cocaine abuse are pretty inconclusive20    and -- as to how they affect the fetus, and even if they21    aren't, they're pretty one-sided, the studies, that this22    kind of thing hurts the fetus because mothers don't come23    in.24              MR. HOOD:  If Your Honor has a chance to look at25    page 314 of the joint appendix, your question will be461    answered by the plaintiff's lead expert, Dr. Ira Chasnoff,2    wherein he said there was an urgent need for the medical3    community to do something.  This was a major crisis, an4    epidemic in the United States, and we tried to down in5    Charleston, and it worked, and 90 percent of the people6    that had this awful addiction and were doing what they7    were doing to their children were helped, and it worked.89 are. 10We got the lawsuit, and we stopped, and here weQUESTION:  Well, am I supposed --111213    committed.14              MR. HOOD:  Correct, Your Honor.15              QUESTION:  Oh, so in other words you think that16    the Fourth Amendment permits the police to go to a doctor17    and to ask the doctor to turn unconsented -- unconsented18    private medical information over to the police about a19    past crime?  In other words, the Fourth Amendment permits20    doctors to become agents in private -- you know, private21    patient relationships and suddenly turn over everything to22    the police, even though no future risk is at stake?23              MR. HOOD:  That's the other difference of our24    case.  It's a child abuse case, where the doctor has to do25    it.  There is no privacy.  The doctor is violating the law47          QUESTION:  -- the Tarisoff case, there had beenno crime committed.  In this case there had been a crime1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425if he doesn't turn it over.          QUESTION:  Mr. Hood, don't you have a law --          QUESTION:  And that's true with gunshot wounds,and it's true with teachers who see children that havebeen beaten by their parents.          MR. HOOD:  Yes, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  And don't you have a law that anyonetreated for a gunshot wound by a physician, the fact ofthat treatment has to be --          MR. HOOD:  Yes, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  -- told to the police?  Of course.          MR. HOOD:  Just like if she, if a pregnantwoman --          QUESTION:  It happens all the time that a doctorhas to turn somebody in.          You gave us a citation earlier for the statementof the district judge to the effect that these protocolswere medically necessary.  You said pages 14 to 15 of thejoint appendix.  I can't find it.          MR. HOOD:  The judge, findings of fact start onpage 1408, Justice Scalia.          QUESTION:  1408.  You said page 14.  1408.          MR. HOOD:  I apologize.  I talk funny.  1408 --          (Laughter.)          MR. HOOD:  The order ends at 1417, Your Honor.48 1              QUESTION:  It seems there were a lot of doctors, 2    then, violating South Carolina law if only in this one 3    hospital were doctors engaged in this practice, and that's 4    a little odd. 5              They wouldn't need this protocol, and they 6    wouldn't need these meetings with law enforcement people, 7    if the law in fact required when they test, and one of the 8    things they test for is drugs, that they turn over that 9    information, but as far as this record shows it's only10    this one hospital, and only pursuant to the protocol, so11    that doesn't fit in with your statement that -- in answer12    to some questions that yes, the doctors have an obligation13    to and they do.14              Is there anything to show that apart from this15    one hospital and pursuant to this one protocol, that16    doctors who find pregnant women testing positive for drugs17    are turning over that information to the police?18              MR. HOOD:  Justice Ginsburg, I believe, and I19    can't cite a page, that several of the experts that we put20    on the stand in the 5-week trial said just that.  However,21    you have to look at the patient base that this hospital,22    the State hospital --23              QUESTION:  Say just that.  Just -- I want to be24    precise about, said just what?  They said other hospitals,25    other obstetrician-gynecologists are turning this491 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425information over to the police because that's what adoctor's obligation is?          MR. HOOD:  Well, it never -- this issue nevercame up at trial, but -- except to the extent that thiswas a teaching hospital, and every young physician in theOB department was taught about that.          QUESTION:  I'm not asking about this hospital.I'm asking about any other place.  This place has aprotocol that the police have given to this hospital.          MR. HOOD:  Not the police.  I hate to interruptyou, but the police did not do the protocol.  The doctorsdid it.          QUESTION:  In which the police participated.There were meetings --          MR. HOOD:  All the police did was say, you'vegot a duty and a responsibility here, and they --          QUESTION:  Did they say it to any otherobstetrician-gynecologist, as far as the record shows itseems to me you would have certainly put that into therecord if it existed, but what comes to us is onehospital, and -- with the nurse who asked if we couldget -- can we get the police involved.  There's not oneshred of any indication that other hospitals -- this isthe law.  The law requires them to do it.          MR. HOOD:  Justice Ginsburg, the question that                            50 1    you're asking me was not raised at trial by anyone, nor 2    answered by anyone at trial, but the answer to your 3    question is, we have, like every State, a child abuse 4    statute, and if a doctor in any practice observes child 5    abuse, they have an affirmative duty to report it. 6              QUESTION:  Mr. Hood, would you comment on this 7    point?  With minor variations, I think we're pretty much 8    agreed that if in the normal course a doctor obtains the 9    evidence that a patient is about to commit some kind of10    imminent violence or damage to another person, or if a11    doctor obtains evidence such as gunshot evidence which12    clearly points to a crime, that the doctor is permitted13    and obligated to turn that evidence over to the police and14    the police can use it.  Start with that premise.15              The argument that I want you to comment on is16    this.  That kind of a rule was derived in situations in17    which the doctors are simply going about their business,18    acting independently as physicians.  In this case,19    however, the doctors, as a result of their arrangements20    with the police, had become in effect agents of the21    police, and they were acting in a dual capacity.22              They had their medical responsibilities, but23    they were acting under an agreement with the police to24    look for certain things and to turn over information if25    they found it, and the argument is that in that case the51 1    police should not be able to use the evidence unless the 2    evidence has been searched for and seized in accordance 3    with the same rules that the police would have to follow 4    if they were doing it in the first place because 5    otherwise, in effect, the co-option of the medical 6    community will eliminate the Fourth Amendment whenever the 7    police can use the doctors.  What's your response to that? 8              MR. HOOD:  The police were never the agent of 9    the hospital.  The police were purely a means or method.10              QUESTION:  Well, let's assume that we found --11    let's just assume that we found, as a kind of a12    constitutional fact on this record, that an agency13    relationship had been established.  What is your response14    to the argument?15              MR. HOOD:  We strenuously objected it was16    established.  If it were established to the satisfaction17    of anyone, and I don't believe it was at trial or at the18    Fourth Circuit, then the role of the police, they are not19    determining who is tested.  They are not determining who20    gets the test results.  They are not determining the21    counseling of the patient.  They're not determining22    whether the patient makes the counseling sessions.23    They're not determining whether the patient signs a24    consent form, which every one of them did.  They're not25    determining whether the patient actually makes the52 1    substance abuse clinic -- 2              QUESTION:  I think what you're arguing is that 3    there's no basis for finding that kind of agency here, but 4    if we make the assumption that there is a basis, what is 5    your response to the argument that in that case the 6    criteria for police receipt and use of evidence has got to 7    be the criteria that would apply even if the doctors 8    weren't involved because otherwise the Fourth Amendment 9    gets swallowed up in the agency relationship?10              MR. HOOD:  That the Fourth Amendment doesn't11    apply, that the Court adopt the case of Attson from the12    Ninth Circuit, wherein it said the dual purpose applies,13    and if there are two purposes and one's medical and one's14 not --15              QUESTION:  No, but this --16              MR. HOOD:  -- it's okay.17              QUESTION:  Okay, and so your answer -- I mean, I18    guess I don't understand the argument.  You're saying yes,19    there's a way to say that the dual relationship doesn't20    affect it, but is there a good reason for us not to fear21    that this agency kind of relationship will swallow up the22    Fourth Amendment standards that otherwise the police would23    have to satisfy?24              MR. HOOD:  It didn't happen in this protocol, in25    this policy.  It never happened.  All they did was to531 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011 fact.12              MR. HOOD:  Yes, Your Honor, that's correct,13    Justice Scalia.  That's what Judge Houck found.14              Law enforcement was not the purpose of this15    thing at all.  It was purely the tragedy of a medical16    crisis of these pathetic babies coming into the world and17    trying to stop it, and trying to help them stop it.  They18    couldn't help themselves, some of them.19 Thank you.20              QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Hood.21              Ms. Smith, you have about 3 minutes remaining.22              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PRISCILLA J. SMITH23                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS24              MS. SMITH:  Thank you, Your Honor.  Three brief25    points, Your Honor.54help -- these people helped themselves.  Every one of themended up getting off of cocaine, and it helped.          You know, one use of cocaine can kill the baby.          QUESTION:  Mr. Hood, I guess the finding of factyou're referring to is on page 1410, and I assume thatyour colleague will address this in rebuttal.          The policy, the protocol was applied in allmaternity departments at MUSC.  Its goal was not to arrestpatients, but to facilitate their treatment and protectboth the mother and unborn child.  That's a finding of 1              What distinguishes this policy from a medical 2    protocol is that it was designed by and for law 3    enforcement, and implemented by the hospital for the 4    purposes of crime detection. 5              To say that the medical criteria was medically 6    appropriate, as I said, is different from saying that it 7    establishes probable cause or individualized suspicion, or 8    allows the hospital officials therefore to search, as 9    agents of the police, under a police policy that10    incorporates criminal sanctions for evidence of a crime,11    and to turn that right over to the police.12              And if it was probable cause, if they had13    probable cause here, why not obtain a warrant?  Why not14    test your criteria with an objective magistrate to ensure15    that you're not the discretion that's allowed in those16    criteria is not being abused.17              That's the purpose of the warrant requirement,18    is to protect against that kind of abusive discretion, and19    that's exactly the discretion we see that was used in this20    policy, where women who met the criteria were not tested,21    and women who didn't meet the criteria, perhaps, in some22    cases were.  We don't know.  We do know that some who met23    the criteria weren't tested.24              In terms of the finding of fact, in the title VI25    opinion the court, in addressing the policy as a whole,55 1    talks about the goal of the policy, the ultimate goal of 2    the policy, but when he's looking, when the trial judge 3    looked at the purpose of the search, he recognized the 4    dual nature of that searched -- search, that there was a 5    medical purpose and a law enforcement purpose, and that's 6    what brought this search under the Fourth Amendment, and 7    that's what makes this policy so insidious. 8                                 What happened here is that 9    the doctors used the promise of confidentiality in the10 private11    physician-patient relationship to obtain information from12    their patients in order to turn it over to the police.13              That's all they did here, and when they did14    that, when they took on the mantle of the police, they had15    to obtain a warrant based on probable cause, and they had16    to do that for all the reasons this Court enunciated in17    the special needs doctrine, when it limits that doctrine18    so that discretion will not invade police actions, so that19    Delaware v. Prouse is not okay, Sitz is, because of that20    discretion.21              And that's why, even if this Court were to apply22    the balancing test here, we've got a case that's got23    discretionary criteria, we have a significant intrusion on24    the body, not a minimal intrusion like we had in Sitz, and25    we have no diminished expectation of privacy.  In fact, we56 1    have a heightened expectation of privacy in our 2    doctor-patient relationship, and as the amici point out 3    much better than I could, that's what's at stake in this4 case. 5              So we ask this Court -- 6              CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Ms. Smith. 7              MS.
