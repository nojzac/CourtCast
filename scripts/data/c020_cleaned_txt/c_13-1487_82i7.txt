The United States.      Mr. Ortiz.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. ORTIZON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. ORTIZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      This case asks whether the felon inpossession statute prevents the court from ordering thegovernment to transfer firearms in its possession thatare owned by a felon to ­­ to a suitable third party.  Thegovernment now concedes that a court can order transferto a licensed gun dealer, who will then sell thefirearms on the owner's behalf.      That concession alone requires reversal.Neither court below understood that it had such power.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why isn't ­­ is that enough for your client? He wants to sell the firearms to ­­ the government is willing to let a licensed firearms dealer sell them for him?MR. ORTIZ: Yes, Your Honor. He ­­ that's not his preferred remedy, but that is an acceptable3￼25 JUSTICE GINSBURG:Is there any point in the￼1 remedy for him. In fact, it is one of the remedies that2 he ­­ he suggested below.3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did ­­ I didn't ­­ I4 thought that before the district court there was only5 first, his friend, then his mother, and then another6 friend. Where ­­ where did he ask the court to allow7 the guns to be sold by a licensed gun dealer?8 MR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, you can see the9 references on page 71, 170, 132 and page 195 of the10 joint appendix. On page 71 in his renewed request for11 disposition of property, Mr. Henderson said that the ­­12 said that the owners quote, “have property interest in13 the firearms which must be accommodated by the sale,14 transfer, or storage of the firearms in spite of his own15 possessor rights having been curtailed.” On page 170 ­­16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that doesn't mention17 anything about a gun dealer, and he had been quite18 specific about the persons to whom he wanted the guns19 transferred.20 MR. ORTIZ: Well, Your Honor, the ­­ in21 the ­­ in the Miller case, which he cites there for the22 proposition that a sale would be an appropriate remedy,23 the sale was through ­­ license ­­ one of the24 possibilities was sale through a licensed gun dealer.4￼1 references that you made where he said to the court, "I2 would like these guns to be consigned to a licensed gun3 dealer?”4 MR. ORTIZ: He, twice, Your Honor, did5 not ­­ he did not mention the word licensed gun dealer,6 but he said transfer for sale, did not limit it to any7 particular person. And on page 132 in his objections to8 the magistrate judge's report and recommendation, he9 asked the court to grant the request that this Court10 ordered that a person lawfully titled­­ entitled to own11 the subject firearms collection12 and control and direct that the13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:14 mission in this circuit?be awarded possessionpayment ­­Wasn't he on a futile15 MR. ORTIZ: Yes, Your Honor, he was on a16 futile mission in this circuit.17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because this circuit had18 already ruled that any kind of sale by anyone was19 prohibited, because he was a felon.20 MR. ORTIZ: That is21 Sotomayor. It is also ­­22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:23 appeal, he cited the Brown case24 circuit court, which had held that a court­ordered sale25 was okay.5clear, JusticeAnd when he went up onto the court ­­ to the￼1 MR. ORTIZ: Yes, Your Honor.2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And despite him citing3 the Brown case, the Eighth Circuit continued with its4 own precedent and said no one can sell it, not even the5 court.6 MR. ORTIZ: Yes, Your Honor. He – he ­­ he7 did make that clear to the Eleventh Circuit, but nowhere8 in his request for sale or transfer below did he9 specifically limit it to someone who was not a licensed10 gun dealer. This request at the end of his objections11 to magistrate judge's report is broad enough to12 contemplate that. He ­­13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have14 thought ­­ I would have thought you would oppose the15 notion that that would be an adequate ­­ adequate16 relief. If we're talking about an attribute of17 ownership, the owner gets to decide who ­­ to whom he's18 going to sell what he owns.19 MR. ORTIZ: Yes, Your Honor. It is ­­ it20 may, in this particular case, because it was one of the21 remedies that he actually requested be possible, but it22 was not his preferred remedy. This Court should have23 the power to approve sales and transfers so long as the24 recipients are not under the control or influence of the25 owner, so long as they themselves are legally entitled6￼1 to own and possess the guns, and so long ­­2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you ­­ how does3 one tell ­­ let's take the two people ­­ two friends4 that you opposed ­­ suggested transferring them to, or5 his wife so they could stay within the family. How does6 the Court know whether that transfer will give him7 access to the guns so that he will have possession?8 MR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, it's up to the9 district court to hold a hearing on the issue. The10 standard is reasonableness. There's no equitable11 analysis. The court can notify the suggested12 transferees that they are giving the ­­ allowing13 Mr. Henderson any access to the guns would constitute a14 criminal violation. The court can, as the Seventh15 Circuit suggested, resign­­ required signed statements16 from the proposed transferees that they will never let17 the owner again have control or influence over the use18 of the guns.19 There are example ­­ it's a case­by­case20 determination however. In some cases the court may be21 persuaded that such transfers would be appropriate. In22 other cases, the court may well not, and that begins ­­23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And under what statutory24 rule or authority does the court hold that hearing?25 MR. ORTIZ: This is under its traditional7￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425equitable principles or authority, Your Honor. JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there a black­lettercase you can cite for the proposition that the court hasthis general equitable authority?MR. ORTIZ:      JUSTICE KENNEDY:the government wants tosomething.  That's what      MR. ORTIZ:courts that have done this, Your Honor, have cited incases like Wilson and Wright from the D.C. Circuitbefore Rule 41 was amended in 1989, pointed out thatthey had ancillary jurisdiction to this, and since whichdoes not violate Kokkonen or Peacock v. Thomas becausein this case, the ­­ Mr. Henderson was ordered to giveup the guns as a condition of his release.  The court'sreturning of the property can be seen as its givingeffect to its own orders and decrees.JUSTICE KAGAN: You agree that ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: And 41(g) is too much of astretch?MR. ORTIZ: No, Your Honor, we believe thatRule 41(g) would also work here.  The government takes amuch narrower view of the course.      Mr. Henderson did not actually ask for8Well, Your Honor ­­      Because I'm wondering ifsue under the Tucker Act orI'm asking.Yes, Your Honor.  No.  The lower￼1 relief under 41(g) himself. He asked for it under2 general equitable principles, which other courts have3 allowed. It is the government that tried to narrowly4 characterize his request as one under Rule 41(g) and now5 takes a ver­­ narrow approach towards the word return,6 and suggests that he is unable ­­ he should be unable to7 seek transfers of his guns for that reason.8 JUSTICE KAGAN: But it's not just return;9 right? It's return the property to the movant.10 MR. ORTIZ:11 JUSTICE KAGAN:12 41(g)?13 MR. ORTIZ:14 transaction under Rule 41(g), Your Honor. He is asking15 for the guns to be transferred, and as part of that16 transfer, for him to receive payment. He is not asking17 for the gun itself, admittedly. But he is asking the18 court to structure the transaction in such a way that he19 would receive the economic benefit.20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: He's asking for the stick21 and the bundle that's called ownership and ­­ and the22 funds from the transfer.23 MR. ORTIZ: Yes, Your Honor. He is asking24 for the ownership; in particular, the right to transfer.25 And that ­­ the Eleventh Circuit held that the right, by9Yes, Your Honor.    So how does this fit underWell, it's a kind of complicated￼1 transferring the property, he was necessarily receiving2 constructive possession of it. And that holding is3 wrong for at least six different independent reasons.4 It violates the plain language of the statute. It5 violates traditional understanding, common law6 understandings of what possession entails. It violates7 the statutory structure and at least two canons of8 statutory interpretation. It violates the statutory's9 purpose by preventing felons from completely alienating10 their interest in their guns.11 It also allows the government to accomplish12 a forfeiture without any due process at all. And, Your13 Honors, it raises serious takings, due process, Fourth14 Amendment, Second Amendment, and Eighth Amendment15 concerns.16 JUSTICE KAGAN: Just so I understand the17 scope of your position, you say that the district court18 has discretion to figure out, you know, whether a19 particular person whom your client or someone else wants20 to sell the gun to is an appropriate recipient of the21 gun. But in the absence of that, does the district22 court just have discretion or must the district court23 ensure that the gun is sold through a gun dealer?24 In other words, if ­­ if your client says25 really I want it sold through a gun dealer, is that10￼1 discretionary on the district court's part or is that2 required?3 MR. ORTIZ: That would be required, Your4 Honor, although there might be some argument about the5 particular gun dealer. Maybe the one is ­­ one is6 proposed that petitioner believes would be inappropriate7 for some reason.8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry, would you9 repeat that?10 MR. ORTIZ: Sorry. The court ­­ lower11 court, Your Honor, would be required under those12 circumstances that Justice Kagan had proposed to order a13 sale by a licensed gun dealer. It's possible that there14 might be some argument about a particular ­­ whether a15 particular gun dealer would be appropriate or not.16 JUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you a question17 about your argument that a district court would have the18 discretion to prevent the transfer of a gun from the19 convicted felon to a third party who has some20 acquaintance with the convicted felon? A friend, let's21 say. Let's say it's a friend who lives two blocks away.22 Now, if this friend doesn't ­­ is not himself a23 convicted felon or doesn't have some other aspect of his24 record that would prevent him from buying a firearm, he25 could go to a licensed firearm dealer, presumably, and11￼1 purchase it directly; right?2 MR. ORTIZ: Yes, Your Honor.3 JUSTICE ALITO: So why should the4 situation ­­ and that would be true even though he is a5 friend of the convicted felon, and there might be some6 risk that he would allow the convicted felon to use the7 firearm.8 So why should the situation be different9 when the district court is considering whether the10 firearm can be transferred from the convicted felon to11 this individual?12 MR. ORTIZ: It shouldn't be any different.13 JUSTICE ALITO: But I thought you14 understood ­­ I thought you were saying that the district15 court would have the discretion to prevent that transfer16 if the district court thought there was some risk that17 this individual would allow the convicted felon to have18 access to the firearm.19 MR. ORTIZ: If, in its hearing, the district20 court is not ­­ insufficiently convinced that there is21 independence between the owner and the transferee, it22 might, as an exercise of its equitable23 discretion because it is a question of equity, refuse24 the direct transfer and put it up for ­­ put the25 firearms for sale through a licensed gun dealer.12￼1 JUSTICE ALITO: And then that individual2 could go to the ­­the licensed firearm dealer and buy3 exactly the same gun.4 MR. ORTIZ:5 JUSTICE ALITO:6 positions are ­­7 MR. ORTIZ:8 the extreme, Justice ­­ Justice Alito, imagine a situation9 where someone in this position is proposing transfer to an10 unindicted drug kingpin, something like that. The11 government presumably would object to the transfer, not12 because the person is indicted, the drug kingpin hasn't13 yet, but because they have suspicions about his14 activity. The drug kingpin, in that position, could15 presumably go to a gun dealer and buy whatever firearms16 the drug ping ­­ kingpin wanted. But it is not outside17 of the court's authority to take that fact into account.18 Those circumstances, I believe, would be19 very few and far between. In most cases, so long as20 the ­­ the transferee is not under the owner's control21 and the transferee has the legal ability to own and22 possess the guns, the district court, normal course,23 should approve the transfer. But there may ­­24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And who ­­ who makes the25 arrangement?

Does the court dothat ­­it?MR. ORTIZ:JUSTICE GINSBURG:I believe ­­       ­­ or does Henderson do￼      MR. ORTIZ:courts have ­­ or the courts below have taken thisapproach, Your Honor, it's usually a matter ofnegotiation between the government and the felon.JUSTICE KAGAN: And, Mr. ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I would assume it ought to be the gun owner's first preference. I mean, why ­­ why wouldn't that be the normal situation? His first preference is that it ­­ it should be sold to ­­ to individual X. And if the court cannot reject that, it should go there. And his second preference is, well, if you reject that, give it to Y. Wouldn't that be the normal?MR. ORTIZ: That would be the normal, Your Honor. We certainly believe that Petitioner should have that right and the Petitioner's nominee of the gun dealer should be accepted.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think Justice Alito's question is basically why would the district court have equitable power to turn down any named buyer so long as14In the cases where the district￼1 it is an actual buyer. Meaning I can understand he2 can't just designate someone who's himself, okay, but if3 he's making a good faith sale, why should the district4 court have any power to turn that person down?5 MR. ORTIZ: Justice Sotomayor, the district6 court shouldn't have that power unless the public7 interest, which is always a concern in equity, would be8 violated by it, and those cases would be few and far9 between. The one I mentioned, the sale ­­ the proposed10 transfer to an unindicted drug ping ­­ kingpin might be11 extreme enough for that to be possible, but ordinarily,12 the district court should have ­­ not have that power.13 JUSTICE KAGAN: And, Mr. Ortiz, why ­­ why14 is it required that the court arrange for some transfer,15 whether to a gun dealer or otherwise? Is it principles16 of equity that require that? Is it something else?17 MR. ORTIZ: Well, Your Honor, there's no18 statutory bar to it. There's always ­­19 JUSTICE KAGAN:20 MR. ORTIZ:21 there's no ­­22 JUSTICE KAGAN:23 statutory bar, but I guess I'm asking a further question24 because you said in response to my earlier question it's25 not just discretionary, it's required, you know, at15    Right.­­ principles of equity andThere ­­ there's no1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425least to a gun dealer.  And ­­ and I guess I'm asking:What is the source of that requirement?MR. ORTIZ: Well, that requirement has several sources. Part of it is the Due Process Clause where the government can't basically effect a forfeiture without affording any process, which the Eleventh Circuit rule would allow.      There are also concerns under the TakingsClause.  There's ­­ there also may well be anunreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment.  Thereare Excessive Fine Clause issues.  In fact, this Courthas all of those constitutional doubts and concerns thatargue in favor of the remedy that Mr. Hendersonrequested.      If there are no further questions, YourHonor, we'd like to reserve the remaining time forrebuttal.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Ms. O'Connell.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL       ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMS. O'CONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      If a convicted felon selects a recipient ofhis firearms and negotiates the terms of a transfer but16￼￼1 then relies on someone else to deliver the firearms, he2 still has the power and intention at a given time to3 exercise dominion and control over those firearms, which4 amounts to constructive possession.5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where did it ­­ the6 ability to sell something depends upon ownership, not7 possession. If I leave my car with a garage for a8 month, the garage has possession, but they can't sell9 the car. I don't have possession, but I can sell the10 car.11 In other words, I don't see how it gets to12 be constructive possession. All he's asserting is a13 right to ownership, which carries with it the right to14 sell.15 MS. O'CONNELL: The definition of16 constructive possession, which everybody agrees is17 included within the word "possession" in 922(g), is when18 a person has the power and intention at a given time to19 exercise dominion and control over the property, either20 directly or through others.21 And it's our position that if he is22 selecting the recipient, excluding others from receiving23 it, and negotiating the terms of the sale, that he has24 the power and intention at that time to exercise25 dominion and control over those firearms.171 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      We've cited some papers ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But he doesn't ­­ he doesn't have much control when the government is holding them. He's ­­ he's just trying to sell them. He doesn't want to control them. He doesn't want to use them. He doesn't want to possess them, constructively or otherwise. In fact, he wants to get rid of them, which is what the statute is supposed to accomplish.MS. O'CONNELL: Right. So we agree that the convicted felon can sell the firearms. They can be sold. There's a question of who should be selling them. On our end, we think that they should go to a licensed firearms dealer, a Federal firearms licensed dealer, or an FFL, who is licensed and expected to sell firearms.JUSTICE KAGAN: But do you think that the ­­ the person can pick the firearms dealer?MS. O'CONNELL: Yes. We think that's fine.JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, then your ­­ your position is internally contradictory, right? You think he can pick the firearms dealer. Well, that's ­­ that fits within your very broad definition of control.MS. O'CONNELL: I ­­ I don't think so, and let me explain why. When he picks the firearm dealer, he is not exercising any control over where the firearms land. The firearms dealer is an expected and a licensed18￼￼1 seller of firearms, so we don't expect him to keep them2 or be subject to the convicted felon's control at all.3 If he's nominating someone or selling them4 to a specific person, then he has exercised control over5 where they're going. He has excluded others. And we6 think that amounts to constructive possession.7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, then suppose his8 friend comes forward and says, I don't really intend to9 possess this. I'm going to sell it.10 That wouldn't be control?11 MS. O'CONNELL: Well, I think there's ­­ so12 as I was saying, there's a question over who sells it.13 We think the FFL. The Petitioner thinks he can sell it14 himself to ­­ to a friend, and we think that amounts to15 constructive possession.16 In the middle, there's a question of can a17 neutral third party sell them. And as ­­ as we think18 the ­­ the Federal firearms licensed dealer is the right19 one to sell. But on my theory of constructive20 possession I've just laid out, you point out, yes, any21 third party could, if the Court determines that they are22 not subject to the felon's control, execute this sale.23 However, a Court sitting in equity should24 not be required to accept the convicted felon's25 designation of somebody who's going to sell ­­191 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      JUSTICE SCALIA:that constructive possession only consists of being ableto decide where they go?

I ­­ I don't know why that isn't exercising dominion and control. It seems to me you're drawing a very artificial line. You only ­­ you ­­ you can only exercise dominion and control when you determine where they end up, but I ­­ I don't see that that comes within ­­ within the term "constructive possession."MS. O'CONNELL: If he is just ­­ if there is just a party that's appointed to sell the firearms for him, and we ­­ we have to get rid of them somehow, and so we think the best way to do it is to give them to a licensed firearms dealer.      And ­­ and, Justice Scalia, you know ­­20Why ­­ well, why do you sayI think ­­ ­­ of ­­ of dominion overI think it's harder to say7 makes that distinction.

I mean, this is ­­ this constructivepossession question, it would seem to me to make a lotmore sense to ask the person who's going to end upgetting it, is there a chance that the original ownercan control what that person does with it.      In other words, you know, I give it to mywife, I give it to my best friend, and I'm really in aposition where I'm controlling the use of the firearm.And that seems to me to make perfect sense, not the23￼Why isn't that exercising￼1 question of, like, who controls the sale mechanism.2 MS. O'CONNELL: I ­­ I agree with you,3 Justice Kagan, that it makes perfect sense to look at4 whether the felon has control over the person that gets5 the firearms, but I think there's a separate time period6 that we need to look at during the sale to determine7 whether he's exercising dominion and control over the ­­8 JUSTICE BREYER: Where does all this come9 from? I mean, to me, when somebody uses the word10 "constructive X," that just means it's not X and ­­ and11 it's a way of pretending that it's X when it isn't.12 So I start with that and say what you're13 worried about here ­­ of course, he doesn't have any14 possession of it. You have possession of it. And what15 he wants to do is he wants to put it somewhere so he16 can't get ahold of it as long as the law prevents him17 from having it. And you took it from him. You made him18 give it to him.19 So what's wrong with his saying, you go give20 it to somebody? Now, if it's too much trouble, the21 judge can say he can't make you go to a lot of trouble.22 If it's giving it to somebody who might really do23 everything he wants, we'll guard against that. That's24 the job of the district judge. End of case.25 Now, what ­­ what's ­­ what's ­­ simple,24JUSTICE BREYER:MS. O'CONNELL:JUSTICE BREYER: I ­­If there are ­­￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425realistic, preserves the government's interest.  What'swrong with it?MS. O'CONNELL: I think, Justice Breyer, that we are not pulling our constructive possession position out of thin air.                             ­­ things like that, and Idon't understand any piece of it that has something inthat like it.MS. O'CONNELL: We have ­­ the cases we'vecited ­­ I want to draw your attention to the caseswe've cited on pages 25 and 26 of our brief that involveconvicted felons who are out in the world and they arenegotiating sales of firearms.      And they are saying, Hey, buyer, do you wantto buy this firearm?  Let's negotiate the terms.  Andthen since I can't possess them, I'm going to havesomebody else drop them off.      And courts have concluded in thosecircumstances that's constructive possession.JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So we don't want them. So we'll say to the district judge, Judge, use some common sense. Don't let this gun get into the hands of the crime boss of the area. Don't let the25￼1 things that you were just talking about happen.2 And you look to see how much trouble it is,3 what's likely to happen, and where it makes sense. And4 if it isn't likely for these bad things to happen, fine.5 MS. O'CONNELL: Those cases, though, are not6 concerned with we ­­ we want to double check on who the7 buyer is and see if that buyer is going to be subject to8 the convicted felon's control. They are looking at the9 felon's ability to move guns around throughout the10 world.11 JUSTICE KAGAN: But that seems to me very12 different than the situation here, Ms. O'Connell,13 because in that case, what the gang leader has is a14 situation where somebody else is holding a gun for him15 and he can say anything to that person. He can say, Use16 the gun. He can say, Keep the gun in your closet. He17 can say, Sell it to Person A or Person B or Person C.18 He has total freedom over it.19 And that's very different from the situation20 here where the only thing that a person would ­­ a21 person in Mr. Henderson's position can do is to sell the22 gun to a person whom the court approves.23 MS. O'CONNELL: I don't ­­ I don't think24 that any of the cases that I was just referring to25 involve situations where the convicted felon has control26￼1 over the person that's receiving the gun. All of them2 just have to do with the convicted felon's ability make3 a gun appear somewhere when he says to and to show that4 he ­­ he ­­ he's exercising dominion and control over5 the guns by negotiating the terms of their sale and6 identifying buyers for them.7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but he doesn't ­­ he8 doesn't have to get anybody to approve the buyer. I9 think what Justice Kagan is saying, it's ­­ it's a lot10 harder to say you have dominion and control when you11 have to come before an equity court and say, Please, may12 I, you know ­­ please may I have ­­ have the gun given13 to my best friend or to somebody else. That doesn't14 sound much like dominion and control to me.15 MS. O'CONNELL: We ­­ we acknowledge that16 because the guns are in our possession and the17 Petitioner needs a court order in order for them to go18 somewhere, that the court is exercising, also, some19 control over the weapons; but by reserving this right to20 nominate somebody to receive them, the convicted felon21 is also exercising control over the weapons.22 I'll point out that in the Petitioner's23 opening brief when he described the main attributes of24 possession, he said the right to control and the right25 to exclude. And his theory in the reply brief that, oh,27￼1 I'm just nominating somebody, is certainly an exercise2 of the right to exclude other people from getting their3 hands 4567 world8 there's no exclusion. If I wanted to go into that case9 and ask the court to consider me rather than the10 nominee, it's a court of equity. And the court could11 say I'm the better owner than the person they nominated.12 So I don't know what this ­­ why this13 nomination becomes control over the sale if it's the14 judge who's approving the sale.15 MS. O'CONNELL: Well, I think because ­­ I16 don't ­­ I don't know that it's true that any other17 person could just come in and ask for the firearms. I'm18 not aware of that.19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you're saying the20 court is the one who decides whether the person who's21 nominated is appropriate or not.22 MS. O'CONNELL: Right. The court ­­ the23 court can say yes or no after weighing equitable24 factors; but if it says yes, then the felon is25 exercising a right to control and to exclude ­­28on the firearms.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:JUSTICE SCALIA:JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   Well, the reality is ­­Is this ­­                          The reality is that theis not going to know the guns are there, so ­­ but￼1 JUSTICE BREYER:2 have happen; that is, the gun was taken away from him.3 MS.

What do you think10 should happen?11 MS. O'CONNELL: We think it should go to a12 Federal firearms licensed dealer for a sale. And I ­­ I13 want to make clear that if the ­­ if the Court disagrees14 with our constructive possession theory, I think that's15 probably where Justice Scalia is and I don't know how16 many other people are in that boat, but I think the17 Court should certainly make clear in its opinion that18 because the ­­ the district court looking at this relief19 is sitting in equity, it is not required to broker a20 sale between a convicted felon and his friend. The21 court could still order that the firearms instead be22 sent to an FFL.23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the idea ­­ the24 idea that it should be sold through a Federal firearms25 dealer is a late idea. This was not something the29But what is it you want toYes. He can't possess itof the court, I guess, orIt's a 1891 collector's Nobody is claiming it's￼1 government proposed at any stage below until the case2 came here, right?3 MS. O'CONNELL: Right. We certainly didn't4 propose it, but I ­­ I also don't think it's correct to5 say that the Petitioner was ­­ was proposing this as6 relief that he wanted. He did say in the ­­7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what did you8 anticipate ­­ what was your position before you changed9 it here in this Court about what should happen to the10 guns?11 MS. O'CONNELL: I mean, I think in the12 Eleventh Circuit, Federal law enforcement officers that13 have these guns and are trying to decide what to do with14 them when they get the request coming in from the felons15 were ­­ were certainly under the impression that Howell16 controlled and that they certainly couldn't give it to17 somebody that was selected by the convicted felon, but18 also that they couldn't sell it. And ­­19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Has the Federal20 government ever used these guns?21 MS. O'CONNELL: No, and if we ­­22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not these particular23 ones but guns that were forfeited by a convicted felon24 and someone who couldn't sell them to anyone, at least25 until you changed the position and said they could sell30￼1 them to a firearms dealer? They just sat around2 gathering dust?3 MS. O'CONNELL: They ­­ they do, because we4 don't ­­ if the opinion is affirmed, if there's, you5 know, nothing to do with these guns, we don't gain title6 to them. I think there would need to be an extra step.7 In a lot of the court of appeals cases that present this8 issue, when the convicted felon filed his Rule 41(g)9 motion, the government filed, in response, a motion to10 prefer permission to destroy the firearms, or something11 like that. But there is nothing like that in this case.12 We wouldn't gain title to them.13 But ­­ but we think ­­ we do agree that our14 position, maybe not necessarily in this case, because15 the relief that Petitioner was asking for was always to16 have it transferred to somebody in specific; but I17 completely agree that we have said in briefs before, we18 understood Howell to also prohibit a sale.19 So what I think the appropriate relief for20 this Court to ­­ what the Court should do to dispose of21 the case would be to affirm the Eleventh Circuit's22 holding that the convicted felon cannot select somebody23 to receive his firearms, but then remand for ­­ if the24 Court adopts our Federal licensed firearms dealer25 position, to determine whether that relief ­­31￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA:2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:3 you're ­­ I'm a little bit upset at your brief, frankly,4 because in that circuit, he couldn't know that there was5 any permissible sale, because that circuit had said6 none.7 And so to come back and say to us that we8 should leave it in their discretion as to whether it9 should go to a ­­ a Federal10 firearms dealer seems as if11 trap for a pro se litigant.12 MS. O'CONNELL:13 not trying to do that. The14 just articulated was if the15 said in our brief and our view of constructive16 possession, it should affirm what the Eleventh Circuit17 said with respect to he cannot transfer the firearms to18 a person of his choosing. But we ­­ we would not oppose19 a remand for the court of appeals to ­­ or the district20 court to look at this at that ­­21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not ­­ that's22 not going to get it done. You still have the problem of23 the court below's view of the Unclean Hands Doctrine.24 Do you have a position, the Federal government ­­ does25 the Federal Government have a position on that doctrine32Well, that wouldn't ­­   But the same trap that­­ a federally licensedthe government has set aWe are ­­ we are certainlyposition that I think I'veCourt agrees with what we've￼1 now?2 MS. O'CONNELL: We do not think the Unclean3 Hands Doctrine applies in this case. I'm sorry if that4 was not clear from the footnote in our brief, but we5 disavowed that holding of the Eleventh Circuit. We are6 perfectly fine with you writing an opinion, and you7 should, saying that the Eleventh Circuit should not have8 relied on that doctrine. The Unclean Hands Doctrine9 typically requires the ­­ the uncleanliness of your10 hands, to be tied to the equitable relief you are11 seeking.12 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that going to be your ­­13 your position ­­ I mean, because I'm getting away from14 the ­­ what I call the legal mumbo­jumbo. Looking at15 the word "possessed" there, fine. It's a question of16 interpreting that. And now where I thought, well, he17 can't just have it sold to anybody. I mean, it could be18 sold ­­ you don't want it sold to somebody who's going19 to do his bidding every five minutes. I mean, maybe20 he'd even agree with that.21 And that now you're taking the opposite22 extreme. You're saying the only way to administer this,23 is the only thing really you can do with it, is you can24 sell it to a Federal ­­ through a Federal firearms25 dealer. And there are probably intermediate positions.33￼1 You know, I mean, somebody has a very valuable antique2 weapon the Normans used to shoot or something. And he3 says, I don't want to sell it. I'm going to be able to4 possess it again in ten years. They'll forgive me for5 whatever it is, and maybe you should accommodate that,6 or maybe you shouldn't.7 I have no feeling for how important it is to8 have an absolute rule. You've given some good reasons9 for it. What am I supposed to do? Just say everybody10 agrees here you can't sell it your best friend who will11 keep it to you, so they're wrong on that rule. The12 government's position's is now let's do something else13 with it. Maybe absolute. Maybe not. Go work it out,14 Eleventh Circuit. Go work it out, lower court. What15 should we do?16 MS. O'CONNELL: Yeah, I think that's ­­ that17 is a perfectly fine solution. I think whatever the18 Court is going to hold with respect to constructive19 possession, we certainly hope that the Court will agree20 with us that a transfer to a person selected by the21 convicted felon is an act of constructive possession.22 But we are totally fine with the licensed firearms23 dealer option, and I don't ­­ it's not something we24 could have worked out with him now, because he is still25 presenting in this Court the ­­ the preferred option346 there7 would89 to beany other transferee in the government's view thatbe appropriate?MS. O'CONNELL: No. We think it would havesold, and that the ­­ he could obtain the economic￼1 that they be given to his friend.2 JUSTICE BREYER: Is this Federal license ­­3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Sold ­­ that is ­­ is it4 the government's position that it's the licensed firearm5 dealer or ­­ in effect, forfeited to the government? Is10 value11 possessory interest.12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it would have to be13 sold, but the sale would be ­­ or the consignment would14 be to a licensed dealer. You're rejecting the friends.15 You're rejecting the wife.16 MS. O'CONNELL: I'm ­­ I'm rejecting his17 ability to decide who to sell it to. I think I ­­ I18 tried to explain in a ­­ in response to a question from19 Justice Kagan earlier, I don't think it's ­­ it's20 necessarily true that the firearms dealer is the only21 neutral third party that can sell firearms. And under22 our theory of constructive possession, he wouldn't be23 controlling the destination of the firearms if they were24 given to somebody other than a licensed firearms dealer,25 who was not subject to the control of the convicted35of it because 922(g) only extinguishes his￼1 felon. But we certainly think that given the statutory2 backdrop where firearms are typically sold through an3 FFL, that we think that is what Court should do.4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can he select the FFL? Can5 he select the Federal ­­ I mean, you know, suppose the6 government says we want it sold by a firearms dealer in7 San Francisco and he says, what? You know, they don't8 sell any guns in San Francisco. I want it ­­ you know,9 I want it in ­­ in Dallas.10 (Laughter.)11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can ­­ can he pick the12 firearms dealer?13 MS. O'CONNELL: What we have said is yes, he14 can ­­ the district court has to figure out who's going15 to sell these firearms. And maybe the parties can16 nominate firearms dealers. What I ­­ what I tried to17 say before was that I don't ­­ the Federal government,18 certainly the agencies that I am here representing, have19 said they don't necessarily have the resources to, in20 every case like this, go out and try to find a firearms21 dealer to do this. So we don't ­­ and we don't think22 it's an act of constructive possession for him to pick23 the neutral third party that's going to make an arm's24 length transaction to the entire universe of eligible25 buyers.36￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice ­­ Justice2 Alito.3 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what would happen if4 someone is on trial for a felony and has in ­­ in his5 house a number of firearms and then the person is6 convicted? So what ­­ how can that person deal with the7 firearms in the house without exercising constructive8 possession in your view?9 MS. O'CONNELL: So, this is probably the one10 scenario where somebody like ­­ I don't know that he11 couldn't have made arrangements beforehand, but we don't12 really expect him to because he could be holding out13 hope he's going to be acquitted. I think if he has14 firearms in the house and then he is convicted and he15 becomes a convicted felon, I mean, maybe he's ­­ I16 presume he's going to jail. Maybe he will stay home17 first. But you're right. That does propose sort of a18 dilemma where we're saying he can't tell somebody else19 what to do with the firearms.20 I think if courts were looking at that21 below ­­ and, of course, it's not something that is a22 problem in this case because this Petitioner pleaded23 guilty. And he acknowledged in his plea agreement that24 he was about to become prohibited from possessing25 firearms. But I think that if courts determined in a37￼1 particular case that it was a problem, like all of a2 sudden I am in a status where I can't possess firearms3 and if I go home, I'm immediately in violation of the4 statute, that courts could determine that there's like a5 statutory background principle that you have a6 reasonable amount of time to come into compliance with7 this.8 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, then why can't we do9 that here?10 MS. O'CONNELL: Well, because that ­­ that11 is not the type of ­­ a petitioner who pleads guilty is12 not in that position. He knew when he pleaded guilty13 that he was about to lose his ability to possess14 firearms.15 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, your whole16 argument ­­ the reason I took it that the government17 wants this firearm thing, firearm dealer, is they say,18 look, there are a lot of guns and these guns should be19 safe and we're afraid he'll give them to a friend, and20 we're afraid maybe21 only safe thing to22 Okay.23 case. It's just happened that the government didn't get24 the guns first, they're in his house. And then you say25 well, the solution there is it's a reasonable time. Hethe gang boss will get them, and thedo is really the firearms dealer.But now we think of a similar kind of381 has a reasonable time to do with them what he wants.￼2 MS. O'CONNELL:3 JUSTICE KENNEDY:4 out of his possession.5 MS. O'CONNELL:6 JUSTICE KENNEDY:7 has to give them to a firearms dealer? This is very8 complicated, more so than I ever thought, and it seems9 to me that it might best be worked out by lower courts10 under the principle that we don't want these guns back11 in the hands of either his control or people who might12 misuse them.13 MS. O'CONNELL: I think if he is a person14 who pleaded guilty, and so he ­­ he had advance15 knowledge that he was about to become somebody who16 couldn't possess firearms, including constructive17 possession where he couldn't exercise dominion and18 control over them, then he should be required to ­­ to19 get rid of those firearms before he pleads guilty. And20 if he still has them in his house after he does so,21 there is no reasonable period of time for that person22 to, you know, exercise his own control over what he23 wants to do with them. I think those do have to go to a24 firearms dealer.25 JUSTICE KENNEDY:39No.  As long as he gets themI think if he ­­  Are you going to say heCan you tell me ­­ it's1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425not this case, but suppose ­­ somewhat like JusticeAlito's hypothetical ­­ a man's living at home with hiswife.  Wife owns the firearms.  The firearms are in thebedroom.  He's convicted of an offense where 922(g)controls.  Is he in constructive possession of those inviolation of the statute?MS. O'CONNELL: There is a whole body of case law on that, Justice Kennedy, where the ­­ the answer is can the convicted felon exercise dominion and control over the firearms in ­­ in their location. So if they're in like the master bedroom and they're not locked up and he has access to them any time he wants it, then he would ­­ he would be a felon in possession of a firearm.      JUSTICE SCALIA:wife has them is not enough      MS.

Although you say that Rule 41(g) is not9 the appropriate mechanism, you have no doubt that courts10 do have the equitable authority to do this. Is that11 correct?12 MS. O'CONNELL: That's correct. And I ­­ I13 mean, I hope that, Justice Sotomayor, that it's not the14 case that people are upset with ­­ with the government's15 brief. I think that in our brief, we tried to correct16 some wrongs that had happened in this case. We have17 abandoned that 41(g) argument, we have abandoned the18 Unclean Hands argument. The weapons that are not19 firearms were ­­ have been returned to Mr. Henderson.20 And we think we've come up with a solution transferring21 the weapons to a Federal licensed firearms dealer that22 allows him to obtain the economic value of the firearms23 without exercising control over them.24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you agree that the25 Unclean Hands part, that should not remain the law of41control over the sale or the    Ms. O'Connell, I think it'ssaying, but I just wanted to￼1 the circuit?2 MS. O'CONNELL:3 JUSTICE GINSBURG:4 address that and reject it?5 MS. O'CONNELL:6 unclean hands, we did describe that if these are – if7 the ­­ obviously, if the – if the property that we have8 is contraband, it's not being returned to anybody. But9 we also would reserve the right to make arguments in cases10 where the property we're holding is derivative contraband,11 like it's a firearm that's been used to shoot somebody or12 it's something that is used to for drugs ­­13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you have to file for14 forfeiture in those situations.15 MS. O'CONNELL: Well, what I'm saying is, if16 we miss those deadlines or something like that, we would17 reserve the right in a derivative contraband case to18 make an unclean hands argument ­­19 JUSTICE BREYER: What about just forgetting20 the words "dominion" and "constructive" and just look to21 the word "possession" and say that that sometimes22 includes control? And what you want to prevent is that23 he disposes of these arms in a way that allows him,24 possibly, to control them in the future or control them25 now in a way that likely puts them in the hands of bad42Right.   So we should ­­ we shouldYes.  In our footnote on the￼1 people for the future.2 Now, that way, all we have to do is look at3 the word possession. We have to add that it includes,4 for purposes of this statute, certain kinds of control.5 And then you have to say this is the simple rule, and6 this will prevent two bad kinds of control.7 Now, is there something wrong with that? If8 so, we then send it back so that you can argue to the9 district court why your rule is necessary to prevent10 these two bad kinds of control.11 MS. O'CONNELL: Justice Breyer, I think12 your ­­ your second part we would go a little bit13 further under the government's theory. Surely we think14 that if the firearms are given back to somebody over15 whom the convicted felon is going to exercise control,16 that would be constructive possession. But we also17 think that regardless of the person who's on the18 receiving end of the firearms is a good person or a bad19 person, is an exercise of dominion.20 JUSTICE BREYER: I know, that's the part21 that it's hard for me to accept.22 MS. O'CONNELL: Well ­­23 JUSTICE BREYER: Because you're willing to24 allow that control in the case that Justice Alito put25 where he was convicted and it's in his house. And I43￼1 don't see anything bad that flows from that kind of2 control. And I don't see why you have to read the3 statute to include that kind of control to achieve any4 purpose that the statute has. So therefore, I tend,5 tentatively, to reject that kind of control as falling6 within what the statute forbids.7 MS. O'CONNELL:8 that kind of control ­­9 JUSTICE BREYER:If you are going to reject What bad will happen?­­ then we would just ask10 MS. O'CONNELL:11 that the Court, you know, make clear in its opinion that12 a district court acting in equity is not required to13 accept the convicted felon's choice or direction about14 where he wants the firearms to go, and that, instead of15 having to broker that transaction between a convicted16 felon and his friends, that the Court say, you know ­­17 JUSTICE BREYER: That might be another way18 to do it, you know. All right. You have a difficult19 conceptual case.20 MS. O'CONNELL: And I don't think, you know,21 even if you don't think that it's bad to have firearms22 go to necessarily anybody or maybe there's a very good23 person that the convicted felon knows and wants to have24 it, the line is drawn when you become a convicted felon.25 JUSTICE ALITO:Would the firearms dealer441 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425charge a commission for selling these guns?MS.

ORTIZON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, just four very quickpoints:      First, on the question of whetherMr. Henderson asked with sufficient particularity forrelief, please remember that he was proceeding pro se.And second, the law is clear that post­convictionmotions for return of transfer of property are treatedas civil actions.  Under Rule 54(c) of the Federal Rulesof Civil Procedure, he's entitled to whatever relief isappropriate even if he did not request it. Second ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: You ­­ you started off ­­ you were going to give us five pages in ­­ in the record, and you only got to two of them, I think. You want ­­MR. ORTIZ: Oh, sorry .JUSTICE SCALIA: Just in case I'm unfortunate enough to get assigned this opinion.(Laughter.)MR. ORTIZ: Justice Scalia, on page 71 and on page 170. The first was a reference to his renewed motion for return/disposition of property, and the second was the motion hearing itself. He said thathe ­­ he claimed ­­ he argued that he had a property of46￼￼1 some firearms which must be accommodated by the sale,2 transfer or storage of the firearms. But Justice3 Ginsburg is correct, he did not particularly reference a4 licensed gun dealer. His objections to the magistrate5 judge's report and recommendation which appears on6 page 132 of the joint appendix, he asks the court for7 the relief ­­ to grant the request that this Court8 ordered that a person lawfully entitled to own the9 subject firearms collection be awarded possession and10 control and direct the payment for the firearms be11 awarded to Petitioner or his wife.12 And finally, in his Eleventh Circuit brief,13 he said, "Alternatively, I request the court recognize14 my continued ownership interest in the property value15 and order its sale for my benefit or my wife's or adult16 children's benefit or allow me to designate a neutral17 third party to take possession as his own."18 Second, remind the Court that the19 government's proposed Federal firearms dealer20 remedy would allow an owner's friend to take ­­ to buy21 the firearms without the lecture and warning from the22 district court that might be a criminal offense.23 Third, in this case, the firearms were24 turned over long before Petitioner pleaded guilty. They25 were turned over by order of the court setting the47MR. ORTIZ: No ­­      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:You think there's still ­­So that's not at issue.￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425conditions of his release, pretrial.      And finally, despite my friend's suggestion,Petitioner firmly does not believe that affirmance isappropriate relief here.  Thank you.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Ortiz, you do understand ­­ I thought it was clear from what the government said earlier, that it's waived any claim ­­ that you waived the request for this relief.MR. ORTIZ: Your Honor ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ they're going to go back down and say that you're not entitled to the relief because you didn't ask for the right relief?MR. ORTIZ: That's one fear . If this Court were to dispose of the case other than by reversal, there's also the other problem that ­­ not only would that not resolve the circuit conflict, because the government is taking a very different view of the Eleventh Circuit's role than the Eleventh Circuit itself does, but there is also the issue of unclean hands, which would still be out there. And that would bar going forward anyone in Petitioner's position from taking advantage of the government's new position.481 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      If there are no further questions, we restour case.
