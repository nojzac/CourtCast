Johnnie L.          Mr. Chemerinsky.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN CHEMERINSKY               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Good morning.  Mr.argumentCochran.Chiefthe mostJustice, and may it please the Court:          The injunction in this case violatesbasic principles of the First Amendment.  It's                                               a priorrestraint.  It's a content-based restriction on speech.It's vastly overbroad.  It even restricts the speech ofthose who are not a party to the lawsuit, such asPetitioner Ruth Craft.          The injunction in this case is inconsistent withthis country's unique and profound commitment that speechby public officials and public figures be open, robust,and uninhibited.          One way in which the injunction is clearlyunconstitutional is in restricting the speech of those whoare not a party to the lawsuit.  For example, Ruth Craftis expressly restrained from ever speaking again aboutJohnnie Cochran even though she was never named as a partyto the lawsuit.  And, in fact, Cochran's attorney admitted31111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005(10:15 a.m.)￼1 at the beginning of trial, she wasn't a part of the2 lawsuit.3 JUSTICE SOUTER: How about you? You're in4 trouble too, aren't you?5 (Laughter.)6 MR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, I am, Your Honor. This7 injunction is so broad that if I talk about Johnnie8 Cochran or this case on the sidewalk in front of this9 Court or pass out copies of the brief or speak to any10 reporter, I am violating the terms of the injunction and I11 could be held in contempt of court.1213 about the14 I thought15 question presented doesn't suggest you're challenging --16 the first one that concerns distance, the 300 yard from17 Cochran or his place of business, and the third one, which18 is an anti-harassment provision. Do I understand19 correctly that it is only the second one that you're20 challenging?21 MR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor. The question22 presented is that the injunction is unconstitutional.23 One of the reasons why the injunction is24 unconstitutional is that it's based on speech that's25 protected by the First Amendment. All of the statements41111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Chemerinsky, you speakinjunction, and the injunction has three parts.that you were not challenging -- at least the￼1 that were uttered by Mr. Tory are opinion protected by the2 First Amendment. There is not the requisite actual3 malice. And so it's our position that the injunction4 itself is unconstitutional.5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But your question is6 preventing all future speech about an admitted public7 figure, and the first and third provisions of this8 injunction do not prohibit all future speech.9 MR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor, that's10 correct. It's our position, though, that the injunction11 is based on speech that's protected by the First12 Amendment, and we believe that the question presented is13 that the injunction is impermissible in its restriction of14 speech.1516 said in17 limited18 would leave the other parts there.19 MR. CHEMERINSKY: Well, of course, you're20 limited to the question presented. Our position, though,21 is that the injunction in its restriction of speech is22 unconstitutional. And one of the reasons why the23 injunction is unconstitutional is that all of the speech24 that occurred in this case is speech that's protected by25 the First Amendment.51111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005  JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  But that isn't what you'vethe question presented.  Why shouldn't we beto answering the question presented?  And that￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Yes, but you understandJustice Ginsburg's question surely, and I would imaginethat even if you prevail, nothing we would order wouldaffect the first and third parts.          MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Well, Your Honor, certainly webelieve that the injunction is most clearlyunconstitutional in its overbreadth.          We believe also and separately the injunction isunconstitutional because injunctions are not a permissibleremedy in a defamation case, especially concerning publicofficials and public figures.          But it's also our position that the injunctionis based on speech that's protected by the FirstAmendment, and thus, the injunction violates the FirstAmendment.JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but that doesn't --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Mr. Chemerinsky, is it truethat your client intends to go on defaming Mr. Cochran?          MR. CHEMERINSKY:  No, Your Honor.  We don'tbelieve our client has ever defamed Mr. Cochran.  Webelieve that all of his speech is just opinion.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Does he intend to continuemaking the same comments that he made before?          MR. CHEMERINSKY:  His exact words were thatperhaps he would continue to express his view that Mr.61111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Cochran owes him money.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  All right.  Now, let me askyou this.  Under your theory, if -- if the defendant isjudgment-proof, does respondent have any remedy at all ifthe statements are defamatory?          MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Yes, Your Honor.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  What is it?          MR. CHEMERINSKY:  There is, of course, a remedy.Since we're dealing here with a public figure, there is the remedy of expressing views which this Court has said in Gertz v. Welch is available to a public figure. There is a damage judgment that's available. Certainly, Your Honor, there can't be a different rule --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  But if -- if the defendant isjudgment-proof, what good does that do?MR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, there is a damage judgment that forever would be available against the person. And it cannot be, Your Honor, that those who are poor will have injunctions --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well -- well, your -- youranswer should be to Justice O'Connor there is no effectivelegal remedy under your theory of the case.          MR. CHEMERINSKY:  No, Your Honor, I disagreewith that.JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, you -- you say he has 71111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 the remedy of -- of counter-speech. We're talking --2 that's really that doesn't answer the question. The3 question is, is there anything he can get from the courts4 other than a damage remedy, and your answer I think is no.5 MR. CHEMERINSKY: That's correct, Your Honor.6 From the courts, he can get a damage remedy but I don't7 accept that a damage remedy is inadequate just because a8 person may be poor. The damage remedy will be that they'd9 be collected for the person who gets assets in the future.10 Also, as I was saying to Justice O'Connor, it11 can't be --1213 that that 1415 Then it's16 remedy that he can get.17 MR. CHEMERINSKY: But then, Justice Kennedy, it18 can't be the rule that poor people have their speech19 enjoined, but those with assets can continue to speak in20 the future.21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it also can't be the rule22 that poor people can defame ad libitum and -- and people23 who have money cannot. I mean, that's -- that's not a24 fair rule either.25 MR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor, but that's why81111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it -- it seems to mereally avoids the problem -- the problem.So suppose we disagree with you about that.true that there is no -- there is no legal￼1 there would be, of course, the ability of a court to issue2 a damage judgment. There are many instances in which3 damage judgments can't be collected.4JUSTICE SCALIA: It's worthless against a -- person who has no assets.MR. CHEMERINSKY: But that's true everywhere in system, Your Honor.And I would also argue here that none of Mr.5 against a 67 the legal 89 Tory's statements were defamatory. I would point --10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now that's another one that11 is in your brief. You say that these were statements of12 opinion not fact. But that surely is not presented in13 your question. You -- you don't -- there were findings14 made that these statements were defamatory, and your15 question presented does not seem to me to encompass at16 all the question whether these statements were defamatory.17 MR. CHEMERINSKY: I would disagree, Your Honor.18 The question presented is whether this injunction, that19 forever stops speech, violates the First Amendment. One20 reason why --21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not this injunction.22 The question presented is whether a permanent injunction23 as a remedy in a defamation -- in a defamation action,24 preventing all future speech about an admitted public25 figure, violates the First Amendment. There's no91111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425suggestion in that that you claim that in this particularcase there was no defamation.  I -- I just don't thinkit's fairly included within the question.MR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, what I am saying is that the question presented does ask whether this injunction, which permanently restricts speech --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, it doesn't.  It sayswhether a permanent injunction as a remedy in a defamationaction preventing all future speech about an admittedpublic figure violates the First Amendment.MR. CHEMERINSKY: We would argue --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  There's nothing about thisparticular injunction which is based upon speech that isnot defamation.  There's nothing in there about that.MR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, our position is that question asks whether an injunction violates the First Amendment, and certainly it is about this case. And our position is that all of the speech that was expressed in this case is opinion. And it's important --          JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now, if that'sso --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, there really -- there are findings against you, and to say that a lawyer is a crook, a liar, and a thief and you're trying to tell us that that's not defamatory, I mean, I -- I think we101111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 should just proceed on -- on some other basis for this2 argument. We have other questions to discuss.3 MR. CHEMERINSKY: Sure. But, Your Honor, I want4 to just respond to that. The exact statement there was --5 and I'll quote it for you and it is on page 54 of the6 joint appendix. Johnnie is a crook, a liar, and a thief.7 Can a lawyer go to heaven? Luke 11:46. Your Honor, this8 Court has said, for example, in Greenbelt Cooperative that9 charging somebody with blackmail is expressing opinion.10 In Letter Carriers v. Austin this Court said calling11 somebody a traitor is opinion.12 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. That -- that --13 what you've quoted many -- much of this I wouldn't repeat14 in polite company. You've reported one of the most mild,15 and in fact there are two findings. One, this is not just16 defamation. It was an action for defamation, as well as a17 tort of invasion of privacy. And there is a finding,18 first, that this was done intentionally to create a19 negatively charged and ominous environment, and this is20 not a matter of speech-related issues. It is simply the21 use of false and defamatory and privacy-invading22 communications, or worse, or attempt to improperly coerce23 payment of money in tribute for -- for desisting from that24 type of activity. All right. Now, those are the25 findings against you.111111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 So suppose I agreed with you hypothetically that2 that, with all these findings, is nonetheless protected by3 the First Amendment. All right? Now, suppose, in other4 words, you convince me of that. Now, I want to know how5 to write my opinion on that assumption to protect what I6 was worried about yesterday, that a woman who has a7 boyfriend or a husband is being continuously harassed in8 -- with methods similar to this one. See, it's easy to9 transpose those two cases which are both on my mind.10 And I want to know if in your opinion that these11 restraining orders, which try to prevent this kind of12 thing, among others, are unconstitutional, if there's a13 way of distinguishing them, if you could possibly win on14 what theory. And what I'm trying to get you to do is to15 say is it 1617 different18 distinguished the case.19 The first is that this injunction is vastly20 overbroad, that even if there can be an injunction to say21 that Ulysses Tory and Ruth Craft can never again sayabsolute.  Are there limits?  If so, what?MR. CHEMERINSKY:  I would suggest threeways in which you could write the opinion that22 anything about Johnnie Cochran in any public forum, that I23 can never speak about Johnnie Cochran would violate the24 First Amendment.25 A second way of distinguishing is that121111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 defamation is different, that when the First Amendment was2 adopted, the clear history was that above all it was to3 prevent prior restraints, and that injunctions were not4 permitted in defamation actions. That's quite different5 than a harassment action.6 And third, as I've argued, what makes this7 different is the basis for this injunction is speech8 protected by the First Amendment.9 With regard to the findings that you referred10 to, you mentioned two.11 The first is invasion of privacy. Your Honor,12 the only privacy claim in this case was false light13 invasion of privacy. California law is clear. When there14 is a defamation action and a false light claim, the false15 light claim is automatically dismissed as duplicative when16 it's based on the same fact.17 The second basis you pointed --18 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Chemerinsky, this19 case comes up to us from a California appellate court.20 Surely they know California law better than we do.21 MR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor, but they did22 not base their decision on the privacy claim because23 California law is clear that when it's false light24 invasion of privacy brought together with a defamation25 action, the false light claim is dismissed. That's a131111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 California case, Couch v. San Jose Unified School2 District.34 to debate 56 saying is7 privacy claim is. As I was saying to Justice Breyer,8 there may be privacy claims that give rise to injunctions.9 Harassment claims may give rise to injunctions, but notCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Well, we're not goingamong ourselves over what California law is.MR. CHEMERINSKY:  No, Your Honor.  All I'mit's important to be clear about what the10 the privacy claim in this case which was just about false11 light, which even the California Court of Appeal admitted12 is treated together with defamation.13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose this picketing had14 taken place in front of his house, every day in front of15 his house.16 MR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, under Frisby v.17 Schultz, that would be a different situation. Under18 Frisby v. Schultz, this Court said --19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. Well -- well, then20 this -- this argument you're making, oh, never, never, the21 sky is falling and so forth, I -- I think we have to be22 more precise here. I think if it were in front of his23 house, it would be different.24 If he had alleged $10 worth of monetary damages,25 it would be disparaging the quality of his services, which141111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425would be a trade libel, and the Restatement at least -- I don't know California law -- says that you -- would you agree that you can enjoin a trade libel --          MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Well, Your Honor --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- that disparages quality ofgoods to the serious injury of a -- of a business?          MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Actually, Your Honor, the vastmajority of cases have held that you cannot have aninjunction for product defamation.  And so I think whilethat's a different and more difficult question, mostcourts have said no even there.          And Your Honor, I'm not saying there can neverbe injunctions.  But I am saying that this Court has saidthere's a very strong and heavy presumption againstinjunctions, and that never, not once in the 214-yearhistory of the First Amendment, has this Court ever upheldan injunction as a remedy in a defamation action.And, Your Honor --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, if -- if this under -- the underlying claim seems to be that Mr. Cochran is essentially being blackmailed; that is, this -- this -- your client wants tribute to go away. And you say, yes, but it's defamation. It's a defamation action. Therefore, damages is the only remedy.Is there nothing that one can do to stop another 151111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 from engaging in blackmail?2 MR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor, there is. If3 this was blackmail or extortion, Johnnie Cochran could4 have filed a criminal complaint with the police. He could5 have civilly sued for blackmail or extortion. But, Your6 Honor, this wasn't extortion.7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What kind of a jurisprudence8 is it that a person can go to jail but that he's freed9 from an injunction? I mean, why -- why do we do this?10 MR. CHEMERINSKY: But Your Honor, that's11 because this Court has said that injunctions of speech are12 even worse than criminal penalties. I would refer this13 Court --14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but why -- is that true15 in every case? I mean, take the timid person who's not16 sure -- I know the law doesn't protect the timid person in17 the first area, but let's -- let's assume the timid person18 is not sure. So he wants -- he wants to get an equitable19 ruling first, declaratory judgment. He -- and he would20 take an injunction. That's certainly much easier than21 going to jail.22 MR. CHEMERINSKY: But, Your Honor, I'd remind23 you of this Court's language in the Vance v. Universal24 Amusement where the Court said presumption against prior25 restraints is heavier and the degree of protection broader161111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 than against limits on criminal penalties.2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I know, but I'm asking you why3 that -- why that should be. If -- if you asked a person4 not familiar with our jurisprudence, which is worse,5 having an injunction that you can argue about or going to6 jail, I -- I think they would say that going to jail is7 worse.8 MR. CHEMERINSKY: But, Your Honor, in terms of9 the First Amendment, there are reasons why an injunction10 has always been regarded as worse.11 JUSTICE BREYER: Always? Do you want to apply12 that to an harassment action too against a woman who has13 the restraining order? No restraining orders in divorce14 cases in case they're against speech because even if15 violence is threatened, even if -- et cetera. I mean, how16 -- how far do you want to push that principle?17 MR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, I don't want to18 push the principle at all to harassment. I believe that19 injunctions are completely appropriate in harassment20 actions. I think it is quite important to note that the21 California harassment statute expressly excludes speech22 which is protected by the First Amendment as being a basis23 for harassment.24 The history of the First Amendment is different.25 To go back to Justice Kennedy's question, it's always been171111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 thought that an injunction strikes at the very heart of2 the First Amendment because, as Justice Scalia pointed3 out --4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why can't we say that speech5 that is -- is being used for extortion is different, just6 as speech which is being used for harassment is different?7 And just as you can get an injunction for the latter, you8 ought to be able to get an injunction for the former. Not9 all speech, but only when speech is being used to -- to10 extort money.11 MR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor, there can be12 an injunction for extortion, but this was not extortion.13 There was never the criminal complaint. There was never14 the civil action. And it didn't meet the requirements for15 extortion. Your Honor, California law, Penal Code section16 518, defines extortion as, quote, the obtaining of17 property from another with his consent induced by a18 wrongful use of force or fear. There wasn't the wrongful19 use of force or fear.20 Now, it may be that Ulysses Tory was speaking --21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Here I think there was -- why22 isn't there a use of fear when, you know, you're afraid of23 this person destroying your business by calling you a liar24 and a cheat? Wasn't Mr. Cochran afraid of that -- of that25 happening?181111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, this Court is2 required to do an independent review of the record under3 Bose v. Consumers Union. There's no indication that Mr.4 Cochran suffered that fear from Mr. Tory being outside.5 It's true that Mr. Tory may have believed that he was owed6 money by Johnnie Cochran and was also trying to encourage7 Mr. Cochran to pay. But this Court has said in cases like8 NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware speech does not lose its9 protective character simply because it may embarrass10 others or coerce them into action.11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Chemerinsky, the district12 -- I mean, the trial court made certain findings and I'm13 looking at page 42 of the joint appendix. The first is14 that these statements were actually made for the purpose15 of inducing Cochran to pay Tory amounts of money which16 Tory was not entitled. That's one finding. And then17 finding 24, despite repeated requests, Tory has refused to18 cease picketing unless he was paid money -- a monetary19 settlement by Cochran. And then 27 that says this is20 simply use of false and privacy-invading communications to21 coerce or attempt to improperly coerce payment of money in22 tribute for desisting from that type of activity. And23 those sound like findings.24 It's true that the label of extortion has been25 put on it, but it certainly does sound like the -- that191111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 the purpose of the speech was to extract money not owed.2 MR. CHEMERINSKY: But, Your Honor, since this is3 a defamation action, not an extortion action, the rules4 under the First5 Under the rules6 injunctions are7 public figures.8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, so this finding -- the9 court shouldn't have made these findings? It wasAmendment for defamation have to apply.of the First Amendment for defamation,not available to public officials or10 irrelevant?11 MR. CHEMERINSKY: Well, Your Honor, I believe12 that the --13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was there an objection to the14 testimony that established this?15 MR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor. Mr. Tory,16 who was appearing pro se in the trial court, from the very17 outset objected that he was being held liable for speech18 protected by the First Amendment.19 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but it seems to me -- and I20 think what bothers me is -- is what bothers Justice21 Kennedy. It seems to me that the argument you just made22 is an argument that given the pleadings in this case, the23 findings that Justice Ginsburg just quoted really were24 irrelevant findings, that they should25 that the court should not have gotten201111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-not have gotten -- into extortion andWashington, DC 20005￼1 so on and should not have provided a remedy for extortion,2 quite apart from the fact of whether it's an appropriate3 remedy, constitutional or otherwise. And that, it seems4 to me, is -- is something that we -- we are not here to5 touch. That's a question of California law.6 What we are here to touch is, number one,7 whether the injunction is overbroad with respect to pure8 speech, and maybe we are here -- that we have a question9 about the -- the breadth of the case we took. But maybe10 we are here to determine whether there can be an11 injunction against blackmail or harassing activities.12 But I -- I think we're not here to decide13 whether California could have gotten to the question of14 blackmail, harassment, and injunction for that. Do you15 agree with that?16 MR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor. I certainly17 agree with the first point. One issue before this Court18 is whether this injunction is overbroad, and it clearly is19 in terms of the breadth of speech that's regulated and20 whose regulated.21 But as to the second point that you make, this22 is a defamation action, and thus the issue before this23 Court, clearly presented in the question presented, is24 whether a permanent injunction can be issued in a25 defamation case remedy when the plaintiff is a public211111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 figure.2 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it can certainly -- the3 -- the issue is certainly before us as to whether such an4 injunction can be issued with respect to defamation pure5 and simple. But the findings that Justice Ginsburg has --6 has read and part of the order in question here seems to7 go beyond pure defamation. It goes to the kind of8 demonstrative activity which plausibly is found to have9 been in aid of extortion. And that, it seems to me, is an10 entirely different question.11 We may -- I'm not saying we will, but we may12 agree with you that it's overbroad. We may agree with you13 that as to pure speech, you can't enjoin it. But that14 doesn't necessarily mean that every part of this15 injunction is wrong, and it seems to me it is irrelevant16 as to whether the -- the State of -- the courts of17 California should have reached extortion.18 MR. CHEMERINSKY: I would disagree in this way,19 Your Honor. Bose v. Consumers Union makes clear that when20 it is a defamation action, this Court and every appellate21 court has to do an independent review of the record.22 JUSTICE SOUTER: With respect to the defamation,23 pure and simple. I agree with you. We -- there is a24 heightened standard of review, but I don't think that25 addresses one way or the other what the standard should be221111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 when an action in the State courts has been treated as an2 action both for defamation and for extortion or3 harassment.4 MR. CHEMERINSKY: But, Your Honor, it was not5 treated here as an action for extortion or harassment --6 JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand. Mr. Chemerinsky,7 let me put the question this way. Suppose a State does8 not have a civil action for extortion. It provides9 criminal remedies but no civil action for extortion. Why10 does the Constitution not permit us to treat, in that11 State at least, a civil action for defamation which has12 within it elements of distortion differently from pure13 defamation?14 MR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, I would say the15 history of the First Amendment is different. A State can16 create a civil action then for extortion at the urging of17 this Court, but if you open the door to injunctions in18 defamation cases, then there's the possibility that in any19 defamation case, somebody might plead something about20 extortion, and injunctions will not be rare but will be21 the norm.22 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this -- may I ask23 this question? Supposing the only thing he did was to24 carry a sign that said Johnnie is a crook, a liar, and a25 thief, and the trial judge finds that is false, and he's231111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425carrying it in a sign, could the trial judge enjoin himfrom carrying that sign in front of Johnnie Cochran'soffice?          MR. CHEMERINSKY:  No, Your Honor, because thelaw is clear that injunctions are not a permissible remedyin defamation cases.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  What's the best authority youhave for that proposition?          MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Near v. Minnesota would be thebest authority where this Court said clearly thatinjunctive relief should not be awarded in a defamationcase.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Add to Justice Stevens' -- addto Justice Stevens' hypothetical that he shows that he'slosing some clients.          MR. CHEMERINSKY:  But, Your Honor, even -- yes,Your Honor.  But I don't think that changes thehypothetical in terms of enjoining the defamatory speech.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Would you add too thathe's judgment-proof?          MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Well, again, as I said toJustice O'Connor, I don't think it can matter whether he'sjudgment-proof because we can't have a different rule thatwe allow poor people's speech to enjoin and not wealthypeople.241111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You're saying -- you're sayingthat a State cannot constitutionally prohibit someone frommaking false statements in front of the business thatcauses the business to lose money.MR. CHEMERINSKY: Well, Your Honor, there are other causes of action that may allow that. If it could be --thisYour     JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So I'm -- my question is, isconstitutional to prohibit this conduct?     MR.

JUSTICE STEVENS: But what is your authority forproposition?     MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Well, I would say that thethatauthority comes from the fact that never in 214 years hasthis Court ever upheld an injunction in a defamation case.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Have we ever set aside aninjunction that did that?Honor.MR.

COLE:the Court:For years,Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, and mayMr. Tory has relentlessly targeteda pattern of defamatory speech in a￼1 stated he would.2 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you -- do you defend3 the injunction in its entirety?4 MR. COLE: Yes --5 JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, the -- the --6 Mr. Chemerinsky didn't have too much chance to -- to get7 very far into it, but one of his points was that there was8 -- quite apart from any injunction against picketing,9 harassment, et cetera, there was an injunction simply10 against speech on a given subject directed to a lot of11 people with no limit of time. With respect to that last12 aspect, do you defend the injunction?13 MR. COLE: Yes. First of all, I don't believe14 it was directed to a lot of people. As this --15 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it was directed, number16 one, to a named person who was not a party to the case,17 and it was directed to agents and employees of -- of the18 named party. So, I -- I assume that Mr. Cochran probably19 has a fair number of agents and employees, so it does seem20 like a large number of people.21 MR. COLE: I believe this Court said in Madsen22 that that would raise an abstract controversy that Mr.23 Tory doesn't have standing to attack the injunction for24 other persons who are not before the court. No aider or25 abetter has ever been served with this injunction. Ms.271111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Craft has never been served with this injunction. Only Mr. Tory. So I don't believe --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, let me ask you a lawschool question.  In -- given the injunction on its face,with that breadth, is that injunction defensible withrespect not to picketing, not to harassment, simply tospeech in a public place?          MR. COLE:  I defend the injunction, andrespondent defends the injunction on the ground that it isconduct that was being enjoined --JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I asked you --MR. COLE: -- from the use of unprotectedspeech.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- to exclude the -- the issueof conduct.  I said forget the injunction for a momentwith respect to picketing, with respect to harassment, andwe'll say with respect to blackmail, since that has comeup.  Forget that.  Simply take the portion of theinjunction that enjoins speech by these people,associates, agents, et cetera.  On the subject matter ofthe injunction for all time, do you defend thatinjunction?          MR. COLE:  Yes, we defend the injunction.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Let's take specifically thewords of the injunction.  It's against orally uttering281111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425statements about Cochran, just orally uttering statementsabout Cochran.          MR. COLE:  Yes.JUSTICE GINSBURG: You say that someone can be enjoined --          MR. COLE:  Based upon the unique facts of thiscase, Justice Ginsburg, I say somebody can be enjoined.  Idon't say that in the abstract.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, you can't square thatwith the Near case at all.  I -- I mean, the -- theinjunction on its face in part 2 has the appearance ofbeing overly broad.          MR. COLE:  But in Near, they set forth certainfactors, and those factors included that it was not aprivate redress of private wrongs.  The information was oflegitimate public concern.  Neither of those elements arepresent in this action.JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't know that. JUSTICE O'CONNOR: You don't --JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't know what futurespeech is going to be.  His future thing may be, you know,Johnnie Cochran shouldn't be elected mayor of SanFrancisco.  That would be a -- a question of publicconcern.MR. COLE: But, Justice Scalia, what I'm relying 291111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425on is the fact that he has engaged in 3 years in a patternof continuing, repetitive conduct.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, what -- what you'resaying is that an -- an injunction can be overbroad basedon past wrongful conduct.  And there is simply noauthority for that proposition.MR. COLE: I'm not suggesting that this injunction is necessarily overboard based upon that proposition because I believe there are --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But we have just pointed outthat it -- that it -- it prohibits lawful, harmless,truthful speech.          MR. COLE:  I disagree with that, JusticeKennedy.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, it does on its face.  Imean, it is clearly overbroad.  Now, what should we doabout that?          MR. COLE:  Well, if you're asking me, based uponthe breadth of the injunction, what I -- if -- if therewas -- are you asking me what I would do to modify theinjunction?  You could merely strike -- you could leaveintact paragraph 2 and you could strike simply subsections(ii) and (iii) as being unconstitutionally overbroad.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Now, let -- let me ask youabout that.  Let's -- let's assume, for the moment, that a301111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 majority of the Court would find that some of these2 provisions are overly broad. Is there any authority that3 tells us what to do next? This is not like a statute4 where we have to save the statute. Do we have any5 obligation to save the injunction? Send it back and let6 it be done. Let it be done all over again. I mean, why7 -- why should we rewrite it up here? Do you have any8 authority that requires us or permits us to do that?9 MR. COLE: Yes. In -- in Madsen, Justice10 Kennedy, you struck -- the Court struck certain provisions11 as being unconstitutionally overbroad and left certain12 intact. So there's no reason why you can't look at this13 injunction, which clearly does not attack paragraph 1.14 The -- they do not attack paragraph 1. They do not attack15 paragraph 3.16 and paragraph17 would then be18 is picketing.19 JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so if -- before leaving20 that point, what the injunction prohibits is that Tory and21 those acting in concert, cooperation, or participationThey only level their attack at paragraph 2,2, by striking subsections (ii) and (iii),limited to the exact conduct in issue, which22 with him from, in a public forum, orally uttering23 statements about Cochran.

COLE:  Absolutely not.JUSTICE BREYER:  Absolutely not.  Because?MR. COLE: First of all, that's --          JUSTICE BREYER:  It said the words.  Theyviolated the words.  It was a statement, but he has notviolated the injunction because?          MR. COLE:  Because I don't believe that's apublic forum.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, no, no.  He does it in apublic forum.  In fact, he hires Disney Hall.(Laughter.)          JUSTICE BREYER:  And moreover, he gets on stageand announces it.  Okay?  There's no problem about apublic forum.  So, now, why doesn't it violate theinjunction?          MR. COLE:  Your -- Your Honor, I believe thereare alternative channels of communication here.          JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  I thought what you weregoing to say -- but you're not.  So I'm very interested inthat, and I'm glad I asked.  I thought you were going to321111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425say when it says uttering statements, it means statementsof the kind or identical to those we have identifiedearlier in this opinion.MR. COLE: Well, I was --          JUSTICE BREYER:  But, now, you haven't saidthat.  I said it, and I think it's too late for you to sayit.(Laughter.)          MR. COLE:  I think I said it when I said therewas a continuing pattern of repetitive conduct underPittsburgh Press, over 3 years that that was the conductthat he has engaged in.  And that was clearly the purposeof this injunction, Justice Breyer.  We know that.  Andthe purpose of the injunction is to enjoin conduct that'sdesigned to extort money from Mr. Cochran.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  In more than one case,we've said that an injunction has to be precise and clearand not leaving things to the imagination.MR. COLE: Well, I think this is precise and clear. Based upon the breadth of the injunction, it's very clear. Based upon this man's prior repetitive conduct of defaming Mr. Cochran with unprotected speech for the purpose of attempting to extort money from him --JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's -- it's --JUSTICE STEVENS: But nothing in the injunction331111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 refers to prior conduct.2 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. It's --3 JUSTICE STEVENS: The injunction just speaks for4 itself. It doesn't say what -- doing what you used to do5 or anything like that.678 Cochran's 9MR. COLE:  The injunction --JUSTICE STEVENS:  You cannot picket Cochran orlaw firm.  Period.MR. COLE:  If we restricted the injunction to10 specific words used such as you cannot picket Johnnie11 Cochran's law firm and say he's a crook, liar, and thief,12 the response will be that he'll come up with five new13 words to defame Mr. Cochran for purposes of extorting --1415 different16 precisely17 to draft it that say no picketing. Period.18 MR. COLE: Well, there could be no picketing for19 purposes of -- no -- which contains defamatory speech for20 purposes of extorting Mr. Cochran. But --21 JUSTICE STEVENS: All I'm suggesting is just22 draft it -- just excising (ii) and (iii) from paragraph 223 would not necessarily solve the problem completely.24 Because subparagraph (i) says picketing Cochran or25 Cochran's law firm, which is a pretty broad prohibition.341111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, maybe there aregrades of specificity.  Maybe it doesn't meetthe same words, but I think there are other ways￼1 MR. COLE: Well, I would disagree based upon the2 prior -- continuing course of -- of repetitive conduct and3 the fact that this -- over a period 3 years, once a week,4 this man spent 3 to 4 hours a day of his time defaming Mr.5 Cochran at his law office. When we enjoined him from6 doing so at his law office, he moved it to the Los Angeles7 Superior Court.8 And I think the fact that Mr. Cochran is a9 public figure actually favors the breadth of this10 injunction. If this was not a public figure, then the11 public forum issue would not be as effective. But because12 Mr. Cochran is a public figure, the only way he gets13 protection is in the public forum because this gentleman14 could move his picketing down to west L.A., Santa Monica15 Boulevard, nowhere near a courthouse, and to a public16 figure he can inflict the same damage to reputation. And17 that is the problem we were contending with in attempting18 to draft an injunction that was not overbroad and yet19 could control Mr. Tory --20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- you did draft this21 injunction. It wasn't the -- an inspiration from the22 judge unaided by your advocacy. Is that so?23 MR.

Why couldn't he just beMR. COLE:  Were aided -- were aided by myYour Honor.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Aided and abetted.MR. COLE:  Well said, Justice Rehnquist.What I'm suggesting here is Mr. Cochran wouldfaced with -- he has no remedy.  Injunctivethe only remedy.  And he would be faced with a10 enjoined from -- from similar defamation? I mean, this --11 this enjoins him from -- from true speech. At least he12 could -- he could have been enjoined from in the future13 defaming Cochran in the same manner. And if he did that,14 then -- then he could be punished.15 MR. COLE: I think we would be -- that16 injunction then would be attacked on being vague or17 ambiguous, that Mr. Tory wouldn't have sufficient notice18 as to what he was allowed to say and not allowed to say.19 I guarantee you that was --20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if -- if that's so, then21 maybe Mr. Chemerinsky is right. We -- we shouldn't have22 injunctions. If you're saying that injunctions can't be23 narrowly tailored, it seems to me that you're playing24 right into the argument that the petitioner is making.25 MR. COLE: No. I think they can be tailored. I361111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 just don't think they can be that narrowly tailored. And2 I don't think in this case, which I believe that the test3 we should be applying if we're going to balance, is this4 -- there's no need for this injunction to be drafted in5 the least restrictive means.6 I also continue to advance the argument that7 this -- the facts of this case are unique. It's the use8 of speech to engage in unprotected conduct. This -- this9 conduct is not protected by the First Amendment. The10 conduct of attempting to extort money from Mr. Cochran is11 not protected. If that is not protected, then I believe12 we can craft --13 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: You can -- you can14 certainly have, you know, some unprotected speech in15 connection with extortion, like give me $5 million or I'll16 shoot you. But that -- this was a far cry from that. In17 other words, it isn't just addressing the victim and18 saying give me something. It's denouncing the victim,19 which gets into free speech here.20 MR. COLE: It certainly21 But what I am suggesting is there22 Cochran that would have avoided a23 other than to draft the injunction in a form that would24 preclude Mr. Tory from engaging in the same conduct25 without regard to whether it was -- and to let him know 371111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005does, Justice Rehnquist.was no remedy for Mr.multiplicity of actions￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425clearly -- give him a safe harbor as to what he could andcould not say.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  But the injunctionisn't limited to the same conduct.          MR. COLE:  But I don't think it needs to bebecause of the pattern and practice that this man hasengaged in over 3 years.          And if we take the example, which is so he has achange of heart and suddenly he now wants to praise Mr.Cochran and that's become his -- and he's going to promotehim as mayor of San Francisco, he can certainly go intothe court and modify the injunction.L.A.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  I thought he lived in(Laughter.)          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think he'd like to get him upto San Francisco.(Laughter.)          MR. COLE:  He can certainly seek to modify theinjunction, and that, as I pointed out in a subsequentletter brief, there's -- California doesn't adopt thecollateral bar rule.  And therefore, he has a check andbalance in this case.  Under People v. Gonzales, 12Cal.4th 805, the collateral bar rule has no application inthe State of California.  So in the unlikely event that381111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Mr. Tory was engaged in speech praising Mr. Cochran, one,2 and two, in the -- in the more unlikely event that someone3 was going to attempt to cite him for contempt for engaging4 in protected speech, he could contest, under First5 Amendment grounds, the enforcement of this injunction in6 the State of California because the collateral bar rule7 has no impact.8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- I'm baffled by9 that. What you're saying is that the injunction -- we're10 just all wasting our time? The injunction doesn't mean11 anything?12 MR. COLE: No, no, no, no. Justice Kennedy, all13 I'm saying is --14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I fell off the track15 here.16 MR. COLE: All I'm -- all I'm saying is that if17 the collateral bar rule was in effect, you would waive18 your right to contest. You don't have a right to contest19 the constitutionality of the injunction on First Amendment20 grounds or constitutional grounds when it's seek to be21 enforced against you. That's not a defense in a contempt22 proceeding. California does not adopt that rule.23 Therefore, Mr. Tory can always -- if he is engaged in24 protected speech, he can easily contend --25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, yes, but he's different391111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425from other citizens because he's at -- he's at risk of acontempt citation.          MR. COLE:  I don't dispute that.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, his speech is beingchilled with -- with respect to protected speech.MR. COLE: But there's nothing unusual --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So the collateral bar ruledoesn't help you at all because he's subject to a contemptcitation.          MR. COLE:  He's subject to it, but there's acheck and balance there in terms of when you balance, thepotential remedy for Mr. Cochran -- what -- what is goingto give Mr. Cochran the remedy he needs?  And if webalance that against the -- the breadth of thisinjunction, I think we have to look at -- one of thebiggest concerns about prior restraints, when analyzed interms of injunctions, is the collateral bar rule.          JUSTICE BREYER:  But it would be so easy.  Imean, it's virtually no burden.  I take it what you'resaying is that this injunction in paragraph 2 at its heartis aimed at in public forums, keeping insults suggestinghe was a crook against Johnnie Cochran unless you pay me$10,000.  Then I'll stop.  Okay?   Now, at its heart,that's what it's aimed at.MR. COLE: That's exactly -- 401111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE BREYER:  And you are saying if in factit's ever enforced outside that heartland, you can have adefense.  It would violate the First Amendment.          But since it's so easy just to write those wordswe just said right in paragraph 2, why shouldn't the judgehave to do it?  It's so easy.  Say this is aimed at theheartland just as I said it and you said it, and itdoesn't apply outside of it.MR. COLE: And I have no dispute with that, Justice Breyer. I agree that was the whole purpose for the injunction. That's the basis of the injunction. And you could always remand for further proceedings, consistent with any opinion you would write, that the injunction has to be tailored to -- to deal with defamatory conduct, which is designed to extort or with the intent to extort. And I --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's what he's arguing.You're -- you're conceding that it's overbroad.          MR. COLE:  I'm saying if this Court -- well, I'mgleaning the impression that this Court thinks it'soverbroad.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ah, you're very perceptive.          (Laughter.)          MR. COLE:  And having gleaned that perception,I'm trying to suggest that, number one, there was no 411111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 attack on paragraphs 1 and 3, and now we're focused on2 paragraph 2. And paragraph 2 can be tailored, as you have3 indicated, Justice Scalia, I think consistent with First4 Amendment issues.5 And I think it's important to point out that if6 we take away injunctive relief in a defamation action in7 this day -- modern age --8 JUSTICE STEVENS: You're sort of saying the9 opposite of what your opponent said. If we take it away,10 has it ever been there?11 MR. COLE: It's never been there.12 JUSTICE STEVENS: What are we taking away?13 MR. COLE: I -- I agree it's never -- you've14 never found it there and you've never said it can't be15 there.16 JUSTICE BREYER: How does California work in17 that respect? Because what I've been thinking of in my18 mind is that maybe we shouldn't decide this in terms of19 State law boxes, that California seems to have an action.20 Let's call it a buzz action to get away from words. And21 what that action is it's a defamation but a certain kind.22 It's defamation accompanied by extortion. And when you23 have defamation accompanied by extortion -- call it24 whatever you want -- an injunction is proper in these25 circumstances.421111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Now, can we decide it in such a way that we're2 not talking about all defamation actions? We are talking3 about this beast in California which uses the word4 defamation but also finds injunction and therefore issues5 -- also finds extortion and therefore issues an6 injunction.7 MR. COLE: Yes, I think that you could limit the8 injunction to defamatory speech of a similar nature9 designed to extort.10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would -- would that make Mr.11 Cochran happy? What -- what's the big deal about12 extortion? I mean, suppose this same conduct occurs in13 the future, but he doesn't say I'll stop if you give me a14 lot of money. He just pickets every day and says Cochran15 is a shyster, don't do any business with Cochran. Do you16 think Mr. Cochran would be any -- any happier simply17 because the guy says I'll -- hasn't said I'll stop if you18 pay me $10,000?19 MR. COLE: No, and I think that would be subject20 to the same injunctive relief. I think this case is21 unique with the extortion element, but I don't disagree,22 Justice Scalia, that that is why any decision that says23 injunctions in defamation actions would be improper. I24 think people would start defaming with impunity.25 JUSTICE SCALIA: You've got to give us some 431111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 line. I mean, the only reason we're grabbing onto2 extortion is that -- that there's reluctance to say you3 can issue injunctions in all defamation actions. Now,4 what -- what limitation do you want to place upon the5 ability to issue an injunction if it is not defamation6 combined with extortion?7 MR. COLE: I don't think you need to place a8 limitation other than you can enjoin the defamatory9 conduct. Take, for example, the Internet. A posting goes10 on of a -- of a business that -- a startup company. It11 can't -- damages of -- for a startup company -- they're12 very difficult to prove.13 JUSTICE BREYER: But then you run into the14 public figure. I mean, that's a much more dangerous kind15 of rule of law, isn't it? I mean, a pure defamation16 action against a public figure, which they want to say17 this is. You can write all kinds of things about public18 figures. People can and do, for better or for worse. Do19 -- is there any authority for issuing in a pure defamation20 action an injunction?21 MR. COLE: There's no authority, but there's no22 authority that says you can't do it.23 But what I am suggesting is in -- is in a pure24 defamation action that's not tied to any specific wrongful25 conduct, there's no reason why you couldn't enjoin. For441111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 example, if you found that a specific item was defamatory2 on its face, such as a posting on the Internet, the only3 way to get that posting off the Internet would be to4 enjoin it because damages aren't going to solve the5 problem. And if it's -- even if it's purely defamatory,6 you could restrict it to that purely defamatory posting,7 similar to -- to the obscenity cases where you've reviewed8 a film, you found it to be obscene, and then you preclude9 it. There are procedural safeguards and you preclude it10 in the future.11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you've just said12 something that I think that's inconsistent with your13 earlier presentation. You said you could enjoin that14 posting. Here you said it wouldn't be effective just to15 enjoin the particular placards that were used, the16 particular words because then there would be other words.17 So the same question could come up with an Internet18 posting if you had an injunction not simply on what was19 posted but anything about this particular individual that20 might be posted in the future.21 MR. COLE: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think where22 that leaves us is you'd have to engage in some sort of23 balancing about the -- how narrowly tailored the24 injunction is and does it provide a sufficient remedy and,25 you know -- and -- and in this -- and what test we would451111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 analyze it under, strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny,2 or the Ward test. And -- and I think that in applying3 those tests, you'd have to come to a balance, and if the4 balance is that you're going to limit it to a specific5 type of speech or -- then that -- that would be a -- a6 reasonable limit, and if it creates a multiplicity of7 actions, well, so be it. But at least there's a remedy8 for that posting or postings of a similar nature. So --9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, you -- you -- to the10 extent that you're complaining about extortion-like11 conduct, something else that you drafted -- I'm looking at12 the complaint on page 7 of the joint appendix. You have13 identified all defamatory, including with the false light14 invasion of privacy, but you don't have any claim that15 looks like blackmail.16 MR. COLE: If you'd -- if I could direct you,17 Justice Ginsburg, to page 12 of the joint appendix at18 paragraphs (j) and (k) of the verified complaint, you will19 see that we alleged in a verified complaint that he'd20 engaged in three previous efforts of this same type of21 conduct, one. And two, paragraph (k), that Tory is in the22 business of professionally extorting monies from innocent23 persons and business --24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I was going to ask you25 about that. Were there findings to substantiate the461111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 allegations?234 extorting 5678 of those issues, which was the oil company. There was no9 findings on this issue.MR. COLE: Findings to substantiate --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Specifically about themoney from the bank and the oil company.MR. COLE: No, Justice Kennedy, there were not. JUSTICE KENNEDY: No findings.MR. COLE:  There was some testimony only on one10 But then I would refer you to paragraph (k)11 which specifically refers to extorting of monies. And12 also in my opening statement, as is reflected in the13 trial's transcript, the -- the first thing I said is this14 is speech designed for an improper purpose. It's15 unprotected speech designed to extort money from Mr.16 Cochran. That was the whole theme --17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what -- what I mean is18 could you have -- without using the label defamation, have19 stated a claim for extortion or blackmail? I'm not20 looking at your particular allegations but how you21 described on page 1 of the complaint what you were suing22 for: libel, libel per se, slander, slander per se, and23 invasion of privacy.24 MR. COLE: I think we could have pled extortion25 had we chose to. We could have pled inference with471111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 advantageous business relations. We probably could have2 pled California's --3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does California law require4 you to label the type of the cause of action or is it5 notice pleading based on facts?6 MR. COLE: Notice pleading based on facts, but7 we do label the causes of action. The -- the point I'm8 trying to make is whether every cause of action was pled,9 if the conduct is extortion, which is what the judge10 implicitly found by findings 20 and 27, that conduct is11 not protected. And whether we named the cause of action12 correct in the complaint or we sued for that specified13 cause of action, doesn't change what it is that we were14 seeking relief for, which is stopping this man from15 defaming Mr. Cochran until he was paid money.16 We attempted to achieve that. We thought we did17 a fair job in paragraphs 1 and 3, which they don't attack18 and I agree is not fairly included within the question19 which has been certified here, nor is an attack on the20 underlying finding.21 But we attempted in paragraph 2, broadly I22 agree, to avoid a multiplicity of actions and to give Mr.23 Tory other channels of communication other than the public24 forum where he is engaged in a continuing course of25 repetitive conduct to defame Mr. Cochran.481111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          He -- and -- and this is -- one point that Iwant to stress.  We don't view this injunction as beingviolated if he went on TV, he went on the radio, he wentin the newspapers.  We don't view those as public forumsunder the definition that this Court has provided.  Thoseare not public forums.  We are not concerned about that.We do not believe that those events will occur.  We didnot seek to protect them.  So we have given Mr. Tory anunlimited venue to speak, but we said you can't do this inthe public forum because of your continuing course ofrepetitive conduct, 3 years, once a week, 52 times a year,over 150 times, 4 hours a day.          And with that, I would submit that while theinjunction is broad, I don't believe it's aunconstitutional prior restraint, and to the extent thisCourt believes it is overbroad, I believe strikingsubparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of paragraph 2 would solvethe problem, or alternatively, that in conjunction with asuggestion that it needs to be narrowed to deal with thespeech and conduct in issue.          Thank you.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Cole.          Mr. Chemerinsky, you have 4 minutes remaining.          REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN CHEMERINSKYON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 491111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. CHEMERINSKY: Thank you.2 Justice Breyer kindly invited my thoughts about3 how an opinion might be written, and there are three4 different ways not mutually exclusive.5 One is that this injunction is vastly overbroad6 for all the reasons that have been identified. Mr. Cole7 said a couple of things. One, he said that Mr. Tory can8 go to court and ask for modification of the injunction,9 but that's what makes this a prior restraint, that Mr.10 Tory can only speak again if he goes to court and gets11 permission.12 Also, he said at the end that Mr. Tory can go13 before the media. However, under California law, under14 Damon v. Ocean Hill, the media is defined as a public15 forum.16 A second way the opinion could be written is17 that this for speech protected by the First Amendment.18 Justice Ginsburg, you asked me at the outset whether19 that's in the scope of the question presented. Well, it20 is directly relevant to what Mr. Cole was saying. Because21 it's all opinion, all hyperbole it is protected by the22 First Amendment and can't be the basis for an extortion23 claim.24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but you're asking us now25 to -- the -- the trial court found there was defamation,501111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 and now you want to argue, no, it wasn't defamation. It2 was mere opinion. I really don't see how that's included3 in the question presented.4 MR. CHEMERINSKY: I think it is because it goes5 to the question whether the injunction is permissible.6 But I go on to the third way that the opinion7 could be written, and that's that injunctions are not8 permissible as a remedy in a defamation case. We agree9 that if there is a cause of action for extortion, it can10 have an injunction as a remedy. We agree if the cause of11 action is for harassment, there can be an injunction as a12 remedy. But those have specific elements that have to be13 met. Those elements weren't met in this case.14 History is clear that injunctions aren't allowed15 in defamation cases, and also, Your Honor, it's quite16 important that Mr. Cole even said you can't craft a narrow17 injunction in a defamation case. Any injunction is either18 too narrow or too broad.19 In Near v. Minnesota, this Court said that it20 was telling that in 150 years of the history of the First21 Amendment, there had never been an injunction approved by22 this Court in a defamation case. We're now 70 years later23 than that. To approve an injunction in a case like this,24 even though it's called defamation plus extortion, will25 open the door to injunctions as a routine matter in511111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425defamation cases across the country. No --JUSTICE GINSBURG: There have been -- there havebeen injunctions against harassing conduct, threatening,stalking.          MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Yes, Your Honor, and we haveno objection to injunctions of that sort.  What we objectto is an injunction as a remedy in a defamation case andan injunction that is directed at speech.  That's what theFirst Amendment prohibits.Thank you.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.Chemerinsky.          The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 11:11 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 40052 1-Washington, DC 20005
