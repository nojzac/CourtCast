Bazzle.Mr. Phillips.ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPSON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court:First in Volt and then again last term in WaffleHouse this Court made clear that, quote, arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act is a matter of consent, not coercion. It is that core Federal principle that was violated by the South Carolina Supreme Court in this case.QUESTION: Well, Mr. Phillips, now, the contract presumably can be interpreted in accordance with the law of the State with jurisdiction.MR. PHILLIPS: Oh, to be sure, Justice O'Connor, but this contract was not interpreted in accordance with the understanding of the parties, with -- with respect to the parties. Ultimately, you have to look for the parties' consent to this kind of an agreement, and what the South Carolina Supreme Court was quite clear about --QUESTION: Well, there was no express provision31111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 in the arbitration agreement saying that you can't have2 class-wide arbitration.3 MR. PHILLIPS: To be sure, there was no express4 provision to that effect, but if you look at the South5 Carolina Supreme Court's decision in this case what it6 says is, first, the parties were absolutely silent with7 respect to class arbitration. That's not surprising.8 I've never read a class arbitration clause in any9 contract, and I'm told that no one's ever even attempted10 to draft a class arbitration clause.11 But second of all, the -- the court went further12 than that and said what was going to inform its judgment13 about how to interpret or how to apply this particular14 situation, it wasn't anything with respect to the language15 or understanding of the parties. What it was was, without16 any contractual directive whatsoever, stated twice, the17 court simply coerced Green Tree to defend a class18 arbitration proceeding.19 QUESTION: Well, but the --20 QUESTION: Well, how does that -- how does21 differ from Volt, Mr. Phillips? There, the contract22 didn't say anything about the court staying the23 arbitration, and yet we said in our opinion that that was24 a permissible thing for a -- that once the law of25 California had been invoked, that was a permissible thing41111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425to be done.MR. PHILLIPS: In -- the difference between thiscase and Volt, Mr. Chief Justice, is there the parties agreed that the arbitration itself would be controlled solely by California law. That was the consent of the parties.QUESTION: Well, they said the place where the construction was -- was taken.MR. PHILLIPS: Right, and that was understood by this Court, and by the lower courts as a matter of State law, to embrace California law.QUESTION: But didn't the agreement here say it wouldSouth Carolina?MR. PHILLIPS: The --governed by South Carolina law,provision itself is governed exclusively by the Federal Arbitration Act.QUESTION: Well, is your -- your argument that if the South Carolina court is unreasonable in interpreting State law, then it comes up here? I -- I just don't understand how we get this -- this question.MR. PHILLIPS: It seems to me there are two ways you can get to this question. In this case, there was no effort by South Carolina Supreme Court to apply South51111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005-- didn't the -- didn't be governed by the law ofthe underlying contract is￼but the arbitration1 Carolina law. What they did -- they're not looking for2 the consent of the parties. They're looking to coerce a3 result based on their view of efficiency and equity which4 involves the interests of completely third parties to5 this -- to this situation, not the parties to this6 particular agreement. If --7 QUESTION: Why do you -- I'm sorry, I thought8 you were done.9 MR. PHILLIPS: If, in fact, South Carolina had10 purported -- if the South Carolina Supreme Court had11 purported to try to interpret this agreement as in some12 sense reflecting a -- a consent by the parties to a13 class-based arbitration it would be a much, much closer14 case.15 QUESTION: Well, what --16 MR. PHILLIPS: That's not the standard that the17 court applied here.18 QUESTION: What if the South Carolina court in a19 somewhat different case had said this arbitration is going20 to be governed by our State rules of discovery. The21 parties have said nothing about it, but they just say, if22 you're going to be bound by the laws of South Carolina,23 that's what you're going to do. Is that bad?24 MR. PHILLIPS: No, that's not bad at all,25 Mr. Chief Justice. The difference between that, of61111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425course, is that is what you expect when you -- when you consent to a bilateral arbitration arrangement. When you say, we're going to proceed to resolve this dispute in an efficient and economical fashion, you understand that that means arbitration, however the -- however that gets played out and, indeed, generally speaking, you would expect that to be a question for the arbitrator, more than you might as a matter of State law.The difference here, of course, is we're talking about making a decision that's binding, or at least purports to be binding on literally thousands of other individuals who are not parties to this agreement, and this goes --QUESTION: And who are not -- and who are not objecting so far as I know.QUESTION: Yes.MR. PHILLIPS: Well --QUESTION: Green Tree is the one who'sobjecting.MR. PHILLIPS: Well, we don't know whether theyobjected or not. All we know is that they received notice and took no action as a consequence of it, but --QUESTION: Why -- please.MR. PHILLIPS: If you -- if you flip this case around, in this situation, where the -- where the unnamed71111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 members potentially are going to receive $5,000 to $7,5002 of windfall recoveries, my guess is they're not going to3 object, but what if the case had gone the other way. What4 if the arbitrator had issued a $1 nominal damage award for5 each member of this class. Does anyone seriously doubt6 that the next day any of those unnamed class members could7 show up and say, excuse me, I have a right under my8 contract to choose my arbitrator in an agreement between9 myself --10 QUESTION: Yes. Yes, one might doubt it if11 their claim was worth $2, and it would cost them more to12 go into court to make the objection. The -- the class13 action vehicle in some cases will make an action possible14 that wouldn't be brought before an arbitrator before.15 The --16 MR. PHILLIPS: Can I -- can I respond to that,17 Justice Ginsburg, because you see, it seems to me that18 that simply reflects the manifest hostility to the19 arbitration agreement as it's been -- as it's been written20 by the parties here.21 I mean, basically what we're talking about is,22 we have a dispute. It involves what will largely be a few23 thousand dollars, potentially. I mean, the entire24 contract here involved $15,000 of -- in one case and25 $7,500. You expect the disputes are going to be81111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 relatively small, and you expect that the parties are2 going to choose an efficient method of trying to resolve3 those cases and move on, and -- and they waive their right4 to a public, or judicial review, because the theory is,5 win or lose, it's worth taking the risk.6 When you take that kind of a situation and you7 convert it into a $27 million fine, nobody would agree to8 that ab initio.9 QUESTION: Do you --10 QUESTION: That's true. That's true, but what's11 bothering me is exactly this point. I can understand your12 argument to this point. A State, I don't think could13 possibly, consistent with section 2, interpret the word14 arbitration in a contract to contain all the bells and15 whistles of a court proceeding, because that would16 transform the arbitration into a court proceeding, and17 therefore they would have, in this subtle way, not only18 have shown hostility to but destroyed the arbitration19 contract, but what about this one. Is this hostile to20 arbitration?21 I have no doubt that Green Tree wouldn't have22 agreed, in all likelihood, had they known what was going23 to happen, and to that extent it is hostile to24 arbitration, but the consumers on the other side might25 have said, oh, we rather like it, in which case from their91111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425point of view it isn't hostile to arbitration, so sort of from one side it is, and from the other side it isn't, and how do we decide whether, overall, it is or it isn't?MR. PHILLIPS: It seems to me that the linchpin theory of the case ought to be the -- the point I started with, Justice Breyer, which is, you look to determine whether there is the consent of the parties or whether --QUESTION: No, but what we don't know here is whether there is or there isn't. We have silence, and like many contracts that are silent, you have to impute an intent, and what South Carolina did is --MR. PHILLIPS: Well, what South Carolina did -- QUESTION: -- is, they imputed an intent.MR. PHILLIPS: -- they imputed an intent. QUESTION: And they did it by a rule that saysthat since the other parties in our minds would have jumped for joy, and you, your client would have weeped in dismay, we in that situation interpret the contract against the drafter, which happened to be your client, so they chose the other side and thereby concluded that it was not hostile to arbitration, though it wasn't in the interest of one of the parties.MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it also doesn't reflect the consent of both of the parties.QUESTION: Well --101111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. PHILLIPS: Both parties have to consent, Justice Breyer. That's the nature of consent.QUESTION: You -- you --MR. PHILLIPS: You simply can't have unilateralconsent.QUESTION: The reason, as I understand it -- the reason, as I understand it, you say there isn't consent was the reason you gave in your answer to the Chief Justice, that, in fact, they had agreed to be bound by South Carolina law with respect to the interpretation of the contract, but not with respect to the arbitration clause itself, and my question is, how do you draw that line? There's nothing, per se, inconsistent between applying the FAA and applying some State law. That has to be done.MR. PHILLIPS: Well --QUESTION: So why do you draw --MR. PHILLIPS: -- South Carolina Supreme Courtdrew that line. The South Carolina Supreme Court specifically held that the parties agreed that the arbitration clause would be governed exclusively by the Federal Arbitration Act, and the --QUESTION: No, but I mean, you say governed exclusively by the FAA, in the sense that the FAA naturally is going to trump any inconsistency with State111111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 law, but here, there isn't a clear inconsistency with2 State law, and the FAA is always applied with some State3 law in mind. You have to have some procedure, and so on,4 and -- and therefore I -- I don't know how you can draw5 this nonporous line between the FAA and arbitration on one6 hand and State law on the other.7 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, there are two ways to get8 there. First of all, as a matter of just South Carolina9 law we know that South Carolina's arbitration provisions10 completely go by the wayside as a matter of State law.11 Munoz held that several years ago. If the FAA applies,12 there is no State law that is residual to it. It is13 determined by the Federal Arbitration Act, which means14 that the arbitrator is going to make certain kinds of15 decisions.16 But the -- I think the key line here is that17 arbitrators are absolutely free to fashion whatever rules18 they think are appropriate for resolving disputes in a19 bilateral situation. The question is, where does the20 arbitrator get the authority to reach out to literally21 thousands of other parties in order to resolve their22 rights?23 QUESTION: Mr. Phillips, first, you're not --24 you're not urging that there's any inherent inconsistency25 between the arbitration and class action. You concede in121111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 your brief, I think, that if the parties agreed, yes, you2 could have a class action in arbitration.3 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, although, Justice Ginsburg,4 there is not a single example that I could identify of any5 parties ever agreeing to go into a class action through6 arbitration.7 QUESTION: Have there been no class actions8 in -- in arbitration?MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry?QUESTION: Have there been no class actions9 1011 in-- 12131415 that's --16 the only places, and the reason is, is that what you17 create is this extraordinarily hideous hybrid kind of a18 proceeding.19 QUESTION: Does the AAA have no rules about --20 MR. PHILLIPS: No.21 QUESTION: -- class actions? It's just22 silent --23 MR. PHILLIPS: Not as far as I know. I mean,24 they didn't file a brief in this case, but as far as I25 know AAA doesn't have rules specifically dealing with it.MR. PHILLIPS: Other than this one? QUESTION: Yes.MR. PHILLIPS: There are in California, but that's it. California and South Carolina are￼131111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 They find it to be, as I understand it, quite burdensome2 to try to figure out how to deal with it. If you think3 about it, this -- you're -- you're taking a dispute that4 by its nature is supposed to involve a few thousand5 dollars, converting it into $27 million. The costs in6 this case 789alone --QUESTION: Well, suppose --MR. PHILLIPS: -- were $36,000.QUESTION: If the parties had chosen, say, a New10 York forum -- I thought an arbitration agreement is11 supposed to be a forum for action laws.12 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, that's part of it.13 QUESTION: If they said nothing about class14 action and they chose New York as a forum, New York has a15 class action vehicle. They could get -- the plaintiffs16 could get a class action, is that not so?17 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, the difficulty with18 that is that there's -- there's no State law in general --19 I mean, there are no statutes out there that provide for20 class actions with respect to arbitrations. That's why￼21 this is a 2223 something 24hostile --QUESTION: But it -- it -- then arbitration is other than a mere choice of forum, because -- MR. PHILLIPS: Oh, absolutely. The Federal25 Arbitration Act creates a substantive law of141111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 arbitrability. To be sure, it incorporates and embraces2 decisionmaking by the arbitrator. It recognizes some3 limited role in some circumstances for State law, although4 again South Carolina doesn't do that, but there -- there5 is nothing that provides a mechanism for converting your6 ordinary bilateral --7 QUESTION: Can I -- can I interrupt with this8 question, Mr. Phillips? Supposing you had the -- Green9 Tree had agreements with a large -- large number of10 consumers, and suppose 15 of them filed separate11 arbitrations, they all went before the same arbitrator.12 Could the arbitrator have entered an order saying, I think13 it would be efficient to have all these cases tried14 together, so I'm going to enter an order requiring you to15 do so?16 MR. PHILLIPS: I -- I think if the parties all17 agreed to have it resolved by the same arbitrator --18 QUESTION: Well, supposing the -- supposing19 Green Tree objects. Could he nevertheless do it?20 MR. PHILLIPS: No. I think in that situation21 what you're then doing is depriving us of our right under22 those agreements to choose our own arbitrator.23 QUESTION: Oh, but here -- here the South24 Carolina arbitrator, which you -- you certainly consented25 to his appointment, went ahead and did pretty much this.151111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1234 Mr. Chief 5MR. PHILLIPS: Well --QUESTION: Not -- not as sweeping --MR. PHILLIPS: This in a vengeance, I will say, Justice.QUESTION: Well, but what is your -- what is6 your principle objection to Justice Stevens' hypothetical7 where the8 I'm going9arbitrator simply says, I've got 15 of these and to just try them together?MR. PHILLIPS: I -- I have a substantial --10 substantially less of an objection to that kind of a11 procedure because it doesn't adjudicate unnamed parties'12 rights, or purport to adjudicate those rights. At least13 you have a real dispute that already exists --14 QUESTION: But --15 MR. PHILLIPS: -- which can justify in some16 sense consolidation. I still think you have to respect17 Green Tree's right --￼QUESTION: But then -- but you say your -- your would have been cured if the arbitrator had letter to every plaintiff and gotten an -- a1819 objection20 written a21 written okay, that would have made it okay?22 MR. PHILLIPS: No, because the -- the23 arbitration process requires the filing of claims and24 going through it.25 QUESTION: Well then, what's the difference161111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425between that and my 15-individual case?MR. PHILLIPS: Because we don't know whetherthere is, in fact, a dispute between the parties in the absence of some effort by the plaintiffs to come forward.QUESTION: Well, they know there's a common issue in all these cases -- I mean, they -- they all had the same legal issue involved, didn't they?MR. PHILLIPS: But -- but it -- just because you may have a right doesn't mean you necessarily care to assert your right. Again, it's -- it's easy to look at this case and say, well, gee, there's an opportunity to pick up $5,000 in windfall, or $7,500 in windfall, but you know, an arbitrator could just as easily have rendered a decision here that said, this is a pure technicality, it's entitled to $1 in nominal damages, and the class-wide relief ought to be $1,900, and attorney's fees ought to be a third of that, which is $600 --QUESTION: And -- and --MR. PHILLIPS: -- and I guarantee you they would not be willing or prepared to -- I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy.QUESTION: Please, finish your answer.MR. PHILLIPS: They would not be prepared to abide by that. Every one of the unnamed members would say, I never had an opportunity to -- to participate in171111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 the selection of the arbitrator who has resolved my2 substantial rights. There's no basis at all to bind me3 under these circumstances, and I'm going to show up and4 make a claim.5 QUESTION: Well, the obvious solution to that6 would be to read into their contract the idea that they7 had agreed to that situation provided they're fairly8 represented, et cetera, and if they don't like the result,9 they can arbitrate that, too.10 MR. PHILLIPS: But see, Justice Breyer, we -- we11 keep making up more and more and more, and none of this12 is -- is at all linked to any kind of consent among any of13 these parties.14 QUESTION: I want to ask about consent. At what15 point and how did you first object to the class action?16 Did -- did you instruct the arbitrator that we consented17 to your appointment for individuals A, B, and C, but not18 for other --￼19202122232425MR. PHILLIPS: Yes.QUESTION: We -- we do not consent.MR. PHILLIPS: We do not consent to that. QUESTION: And when did you do that?MR. PHILLIPS: We raised that as -- QUESTION: After the first --MR. PHILLIPS: -- as early and often --181111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: -- the idea of class action.MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, and the South Carolina Supreme Court specifically addressed the question of waiver and found that we never waived our right with respect to that.QUESTION: But you did select the arbitrator. It was your arbitrator.MR. PHILLIPS: It was our arbitrator with respect to the dispute with the Bazzles and the Lackeys and the Buggses, to be sure, but we did not agree to an arbitrator to resolve any disputes involving unnamed third parties --QUESTION: Well, it leaves this open, and I mean, I agree with you that it is -- whether you did -- whether this or is not the proper interpretation of what the parties intended is certainly disputable, and if it's disputable, why shouldn't the arbitrator decide that?MR. PHILLIPS: See, I don't think it is disputed what the parties -- what the parties intended, Justice Breyer.QUESTION: Well -- well, wait. You -- I'm going to hear in about 10 minutes or so a pretty good argument the other side, too --MR. PHILLIPS: Except that --QUESTION: -- so that my question is, where you191111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425have a contract that says, interpretations of the contractor should be arbitrated, and where, in fact, what we're arguing about today is how one part of the contract should be interpreted, how did we get here? Why wasn't that referred to the arbitrator?MR. PHILLIPS: Because the question of whetherthe arbitrator has the authority to resolve unnamed third parties is not a question for to decide. That's a question for the courtthe rights of the arbitrator to decide.a--QUESTION: Why?MR. PHILLIPS: Because it goes --QUESTION: I would have thought the meaning ofMR. PHILLIPS: It goes to the core of the arbitrator's jurisdiction and authority to decide.QUESTION: No, but wait. There is a case, including one I just wrote, I think, for the Court which makes very clear that what you send to the arbitrator -- I mean, there are dozens of cases where you have a phrase in a contract, and that's in dispute, and the parties have agreed we send disputes about the meaning of the contract to arbitration, you send that to the arbitrator.I mean, the only things that you don't are whether there's the arbitration contract is itself valid, et cetera.201111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Breyer, I think on question of whether the arbitrator has jurisdictionrights of decide --QUESTION: Yes.MR. PHILLIPS: -- and authority to decide a party, that is a question for the courtmean, I opinion of one.the --the toQUESTION: Okay, is there any -- is thereMR. PHILLIPS: -- not for the arbitrator. QUESTION: Is there any case you could cite -- Iread most of them when I -- when I wrote thein the Howsam case. I don't think you can thinkMR. PHILLIPS: But Howsam dealt with the specific problem of the procedures to be followed with respect to a bilateral --QUESTION: Oh, are we talking about that here?MR. PHILLIPS: No, we're not talking about the procedures to be followed in a bilateral agreement. We're talking about what you have to do --QUESTION: Well, I --MR. PHILLIPS: -- to resolve the rights of third parties who are not signatories --QUESTION: Why should --QUESTION: At least as to the other contracts -- MR. PHILLIPS: Yes.211111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005any --￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: -- the ones that get sucked into this massive litigation, it is certainly a jurisdictional issue --MR. PHILLIPS: That -- that's my point, JusticeScalia.QUESTION: -- if not as to yours. Yours, you -- you agree to the arbitrator and whatnot, but -- buttake -- take somebody else who --MR. PHILLIPS: And anything the arbitrator didtous--QUESTION: I'm sorry, I don't understand the meaning of when you say it's a jurisdictional issue, when you agree to somebody else's statement it's a jurisdictional issue. What I have in front of me is a contract. It says, in this phrase, disputes will be arbitrated, there is a question, what does that mean, that word arbitration in this contract, and then I know that the parties have agreed to arbitrate the meaning of the dispute, all right -- of any phrase --￼MR. PHILLIPS: QUESTION: -- MR. PHILLIPS: QUESTION: Socourt, was my question? MR. PHILLIPS:Right, but --including Right.-- so howBecause,22that one.did we suddenly get into Justice Breyer, the --1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 the contract says that -- that it binds us and you, and us2 and you are defined as Green Tree and the -- and the3 specific named participants in this proceeding. It4 doesn't say word one about the rights of all of the other5 individuals in this --6 QUESTION: But the other individuals --7 MR. PHILLIPS: -- and the South Carolina -- I'm8 sorry.9 QUESTION: The other individuals are not here10 complaining. I mean, they're probably glad they got11 the 7,000 bucks --12 MR. PHILLIPS: Oh, they're not here complaining13 today, but Mr. Chief Justice, you're going to have to14 resolve the question of whether or not you can interpret15 an arbitration agreement in a way that allows these kinds16 of proceedings for the -- for the generality of cases, and17 what do we --18 QUESTION: If you're concerned about the third19 parties, how does it differ from a court-declared class20 action where the safeguards are the class members have21 notice, and there's a notice here that is clearer than22 most notices, and if they're -- if they say that they were23 inadequately represented, they could collateral attack on24 that basis. Why should those States' laws be any25 different in an arbitral forum than in a court forum?231111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. PHILLIPS: Well, if you were going to allow a class action in an arbitral forum you would certainly want those -- those protections to be built in. My point is, is that the way you get those kinds of protections to exist in the ordinary class action is because the State coerces the litigation. The ordinary rule is that you cannot represent third parties, and the court has identified as a matter of its power situations in which it's going to embrace that approach, but that doesn't get you past the contract problem.QUESTION: But the court can't do it as it -- the Federal rules have a class action provision --MR. PHILLIPS: Yes.QUESTION: -- and the Federal rules can't affect substantive rights, only procedure, so the class action device, classes are certified every day in -- in Federal court --MR. PHILLIPS: But --QUESTION: -- and they're not changing the substance of any contract that they're declaring in a contract setting, a class action.MR. PHILLIPS: The -- the difference there, Justice Ginsburg, is that here we're talking about a situation where the full authority of the arbitrator is defined by the consent of the specific parties to the241111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 agreement, and these parties don't have the authority to2 bind nonparties. The Court said just last term in3 Waffle House --4 QUESTION: They're not in court by reason of a5 contract.6 MR. PHILLIPS: I -- I'm sorry, Your Honor?7 QUESTION: They are not in court by reason of a8 contract.9 MR. PHILLIPS: That's correct, Justice Scalia.10 QUESTION: Here, they are before the arbitrator11 only by reason of a contract.12 MR. PHILLIPS: That's correct, Your Honor,13 and -- and --14 QUESTION: But isn't the difficulty --15 I -- I'm still having trouble getting over this.16 the difficulty that -- one -- one thing you said17 ago is -- is really not accurate, I don't think.18 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I apologize --19 QUESTION: They don't consent to every20 tittle of the means by which the arbitration will be21 conducted.22 They consent in a gross kind of way to23 arbitration or nonarbitration, and -- and that's -- that's24 what their consent makes the difference between, but they25 don't consent to every consequent detail that enters into251111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005andI--Isn't a secondjot and￼1 the actual conduct of the arbitration, so why should we2 draw the line where you want us to draw the line as3 opposed to drawing the line a little further and saying,4 if you consent to arbitration and a State says, not5 inconsistently with the FAA, arbitration can be done on a6 class basis if there are common issues and so on? Why7 should we draw the line to exclude that?8 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, there are two answers to9 that. The premise of it, which is that the FAA doesn't10 have anything to say about this, but the core principle of11 the FAA is that there is supposed to be consent of the12 parties, so we ought to be looking to the expectations of13 the parties to determine what rights you're going to14 adjudicate as a matter of arbitration.15 QUESTION: You're -- you're saying, this is so16 far from anything that would have been contemplated --17 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes.18 QUESTION: -- as a detail to be filled in later,19 and that's why you draw the line --20 MR. PHILLIPS: That's -- that is exactly right,21 Justice Souter, and if you look at the South Carolina22 Supreme Court's opinion it doesn't talk about anything23 that has to do with consent. It talks about equity and24 fairness and judicial economy, all factors that influence25 the rights of third parties who have nothing to do with261111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 the arbitration agreement that's before the arbitrator.2 QUESTION: I thought the South Carolina Supreme3 Court said there's a -- there's a silence in this contract4 and we're going to construe it against the drafter. You5 concede that you could have arbitration in a class format,6 and so that South Carolina said it doesn't -- this7 contract doesn't say one way or the other and we'll8 construe it against the drafter.9 MR. PHILLIPS: The -- but what the South10 Carolina Supreme Court said was, we're going to promote11 judicial economy and we're going to do it without a12 contractual directive to do so.13 To be sure, the court said we -- we do not find14 language so clear here -- because you know, what they're15 basically worried about is, does this absolutely prohibit16 the possibility of class arbitration. Is there language17 in there that says, under no circumstances will we ever18 have class arbitration. I would have read the -- this19 agreement to have actually said that, but they didn't say20 that.21 What they said is, well, we think it's -- we22 think it's ambiguous, and therefore we'll construe it23 against you, but all that gets you to the point is that24 the contract says nothing about this, and the problem with25 trying to square that with the FAA is that the animus for,271111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 or the -- the motivation for acting under the Federal2 Arbitration Act is the consent of the parties, not simply3 can you manipulate the contract in a way that gets you4 to--5 QUESTION: But it -- but it is true, is it not,6 that everybody in the class has consented to an7 arbitration with Green Tree --8MR. PHILLIPS: No. No.QUESTION: Not to a class action arbitration, arbitration.MR. PHILLIPS: Well, has -- well, has-- yes, has signed an arbitration agreement -- QUESTION: But not with these arbitrators. MR. PHILLIPS: But not with this arbitrator,910 but to an 1112 consented 131415 that's correct.16 QUESTION: But I thought that --17 MR. PHILLIPS: We had --18 QUESTION: But they have consented to the --19 MR. PHILLIPS: And we have a right in it, and20 it's worth pointing out we still have a right, with21 respect to each one of those third party claims, to have22 our choice of arbitrators.

As Justice Kennedy observed, we24 went --25￼QUESTION: But is it really reasonable to assume281111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 that if he knew he had a thousand different arbitrations2 coming up 345he'd want a thousand different arbitrators? MR. PHILLIPS: Sure.QUESTION: With the same issue in every case? MR. PHILLIPS: Sure. Why not?QUESTION: Don't they wear -- wear out after678 just one case, then?QUESTION: Because --MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the -- the point is that -- QUESTION: You might not want to put your entire future in the hands of one arbitrator. MR. PHILLIPS: Of a single arbitrator -- QUESTION: Yes.MR. PHILLIPS: -- with no right to judicial15 review -- 161718 is, why would we make a judgment at the outset of this19 process that says, we are going to enter into the most20 informal decisionmaking process with no right to judicial21 review and with $27 million at stake.9 1011 company's 121314￼222324 madness. 25QUESTION: Where -- where is it --MR.

Is that how your objection was phrased, and where can I find it in the record?MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Kennedy, I'm going to have to answer that on -- in the rebuttal.QUESTION: All right.MR. PHILLIPS: I'll give you the specific citation when I step up here. If there are no other questions, I'll reserve the balance of my time.QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Phillips. Ms. Pillard, we'll hear from you. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CORNELIA T.L. PILLARDON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSMS. PILLARD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court:Green Tree first protested by asking the arbitrator to decide whether the case could go forward as a class. They did not object to his power to decide, but they asked him to decide and I -- I think the relevant document is on page 15 of the joint appendix, which is Green Tree's memorandum to the arbitrator.There is nothing in the FAA that preempts a State court or arbitrator from applying ordinary State301111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 contract law, the doctrine of construction against the2 drafter, to read a contract to authorize class3 arbitration. As a legal matter, the consent of the4 parties is determined under State contract law by applying5 the doctrines of contract law to resolve ambiguities where6 they exist.7 QUESTION: What doctrine of state contract law8 led you -- led to this result, the doctrine of construe9 the instrument against, contra proferentem against the10 person who drafted it?11 MS. PILLARD: That's exactly right, Justice12 Scalia.13 QUESTION: Now, can -- can that produce14 anything? I mean, suppose one side claims the contract15 says nothing about it, but one side claims, you should pay16 all the costs of the arbitrator, all right. Is -- is a17 State court going to decide that question by simply18 saying, well, the contract says nothing about it, but to19 do it that way would be against the interests of the20 drafter, so yes, it's in the contract?21 MS. PILLARD: The --22 QUESTION: And my next question is going to be,23 what if the other side comes in and says, you ought to pay24 me $10 million, and the other side says, gee, there's25 nothing in the contract about that.311111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425(Laughter.)QUESTION: Can the State court say, well, it's against the -- it's against the interests of the drafter so it must be there in the contract?weird --I mean, that seems -- this seems to me just asMS. PILLARD: You apply --QUESTION: -- to -- to pluck out a right to a class action for no other reason than that it is against the interests of the person who drafted the contract. It's weird.MS. PILLARD: Justice Scalia, the -- the argument is that the arbitrator has the authority under State law to interpret the ambiguity in the contract, and it's not weird at all in this case, where, since 1979 in South Carolina, arbitrators have had the authority to consolidate arbitrations, and the leading cases, Champ, the case on which Green Tree relies, Episcopal Housing, which is the First Circuit case, the -- the cases that look at whether this is allowed, advert to -- I'm sorry, Episcopal Housing was itself a consolidation case, but the cases that allow class arbitration advert to the underlying rule in the jurisdiction --QUESTION: There's a big difference -- QUESTION: What are consolidation arbitration --321111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 what do you mean by that? You mean when the same2 arbitrator has more than one case involving the same3 issue?4 MS. PILLARD: The same arbitrator can take5 different disputes under arbitration clauses and bring6 them together where --7 QUESTION: When he's been selected for the8 various issues. I mean he -- he's been selected in -- in9 all of the various cases. The parties have agreed to this10 arbitrator. They just haven't agreed to have them all11 decided in one proceeding, is that right?12 MS. PILLARD: That's right. They're all -- but,13 that's one of the versions --14 QUESTION: But that -- that's a long -- that's a15 long way off from compelling somebody who hasn't agreed to16 this arbitration.17 MS. PILLARD: It -- it's not at all. First of18 all, I disagree with the premise of your question, Justice19 Scalia, that they haven't agreed to this. Where the20 contract permits it, what Green Tree and the -- the class21 members, absent and named class members agreed to was a22 contract with the potential for a class proceeding, with23 the potential for a class proceeding.24 This -- under the Southland cases, since --25 since 20 years ago cases have been going forward --331111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: That begs the question. I mean, that2 precisely begs the question. I mean --3 MS. PILLARD: They --4 QUESTION: -- that's what we're debating,5 whether they -- whether they agreed to that or not, and to6 say that they agreed to it because they agreed to it7 doesn't get us very far.8 MS. PILLARD: This is an FAA preemption case,9 but the FAA has nothing to say here. The10 anything about class arbitration, and theact doesn't say FAA ousts only11 State law 1213 hostile? 14that is hostile to arbitration.QUESTION: All right, well, whyIt seems to me that is the question.MS. PILLARD: It's not hostile --QUESTION: Well, wait, let me give you an You would agree that the State couldn't silence as follows. The word arbitration in1516 example.17 interpret18 this contract, since it's silent, means that the19 arbitration will take place at the bottom of a coal mine20 with no air, okay. We agree, right?21 MS. PILLARD: Right.22 QUESTION: All right, and what the other side23 has said is, you know, in respect to one of the parties,24 this is the same thing. Of course my client would never25 have agreed to arbitration if he knew that a class actionisn't this￼341111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 lawyer could find a provision in the contract that nobody2 thinks really hurt them but, in fact, we didn't live up3 to, and then obtain $10 million in a judgment before an4 arbitrator, of which he gets three and the rest is5 distributed.6 Now, look, that's what we were trying to get7 away from. That's why we went to arbitration and not the8 court. Of course we wouldn't agree to such a thing, and9 of course reading such a thing into the silence is the10 same as putting us at the bottom of that coal mine, or at11 least close enough so you cannot say that it is neutral as12 to whether or not arbitration is good or bad or likely to13 occur, or Volt was neutral or pro-arbitration. This State14 rule is not neutral, it is hostile to it.15 Now, that's basically their argument, as I16 understand it, and I'd like to hear the reply.17 MS. PILLARD: I think, Justice Breyer, that18 misapprehends what we mean by hostile to arbitration.19 Hostility to arbitration refers to State rules that are20 suspicious of or undermine the ability of an arbitral21 forum to resolve a dispute, and saying that a case is22 going to proceed on a class basis is a far cry from saying23 this case is going to proceed at the bottom of a coal24 mine, where parties' rights would actually be -- would not25 be able to be fulfilled. That's the outside edge. This351111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 Court has -- has always said, well, arbitration can't go2 forward if the parties can't get meaningful relief, and --3 and I think your coal mine case would be such a case.4 But what we mean by hostile to arbitration is5 not whether one or the other party to the arbitration6 wishes that they, in the end, once the dispute arises,7 that they weren't before an arbitrator. No. What we mean8 is, whether State law reflects a suspicion about the9 capacity of arbitration to resolve a dispute, and if10 anybody --11 QUESTION: Could they -- could they then have a12 State law that says, and the party that invokes the13 arbitration in the contract will receive from the other14 party a bonus of about $100,000 for having done a good15 thing? See, that's equally ridiculous as to my example in16 the coal mine, and all I've done is make sure that the17 arbitration -- it's not -- it's not -- you see, it18 satisfies your test.19 MS. PILLARD: I -- I don't think it does,20 because it's -- well, because it's -- it's targeted at the21 arbitration, and if the State had such a rule one could22 look at, what's the purpose, what's the legitimate purpose23 of that rule --24 QUESTION: They love arbitration. Oh, but25 forget my ridiculous example. Go ahead with your -- with361111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425your -- with your explanation.MS. PILLARD: It seems the -- well, that is --is the focus. The focus has to be whether the State law, not looking at ex post, once the parties are -- are unhappy with the broadly worded contract --QUESTION: Okay, I've got that. Then do you think -- the other question that's bothering me -- that was one, and there's one other, is that we have the words in the contract here, and the words are, the dispute, any claim, including what the contract means, or the validity of the arbitration clause, et cetera, shall be resolved by binding arbitration, by one arbitrator, selected by us, with consent of you, okay.MS. PILLARD: Yes.QUESTION: That's the phrase.MS. PILLARD: Yes.QUESTION: Now, there obviously is adisagreement as to the meaning of that phrase. Well, why shouldn't that be arbitrated?MS. PILLARD: Exactly, and it was.QUESTION: All right. Then what we should do in this case is say, forget what the North Carolina Supreme Court says --QUESTION: South Carolina.QUESTION: South Carolina, sorry. I got it371111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425right the first time -- South Carolina Supreme Court. Forget what they say. The question is, what did the parties mean, and therefore send it back to the arbitrator for that determination, not influenced by the South Carolina opinion in front of us. Now, is that the correct resolution, then?MS. PILLARD: No, Justice Breyer.QUESTION: Because?MS. PILLARD: Because the arbitrator already didlook at this clause and decided that the -- that the language of the arbitration agreement allowed him to decide.QUESTION: I thought the first case was a case where the South Carolina Supreme Court, Bazzle or one of them was -- the South Carolina Supreme Court said what it meant, not the arbitrator. The second case, which was in front of the arbitrator, was the arbitrator being influenced by what the South Carolina Supreme Court had said.MS. PILLARD: The -- the Bazzle case did not go up to the South Carolina Supreme Court before --QUESTION: Then it's the other, it's Lackey the Supreme Court --MS. PILLARD: The cases came up to the Supreme Court together --381111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Yes.2 MS. PILLARD: -- after both decisions were made,3 and as an initial matter the Bazzle case went to the trial4 court, which decided as an initial matter that the -- in5 the Lackey case the -- the arbitrator made the decision as6 an initial matter, looking at the language of the contract7 and determining, without any prior judicial instruction on8 the matter --9 QUESTION: Not an instruction, but -- but was he10 not guided or influenced in some way by the Supreme Court11 decision?12 MS. PILLARD: Green Tree tries for the first13 time in this Court to dispute that the arbitrator in14 Lackey made an independent decision --15 QUESTION: Yes.16 MS. PILLARD: -- that the contract authorized17 class arbitration. That argument is a complete red18 herring. Their own brief to the South Carolina Supreme19 Court repeatedly asserted that in Lackey the arbitrator,20 quote, took it upon himself to determine the propriety of21 a class-wide arbitration and certify a class. That's at22 page 29 of their South Carolina Supreme Court brief. They23 say again and again -- their question presented refers to24 the arbitrator deciding the class action issue himself.25 That's question presented 2 --391111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: That was in -- that was in Lackey. In Bazzle, did the arbitrator, after the, what I'll call referral from the State trial court, did the arbitrator then say, as an -- as an independent matter, I ratify, I confirm, I -- I agree that the contract should be interpreted this way, or does it -- or did he just say, I am following the order of the court?MS. PILLARD: We don't have either precisely, but let me tell you what I think is relevant to that. The arbitrator in Bazzle did also consider the issue. The issue was placed squarely before the arbitrator when Green Tree moved him to decertify the class to grant that Green Tree did fight this, a --QUESTION: Wait, wait, wait. Why -- why -- what issue was placed before him when they moved to decertify him?MS. PILLARD: They moved to decertify --QUESTION: The issue of whether he would be in -- in violation of the order of the South Carolina Supreme Court?MS. PILLARD: There was no order of the South Carolina Supreme Court at that time.QUESTION: No.MS. PILLARD: There was only the order of the trial court, which read the contract to allow class401111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 arbitration. Then it -- the class was certified and sent2 to the arbitrator, and then the issue was before the3 arbitrator should he decertify the class, and Green Tree4 argued that -- that they should.5 Moreover, in Green Tree's motion to vacate the6 award, after the arbitrator in Bazzle made the arbitration7 award, they characterized the arbitrator as having made8 the decision that the class could proceed in arbitration.9 QUESTION: I'm sure they did, so -- but my10 impression is they appointed in Bazzle, the district court11 appointed a class, or certified it.12 MS. PILLARD: Certified a class.13 QUESTION: All right, it was after that that14 they go to the arbitrator in Lackey, and now what they're15 telling us is, the arbitrator in Lackey, knowing that the16 district court had appointed the class in Bazzle, then17 appointed the class in Lackey, and what they say, I take18 it, is well, that's not independent, he just thought19 that's what he's supposed to do.20 MS. PILLARD: Right, and -- and I very much21 disagree with that characterization of the record, and22 I'll try to help to make it clearer.23 First, as I pointed out, in their own briefs in24 the South Carolina Supreme Court, they characterized the25 Lackey arbitrator as having acted independently. There is411111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 no -- no record support for Green Tree's current2 assertions that the arbitrator did not make an independent3 decision. There is nothing in the record that supports4 it, and it is not the case.5 The arbitrator said that he determined that a6 class action should proceed based on his careful review of7 the broadly drafted arbitration clause prepared by Green8 Tree. That's --9 QUESTION: Is there any history, Ms. Pillard, of10 this in South Carolina, or is this the first time? Have11 there been class proceedings before arbitrators in the12 past?13 MS. PILLARD: I'm not aware that there are,14 Justice Ginsburg. I'm not aware of any reported decisions15 on that. There have been class arbitrations in -- in16 the -- one of the largest economies in the world for --17 for 20 years, and there have been a smattering of class18 arbitrations in other places, and I -- I --19 QUESTION: Ms. Pillard, when -- when a class20 action is instituted, it seems to me it amounts to an21 interpretation not just of -- of these contracts that were22 in front of this arbitrator, but also of the other23 contracts that have been brought into this arbitration,24 and what I find it difficult to see is how any25 interpretation of one of those other contracts would --421111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 would allow them to be brought into this from the2 standpoint not of this company -- this company at least3 selected this arbitrator for these cases, and you could4 say, well, they didn't select him for the other cases,5 which may be a good point, but let's talk about the6 customers, the plaintiffs.7 They didn't select this arbitrator for any case,8 not even -- not even for their own case. They have had9 foisted upon them not some Federal district judge who has,10 you know, the -- the army behind him, but -- but some11 arbitrator that, you know -- who knows who, that they --12 they never selected at all. How can you possibly draw13 them into this -- how can you possibly say that that14 contract is reasonably interpreted to allow them to be15 brought into this -- into this arbitration?16 MS. PILLARD: I have two answers to that,17 Justice Scalia. First, there's no question that if, under18 a contract that had a forum selection clause that said,19 any disputes under this contract will be resolved ina20 forum chosen by us with the consent of you, and a21 plaintiff chose a forum and filed a class action and22 offered opt-out rights to every absent class member who23 wanted to opt out, and those absent class members were24 bound by the same contract, their right to consent to the25 forum would be protected.431111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: But that's deceptive. They -- they2 are summoned in by the power of the Government, not by --3 not by their -- their contractual commitment to be4 summoned in. Even if there were no contract they could be5 made part of a class action, so to say that you can do it6 when the Government is coercing it, and therefore it's a7 perfectly reasonable interpretation of a contract, doesn't8 make sense to me.9 MS. PILLARD: I --10 QUESTION: Here, the only basis for getting --11 for getting these plaintiffs into this court, or into this12 arbitral court is their voluntary agreement, and their13 voluntary agreement gave them the right to select an14 arbitrator, and they have been deprived of that right15 entirely.16 MS. PILLARD: I agree with you, Justice Scalia,17 up to your last sentence. They have not been deprived of18 that right. It is exactly true that the authority of the19 arbitrator over the absent class members derives from20 contract, and every single absent class member was a -- a21 signatory to the -- to the same arbitration clause. They22 were all governed by the same clause, and once --23 QUESTION: But -- but Green Tree didn't appoint24 the arbitrator for that purpose. Green Tree appointed the25 arbitrator for X, Y, and Z.441111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MS. PILLARD: Green Tree wrote a clause that -- it swept everything within it. They said, we trust everything to the arbitrator. This clause is extremely broad. Once they did that -- they drafted a clause which the arbitrator and every South Carolina judge to look at it believed was susceptible of a reading that had authorized class action. In that case, you read this contract as if it had provided for class arbitration, and when they select --QUESTION: Wait, wait --QUESTION: Could the -- could the arbitrator have said, I'm -- I'm going to include in -- in this class some people who don't have an arbitration contract at all?MS. PILLARD: I would think not, no, and indeed, those people were excluded in this case.QUESTION: And -- and why is that?MS. PILLARD: Because they have -- QUESTION: Because the -- Green Tree did notconsent to that.MS. PILLARD: Because they have no -- thearbitrator has no authority over them, because neither they nor Green Tree consented to that, but by hypothesis, if you had a clause --QUESTION: The hypothesis is, the consent must be bilateral, and here it wasn't.451111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 MS. PILLARD: Oh, I disagree. The consent was2 bilateral. Green Tree chose an arbitrator, and when it3 chose an arbitrator for a case under a contract broad4 enough to authorize class action, legally it has chosen an5 arbitrator with the possibility that the class could6 proceed. Indeed, when they chose --7 QUESTION: All right, but what --8 MS. PILLARD: -- the arbitrator, the case had9 already been filed as a class action. It was -- they were10 on notice --11 QUESTION: Yes.12 MS. PILLARD: -- of the possibility that this13 issue would be litigated on a class basis.14 QUESTION: Well, they were on notice that15 somebody wanted a class action, but it seems to me,16 number 1, they were not on notice that South Carolina law17 would provide a -- a class arbitration because, as you18 said, it hadn't occurred before, and the only thing that19 they definitely consented to was an arbitrator for this20 case, and in a situation in which there was no existing21 State law that put them on notice that they were in22 jeopardy of this result, they're saying there are some23 things we -- I think they're saying there are some things24 we -- we agree that have to be filled in later about the25 terms of the arbitration.461111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 But with no history to indicate that the request2 for class -- or class treatment would be granted and would3 be possible under South Carolina law, we surely did not4 consent, we certainly did not take the risk that we5 consented, that we were consenting to arbitration for all6 of these other people, and if you doubt that, Mr. Phillips7 says, just step back and -- and bear this in mind.8 Without judicial review, would we have rolled the dice for9 $27 million on one arbitrator? What is -- what is your10 answer to that, that it, in effect, it is just too11 implausible to draw this conclusion out of the limited12 consent that they gave?13 MS. PILLARD: I have several answers to that,14 Justice Souter. First of all, this Court has never said15 that a case with a large amount of money at stake, indeed16 in Mitsubishi Motors with antitrust cases, in McMahon with17 RICOs -- RICO and securities cases, large amounts of money18 at stake, arbitration is permitted. They --19 QUESTION: Oh, no question about it. It's a20 question of what they plausibly consented to.21 MS. PILLARD: Right.22 QUESTION: That's the point of his argument.23 MS. PILLARD: Right. They were -- they were on24 notice. If they had good lawyers doing this, they would25 have a long time before 1998 put in the simple one phrase471111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 that they put into their contract as of 1998 which says,2 nobody who signs this can be a class member or a class3 representative.4 QUESTION: Well, if they had been in California5 they would have done that, but were -- were, you know,6 were they on notice that they had better guard against7 that jeopardy in South Carolina?8 MS. PILLARD: Yes. I think in -- in particular,9 the Episcopal Housing case put them on notice as of 197910 there were consolidations being permitted, and the courts11 who were looking at the class question, the Champ court --12 QUESTION: Consolidations aren't class actions.13 I mean, those are quite different.14 MS. PILLARD: I agree with you, Justice Scalia,15 but the fact of the matter is, the courts that have16 decided whether or not to authorize class arbitration in17 an appropriate case have looked as an analogy to the18 consolidation precedent, so you have a jurisdiction in19 which there is consolidation precedent, and parties, when20 they agree to contracts in ambiguous terms, agree to21 submit to the natural evolution of State law, and that22 is -- that does on occasion present risks. That does23 present risks, but they chose both to draft a clause very24 broadly and to submit everything to the arbitrator.25 QUESTION: Well, they're saying this isn't481111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 natural evolution, this is creationism, and --2 (Laughter.)3 QUESTION: -- don't -- don't they have a --4 don't they have a point that there is a distinction when5 the difference gets to be that great?6 MS. PILLARD: No, and I -- and I certainly don't7 think that is a preemption question for this Court. I8 certainly don't think so.9 QUESTION: No, no, but it says the terms have to10 be -- I mean, it doesn't -- it says in the statute you11 have to enforce the arbitration that they wrote, and12 here -- now, it is -- this point is bothering me, because13 I'm not sure what your answer to this was. I do see the14 phrase, shall be resolved by binding arbitration, by one15 arbitrator selected by us, with consent of you.16 Now, the opt-out can be, consent of you. I get17 that. If they don't opt out, they consent, but what about18 the phrase, by one arbitrator selected by us? We've come19 around, we've been talking about that nonstop, but I -- I20 don't have a clear answer to that, because what seems21 absolutely clear in the case of Justice Scalia and me, and22 he's never been in this courtroom, or in the arbitrator23 room or anywhere, you know, I didn't select that24 arbitrator. I selected you for a different case.25 Now -- now, how do we -- how do we square that491111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425with the words, an arbitrator selected by me, if I'm Green Tree?MS. PILLARD: Because -- two reasons. One is that this was filed as a class action, so when they selected the arbitrator they were on notice that at least the plaintiffs were trying to do this. The second --QUESTION: So if they said right at that point we don't want this as a class action, then they win?MS. PILLARD: No.QUESTION: No, okay.MS. PILLARD: The second answer is that thecontract was written in such a way as to be susceptible of permitting class arbitration, so when they select an arbitrator under this contract, they take into account, this could be an arbitrator that could award punitive damages. This could be an arbitrator that could proceed on a class basis. This could be an arbitrator who could order --QUESTION: All right, I see, but --MS. PILLARD: -- broad discovery.QUESTION: If they had had a --MS. PILLARD: This could be an arbitrator whocould do any of the things the contract permits. QUESTION: If they had had enough foresight,could they have told the arbitrator, we are selecting you,501111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 but for this suit only. You may not have a class action.2 We are not consenting. Could they have said that up3 front?4 MS. PILLARD: I don't think so. I don't think5 so, because the -- the language of the contract and the6 authority that they have given to arbitrators is7 determined from the contract language, not from the8 parties' choices at the threshold where a particular9 dispute has already arisen.10 QUESTION: I -- I notice the -- none -- none of11 your answers to these questions, including -- you had12 several answers for Justice Souter. None of your answers13 said, well, you know, that's a very interesting theory,14 Mr. Justice, but this is a State law matter, it's not for15 you. I -- I haven't heard that.16 MS. PILLARD: Well, I -- I intended to give --17 to give that answer when I said this is not a preemption18 question. It is not an FAA question. It is a State law19 question, and I think that's exactly right, Justice20 Kennedy, the narrow scope of FAA preemption focuses on21 whether State law is hostile to the arbitration forum, to22 the choice of arbitral forum to resolve ambiguities like23 these. There is --24 QUESTION: Suppose a -- suppose the State law25 said, not only do we interpret silence to mean you can511111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 have it in a class format, but that if any arbitration2 clause -- any arbitration contract excludes class action3 we will hold that against our public policy and4 unenforceable?5 MS. PILLARD: One would have to look at the6 reasoning of the State court in so holding. If the7 reasoning was hostility to arbitration, trying to trade it8 up--9 QUESTION: Well, the -- the Supreme Court would10 explain, we love arbitration, that's why we're not going11 to let anybody make it a smaller arbitration, so that's --12 so we're not being hostile to arbitration.13 MS. PILLARD: That is, as the South Carolina14 Supreme Court made clear, not the issue in this case. If15 it were an application of general contract principles of16 unconscionability in a particular case with no suspicion17 of arbitration as such, then I think a State could do that18 under State law.19 If the State had a general law that applied to20 litigation and arbitration against class action waivers,21 or against waivers of class actions in adhesive contracts22 that applied to both fora, to the litigation and to the23 arbitration, I think under that circumstance also it would24 not be hostile to arbitration for the State law to25 override the parties' choice --521111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: What's your authority that -- that it2 hastobe--you--youseemto--tobepositingsome3 kind of a -- of an intent requirement on the part of the4 State. It has to really have it in for arbitration.5 Why isn't the Federal Arbitration Act more6 reasonably interpreted as directed at those State laws7 that -- that are destructive of arbitration, that -- that8 are -- are hostile not in the sense of any -- of any9 mental intent, but that in their operation make it10 difficult for parties to enter into arbitration11 agreements, and if that's what it means, a law that12 interprets a -- an arbitration agreement fantastically,13 you know, down at the bottom of the coal mine, or, you14 know, you -- you have to pay so many million dollars win15 or lose, or, I think, you -- you have to subject yourself16 to -- to class actions, is a law that is hostile to17 arbitration, that is -- it is -- it is antagonistic to the18 ability of parties to decide between themselves how, when,19 and where and to what extent they will have an arbitrator20 decide matters for them?21 MS. PILLARD: Justice Scalia, parties have an22 ability to do that, and anyone who wants to put in a23 clause saying, no class arbitration, is invited to do24 that. This Court has never interpreted hostility to25 arbitration that broadly, as you just described. What531111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 this Court has said again and again is that the FAA2 preempts only State laws that single out arbitration3 provisions for suspect status that undercut the4 enforceability of arbitration agreements.5 Here, the arbitration agreement was enforced,6 and there is no FAA rule, contrary to Green Tree's7 contentions, that all arbitration agreements should be8 enforced according to their written terms without the9 benefit of State rules for resolving contract ambiguity.10 Rather, as the Court reiterated in Waffle House,11 absent some ambiguity in the agreement, it is the language12 of the contract that defines the scope of disputes subject13 to arbitration. This Court has repeatedly made clear that14 it is State contract law that applies, and it is State15 contract law that resolves any contract ambiguity.16 Green Tree is seeking a radical expansion of FAA17 preemption. Their rule would federalize countless18 disputes over the meaning of arbitration clauses. Parties19 to arbitration will come and say, we never intended to --20 to permit discovery, protective orders, various types of21 motions, types of damages and the like that would invite22 any party unhappy with the results of an arbitration,23 saying we're getting into more than we thought, this is24 hostile to arbitration as we prefer, to come to this Court25 and ask it to second-guess ordinary State law541111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 interpretation of an arbitration agreement.2 This Court should not expand the scope of FAA3 preemption in this case. There's no warrant for it here.4 QUESTION: May I ask this, if you have another5 moment: Does this case have any real future significance,6 because isn't it fairly clear that all the arbitration7 agreements in the future will prohibit class actions?8 MS. PILLARD: It's really very limited, Justice9 Stevens, I agree. This case deals with whether this10 particular agreement foreclosed class arbitration. Green11 Tree agrees that where an agreement authorizes it, class12 arbitration can be done, and so all they're asking you to13 do is to second-guess the State court's interpretation14 applying the rule of construction against the drafter, and15 I would very much dispute their characterization of what16 the South Carolina Supreme Court did of applying a -- a17 rule without any contractual or statutory directive to do18 so.19 The court was there quoting from a different20 case, and this case is a fortiori. Clearly, the court21 looked and said, there's no specific directive. As a22 preliminary matter, the court said, the contract is23 silent. Then they looked at the more general language the24 trial court had relied on and said, there's affirmative25 authorization here under the general language, and they551111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425looked at Green Tree's argument that the reference to this contract foreclosed it, and the South Carolina Supreme Court said, I find it ambiguous, and I'm going to apply the ordinary rule of --QUESTION: Is there a risk that if we just did what you said, they write in no class actions, a court says this is a contract of adhesion, and that provision's oppressive, and so we strike it?MS. PILLARD: It depends on why they think it's oppressive. If they think that waivers generally in contracts, pre-dispute agreements to waive the right to proceed as a class, whether the contract is an arbitration agreement or not are oppressive, then I think it might not be hostile to arbitration.If they say, a waiver of a class action in anarbitration setting is oppressive and unconstitutional, that might run afoul of this Court's precedence in -- in Casarotto.QUESTION: You really think that they could allow a waiver of judicial review and disallow a waiver of class actions? That would -- that would boggle my mind. And you think that wouldn't display hostility?MS. PILLARD: Thank you.QUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Pillard.Mr. Phillips, you have 4 minutes remaining.561111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS2 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER3 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.4 Justice Kennedy, in response to your question, I5 don't know precisely the first time that we raised this6 issue, but I know that if you look at the record on7 decision at pages 152 and again at 1539, in both Bazzle8 and in Lackey, we say point blank the arbitrator exceeded9 his authority to proceed as a class action, and that10 neither Green Tree nor any of the unnamed class members11 consented to have the arbitrator arbitrate their claims,12 so we said it as plainly as we could with respect to13 the -- with respect to the notion of consent.14 The specific -- aside from that, the South15 Carolina Supreme Court said we didn't waive our rights,16 and it's quite clear that if we fight over these issues in17 front of the arbitrator, we don't waive our rights. That18 was the holding of this Court in First Chicago.19 Justice Breyer, with respect to whether or not20 the arbitrator thought he exercised independent authority,21 I think it's pretty clear that both parties in this case22 have taken inconsistent positions. If you read the23 respondent's briefs below, they say that the arbitrator24 had no authority to go beyond the class certification of25 the decision that had already been made by the State571111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 court. Whether he did or not I say at the end of the day2 doesn't matter, because I don't think it's a question for3 the arbitrator, but if it is, he exceeded his authority,4 because he clearly doesn't have the authority under this5 contract to make a decision with respect to the third6 parties.7 That takes us to the question Justice Scalia8 raised, which is, you know, what -- what do you do with9 the fact that the South Carolina Supreme Court has said10 not word one about arbitrator selected by me? There's11 nothing that interprets that language of this agreement,12 and if the Federal Arbitration Act doesn't have at least13 some component here to say, look, the terms of the14 contract cannot be categorically ignored or disregarded by15 the State court, those are rights that are there. We said16 as plainly as we could we would not consent to this, and17 the court rejected it.18 And the final point I would make with respect to19 hostility, while it is true that this Court has20 consistently struck down efforts to be hostile to21 arbitration, it has never said that that's the only basis22 on which preemption will arise. Preemption in this23 context exists in the same way it does in every other24 context, does it interfere with the full achievement of25 Congress' objections. That's Hines v. Davidowitz, and the581111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425answer to that here, and it's the same answer that would arise if they were to -- if we had an agreement that said class action has, that of course this is manifest hostility to this arbitration agreement as written. It's a bilateral agreement, and all the South Carolina Supreme Court had to say about that bilateral agreement is, it would be judicially inefficient for us to have to go through each one of these individually.Well, that's all well and good, but that's coercion, that's not consent, and if the Federal Arbitration Act has any meaning, it means that you apply the consent of the parties here, and if you do that, the South Carolina Supreme Court has to be overturned.Thank you, Your Honors.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Phillips.The case is submitted.(Whereupon, at 11:09 a.m., the case in the above-entitled matter was submitted.)￼591111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005
