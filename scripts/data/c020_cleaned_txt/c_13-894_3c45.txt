Robert MacLean.      Mr. Gershengorn.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORNON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. GERSHENGORN: Mr. Chief Justice, and mayit please the Court:      In Section 114(r), Congress directed TSA topromulgate regulations prohibiting disclosures thatwould be detrimental to the security of transportation.The information covered in the TSA regulations rangesfrom a flight ­­ flight crew's plans for dealing with ahijacking attempt to vulnerabilities in airport securitysystems to the kind of de ­­ flight ­­ Federal airmarshal deployment information at issue in this case.      Under the Federal Circuit's construction ofthe whistleblower statutes, any one of TSA's 60,000employees may override TSA's expert judgment andpublicly disclose sensitive security information in thatemployee's possession based on that employee'sreasonable belief about what public safety requires.3￼1 MacLean told that this qualified an ­­ as SSI? Correct2 me if I'm wrong about this, but as I understood it, he3 was fired, and it wasn't until the case was before the4 MSPB that a determination was made that this information5 qualified as ­­ as what you call SSI.6 MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, I think that's7 not quite correct, and let me see if I can work it8 through.9 The information ­­ the information about10 Federal air marshal deployment has been prohibited by11 regulation for more than a decade. It was prohibited12 expressly prior to 9/11. It was in regulations that13 were promulgated by TSA after 9/11.14 JUSTICE GINSBERG: But when was he first15 told?16 MR. GERSHENGORN: He was told that air17 marshal deployment information was SSI in the training,18 and it's in the regs. He argued before the19 administrative judge that he was unaware that this20 information was SSI, and the administrative judge21 rejected that contention. That's at Petitioner's22 Appendix from 100a to 103a.23 What the administrative judge found was his24 testimony that he did not know this was SSI was25 inconsistent, nuanced, and evasive, and the judge4￼1 rejected that contention.2 What happens in the TSA final order, which I3 know Your Honor is referring to, is that TSA creates a4 final order determining something is SSI precisely so5 that it can be appealed to the court of appeals under 496 U.S.C. 46110, which gives a person aggrieved by a ­­ a7 TSA order 60 days to appeal something to the court of8 appeals.9 Mr. MacLean did so, and the ­­ the Ninth10 Circuit rejected his argument that this was retroactive11 classification of TS ­­ of SSI. So I think as the case12 comes to this Court, there really is no dispute that he13 understood that this was SSI.14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it ­­ it15 certainly is ­­ will, in many cases, be a close16 question. I was very surprised to see in your reply17 brief the recognition that the employee can ­­ just to18 quote it ­­ "can tell the media that Federal air19 marshals will be absent from important flights, but20 declining to specify which flights."21 I think it would be very difficult to figure22 out what's SSI and what's not if ­­ given that kind of23 fine line.24 MR. GERSHENGORN: So, Your Honor ­­25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:5And could he say,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425there will ­­ air marshals have been cut 50 percentfrom, you know, transcontinental flights?MR. GERSHENGORN: So, Your Honor, there may be close cases. Again, the administrative judge heard this contention from Mr. MacLean and rejected it. As the case ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Heard what contention?MR. GERSHENGORN: That he did not know that this was SSI, that the Federal air marshal deployment ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Well, what about my question? Could somebody say that the number of air marshals on transcontinental flights has been cut 50 percent?MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, I think that ­­ that without specifying ­­ I don't know the answer to that. I'm not someone at TSA who has classification ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So how was Mr. MacLean supposed to know?MR. GERSHENGORN: Because Mr. MacLean ­­ Mr. MacLean is ­­ was trained to know, was trained in SSI, received training on that ­­ on that. And as I say, Your Honor, there is no dispute that he did know that this was SSI. Details of Federal air marshal6￼￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425deployment ­­      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                                I'm a little confused.Like Justice Ginsburg, I thought from the briefing thatthat was done generally beforehand, that something wouldbe distributed to people with a confidential notice onit so that people would be ­­MR. GERSHENGORN: That would be marked SSI.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ that the ­­ that this was SSI. But this particular information wasn't so designated before the release.MR. GERSHENGORN: That's correct, Your Honor. But the ­­ the ­­ there's no doubt the best practice is, is to mark information SSI. But information is SSI ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You want it before it's going out.MR. GERSHENGORN: Correct. But SSI can ­­ information can be SSI, whether or not it is marked ­­ whether it ­­ or not it is marked that way. And, again, the regulations are ­­ are clear on this, that details of Federal air marshal deployment are covered as SSI, and this issue was litigated before the administrative judge. I think ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: If there were no regulations, just the statutes on the books, at that71 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425point, are there any prohibitions on disclosure?  Orthere can be no SSI without at least some regulation?MR. GERSHENGORN: That's correct, Your Honor.      But ­­ and so if I could turn to that, whatthe Federal Circuit held, the Federal Circuit held thatthe whistleblower protections extended to thisinformation.  But properly read, 2302(b)(8)(A) squarelyforecloses that result.  What that section does isexempt from whistleblower protection information that isspecifically ­­ disclosure of which is specificallyprohibited by law.  The Federal Circuit found nospecific prohibition here, indeed, no law at all.      But under the SSI regime, disclosure wasprohibited both by the statute that mandatednondisclosure regulations and by the nondisclosureregulations ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: No, it wasn't prohibited by the statute until there were regulations, right?MR. GERSHENGORN: That's correct, Your Honor. But there were regulations ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: So it is prohibited by regulations. Let's not play games.MR. GERSHENGORN: So, Your Honor, I don't ­­ I ­­ I think we would prevail even under that8￼14 is ­­ 1516171819202122232425￼1 interpretation because it's prohibited by regulations2 that the statute mandated to be disclosed. But I think3 under this Court's decisions in Robertson and in Sims,4 which addressed the question of specifically exempted5 from disclosure by statute, and this Court said that in6 Robertson, a regulation that gave to the administrator7 authority to ­­ to ex ­­ to dis ­­ exempt from8 disclosure after a public interest weighing, and in Sims9 where the Court had a statute that just gave to the CIA10 director an instruction to protect sources and methods,11 and the Court said in both cases that was specifically12 exempted by statute.13CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:Well, your reasoning      JUSTICE GINSBURG:      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:apparently came as a surprise to the government lawyerin the court of appeals.  He said, I'll be as clear as Ican.  Specifically prohibited by law here means statute.MR. GERSHENGORN: So, Your Honor, I ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Again, the MacLean is supposed to know something that the lawyer ­­ government lawyer and the court of appeals doesn't know.MR. GERSHENGORN: So, Your Honor, I think that that statement ­­ the lawyer did say that. But the9What ­­     ­­ would ­­ it￼1 lawyer went on to explain that regulations promulgated2 pursuant to a statutory mandate would control, and3 that's what the Federal Circuit understood.4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But now you think ­­ you5 seem to be arguing that it's not simply mandated by6 statute. You use the two FOIA examples that you gave7 was authorized or permitted. So what is your position8 today? Before the Federal Circuit, it seems to have9 been this is statute, not regulations. Now it's some10 regulations, but we don't know whether regulations that11 are mandated or regulations that are merely authorized.12 What is it?13 MR. GERSHENGORN: So let me be as clear as I14 can. We believe that it is specifically prohibited15 first by a statute, which was the argument that was made16 clearly below, and by ­­ and ­­ and in the briefs here17 and that this qualifies.18 Second, we think that it is prohibited by19 regulations that are prohibited pursuant to a statutory20 mandate ­­ that promulgated pursuant to a statutory21 mandate.22 And if I could point the Court's attention23 to page 15a.24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Excuse me, I must have25 misunderstood. I asked you whether or not the employee10books and no regulations yet,      MR. GERSHENGORN:SSI designated.      JUSTICE KENNEDY:      MR. GERSHENGORN:and I thought you said no.Because there would be noAll right.  So ­­But once there's ­­ sorry.So then ­­ so then the      JUSTICE KENNEDY:statute alone does not carry the day.￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425could be terminated if only the statute were on theMR. GERSHENGORN: So, Your Honor, I don't think that's the way the Court looked at it in Robertson and the way the Court looked at it in Sims, because in both of those cases, there had been no determination not to disclose until the administrator made the determination, and yet the Court found that those were specifically ­­ that they were specifically ­­ nondisclosure was specifically authorized by statute.      If I could just finish the answer to JusticeGinsburg and to the Chief.  At ­­ to the Chief Justice.      At page 15a in the Petitioner's Appendix,what the court ­­ the Federal Circuit said was,"Regulations promulgated pursuant to Congress's expressinstructions would qualify as specific legalprohibitions."Both arguments were ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, what was111 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that quoted from?      MR. GERSHENGORN:￼                              That was from the FederalCircuit's decision at 15a.  It's at 15a attached tothe ­­ to the petition.      So the Federal Circuit understood, justas ­­ as they said, that regulations promulgatedpursuant to Congress's express instructions wouldqualify as specific legal prohibition.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, would you qualify, assuming ­­ because Congress disagreed with Robertson and ­­ didn't it? And it then amended FOIA.MR. GERSHENGORN: Congress amended FOIA, yes, Your Honor.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Assume that we read statute more or less the way that FOIA does ­­MR. GERSHENGORN: Okay.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ the amended FOIA. Do you meet the amended FOIA criteria?      MR. GERSHENGORN:      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:prong of it and why?      MR. GERSHENGORN:all, I would just like to say that the Senatelegislative history expressly considered this veryquestion and said that if that ­­ that we ­­ I'm sorry.12We do, Your Honor.  All right.  And whichWe meet the ­­ first of1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      Can I step back one second, Your Honor?      We don't think that you need to meet thoseamended ­­ so ­­ the ­­ the amended FOIA.      But taking that as a given, Your Honor, whatthe Senate report said was ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:Yours is, I think, a￼      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:reasonable despite Robertson.      MR. GERSHENGORN:once this Court ­­      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:basically what you're arguing, is that ­­ one of the twoFOIA exceptions.  So tell me which one.MR. GERSHENGORN: So it's the FOIA exception, Your Honor, that ­­ that establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters withheld. And we think in the legislative history what the Senate report said was that the Sims statute, the Section 102(d)(3) of the National Security Act of 1947, would qualify and that's a statute that said, "The director of CIA shall be responsible for protecting intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure," period. That was all it said. That's no different from our statute and we think that even if this ­­ we think ­­13  It seems to be eminentlyIt seems ­­ Your Honor,I mean, but that's￼1 little bit more specific than that.2 MR. GERSHENGORN: Then perhaps more3 specific. So we think that ­­ that it follows a4 fortiori that if the Court relies on statute, that we5 meet that statute and, of course, that ­­ that makes6 perfect sense. If the Chief Justice were ­­7 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, my goodness. I'm not8 sure. I mean, when you have a CIA statute, they say you9 cannot disclose agents or sources and ­­ what does it10 say? Sources?11 MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, it says, "The12 director of" ­­13 JUSTICE BREYER: Sources and methods,14 intelligence sources and methods. And there's another15 one that refers to critical infrastructure information.16 All right. If I accept those as being sufficiently17 specific or having sufficient criteria, I look at yours.18 And yours says, "There shall be regulations prohibiting19 the disclosure of information obtained or developed in20 carrying out security" ­­ and now here's the21 criterion ­­ "if the under secretary decides disclosing22 information would be detrimental to the security of23 transportation."24 Now, that it seems to me could include25 everything from a spark plug that is deficient in the14￼1 airplane to a terrorist. And ­­ and I don't ­­ I mean I2 don't know how I would judge that. I mean, to the ear3 telling the CIA you can't disclose sources seems a lot4 narrower than telling the Department of Transportation5 or Homeland ­­ what is it, DOT ­­ that, everybody in6 charge of airplanes, you have a regulation, detrimental7 to the security of transportation. I don't know. How8 would you decide it? I mean, it sounds to me that9 that's quite a lot broader and so much can be10 detrimental to the security of an airplane.11 MR. GERSHENGORN: So, Your Honor, a couple12 of points on that. First of all, the ­­ the Court13 interpreted the statute in Robertson to be sufficiently14 specific. And in Robertson, what the Court ­­ what the15 statute said was, "An administrator shall order16 information withheld from public disclosure when, in the17 judgment of the administrator, the disclosure would18 adversely affect the interest of the person and is not19 required in the interest of the public." It's much less20 specific.21 JUSTICE BREYER:22 MR. GERSHENGORN:23 Court found sufficient.24 JUSTICE BREYER:25 did. But subsequent to that, Congress amended the Act,15Now, that's the one before. But that's the one thisThat may be what this Court￼1 as was just pointed out, in a way that says you have to2 have specific criteria.3 MR. GERSHENGORN: But if I may, Your Honor.4 It amended FOIA, but strikingly, the Court ­­ the5 Congress did not amend and include that language when it6 passed the CSRA. In fact, what Congress did ­­7 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. I'll look at that.8 I'll look at that. I'm not ­­ I can deal with that on9 my own. But I do have a question that only you can deal10 with. And the question I have that only you can deal11 with is this. I mean, obviously, it's a matter of12 concern that someone could go around and say there are13 no marshals on this airplane. That is obviously a14 matter of concern. So if in fact that was a real worry15 about blowing up airplanes for that reason, could the16 President then simply use the second prong and say an17 executive order will require that to be kept secret?18 MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, the President19 could do that.20 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, in doing21 that, in doing that, does it automatically fall into the22 400,000 regulations that govern Defense Department23 security information, or could he say, for the purpose24 of this statute, what we're talking about now, I25 determine that it should be kept secret. Therefore,161 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9there is no ­­ no prohibition against peoplecommunicating that information with Swedish people,British people, all kinds of airline officials, etcetera?  Now, you're saying yes, he could do that underthis second prong, yes or no?MR. GERSHENGORN: Yes, because there's an executive order ­­JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Okay. Fine. If that ­­ if he can do that, then there is no worry.MR. GERSHENGORN:MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor ­­Because if this ­­ am I      JUSTICE BREYER:right, there is no worry?￼1011121314151617 right. Why not?18 MR. GERSHENGORN: You're not right, Your19 Honor, because that is fundamentally inconsistent with20 the judgment that Congress made that the SSI system21 should coexist with the classified information and with22 executive orders. What Your Honor is saying is that it23 doesn't matter that the SSI system that Congress set up24 doesn't ­­ wouldn't work and can't function because the25 President by executive order could fill in the gaps.17      JUSTICE BREYER:is going to lead to blowing up airplanes, all he has todo is use that second prong.  Now, you say I'm not No, Your Honor.Because if, in fact, this￼1 But what Congress ­­2 JUSTICE BREYER:3 like that. I am worried about a practical matter. I am4 worried about the decision of the Court against you5 leading to somebody blowing up an airplane. And I6 suddenly thought, as a practical matter, that is not a7 serious worry because the President can always use the8 second prong to keep people from disclosing the9 information that you don't want disclosed. And so far,10 you've said I'm right and now you got into a legal11 argument. I'm not talking about a legal argument.12 MR. GERSHENGORN: So, Your Honor, I think13 such a system could be devised, but I think it would be14 a very odd construction of the statutes the Court has15 before it to ­­ to say that we are going to undermine16 and eviscerate the SSI system that Congress by17 statute ­­18 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I am just19 worried ­­ look. Let me ask my question. And my20 question is: If for other reasons I decided you were21 wrong, would I still have to face the problem of22 airplanes being blown up? I'm focusing on this because23 it's very important to me. And you have answered that24 question, if for other reasons ­­ and you, of course,25 think you're right ­­ but if for other reasons I thought18I'm not saying anything￼1 you were wrong, I wouldn't have to worry about that2 practical problem because there is prong two. And it's3 important to me that you answer yes or no and I take4 your answer to be yes, you are right as a practical5 matter.6 MR. GERSHENGORN: I think it is possible7 that the President could entirely duplicate the SSI8 system that Congress set up to help to prevent that9 practical problem.10 JUSTICE ALITO: To follow up on that, if the11 President proceeded along that path, what would be the12 consequences with respect to the people, the class of13 people who would be able to have access to this14 information? Would this ­­ this would be classified15 information and then only people with certain security16 clearances would be ­­ no?17 MR. GERSHENGORN: So the system could not18 work, Your Honor, if it was a classified information19 system.20 JUSTICE ALITO: No. I'm talking about21 Justice Breyer's alternative.22 MR. GERSHENGORN: So Justice Breyer's23 system, the answer is we would be in uncharted24 territory. I don't know as a fact that the President ­­25 the President would have to essentially duplicate the19￼1 SSI system. And it's precisely because it doesn't work2 under the classified information system that already3 exists, because this is information that is very4 sensitive, yet has to be shared among people who are5 operating our ­­ our transit system, so that flight6 attendants need to know ­­7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah. But what's so8 hard about duplicating the SSI system? He signs an9 executive order saying duplicate the SSI system and10 right away the problem we have here of people like11 Mr. MacLean revealing information is not a problem12 anymore because it is then protected by executive order.13 MR. GERSHENGORN: So, Your Honor, I ­­ I14 just ­­ I ­­ I think that that would work, but I have to15 say I'm not sure of the ins and outs. But I do think16 it's critical to say ­­17 JUSTICE SCALIA: It would have one good18 effect and that is, it would make sure that the matter19 is important enough to occupy the President's attention20 and is not so insignificant that an agency that just21 doesn't want any whistleblower, doesn't want any22 criticism of what it's doing, can pump out these23 regulations. It would have that ­­ that salutary24 effect, wouldn't it?25 MR. GERSHENGORN:20Your Honor, it might have5 information6 knowing, in7 regulations8 have today.9 When Congress created ­­ moved TSA into￼1 that effect, but I think that that's the judgment that2 Congress made. What Congress did was set up this SSI3 system, knowing that the President had authority under4 the executive order, knowing that the classifiedsystem was set.  And what Congress ­­ andfact, what these regulations said, the veryin ­­ in basically the same form that we10 the ­­ into DHS as part of the Homeland Security Act,11 these regulations were already there and Congress had12 them before it. And what Congress said was that SSI ­­13 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Gershengorn, if I could,14 before you get away from this, and I understand you have15 a statutory argument to make, but the way that the16 President would do this, if he wanted to do it, would be17 by a new executive order or, in fact, would this old18 Executive Order 13556, which deals with controlled19 unclassified information, is that what the President20 would use?21 MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, I'm not sure22 of the ins and outs of what the President would have to23 do. This is information that is shared outside of the24 government, which is what makes it a little tricky.25 These are ­­ they are shared with ­­ with flight21￼1 attendants. They're shared with local ­­2 JUSTICE KAGAN: Right. But I thought that3 that class ­­ that class of information, controlled4 unclassified information, as opposed to classified5 information, could be shared outside the government and6 Executive Order 13556 deals with that and the President7 could simply make clear that that executive order8 applies to this kind of information.9 MR. GERSHENGORN: So, Your Honor, I just10 don't know the answer to that, whether that order11 would ­­ would satisfy. My sense is that it would take12 a lot more than that to ­­ to duplicate the kinds of SSI13 system that has been in place for over a decade and a14 half and that Congress signed off on. But it ­­ it ­­15 and so the exact form of the executive order, it's not16 something that, quite frankly, I think we've17 contemplated here because there is this regime that18 Congress had set up.19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, about ­­ you20 talked about what Congress meant and set up. But the21 conference report says the language does not refer to22 agency rules and regulations. So, whatever staffers23 prepared that, and I'm not suggesting Congress did, but24 whatever staffers prepared that, again, MacLean had to25 know more than they did.22￼1 MR. GERSHENGORN:2 think that's right. And I think this is a situation ­­3 I'm going to make the initial point and then step back4 if I could and make a series of points on this.5 I think this is a situation in which the6 Court has ­­ would be right to view that legislative7 history with some skepticism and here's why. What8 Congress had before it was a bill that said, but from9 the Senate side, that said "prohibited by statute." Had10 Congress passed that, we wouldn't be here making our11 regulatory argument. What Congress adopted was a12 provision that says "specifically prohibited by law," a13 phrase that ­­14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. But elsewhere in the15 same legislation, it refers to "prohibited by law, rule16 or regulation."17 MR. GERSHENGORN: It does.18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Here, it just said "by19 law." Elsewhere in the same statute it says, "by law,20 rule, or regulation." What am ­­ what am I supposed to21 conclude from that?22 MR. GERSHENGORN: So I think what you need23 to conclude from that, Your Honor, is that the term "by24 law" has to exclude at least some rules and regulations,25 and we think that it does. It excludes those that are23So, Your Honor, I don't25 MR. GERSHENGORN:No, Your Honor.  The "law,￼1 internal agency regulations and regulations relating to2 agency organization, practice or procedures.3 JUSTICE SCALIA: How do I know that?4 MR. GERSHENGORN: Because that is the5 presumption that this Court set up in Chrysler. What6 Chrysler did was interpret the phrase "authorized by7 law," and what the Court said that "authorized by law"8 meant had a well­established meaning and that9 well­established meaning was that regulations that met10 the three­part test in Chrysler, that they were11 substantive regulations of a legislative type, that they12 were reasonably within the contemplation with Congress,13 and they were properly promulgated, were regulations14 that counted as by law.15 The Court expressly distinguished internal16 agency interpretive rules and agency rules of17 organization, order, and practice and said those were18 different. We think that is the distinction that is in19 the statute.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: If ­­ if that is true and21 if that is so obvious, Congress would not have ­­ have22 to have said "by law, rule, or regulation" in the other23 provision. It could just have said "by law" and what24 you said would automatically follow.24￼1 rule, or regulation" is the formulation that sweeps in2 agency internal rules and regulations and regulations3 promulgated pursuant to the housekeeping reg. That is4 precisely the distinction that the Court drew in5 Chrysler and it is precisely the distinction that we6 draw in the statute.7 When the statute says "by law, rule, or8 regulation," it includes all lawfully promulgated9 regulations, including interpretive rules, including10 agency's rules of procedure and practice. When the11 statute says "by law," what the Court ­­ what is meant12 and what Chrysler said had a well­established meaning13 that ­­ that would require a clear showing to overcome14 is that it includes statutes and it includes regulations15 that meet the Chrysler three­part test. So that is the16 precise distinction that this Court ­­ that this Court17 drew in Chrysler, and it is18 read it otherwise is to say19 JUSTICE KAGAN:20 Gershengorn, Chrysler was ­­ it just said "law." "Law"21 was not juxtaposed in the same sentence as another22 phrase that said "law, rule and regulation." So that23 would seem, that juxtaposition of the two very different24 terms, would seem to defeat the Chrysler presumption.25 MR. GERSHENGORN:So, Your Honor, the reason25embodied in the statute.  Tothat ­­But the place ­­ Mr.12 it enacted this thing or that13 in mind when he voted for it,14 believe.15 MR. GERSHENGORN:any member of Congress hadI ­­ I find that hard to￼1 I don't think it does is because it is equally2 consistent with precisely the distinction that Chrysler3 drew between regulation ­­ rules, regulations with the4 force and effect of law on the one hand and internal5 rules and reg ­­ and rules of agency ­­6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Boy, that is subtle. That7 is so subtle, that Congress is going to draw that8 distinction between substantive rules and procedural9 rules by saying "law" here and "law, rule, or10 regulation" there. You can spin out that argument, but11 the notion that this is what Congress had in mind whenSo, Your Honor, the reason 16 why I don't think you should find that hard to believe17 is the following. First of all, by going from "by18 statute" to "by law," right, Congress went from a19 narrow ­­ a narrow structure that would have plainly20 foreclosed regs and instead moved to a much broader21 formulation that this Court had given meaning in22 Chrysler.23 Second ­­24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: One ­­ there was one view25 that by going to "law" rather than "statute" what was261 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425meant was to include judicial decisions.MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, it does saythat in the ­­ in the legislative history, but that'sprecisely why I think this Court should view that withsome skepticism.  It's hard to believe that the term "bystatute" would not have included constructions ofstatutes that this Court made.  And so to justify themove from "by statute" to "by law" to say we sweep inthe Court's interpretation of statutes, I think, is alittle hard to swallow.If I could reserve the balance of my time.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Katyal.       ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL        ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      Congress enacted the Whistleblower Act torestrain, not to empower, agencies.  Now, my friend'sanswer at the start of his oral argument was the specterof 60,000 people who are going to leak this information.We're not in a Chevron situation in which the agency isgetting any sort of deference here.  And as JusticeBreyer's line of questioning, I think, points out, thatis a red herring, because Congress in (b)(8) of the27￼￼1   Whistleblower Act dealt with precisely that.  They gave2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011   to know.  How specific does ­­ are we going to get to a12   point where Congress has to look at every category of13   information every agency deals with and make a law14   prohibiting the disclosure of that individually?15 MR. KATYAL: Not at all, Your Honor. So16   with respect to the backup argument of the government,17   114(r), we have two different views ­­ two different18   arguments.  One is that 114(r) doesn't prohibit.  The19   other is that it's not specific.  And your hypothetical20   deals with the first and not the second.  So you've21   already ­­ the Congress is doing the prohibiting, unlike22   114(r), which, as Justice Kennedy pointed out, doesn't23 actually do anything. You need the regulation.24 With respect to specificity, I think25 Congress has two different options in (b)(8). One is to28a mechanism for the President ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Katyal, if thestatute read, "Disclosure of information detrimental totransportation safety is prohibited and the TSA shallpromulgate regulations to that effect," would that bepursuant to law under the statute?MR. KATYAL: I don't think so. I'll explain why in a moment.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And that’shat's what I want￼1 pass a specific law. The opposite of "specific" is2 "general," and I think the words "detrimental to3 transportation security" aren't specific enough. And if4 you need any illustration of that, just look to my5 friend's argument in the reply brief that the Chief6 Justice pointed out, where he said that ­­ that7 information ­­ that you could release information about8 how important flights weren't covered.9 The SSI regulations flatly call that SSI10 material ­­ this is 49 C.F.R. 1520.5(b)(1) and (2),11 quote: "Information concerning the deployments and12 operations of Federal air marshals are covered." That13 is SSI material. And so he can't even give you ­­14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you have any doubt15 that the ­­ that ­­ make the argument that the16 disclosure of this information didn't potentially harm17 transportation safety?18 MR. KATYAL: Certainly. That's19 Mr. MacLean's whole position, which is that he saved20 national security. This was a situation unfolding in21 real time in a 4­day period and he did everything he22 could from going to the Inspector General and to a23 supervisor in ­­ in a quick thing in order to save24 something that otherwise would have been detrimental to25 national security.29￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Now, my other point about the specificity ­­ JUSTICE SCALIA: And he was successful.

KATYAL:specificity is Congress has a whole other way of dealingwith it, as Justice Breyer pointed out, which is thecritical information, infrastructure regulation ­­regulations and the like.  Congress can enact anotwithstanding clause ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So are you saying that this statute is not specific enough for a FOIA request? If someone under FOIA had come in and asked for this information, they could have gotten it?MR. KATYAL: Your Honor, 114(r)'s first words are "notwithstanding FOIA," okay. And it only is notwithstanding FOIA. Congress is free to do precisely that with respect to the Whistleblower Act, either notwithstanding all laws or notwithstanding the Whistleblower Protection Act, and pass the most general30    They called off theExactly.  The other point   I'm sorry.  Go ahead.The other point about￼1 statute imaginable. It doesn't have to be specific.2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you want us to3 de­couple FOIA from this. It would be okay under FOIA4 for the agent to withhold this information?5 MR. KATYAL: That's exactly what Congress6 has said.7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because you think it's8 ­­ that you think it's ­­ that particular types of9 matter to be withheld. You agree with the government10 that that includes this kind of material.11 MR. KATYAL: It very well may satisfy FOIA,12 particularly because of the first clause, which is13 "notwithstanding FOIA." So you don't have to deal with14 this. But ­­ but here, the statute doesn't say anything15 like that and so for that reason it's not specific.16 JUSTICE BREYER: No. But the statute ­­ the17 statue other than the FOIA exemption 3 language doesn't18 talk about when a matter is kept secret by statute, as19 opposed to by regulation. So given that it's all tied20 in together, it's very tempting to say, I'll tell you21 when it's a statute rather than a regulation. And then22 you go and read the ­­ the exemption 3 and you say it's23 a statute when, 1, it leaves no discretion on the issue,24 or 2, it establishes particular criteria for25 withholding; or three, it refers to particular types of31￼1 matter. So we look at the statute to see if it does2 that. That's what I thought I was supposed to do, to3 decide whether it's the statute that's doing it or the4 regulation. And the one that gives me the most trouble5 on those three is the last one, because it does seem to6 refer to a particular type of matter, though in very7 general terms. But so what do you think of what I've8 just said?9 MR. KATYAL: Your Honor, we think the best10 way of understanding specific is to think about its11 opposite, which is general. And "detrimental to the12 security of transportation" is general. Yes, if it13 refers to a particular ­­ you know, it does refer to a14 particular matter. Well, any statute is going to refer15 to some sort of particular matter, but we think Congress16 had something deeper in mind. And, of course, the17 Freedom of Information Act ­­18 JUSTICE BREYER: I see that. I see that.19 You'd have to say critical infrastructure facilities are20 on one side of the line. This is on the other.21 Now, what about the analysis I just went22 through? What do you think of that? Is that the23 correct legal analysis, in your opinion?24 MR. KATYAL: Well, I think ­­ I think not.25 I think you can pick any definition of specificity. My32￼1 worry about adopting the FOIA one is, as Justice Scalia2 was pointing out to my friend,that this statute3 affirmatively distinguishes in (b)(8) between "law, rule4 and regulation" in the first clause and "law" in the5 second. And I think Congress is saying, unlike FOIA,6 that rules and regulations don't themselves do the7 prohibiting. It is only law. That is why the phrase is8 "specifically prohibited by law." There isn't anything9 like that in FOIA. And, indeed, FOIA has two purposes,10 as this Court in Robertson said, one of which is to11 empower agencies. It has nine different exemptions all12 about empowering agencies ­­13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the gravamen of your14 position is that after Congress enacted these statutes,15 anything that came within the WPA definition could be16 disclosed until Congress passed another statute? That's17 what you want us to hold?18 MR. KATYAL: No, no, not at all, Your Honor.19 I think that as long as it has a notwithstanding clause,20 as many things even before the Whistleblower Protection21 Act did have, or it has a specific prohibition about22 specific matters to be disclosed, unlike the general23 prohibition here, "detrimental to the security of24 transportation," that's enough. But there's also a more25 fundamental point ­­331 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      JUSTICE KENNEDY:examples of where, before the regulation, there would beinformation pertaining to airline flights that could notbe disclosed?MR. KATYAL: Well, I'm not sure about airline flights, but, for example, 10 U.S.C. 2640(h) says, quote, "The Secretary of Defense may, not withstanding any other provision of law, withhold from public disclosure safety­related information." And so that is a notwithstanding any other provision of law.JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that doesn't apply to this Respondent.MR. KATYAL: Well, I'm saying in general, Your Honor, Congress has available to it tools ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're saying that this Respondent, until there was a second statute, was not prohibited from disclosing anything within the broad reach of the WPA of "uncovered a violation of matters relating to specific danger to public health or safety."MR. KATYAL: That is correct, Your Honor. We are saying that ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: So Congress passed a statute saying: And we'll pass another statute sometime before this has any effect?MR. KATYAL: Your Honor, Congress in 114(r)34￼Where could I look to find￼1 was not dealing with the Whistleblower Protection Act.2 The language at the start is "Notwithstanding FOIA." We3 certainly think Congress could deal with it if they4 wanted to, but I think, as the members of Congress brief5 points out, they likely won't. Why? Because people6 like Mr. MacLean promote the national security. They7 don't harm it.8 JUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you about that?9 You say in your brief Mr. MacLean contacted a reporter10 with a history of responsible reporting about TSA who11 maintains close connections with Congress. Now, suppose12 that he instead contacted a reporter working for a13 foreign state­controlled news agency and the information14 was not quickly released to the public, so that the15 information was out there and could have been obtained,16 perhaps, by terrorists before Congress was aware of this17 and before the agency was aware of it and before it was18 able to take corrective action. Would there be any19 reason why that would not fall under the statute, as you20 understand it?21 MR. KATYAL: Justice Alito, I don't believe22 the Whistleblower Protection Act deals with that. Of23 course, Congress could, by circumscribing the Act in24 various ways. But here's what I think Congress did in25 (b)(8). They said not just can Congress pass a specific35￼1 exemption or a nonspecific one with a "notwithstanding"2 clause. They said the President, by executive order,3 can deal with precisely this problem and it doesn't4 require classification and it doesn't require somehow5 two systems that are going to ­­6 JUSTICE BREYER: In your view you don't even7 need the President. In your view, the President8 wouldn't get involved because you have to have a very9 specific statute. That's your view.10 MR. KATYAL: No, Your Honor.11 Justice Breyer, there are two different ways in (b)(8)12 for Congress to deal with the problem.13 JUSTICE BREYER: I know that. I'm just14 saying but you don't even get into it because it was in15 a regulation and not in a statute. And if it's not in a16 statute, then you don't even get into that.17 MR. KATYAL: Right. I'm dealing with the18 circumstance that Justice Alito's posited, in which you19 have 60,000 people who might leak to foreign media or20 something like that. And if the government believes21 that, they can solve that problem literally today by22 walking out of this courtroom, having an executive order23 that says SSI material, like the material here, air24 marshal information, is exempt from the Whisteblower25 Protection Act. Congress passed that clearly in (b)(8).36￼1 And as Justice Scalia says, that's the way to promote2 accountability. They didn't want unelected agencies ­­3 the fox to guard the hen house.4 JUSTICE ALITO: That may be. But I doubt that if5 Congress had thought about the situation that I posited,6 they would be content with the possibility of a7 disclosure that wasn't really a disclosure to the full8 public.9 MR. KATYAL: Well, I think, Justice Alito,10 Congress has dealt with this question about how to11 whistleblow, do you need an exhaustion requirement, and12 so on, and other things. And every single time ­­13 they've amended the Act four times. And every single14 time, they've said the problem is not too many15 whistleblowers, it's too few. Congress recognizes it's16 really hard for someone like Mr. MacLean, other17 whistleblowers, to go to the media because they put18 their job at risk, they get fired. And then they have19 to spend years litigating, as this litigant has, just to20 get his job back. And they do that only in the name of21 public interest. There's no private gain or anything22 like that.23 So, Justice Kennedy, of course Congress can24 prohibit the disclosure of this information in general.25 They have in 114(r). The question before the Court here37￼1 is have they done so with respect to the Whistleblower2 Protection Act? Have they done something specific3 enough to deal with the Whistleblower Protection Act?4 And the answer to that, we think, is no because ­­5 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm a little concerned6 about your acceptance of the hypothetical that the7 whistleblower doesn't blow the whistle to anybody except8 the Soviet Union. Do you really think that that's what9 the statute means when it says to take or fail to take10 or threaten to take personnel action with respect to any11 employee because of any disclosure of information which12 the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences13 a violation of law, rule or regulation, gross mis ­­14 don't you think it's implicit in that he's disclosing it15 to somebody who could remedy the problem as opposed to16 an enemy?17 MR. KATYAL: It may very well be precisely18 right. Our simple point here is that, whatever that19 standard is, that's a constant in this case. And if to20 the extent the Court is worried about it at all, I think21 Congress in (b)(8) provided mechanisms to deal with22 that, either a specific or nonspecific order or an23 executive order that doesn't require classification. It24 doesn't require mucking up at all the classification25 system.389 10 11MR. KATYAL: Justice Sotomayor, Congress has dealt with that, I think, at various points in the Whistleblower Act, asking the question, is this too12   loose a standard and so on.  Every single time they13   concluded not.  Why?  Because it is so hard for14   whistleblowers to come forward.  The former government15   officials' brief at page 34 gives you data on this.16   There have been 203 cases that have gone to the Federal17   Circuit, whistleblower cases, and they've won ­­18 whistleblowers have won a whopping three of them. There 19 have been 56 cases that have gone to the MSPB. Again, 20 whistleblowers have won three of them.21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which way does that 22 cut? It seems to me that cuts very much against you.23 In other words, whistleblowers are blowing the whistle 24 all the time without any justification. That's I25 thought the government's point, that this requires, puts39￼1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm troubled because, you know, the2   facts are very much in your favor here, because he3   disclosed it publicly, but under your scenario or under4   your position, if he published every day until the5   executive order came out the schedule of which flights6   air marshals will be on and he would come out and just7   say, I think we need more air marshals, that would be ­­8   that would not be a violation.  They couldn't fire him for that.￼1 all the eggs in the basket of whatever the whistleblower2 happens to think is a good disclosure.3 MR. KATYAL: I think not, Mr. Chief Justice.4 I think Congress each time has looked at this situation5 and has said every single time, we need more6 whistleblowers to come forward, because that's the human7 failsafe against a machine bureaucracy.8 JUSTICE BREYER: Congress ­­ I mean, I know9 people don't want to bring this up. But actually the10 staffs of congress do consider these problems. They11 write them down. They say what the answer is and the12 members are informed.13 Now, in this particular case, if you happen14 to read the conference reports, you get the answer. It15 says, what does it mean not specifically prohibited by16 law? And then in both the House report and the Senate17 report, it tells you, go back to what we passed two18 years ago, namely, the FOIA exemption, and that's what19 it means. And so that's why I got the thought that20 maybe that is what it means. And once you have that21 thought, you then see the country isn't going to fall22 apart because they wrote in the presidential exemption23 as well.24 So reading what the staffs actually wrote,25 perhaps I'm biased in that respect, believing that the40￼1 members of Congress do think about these problems2 through staff, we have the answer to this case leaving3 only open whether it is specific enough or not, and you4 make an argument that it's too general.5 Now, why shouldn't I follow that approach?6 MR. KATYAL: So I think generally, you7 should ­­ you should, Justice Breyer. That is, I think8 the conference report, and this is quoted in our brief9 at page 24, this is unlike almost any case I've seen10 before this Court in recent years in which the11 conference report so clearly gives you the answer to the12 question presented.13 JUSTICE BREYER: There are three reports.14 One is really for you, and that's the conference report.15 The Senate report is somewhat against you because it16 picks up the FOIA ­­ or the FOIA exemption, and says17 that's what this means, even though you don't want to do18 that and ­­19 MR. KATYAL: Your Honor ­­20 JUSTICE BREYER:21 them, the House report, too.22 MR. KATYAL: ­­ let ­­ let me address the23 Senate report and the FOIA stuff. We think even under24 the FOIA standard, we don't think this is a particular25 matter, that that itself is too general.41­­ I would read all of1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      But, Justice Breyer, there's two otherthings about that Senate report ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me.      Then you would say that under FOIA ­­ Imean, assuming I follow Justice Breyer's approach ­­ youwould be leading to the conclusion that thegovernment ­­ if a FOIA request is made, the governmenthas to disclose it because it doesn't ­­ because it'snot ­­ the ­­ the statute is not referring to aparticular type of matter to be withheld.  It's notparticular enough for you.MR. KATYAL: Well, I think that the language of 114(r) in the first notwithstanding clause is enough to basically just bracket FOIA.      With respect to the ­­ the Senate report ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just answer my question. You're saying the government couldn't withhold it under FOIA?MR. KATYAL: No, I think that they could under FOIA, which has a very different situation, which it's empowering agencies to try and make certain exemptions. The Whistleblower Protection Act, I think, should be read with the reverse view in mind.      Justice Breyer, the Senate report, theSenate language of the bill didn't even have the word42￼￼1 "specifically" in it. So I'd urge you not to look at2 the Senate report when reading the word "specifically."3 I agree there's some language where they talk about4 Robertson and the like, but actually, page 154 has the5 text of the Senate bill, and it doesn't even have6 "specific" in it. So that's why we would caution7 against using that as your template for deciding what8 "specific" is.9 JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Katyal, if you agree10 with the suggestion that this could be remedied by the11 President through an executive order, could I ­­ do you12 agree with that?13 MR. KATYAL: I do.14 JUSTICE ALITO: Now, could I ask you how15 that would ­­ how that would work out? Let's say ­­16 let's just take this example. Suppose the information17 in question concerns the ­­ the layout in a particular18 airport. There's an area that ­­ that some employee of19 the TSA thinks is not secure. So that's the20 information. Then the information comes out that21 there's this problem with that particular airport and22 the ­­ the TSA employee thinks that it's not being23 remedied, so this person wants to disclose it.24 Now, how would that ­­ this information has25 to be disclosed to a certain number of people associated43￼1 with that airport in order for the problem to be2 remedied. So how would that be dealt with in an3 executive order? The President has to issue an4 executive order about that specific thing and say, this5 can be disclosed to security people at the airport, the6 local police, maintenance people who are going to fix7 that. How would you deal ­­ how would that be dealt8 with?9 MR. KATYAL: Two different ways. One is10 through the classification regime. The other, as we've11 been talking about with Justice Breyer, is through the12 nonclassified SSI system. The President can pick up the13 SSI system, in general, under the B­8 exemption because14 it does deal with national defense and foreign affairs.15 There are parts of SSI which may not fall16 within it, but for the most part, things like this17 would. And so the President could designate that18 information subject to the exception to the19 Whistleblower Protection Act. I don't think he has to20 get into details about who it has to be shared with and21 who it doesn't, but he certainly could.22 With respect to the classification regime,23 he could also use the classified system to try and24 exempt this information as well. My friend on the other25 side says, oh, no, we can't share information with44￼1 uncleared people, foreign people and the like. As our2 brief at page 52 points out, the classification regime3 already is supple enough to provide that, as long as it4 is in the defense of the homeland, as your hypothetical5 would.6 And more to the point, this Court's decision7 in Eagan, which my friend cites, says that the8 classification regime is entirely a creature of the9 executive and can be modified at will. So if they10 really believe that you need to do this and share even11 classified information with uncleared parties, they can12 do that.13 But I think ­­ so we're not requiring some14 sort of specificity requirement, either in the executive15 order or in the congressional solution that is so every16 jot and tittle or anything like that. Now ­­17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Katyal, are there18 criminal penalties for violation of ­­ of this statute?19 MR. KATYAL: Not of SSI material, but there20 are of classified information.21 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Katyal, can we go back22 to your legal argument, and let me make sure I23 understand it. You're saying don't use the revised24 exemption 3 standard. 114(r) is narrower than that; is25 that right?451 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. KATYAL: That's correct.JUSTICE KAGAN: So that all of our exemption 3 cases essentially become irrelevant; is that right?MR. KATYAL: Correct.JUSTICE KAGAN: But the ­­ and you're doingthat based solely on the notwithstanding FOIA language; is that right?MR. KATYAL: Well, I am saying that. I wouldn't want to go too far. I don't think our argument depends on this. In other words, I think if you adopted the FOIA 3 standard, I still think that this language, which is detrimental to the security of transportation, is so capacious, heaven knows what it means.      I mean, Mr. MacLean, of course, thought whathe was doing was promotion of the national security ­­of transportation security, not detrimental to it.JUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, it's very general language, that's absolutely true. And if you were writing on a clean slate, you might say, gosh, that's very general language. But ­­ but we're not writing on a clean slate, and all our exemption 3 cases seem to suggest that very general language can meet the bar.      And so I'm just looking at ­­ there's thiscase GTE Sylvania, which was a statute that prohibiteddisclosure, if disclosure was not fair in the46￼￼1 circumstances and reasonably related to effectuating the2 purposes of the Consumer Product Safety Act. And we3 said that was enough, which it's like you look at that4 and you say, why is it enough? But that's what we said.5 MR. KATYAL: Right. But again, I think ­­ I6 think the FOIA context is very different than here7 because FOIA is something about empowering agencies to8 restrict disclosures. As this Court's decision in9 Robertson said, that that there was a preexisting10 legislative history about how they wanted to keep in11 place the 100 statutes or so that are anti­disclosure.12 The Whistleblower Act, I think, has the13 reverse idea in mind. We see this texturally, for14 those ­­ for those who ­­ who are focused on the text,15 because the statute distinguishes, in the first part,16 between law, rule, and regulation and law. And I think17 it's specifically prohibited by law. And what Congress18 is saying by that phrase in the context of this statute19 is, unlike FOIA, we're not about trying to empower20 agencies through general language.21 And I think this is the most natural way to22 understand what the statute says. I mean, I think23 when ­­ when ­­ when the word "specific" is used, I24 think the most helpful way of understanding what25 Congress had in mind is to think of its opposite471 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425general.  That there are two boxes, and detrimental tothe security of transportation sounds very much like,frankly, the TSA's mission statement and not anythingmore than that.JUSTICE KENNEDY: If ­­ if Congress wanted to reach your position and it had a choice of the words it would use in the second part of the statute, could it say "statute" instead of "law" and it would just come out the same way?MR. KATYAL: They certainly could use statute. The ­­ the ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: And ­­ and for purposes of this case and generally, there'd really be no difference?MR. KATYAL: Well, I think there may arguably be a difference. This is found in the conference report language. They said, we didn't use "statute" for a particular reason, which is because they wanted to sweep in not simply the statute and the U.S. code, but also judicial interpretation.JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, yeah, I'm sure that's what they all had in mind. I have no doubt of that.(Laughter.)MR. KATYAL: Well, Justice Scalia, let me answer because, first of all, it is what Congress said48￼￼1 in the conference report, which is, of course, what2 Congress votes on. And I understand many people don't3 like legislative history, but this is the apex of4 legislative history, as Chief Justice Rehnquist pointed5 out in the Simpson case ­­6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does ­­ does Congress vote7 on the conference report?8 MR. KATYAL: They do vote on the conference9 report.10 JUSTICE SCALIA:11 House? Each separate House?12 MR. KATYAL: I believe that the answer to13 that is yes. But I'd also say, the other thing about it14 is that I do think Congress actually ­­ what they were15 saying in the report made some sense because the16 language is specifically prohibited by law. And I think17 what Congress was trying to do was sweep in things like18 the Trade Secrets Act in which even if that language19 might look general to a lay observer, the words "trade20 secrets" have been fleshed out by courts over time.21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm a little22 ­­ maybe this doesn't make any sense, but you've been23 focusing on specifically as referring to the material24 that is covered. Can't it also refer to the ­­ the25 prohibition, specifically prohibited? In other words,49The whole ­­ the whole￼1 it actually has to say, "You cannot disclose this." You2 think it's specifying what "this" is. Couldn't it3 equally be well specifying how direct the ban must be,4 "specifically prohibited"?5 MR. KATYAL: Right. So this is the argument6 in the government's reply brief which comes up for the7 first time. It's never been advanced by anyone.8 There's no support for it in the ­­ in the legislative9 history or I think even, really, the text of the10 statute. I think "specifically" refers to "such11 disclosure." The phrase is "if such disclosure is not12 specifically prohibited by law," and so I think13 "specifically" is best read as referring to such14 disclosure.15 Justice Breyer, back to your question about16 the Senate report in 102(d)(3), which is what you were17 asking about earlier. It's real important ­­ I think18 it's important that I say that the Court ­­ excuse me,19 the Congress when they passed the Whistleblower Act20 rejected the idea that 102(d)(3) ­­21 JUSTICE BREYER: I think22 the report on the Whistleblower Act.23 MR. KATYAL: Exactly.24 JUSTICE BREYER: And the25 Whistleblower Act, which it came two50I'm talking aboutreport on theyears after FOIA,MR. KATYAL:JUSTICE SCALIA:MR. KATYAL:I don't believe they did.    No, they don't.￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the Senate committee said, "Those disclosures which arespecifically exempted from disclosure by a statute whichrequires that matters be withheld from the public insuch a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue orby a statute which establishes particular criteria forwithholding or refers to particular types of matters tobe withheld."  That is word for word.MR. KATYAL: Right. But ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Did the Senate vote on that, Mr. Katyal? Did the Senate vote on the Senate committee report?MR. KATYAL: They did not ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: And did the Senate committee vote on the Senate committee report?                         But, Justice Breyer, thatSenate bill that that language is interpreting doesn'teven have the word "specific" in it.  So that ­­ theactual bill the Senate is using is at page 154 of thatreport, it doesn't have it in it, and that's why I don'tthink it's the best guide for what "specific" means.      Now, there is language, as you say, about102(d)(3) saying 102(d)(3) would meet a specificprohibition.  In section 2306 of the actual51￼1 Whistleblower Act, which, Justice Scalia, Congress voted2 on exempts 102(d)(3). Congress didn't buy this argument3 that the Government has come up with right now that says4 that the Senate ­­ the Senate report means that5 102(d)(3) was a specific prohibition because they added6 this language "no provision of this chapter shall be7 construed to impair the authorities and responsibilities8 set forth in section 102." And so Congress itself9 didn't believe this notion that 102(d)(3) was specific.10 They wanted something ­­11 JUSTICE BREYER: You might be right about12 that, but what's bothering me is the more general13 question of driving an interpretive wedge between the14 FOIA exemption and the Whistleblower Act. I mean,15 that's going to get everybody good and mixed up, I16 think.17 MR. KATYAL: Your Honor, I don't think our18 answer depends on that. That is, I think that this19 doesn't meet the ­­20 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, but which in your21 opinion is the wiser way to go about it? I mean,22 assuming that this statute is not specific enough, which23 is the better way to go about it? To say the24 Whistleblower Act is special or to say interpret them25 both alike?52￼1 MR. KATYAL: I think either is equally2 plausible because FOIA and the Whistleblower Protection3 Act are two very different statutes. This Court has4 said in Robertson that FOIA has two goals, one of which5 is about empowering agencies. Here, nobody has said6 that. The text of the Act never refers to empowering7 agencies as Justice Scalia said. And Congress with8 respect to the Whistleblower Act is concerned about9 incentivizing them to come forward. That's what the10 Members of Congress brief says, as well as the Office of11 Special Counsel brief. There's no fear about chilling12 FOIA requests for heaven's sakes.13 JUSTICE KAGAN: But that suggests that we14 take, essentially, the same language and read it two15 different ways, just dependent on our sense of the16 purpose of the underlying statute. Is that right?17 MR. KATYAL: Well, I think that is available18 to the Court. But again, you can use the FOIA standard19 and there is no way ­­20 JUSTICE KAGAN: But I'm just asking if we ­­21 your decoupling argument is essentially based on the22 notion that these two statutes have very different23 purposes and, therefore, we can take those very24 different purposes and read the very, very similar25 language differently.531 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. KATYAL: Yes, Justice Kagan, for purposes of 114(r), which, of course, bothers to specify only FOIA by saying "notwithstanding FOIA" and then goes through the detrimental transportation security.Doesn't specify the Whistleblower Act. Congress can, of course, deal with this by having a more general notwithstanding clause.JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you were relying on text. I thought you were relying on the difference between law and law, rule, or regulation.­­MR. KATYAL:JUSTICE SCALIA:      MR.

KATYAL:Court isn't worried with anything else ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.      Mr. Gershengorn you have 4 minutes left.    REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN      ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERThank you.  Thank you.  If the54￼1 I'd like to make two principal points.2 First, the question here is whether ­­ the principal3 question I'd like the Court to decide is whether this4 disclosure was specifically prohibited by statute. We5 believe it is, and I think it's very interesting today6 ­­ Justice Kagan, you pointed out that the precedent7 seems to require that. Justice Breyer, you pointed out8 that the legislative history in the Senate report seems9 to require that result. Justice Alito and Justice10 Kennedy, you pointed out that the practical effects of11 Respondent's position would seem to be grave. Mr. Chief12 Justice, you pointed out and we completely agree that13 the term "specific" which is critical to their argument14 could just as easily, and we think properly, mean15 express, which is what it means here. And Justice16 Scalia, you asked about criminal penalties, but the17 statute itself does not provide criminal penalties just18 as Mr. Katyal said, but it does provide civil penalties.19 We think in that situation where you have20 the prior case law, the legislative history, the21 practical effects and the plain text that to say that a22 statute that mandates nondisclosure regulations does not23 specifically prohibit disclosure is just a very odd24 construction.25 The principal practical arguments we've55￼1 heard today are that we don't have to worry because2 Congress could have had an executive order to make it3 work. We continue to think there is no dispute that the4 SSI system doesn't work under Mr. Katyal's construction.5 The idea that what Congress expected was a duplicative6 executive order to mimic the SSI scheme seems very odd7 to us, and seems like a very odd way to construe8 congressional statutes.9 There was a concern here that there's this10 fox guarding the hen house. That may be a concern with11 the Whistleblower Protection Act, but it has no12 application here, where Congress itself mandated the13 nondisclosure regulations, and did so knowing precisely14 what those regulations were when it did so.15 And finally, there's been some suggestion16 that the facts are in Mr. MacLean's favor here. I would17 only say this. What Mr. MacLean ­­ what a TSA employee18 has before them is not a full picture of the threats, is19 not a full picture of the resource constraints, is not a20 full picture of the other means that the agency is21 taking and is not possessed with the same experience22 that TSA has.23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, I hate to24 interrupt you, but you worry me. I assume that if we25 find for your friend on the other side, the SSI56￼1 regulations are not null and void. They would still2 apply to everybody except whistleblowers. Isn't that3 right?4 MR. GERSHENGORN: Yes.5 JUSTICE SCALIA: It would still be a6 violation for anybody to make those disclosures unless7 he's doing it in a whistleblower capacity.8 MR. GERSHENGORN: It would be ­­ yes, Your9 Honor, but the standard in whistleblowing is do you10 reasonably believe that there is a specific and11 substantial danger to public safety? That is a judgment12 made on the information known ­­ reasonably known to the13 employee and readily ascertainable. It is not a14 judgment made with the full picture of the security15 consequences.16 I suggest to the Court, as a step back, that17 the right way to think about this case is that in a18 situation where the statute mandates nondisclosure ­­19 just as if the Chief Justice were to tell the marshal to20 bar me from the courtroom, that it would be perfectly21 reasonable to say that the Chief Justice had expressly22 prohibited, specifically prohibited, my presence in the23 courtroom, even if the marshal were the one standing at24 the door.25 JUSTICE GINSBURG:57Do you know how come that1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425is, Mr. Gershengorn?      MR. GERSHENGORN:Excuse me? How common it is to have      JUSTICE GINSBURG:regulations specifically mandated as opposed toauthorized or permitted.￼MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, we're not aware of very many statutes like the SSI statute, where Congress has expressly mandated regulations. There are things like the 102(d)(3) of the National Security Act, which generally says to the CIA director, protect sources and methods, and statutes like that.      There are, of course, a wide range ofnondisclosures, but we're focused principally on thenondisclosure provisions here.  We respectfully ask theCourt to hold that this is specifically prohibited bylaw and in particular by the SSI statute.JUSTICE BREYER: We would never bar you from the courtroom.      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:about you.  Thank you, counsel.      The case is submitted.He wasn't talking      (Whereupon, at 11:05 a.m., the case in theabove­entitled matter was submitted.)58Page 59￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Aable 19:13
