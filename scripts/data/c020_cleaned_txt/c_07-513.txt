KARLAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice - Subject to Final Review1234   first today in Case 07-513 , Herring v.  United States.P ROCEEDINGSCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argumentand may it please the Court:            In February 2004, the Dale County circuit10111213   Petitioner's arrest.  Having received that notice,14   someone in the sheriff's department physically removed15   the warrant from the file and physically took the16   warrant back to the court clerk's office.  But no one17   either then or later in the sheriff's department ever18   updated the computer file to indicate that the record19   had -- that the warrant had been recalled.  As a result20   of that police department error, the Petitioner in this21   case was subject to a warrantless arrest for which there22   was no probable cause five months later.23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Didn't they have24   some regular system for updating the computer base?  I25   mean, I assume it was updated at some point.3clerk told the local sheriff's department that the courtwas recalling a warrant that had been issued earlier for(10:03 a.m.)￼ - Subject to Final Review1234   which is to conduct periodic audits.  Had they conducted5   one, they would have discovered almost instantly what            MS. KARLAN:  No.  Your Honor.  There wasno -- there's nothing in the record to suggest that thisdepartment ever does, for example, what the FBI does,6   they discovered five months later, which was there was7   no warrant in this case.  So this --89 10 11 12 13 14            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So people who are,you know, the warrant is served, they're arrested, theygo to trial, they're in jail, their name still shows upas having a warrant out for their arrest.            MS. KARLAN:  We don't know, Mr. ChiefJustice, because this is a department that as far as therecord reflects conducts no audits of any kind to update15   its files.  And if you look at page 41 and page 60 of16   the joint appendix, one of the things you'll discover17   about this department is that everyone in the department18   has access to the physical place warrants are kept.19   They're kept in several different places in the office.20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well then, how did21   this warrant clerk, I guess is what I'd call her,22   discover the error?  She discovered it within 10 or 1523 24 25minutes, right.            MS. KARLAN:  She discovered it because whathappened is a clerk in another police department called4￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   and said, is there a warrant for Petitioner's arrest. 2   She looked at the computer list on her computer and said 3   yes.  Then this other warrant clerk said, please fax us 4   a physical copy of the warrant.  So she went to the file 5   where the warrant should have been.  It wasn't there. 6   She went to another file.  The warrant wasn't there. 7   She then called the court clerk's office and discovered 8   that they had recalled the warrant which was back in 9   their records five months earlier.10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why did the first --11   first person in that scenario need a physical copy of12   the warrant?13               MS. KARLAN:  The record doesn't reflect14   that, but she simply I guess wanted to verify that there15   actually was a warrant because they were picking16   Petitioner up in a different county.17               JUSTICE ALITO:  Does your argument depend on18   the quality of the recordkeeping in this particular19   department?  I thought your argument would apply even if20   this department had excellent recordkeeping procedures21   but nevertheless made a mistake in this instance.22               MS. KARLAN:  That's correct, Justice Alito.23   Our view is, just as is true with respect to probable24   cause, the fact that 99 percent of a department's25   arrests are with probable cause doesn't mean that when5￼ - Subject to Final Review1234567   Arizona v.  Evans.  And if I could give an answer to the8   question the Chief Justice was asking earlier that comes9   from Arizona v. Evans, what happened in Arizona v. Evansthey arrest someone without probable cause you say,well, you get one bite at the apple or a sort of "goodenough for government work" theory.            JUSTICE ALITO:  You're not asking forArizona v. Evans to be overruled are you.MS. KARLAN:  No.  We're asking to you apply10   -- and Justice Stevens mentions this in his dissent11   there -- is the clerk discovered there, the court clerk12   discovered, that the warrant that had been, that she had13   verified, had in fact been recalled.  And so what they14   instantly did is they checked their files, and they15   discovered four other warrants from that same day that16   had been recalled but that were still in their files.17               Here we didn't have anything done after they18   discovered the error.  They discovered this error and,19   as they say, have gone on their merry way.  There's20   nothing in this record --21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, there was22   something done in this particular case, though, right?23   The warrant clerk notified -- was it the Coffee County24   people?25               MS. KARLAN:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.6￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- that the warrant-- that the information she had given 10 minutes beforewas inaccurate.            MS. KARLAN:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.  Andthat indicates part of what we're concerned about here,which is this is a department that was built for speed,not for accuracy.            JUSTICE ALITO:  But none of that matters foryour argument, does it? - Subject to Final Review1011121314   employees.15               MS. KARLAN:  That's correct.  We think16   that's the most workable argument, because what we want17   is a system in which suppression hearings can be18   conducted expeditiously based on the facts of particular19   cases.20               JUSTICE ALITO:  How expeditious would it be21   -- suppose there's negligence on the part of both a22   court employee and a police department employee.  What23   is the judge supposed to do in deciding the suppression24   motion?  Is this a comparative negligence determination.25               MS. KARLAN:  I don't think it would be7MS. KARLAN:  Oh, no.            JUSTICE ALITO:  You want to make it -- youwant to draw a clear line between errors by -- byclerical court employees versus errors by police￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   exactly a comparative negligence determination.  I think 2   it -- that raises a difficult question and the way I 3   would approach that question is to perhaps use some of 4   what Justice Kennedy talked about in Hudson as a 5   causation approach.  That is, if but for the negligence 6   of the police department there would have been -- 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought negligence is 8   irrelevant here.  I think if the police department was 9   wrong, even if they had been very careful but for some10   reason or other they made a mistake -- so you're arguing11   for shear causality, not for negligence.  If negligence12   made the difference then we'd have to go into these13   factors that you say are very difficult to calculate.14               MS. KARLAN:  Well, Justice Scalia, I was15   answering Justice Alito's question and if I could just16   give a little bit of --17               JUSTICE SCALIA:  I know you were answering18   his question, but you want to answer it in a way that's19   consistent with your argument here.20               MS. KARLAN:  Well, it is, Justice Scalia.21   So let me explain why it's consistent, which is our22   position is if police department error causes an23   unconstitutional arrest then you should suppress24   evidence, but if both the police were negligent and the25   clerk was negligence and the police department's8￼ - Subject to Final Review1   negligence.2               JUSTICE SCALIA:  You've injected the word3   "negligence."4               MS. KARLAN:  Okay, let me take the word5   "negligence" out then.  If the police error didn't cause6   the discovery of the evidence --7 8 910   causality.11               MS. KARLAN:  Yes.12               JUSTICE SCALIA:  It isn't a matter of simple13   negligence.14               MS. KARLAN:  No, that's correct.  That's15   correct.1617   keep --1819   to determine whether there's error without determining20   whether there's negligence?  Suppose the court clerk21   calls up the police department and says the warrant is22   still outstanding, and in fact it's not.  And it sends23   them over a physical copy of a warrant, but that warrant24   has been withdrawn.  Now, the police could always take25   additional steps:  They could send someone over to check9JUSTICE SCALIA:  Alone, but --MS. KARLAN:  -- that's correct.JUSTICE SCALIA:    -- there is dualCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How is it going toJUSTICE ALITO:  How are -- how are you going￼89 10            JUSTICE ALITO:  --  what their duty was.How are you going to determine where this error shouldbe -- should be assigned? - Subject to Final Review1   the records, to look at the court docket to make sure2   that the warrant had not been withdrawn.  So there would3456 there. 7be causality, but it would not determine what theyshould --                 MS. KARLAN:  There would be no police error                 MS. KARLAN:  Because in that case there11   would be no police error.  What this Court held in Evans12   is that police departments are entitled to rely on the13   representations of court clerks that there are warrants.14   So if the court clerk erroneously sends a warrant over,15   the police are not required to look behind that warrant,16   just as they're not required in Evans.17               JUSTICE ALITO:  Let me give you another18   example.  Suppose that the court clerk calls up and says19   -- it leaves a message, gives a message to somebody in20   the police department.  And they memorialize that, and21   they say "called up."  And let's say the warrant number22   is the same as the docket number of this case.  So the23   court employee says -- writes down "Called up," says,24   "Warrant quashed in warrant, in case 07-513."  The court25   -- the police department has a record of the call, and10￼ - Subject to Final Review1   they say, "Received call from court clerk.  Warrant to2   be quashed.  Warrant quashed in case 07-531."  And so3   the 513 is not quashed; the person is arrested.  Now,4   who caused that?  You have to have a hearing?5               MS. KARLAN:  The police -- the police6   department person caused that by writing down the wrong7   number.89            JUSTICE ALITO:  How do you know that thepolice department wrote down the wrong number?MS. KARLAN:  Well, it's the same question asJUSTICE ALITO:  How do you know what numberMS. KARLAN:  Well, it's the same question as1011   --12131415   in Evans:  How do we know who made the mistake?  That16   question, just like the question -- is a question on17   which you're going to have to hold a hearing because18   Evans says if it was court error, there is no19   suppression; and our position is, if it was police20   error, there is.  But that's a very manageable hearing.21               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Just so I have your theory22   firmly in mind, you would say there is police error even23   if what happened was that there was an unpredictable and24   unavoidable computer glitch, no negligence on anybody's25   part?  The computer simply malfunctioned, got it wrong.11was --￼16171819202122232425            JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, either of thosethings are negligence or worse.            MS. KARLAN:  Yes.            JUSTICE BREYER:  So what I didn't understandis why you would charge the police with anything orsuppress a warrant where there was a mistake but no onewas negligent or worse.            MS. KARLAN:  Well, we have had somedifficulty finding any reported cases in which there isa police error of the kind of computer glitch that was12 - Subject to Final Review1   It wasn't negligence.  You would still say that that is 2 3 4 5 6 7   negligence?  Why do you need to argue that and why do 8   you argue that?  I mean doesn't there have to be at 9   least negligence on somebody's part?10               MS. KARLAN:  Well, here's the problem:11   There are two kinds of negligence you might have; that12   is, you might have the negligence of an individual13   employee, or what you might have is a decision to use a14   shoddy recordkeeping system that doesn't catch those15   errors.  So the question is --police error, and you would say that that counts againstthe admission of --            MS. KARLAN:  That's correct.  As long asit's police error, it counts against the police.            JUSTICE BREYER:  Why, if there is no￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   just hypothesized.  That is where the machines -- 2               JUSTICE BREYER:  But what you argued for -- 3               MS. KARLAN:  Yes.  What -- 4               JUSTICE BREYER:  -- you said, it should be 5   suppressed even if no one is negligent or worse.  And I 6   have trouble seeing why you're suppressing a warrant 7   where no one does anything wrong at all. 8               MS. KARLAN:  Well, part of what I'm trying 9   to get at in my answer to your question is it's unclear10   in that situation whether anyone has done something11   wrong; that is, whether somebody in the police12   department programmed the police department computer --13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Let's just assume the14   hypothetical -- the hypothetical:  The computer15   malfunctions.16               MS. KARLAN:  Well, you could have an act of17   God exception to exclusionary rule, if you wanted to,18   but this case doesn't ask you to do that.19               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm sure a computer might20   be compared to God, but let's --212223 --24               MS. KARLAN:  It's more powerful sometimes.25               JUSTICE STEVENS:  Could I ask this question?13(Laughter.)JUSTICE STEVENS:  Could I ask this question￼4 5 6 7 8 9violated the Fourth Amendment.            MS. KARLAN:  There is no question that as amatter of fact --            JUSTICE STEVENS:  The question is whether itcan be justified.            MS. KARLAN:  Yes.  This was a warrantless - Subject to Final Review1   You're saying that the question is whether anybody did2   anything wrong at all.  This is not undisputed, that3   this person was illegally arrested?  The arrest itself10   arrest without probable cause.  And the question is:11   Does the government have some sort of affirmative12   defense as to why it should be allowed to use this?13   Now, in Evans --14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's a separate15   question.  It may be an illegal arrest, but the question16   is the separate one of whether or not you exclude the17   evidence collected incident to that arrest.  And we18   have, in several cases, separated the two questions, and19   I guess it's difficult for me to see if no one has done20   anything wrong, no one, why you would suppress the21   evidence in that case.22               MS. KARLAN:  Well, that case of course is23   not this case, and you might want to leave open the24   question of the --25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, but you have14￼ - Subject to Final Review1   this difficulty:  Do we have to get into negligence, or2345678   do you know?  That's the problem.9               MS. KARLAN:  Well, we do know that someoneshould we assume, as I understand to be your theory, asJustice Breyer put it, that you would still suppress theevidence when no one has done anything wrong?            MS. KARLAN:  We are asking in this case foryou to suppress when someone has done something wrong.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But how do you know?  How10   did something wrong here, because we know --11121314   question.15JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But we want an answer --MS. KARLAN:  No, I'm trying to answer --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  We want an answer to theMS. KARLAN:  No, I'm trying --1617181920212223   question, and the point I wanted to make is:  This case24   asks for a narrow rule, but the question that you may25   also want to be thinking about here is how to have a15            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Let's assume no one didanything wrong.            MS. KARLAN:  I know.  I'm trying to answerthat question.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- because this bears onthe fact of why are we doing this at all.MS. KARLAN:  No.  I'm trying to answer that￼ - Subject to Final Review1   workable suppression hearing.  And if you require2   showings of different levels of fault, rather than3   asking was this police-generated error, the suppression4   hearings are going to be somewhat more cumbersome.  So5   you have a choice.6               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Exactly.  You give7   something, you get something.  If you adopt a negligence8 910111213141516theory, the --            MS. KARLAN:  We would be happen with thenegligence theory.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- the noose is not aswide, but on the other hand it's a lot harder tocalculate whether you -- every case involves an inquiryinto whether there's police negligence or not.            MS. KARLAN:  That's exactly what I'm --                 JUSTICE SCALIA:  A much easier rule, was17   there a warrant or not?  If there wasn't, end of the --181920212223   the underlying law is here.  I mean -- I guess it's24   little weird, but what happens if the policeman arrests25   the wrong person, but it's nobody's fault?  You know,16end of the inquiry.            MS. KARLAN:  Well, that's exactly why I --why I said I think the easier rule for judges faced withsuppression hearings is a rule that says --JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, I don't know what￼6789   things then?  I wouldn't think so --happened in history --            MS. KARLAN:  Sure. - Subject to Final Review1234   John and it's really Joe.  And so, the policeman wasn't5   at fault.  They arrest the wrong person.  I guess that'sthe person was pretending to be his brother.            MS. KARLAN:  Well, that's like --JUSTICE BREYER:  Or the mother said it'sJUSTICE BREYER:  -- but do they suppress10               MS. KARLAN:  Well, there are two different11   --12               JUSTICE BREYER:  -- but maybe they do.13               MS. KARLAN:  There are two different kinds14   of cases where police arrest people:  One set of cases15   where the policeman is arresting on the basis of16   probable cause, and there, there's a lot of room for17   error that is based on the facts.  The mother told him18   it was Joe when it was really John.  That's good enough,19   good enough, because that's probable cause.20               JUSTICE BREYER:  But do we suppress?21               MS. KARLAN:  No, you do not --22               JUSTICE BREYER:  We do not?  Okay.23               MS. KARLAN:  There was not even a Fourth --24               JUSTICE BREYER:  So there's no reason then,25   if we don't suppress when there's no error in the part17￼ - Subject to Final Review1   of the policeman, none, it was just a weird2   circumstance, then I don't understand why we would3   suppress here.  And nor do I understand why you have to4   argue this because I thought it's clear here that there5   is error, and it was negligently caused.  There were6   four months that went by without anybody doing anything7   about this mistake.8               MS. KARLAN:  No.  That's correct.  If I can9   just say one thing that will make this perhaps a little10   clearer, Justice Breyer, you would not even find a11   Fourth Amendment violation in the first place in the12   hypothetical you gave because there was probable cause13 to arrest.1415   here?161718   warrant; he had probable cause to arrest.19               MS. KARLAN:  There is no such thing as20   probable cause to believe there's a warrant.  You21   yourself in Hudson said it's a bright-line rule.  Either22   there's a warrant or there isn't.  Here there was no23   warrant.24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's just25   rephrasing it.  It's probable cause based on the18JUSTICE SCALIA:  Isn't there probable causeMS. KARLAN:  Probable cause to do what?JUSTICE SCALIA:  He thought he had a￼9 10 11 12 13            MS. KARLAN:  Well, because here --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  If the policeman ismistaken about whether he saw this guy pickingsomebody's pocket, he's mistaken about that, and in that - Subject to Final Review1   existence of a warrant, and it turns out to be there is2   a mistake in the warrant.3               MS. KARLAN:  This Court has never said that4   before, which is it's not probable cause to believe5   there's a crime because there's a warrant.  It's --6   you've always separated those two lines of cases for --7               JUSTICE SCALIA:  It doesn't seem to make8   sense, though.  Why should we separate the two?     case, the search is -- the product of the search is14   admitted.  In the other case he's mistaken about whether15   there was a warrant.  Why do you want to draw a line16   between those two?17               MS. KARLAN:  Well, for two reasons:  One is,18   even in the probable cause case, if the reason he19   thought there was probable cause is another officer told20   him there was probable cause and that officer was wrong,21   this Court said in Leon you continue to suppress.  Here,22   this police officer was told by other police personnel23   that there was a warrant, and there wasn't.  So it's a24   case just like the cases post-Leon -- you suppress when25   the chain of information is fatally flawed by police19￼ 910111213141516in command, you would impose that burden.            MS. KARLAN:  No, I would not, Mr. ChiefJustice, because if you announce that police error isgoing to lead to the suppression of evidence, the policewill do a better job of maintaining their records.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, but I mean Idon't know what the situation is like --            MS. KARLAN:  And then you won't have this - Subject to Final Review1   error, which is what happened here.2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, you would impose3   a burden on the officer on the street serving a warrant?4   When he gets the call saying there's a warrant, he's5   supposed to say, "Are you sure?  Did you double-check6   with the clerk?  When was the last time they updated the7   computer system?  I don't want to go through all this if8   the evidence is going to be suppressed."  At every chain17   problem.18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't know what19   the situation is like in Dale County.  They probably20   don't have the latest version of WordPerfect, or21   whatever it is.  They are probably making do with22   whatever they can under their budget and doing the best23 they can.24               MS. KARLAN:  But there's not a Barney Fife25   defense to the violation of the Fourth Amendment either.20￼ - Subject to Final Review1   If a department is having its records kept the way they2   are keeping them here, then suppression is the only3   thing that tells them:  You're going to have to --4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you said this5   wasn't anything in the record about what type of program6   they might have, whether they were updated.  They found7 8 9the mistake in ten minutes.            MS. KARLAN:  Which suggests if they had beendoing a good job of maintaining their records all along,this violation never would have occurred.1011121314   department?  Suppose the person who makes the mistake in15   the police department is a -- a person who holds a            JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what's thejustification for drawing a distinction between a courtemployee and everybody who works for the police16   unionized position where advancement is based purely on17   seniority, or it's a civil service position where the18   person is -- is totally protected from any sort of19   adverse job consequences as a result of displeasure20   about or pleasure about how the job is being -- being21   performed.22               And what's the justification for drawing a23   distinction between errors committed by those two24   employees just based on where they fit in the25   organizational box?21￼11121314151617181920   tasks.2122 23 24 25            The second is on the record in this case.We don't know whether it was a sworn officer who removedthe warrant from the file or it was a clerk, and there'sno way of finding that out now.            A third reason, if I could just point to22 - Subject to Final Review1               MS. KARLAN:  Well, three things:  One is the2   police themselves are often unionized and protected from3   retaliation.4 Second --5               JUSTICE ALITO:  What if it's not a police6   officer; it is not a law enforcement officer?  It is a7 8 9clerical employee, or it's a computer guy.            MS. KARLAN:  Well, I think that the clearest     line is inside the police and outside, and let me give10   you a couple of reasons why.  The first reason --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, one is that you --you are stuck with the Arizona v. Evans, which says ifit's the court --            MS. KARLAN:  Well, if it's the court, yes;but I -- I was going to give some reasons why the policedepartment should be treated as an integrated whole.            One reason why is in many departmentsofficers, sworn officers, who are on desk duty forphysical disabilities and the like, perform clerical￼ - Subject to Final Review1 this -- 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure. 3               MS. KARLAN:  -- this Court, for just a 4   moment, is clerical personnel, support personnel -- 5   there is a reason they are called "support personnel". 6   They support the mission of the office, and here this 7   office decided to maintain its records in a particular 8   way and to have this quick reference file and the like, 9   presumably to support --10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But the Coffee11   County people aren't called "support officers" for the12   Dale County police.13               MS. KARLAN:  They are support for the14   police, and this Court has --15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Now you keep saying16   this when you did this in your brief.  You just call17   everybody "police," "police," "police," when the18   question is whether there's a distinction between the19   Coffee County police and the Dale County police for20   purposes of applying the exclusionary rule.21               MS. KARLAN:  This Court, at least since22   Elkins, has recognized that police departments often23   operate across the board.  If I could point to Leon24   itself, in Leon the search was conducted by California25   municipal police, and the evidence was used in Federal23￼ - Subject to Final Review1 court.2               And this Court never suggested, not even for3   a minute, that the fact that the evidence was obtained4   by State-level -- local-level police and used in a5   Federal prosecution was relevant to the question whether6   or not it should be suppressed.  Because what the Court7 8 9is trying to do in the exclusionary rule, as Iunderstand it, is to deter future violations.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's crucial to your case            MS. KARLAN:  Yes.10 -- 111213            JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- really, that you -- thatthe police will not keep good records unless -- unlesswe let the criminals go.141516   incentive.1718192021   writings in some of our prior cases.  Things have22   changed a whole lot since we adopted the exclusionary23   rule, and I think it's quite -- policing has become much24   more professional, and I think it's quite unrealistic to25   think that if we don't adopt the rule that you -- that24MS. KARLAN:  That they need a powerful            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that's the theory ofthe exclusionary rule as --MS. KARLAN:  Yes.JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- as has been expressed in￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   you propose, police -- police departments will just 2   willy-nilly not keep track of warrants.  I -- I just 3   don't think that's true.  That's not professional 4   policing, and -- and I think to say -- to apply the -- 5   the severe remedy that you propose in this -- in this 6   area at this date seems to me excessive. 7               MS. KARLAN:  Well, we don't think this is a 8   severe remedy, and we think that the professionalism of 9   the police is in substantial part a response to the10   message that the exclusionary rule sends, which is11   either you professionalize your police departments or12   the evidence they obtain is going to be suppressed;13   either you maintain good records or the reliance on14   those records is going to lead to suppression.15               JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't think that --16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We don't know if these17   records are good, bad, or indifferent.  As far as this18   record shows, this could be an isolated incident, or it19   could be typical of what goes on.  We just don't know.            MS. KARLAN:  It could be, and if I can justpoint to -- if you look at the Government's brief atpage 48, they talk about how the FBI maintains its20212223   "Wanted" lists now.  And they show that due to a list of24   reforms they were able to cut the error rate there from25   about 6 percent to about 3 percent.  None of those25￼5678   pertinent.9 - Subject to Final Review1   reforms, limited access to entry, periodic audits, is2   done here.  And the last available published data, which3   we cite in our brief about -- about Alabama, is that4   they had about a 13 percent error rate.  That is, 13percent of the --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you are back toarguing that there was negligence, and that that's            MS. KARLAN:  Well, in this case there wasnegligence, and you need not go any further than that.If the Court has no more questions, I'll reserve theremainder of my time.101112131415161718192021222324   activity.  The exclusionary rule does not put the error25   back in the box.  It does not correct it.  It serves26            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,Miss Karlan.Mr. Dreeben, we'll hear now from you.ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. DREEBEN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:            The exclusionary rule under this Court'scases has always been a balance between the interest inachieving some deterrence of police misconduct and thehigh cost of excluding probative evidence of criminal￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   only as incentives for future compliance to avoid future 2   Fourth Amendment errors. 3               In this case, where nothing is shown other 4   than a negligent and isolated clerical error in the 5   maintenance of warrants, there is no showing that 6   suppression of evidence will achieve the kind of 7   appreciable deterrence that this Court has said is 8   necessary before the exclusionary rule is applied. 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do we assume on the10   basis of the record that there is negligence in this11   case?12               MR. DREEBEN:  The district court did find13   that there was negligence.  There is very little in the14   record, Mr. Chief Justice, that explains precisely what15   did happen.  But I would take issue with my colleague's16   comment that the record shows that there were no17   auditing procedures.  The record simply was not made on18   whether there were auditing procedures.19               What the district court did find based on20   testimony is that the Dale County Clerk's Office and the21   Dale County Sheriff's Office both had a reliable system22   of recordkeeping on which law enforcement could rely.23   That's a finding of the district court.24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Now, Ms. Karlan made25   the point -- and I'd like to get your response to it --27￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   that if we adopt something that depends on the showing 2   of negligence, that that will require extensive hearings 3   in every case into exactly what their computer update 4   system was, and so on. 5               MR. DREEBEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, I actually 6   think that negligence alone should not be enough to 7   justify suppression, because it would not produce the 8   appreciable form of deterrence that this Court has said 9   is warranted.  But I also think that --10               JUSTICE SOUTER:  May I interrupt you there?11   I mean, why do you say that?  I mean, we -- we have --12   just getting outside the criminal law for a minute, we13   -- we've got a whole system of personal liability law in14   which the theory is that, in effect, requiring15   compensation for negligence, even though it is not an16   act of bad faith or malice, is -- is going to affect17   conduct.  Why do you assume it will not affect conduct18   here?19               MR. DREEBEN:  I'm not sure that it won't20   affect conduct to some degree, Justice Souter.  I think21   the exclusionary rule requires far more than saying that22   it might affect conduct, and I think that what the Court23   should look at --24               JUSTICE SOUTER:  Don't you think it's25   probable that it will affect conduct?  I mean, if the28￼ - Subject to Final Review1   police know that they are going to lose the case because2   they are engaging in a negligent or objectively3   unreasonable way in -- in relation to their4   warrant-keeping, they are going to be more careful.5               MR. DREEBEN:  I think the incremental change6   in police behavior will be modest at best, and I think7   this is crucial to my view of the case.8               JUSTICE SCALIA:  They -- they won't know9   that they are going to lose a case.  What they will knowis that if they happen to arrest someone whom theyshould not have arrested anyway, they won't be able toprosecute him, right?101112131415   themselves nothing.  I mean, this person would not have16   been stopped.  I mean, if the difference was we -- we17   caught a criminal and we could have convicted him except18   because of the clerical error we can't, but that's not19   the situation.  They would never have found this fellow20   but for the clerical error.MR. DREEBEN:  That's precisely so.JUSTICE SCALIA:  So they are saving2122   --23               JUSTICE SOUTER:  But they -- but they also24   --25               MR. DREEBEN:  -- if you take it --29MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Scalia, if you take it￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9            JUSTICE SOUTER:  But they also, as in thiscase, in the course of -- of committing their -- theirnegligent arrest find evidence of a crime.            MR. DREEBEN:  They do.  But from an ex anteperspective, Justice Souter, they can't know that, butthey do have --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  They can't know that, butwe all know, as a practical matter, that that's whypolice want the -- the greatest scope to the arrest - Subject to Final Review10 power.11               MR. DREEBEN:  No, I think that --12               JUSTICE SOUTER:  Because in the course of13   doing incidental searches, they find things.  They know14   that, and we know that.15               MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Souter, what I think16   it's important for the Court to know is that the17   police have ample incentives as it stands to try to make18   their recordkeeping systems as accurately as possible.19   The police do not have an interest in believing that20   there is an outstanding warrant for someone's arrest21   when there is not.22               The first reason is that an arrest situation23   is a highly dangerous encounter for police officers.24   It's not one to be undertaken lightly.  That's why this25   Court has rules that govern searches incident to arrest30￼ - Subject to Final Review1   in order to remove potential weapons from suspects.  The234567   here?8police don't want to convert what would be an otherwiseroutine traffic stop or no stop at all into a felonyencounter that could go bad for all concerned.                 Second, there is --                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is there a 1983 violation10   liability.  It's a litigable issue whether there would11   be the potential for a plaintiff to show, as the12   defendant in this case did not try to show, that there13   was a degree of deliberate indifference to a need to14   have a reliable recordkeeping system such that some15   official would be personally liable for the failure to16 have that.17               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I suppose if the concern18   were that the police would become sloppy, then a 198319   suit would be more likely?20               MR. DREEBEN:  Yes.  I think a 1983 suit, and21   there is ample evidence that many such suits have been22   brought, and we cite cases in our brief and the23   Petitioner cites cases in his brief.24               JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Dreeben, can I go back25   to your point you were just making.  What incentive does31                MR. DREEBEN:  On the facts of this case,9   Justice Kennedy, I would not say there is 1983￼ - Subject to Final Review1   the police department have to withdraw warrants that2   have been cancelled?  Why not just leave them there?  Aslong as they are there, it would justify an arrest.            MR. DREEBEN:  Well, that assumes, I think,contrary to this Court's assumption of good faith ongovernmental actors --345678   faith for the moment.  If you just think in terms of9 10 11incentives of officers, would they not have an incentivejust to leave everything there?JUSTICE STEVENS:  If you put aside good                 MR. DREEBEN:  No.  There are three reasons12   why they would not.  The first is the danger factor, as131415161718   a reasonable suspicion stop into a felony arrest.  AndI mentioned.            JUSTICE STEVENS:  The existence ornonexistence of the warrant doesn't affect the danger.            MR. DREEBEN:  Oh, it certainly does, becauseit converts what would otherwise be not a stop at all or19202122232425   will be no arrest.  And that's why the police have anwhen the police are undertaking an arrest, this Courthas recognized that suspects often have an incentive toescape or to use weapons to resist --            JUSTICE STEVENS:  But the incentive existswhether there is a warrant in his pocket or not.MR. DREEBEN:  If there is no warrant, there32￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   incentive to clean up the records so that they don't 2   send out the police on warrant situations when there is3 no warrant. 4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Dreeben, what you've 5   said about the danger to the arresting office -- officer 6   and so they don't undertake an arrest lightly, doesn't 7   fit with the facts of this case.  This was a police 8   officer who really wanted to go after the defendant.  He 9   expected -- he suspected defendant was a bad guy.  So10   that's how this all started.  So he called his own11   department, do we have any warrant, and then the next12   county's department.  But this was an officer who wanted13   to go after the defendant.14               MR. DREEBEN:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, I15   assume that the Court will make its decision not based16   on the conduct of Officer Anderson in this case, but in17   an assessment nationwide of whether the exclusionary18   rule is necessary because the police lack incentives to19   keep warrant systems up to date.  And I'm giving reasonswhy institutionally the police do have that incentiveand, therefore, undertake those kinds of efforts.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And there are three20212223   reasons.  One is to reduce the incidence of arrests, so24   they don't have the hazard of felony arrests.25               Number two is?33￼ - Subject to Final Review 1               MR. DREEBEN:  The second reason is police 2   resources.  It takes a lot of time and energy to 3   undertake a felony arrest.  Many jurisdictions have 4   dedicated warrant forces which seek to serve outstanding 5   warrants, and they don't want to spend their time doing 6   it on warrants that have been recalled. 7               Similarly, in a case like this, the police 8   happened to find drugs on Petitioner's person and a gun 9   in his car, but if they had found nothing and taken him10   down to the station house and booked him, that would11   have been taking two police officers off the street for12   an afternoon, wasting their resources so that they're13   not engaged in the kind of protection of the community14   that the police force wants to do.15               And the third reason is that it does not16   create community goodwill to undertake arrests when17   people do not have warrants and simply because of a18   mistake in police records they're hauled downtown.19   That's the kind of thing that creates friction between20   the police and communities.21               JUSTICE BREYER:  There is one question I22   have in my mind, and it's the only factor I thought of23   hypothetically that cuts against you.  This is the24   argument and I'd like you to respond to it.25               I take everything you said as so.  I'll34￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   assume all that.  And so I'd still say the rule, the 2   basic rule of suppression, putting Leon to the side, 3   basic rule is -- the opposite of Holmes:  If the 4   constable blunders, you suppress the evidence.  Okay. 5               Now, our prior case -- here we have a case 6   where the constable blundered.  I grant you, not the 7   arresting officer.  It was a different policeman, and it 8   was a different form of error.  But five months this 9   thing -- this warrant had been recalled five months10   earlier and you agree that it was negligent.  Therefore,11   the constable blundered.  And the virtue of our earlier12   case where we said don't suppress, it wasn't the13   constable who blundered.  So I see an absolutely clear14   line:  If the constable blunders you suppress; if it's1516171819202122232425somebody else who blundered, you don't.            Now, every time I've tried to think of asubstitute for that clear line, I've run into trouble.I've been sitting in my chambers with my law clerks andwe've tried out five substitutes, and I can't find onedecent substitute that isn't filled with problems.            MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Breyer --            JUSTICE BREYER:  What is your substitute?            MR. DREEBEN:  Well, my first answer, JusticeBreyer, is that this Court's exclusionary rulejurisprudence already draws a number of careful lines35￼ - Subject to Final Review1   based on the balance that --2               JUSTICE BREYER:  Right.  Well, I'm3   overstating my point.  What I'm really driving at and4   trying to show you is you, if you want to have a5   different rule than within the prior case, remember the6   one where it wasn't the police that blundered, you have7   to come up with some rule.  And I want to know what your8   rule is.9                 MR. DREEBEN:  Well, the rule, to state it10   simply, that I think should govern this case is:  An11   isolated and negligent police clerical error in the12   maintenance of warrant records should not lead to13   suppression.  And the reason for that is there are ample14   incentive for the police to attempt to correct their own15   records such that the exclusionary rule would not16 approve --1718   think about that.  The special rule is now we have the19   Leon exception and now we have a new exception, and the20   new exception is called for isolated police clerical21   errors.  Well, that's going to be interesting, I22   suspect.23242536JUSTICE BREYER:  So now we have -- let's            The first thing you'll have when you try toimpose your rule is you will have the defense attorneysthroughout the city going in to see if it's an isolated￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   error.  And they will, of course, have a right to decide 2   whether or not this is the only such error, whether 3   there are other clerical errors, how often they occur, 4   what the -- is that an administrable rule? 5               MR. DREEBEN:  I think it's highly 6   administrable.  It doesn't create that many problems. 7   This exclusionary rule hearing is an illustration.  The 8   warrant clerk for Dale County was on the witness stand. 9   The warrant clerk for Coffee County was on the witness10   stand.  The arresting officer was on the witness stand.11   All of those people were asked, do these errors occur12   with frequency?  They said:  They don't; our system is13   reliable.14               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And if there were15   pervasive deficiencies, I assume that's exactly what we16   would inquire about under 1983?1718   Kennedy.1920   number four to your list?21               MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, I would add number -- I22   would add 1983 possible liability as an additional23   incentive, just as it was remarked in Hudson that it24   provides for additional incentive for --25               JUSTICE BREYER:  One other question.37MR. DREEBEN:  That's correct, JusticeJUSTICE KENNEDY:  And would you add 1983 as￼ - Subject to Final Review1   Suppose that the error here consisted not of a computer,2   but rather Joe, who is the policeman, has a partner3   called Sam, and Sam told Joe that this is Harry Smith,4   when negligently it wasn't Harry Smith?  It was Joe5 Smith. 6789 1012   at all.  I think under Hill v. California --MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I think --            JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I mean does thatcount as a clerical error if, in fact, it's the man'spartner who tells him this negligently?                 MR. DREEBEN:  I'm with Miss Karlan on this11   one.  I don't think that's a Fourth Amendment violation21 22 23 24 25            MR. DREEBEN:  I think that that's a veryclose case, and I don't think that this Court --            JUSTICE BREYER:  There must be millions --not millions, but there must have been cases where twopolicemen or one policeman goes off to arrest someone38            JUSTICE BREYER:  Negligent.  It's Negligentpolice work.            JUSTICE BREYER:  That's negligent error.You mean we don't suppress the negligent errors of thepartners who, after all, say, let's arrest this man overhere, and through negligence they have got the wrong1314151617181920   man?  We don't suppress?MR. DREEBEN:  Yes.  It's a mistake.￼171819202122232425   courts?  What have they done? - Subject to Final Review1   and negligently arrests the wrong man.  And when he does2 3 4 5 6 7 8 912   it would not pass the Leon test.13               JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not thinking of a14   warrant.  I'm thinking of a policeman who has a warrant15   for Jack Smith and he goes to arrest Jack Brown because16   through negligence he went to the wrong house.  Now,that and does a search, we don't suppress.            MR. DREEBEN:  What we know about that fromthis Court's cases is that if one police officer has awarrant and it's, he obtained it based on an affidavit,that's purely a bare-bones --            JUSTICE BREYER:  That's Leon.  I'm notthinking that.                 MR. DREEBEN:  No, it's actually not Leon.10   It's Whiteley versus Warden.  And I'm positing a warrant11   that was completely based on a bare-bones affidavit.  Sounder those circumstances would we suppress the drugsthat happen to be found in Jack's house.            MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think it's so clearfrom this Court's cases.            JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, there must have beena lot of cases.MR. DREEBEN:  Well, not in this Court.JUSTICE BREYER:  But what about the lower39￼ - Subject to Final Review1               MR. DREEBEN:  I'm not so aware that there2   are so many of them in the lower courts where it's3   negligence.  Most often the kind of mistakes that's4   made, the courts say it's within the realm of probable5   cause if it's a reasonable mistake.  If it's an6   unreasonable mistake, negligent mistake, I would be7   prepared to say that the lower courts are probably today8   suppressing.  And this Court doesn't have to decide9 10 11 12 13 1416   "good faith" in Leon.  It's repeated it in all of its17   so-called good faith exclusionary rule exceptions.18   We're talking about an objective rule, and the line that19   I think that the Court should draw today is between20   isolated negligent errors and errors that result from a21   more systematic or widespread pattern, the kind that22   Justice O'Connor referred to in her concurrence in23   Arizona v. Evans.24               JUSTICE SCALIA:  You would allow all of that25   inquiry every time there's a motion to exclude.  That40whether that's correct in order to decide this case.This case --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do we use the word or thephrase "good faith" in writing the opinion if we writeit your way?                 MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think the Court needs15   to use the word "good faith."  The Court used the words￼ - Subject to Final Review1   would not just be the basis for 1983.  You still want2   negligence inquiry.3               MR. DREEBEN:  I don't want it.  I'm saying4   that the Court doesn't have to reach the issue today of5   whether a widespread pattern of errors or complete 6   neglect -- 7 8   different. 91011   about reaching your standard in cases in which the12   arrest is wrong, not because there's no warrant, but13   because there's just slightly less than probable cause?14   If there are isolated incidents of that are we going15   to -- are we going to say that in fact that does not16   violate the Fourth Amendment?17               MR. DREEBEN:  I think that's a very18   different -- well, whether it violates the Fourth19   Amendment or not would turn on whether there is in fact20   probable cause.  If there is no probable cause, and I21   understood your question, Justice Souter --22               JUSTICE SOUTER:  No.  We're starting with23   the assumption that there is a violation of the -- I24   think we're starting with background law at this point25   that there is a violation of the Fourth Amendment if41JUSTICE SCALIA:  Thank you.  That's a littleMR. DREEBEN:  Yes.  That's not to say --JUSTICE SOUTER:  What about reaching -- what￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6   line of our objective reasonableness inquiry.  And 7   you're making a dent in the warrant requirement for 8   isolated incidents, and I don't see why we can't or why 9   coherence would not require us to make the same dent in10   the probable cause requirement for equally isolated11 mistakes.there is an arrest without probable cause or without avalid warrant.MR. DREEBEN:  Yes.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  The warrant itself may besubject to attack, but at least that's sort of the front12131415161718   background question?  How frequent does the issue in            MR. DREEBEN:  I think it's simply adifferent inquiry, Justice Souter, because, as I triedto explain, in this area the Court can note a number ofincentives that law enforcement has to keep its warrantdatabases accurate and up to speed.JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Dreeben, can I ask a1920212223   too.24               MR. DREEBEN:  And I think --25               JUSTICE STEVENS:  It seems to me the case42this case arise?            MR. DREEBEN:  In my experience, JusticeStevens, not that frequently.            JUSTICE STEVENS:  That's my understanding,￼ - Subject to Final Review1   may have more symbolic importance than practical2   importance.            MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I think that thepractical importance of it and the legal importance ofit is what, kind of a balance is the Court going to3456   strike under the exclusionary rule.  We heard a lot from7   Petitioner today about how the exclusionary rule would8   help make police engage in better practices.  We heard9 10 1113   there any cases involving violent criminals that have14   been affected by the outcome of this case?15               MR. DREEBEN:  Some in the lower courts have16   involved violent crime, and I think this case would look17   and feel very different if evidence of a murder had been18   discovered in the car.  And that just accentuates the19   point that the exclusionary rule comes with a price to20   society.  It's not free.nothing about the costs of the exclusionary rule.Compared to, for example, to --                 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Are there any cases where12   -- this is a drug peddler here that was caught.  Are2122232425   district court found.  The district court had evidence            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Dreeben, if we adoptyour formulation that isolated negligence doesn't count,is it clear that that's all there was in this case?MR. DREEBEN:  Well, that's all that the43￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   and made a finding that there was no pattern of 2   violations like this, that the system of recordkeeping 3   was generally reliable.  This is the findings of the 4   district court that are on page 17a and 18a of the 5   Petitioner appendix.  The district court concluded: 6   "There is no credible evidence of routine problems with 7   disposing of warrants and the warrant clerk herself 8   could not recall other instances like this." 9               JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, if Miss Karlan's10   figures are correct in Alabama there would be11   suppression.12               MR. DREEBEN:  Well, there was no record made13   whatsoever on what Alabama's overall --14               JUSTICE SOUTER:  No.  I said if her figures15   are correct and there's a 13 percent error rate either16   in the State of Alabama or at least in the department17   involved that we'd have suppression there.18               MR. DREEBEN:  Unless -- if the Court is19   prepared to say that the exclusionary rule is going to20   function differently on a State by State basis depending21   on the statewide error rate, which I think is an unusual22   thing for the Court to do --23               JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, it's going to24   function -- even on your theory, it's going to function25   differently on a department to department basis44￼23 24 25would note, though, that --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  But I thought thatbasically was the distinction that you were arguing for.45 - Subject to Final Review1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011   have a good prima facie case.  I would want to know more12   to know what that really means because with a lot of13   these statistics --14               JUSTICE SOUTER:  But the fact is unless the15   "more" showed that they were getting a 13 percent error16   rate in a negligence-free system, you would have17   suppression there and you would not have suppression18   there in the town next door or the county next door or19   the State next door.20               MR. DREEBEN:  If the Court adopts a rule21   that says that a showing of more than isolated22   negligence would justify suppression, you're correct.  Idepending on the error rate.            MR. DREEBEN:  Upon a -- Not just upon ashowing of an error rate, but upon a showing that aparticular recordkeeping system that produced an errorwas conducted in a manner so that you could say muchmore than negligence was involved here.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, if you've got a 13percent error rate I think you've got a pretty goodprima facie case.MR. DREEBEN:  You do.  I would concede you￼ - Subject to Final Review 1               MR. DREEBEN:  No.  I think I clarified to 2   Justice Scalia that I think all the Court needs to 3   decide today is that an isolated negligent error in 4   police recordkeeping should not result in suppression. 5   It should not hold today because it's not confronted 6   with today -- 7               JUSTICE SOUTER:  But I take it if you're not 8   accepting -- if you're not accepting -- I mean, you're 9   not accepting the proposition that the 13 percent error10   rate which is not somehow shown to be non-negligent11   should have a different result, you are saying in the 1312   percent case we're still not going to suppress.13               MR. DREEBEN:  I would reserve the right to14   argue that the exclusionary rule's costs outweigh its15   benefits even if that is shown in a particular case16   because there are a myriad of other reasons why the17   police would have an incentive to improve that.18               JUSTICE SOUTER:  But if you -- if you were19   to make that argument and it came down to that bald a20   proposition, I assume you would come in with some kind21   of evidentiary basis to tell us exactly what the cost22   is.  And you have spoken of the cost today.  You have23   not spoken of the benefit and the value of having24   relatively error-free arrest recordkeeping.  But I25   haven't heard anything about the unreasonable cost of46￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   equation.  We want to be know how much of that there is 9   and we want to be able to measure against that the value10   that society is getting by requiring valid arrest11   warrants and in a probable cause case by requiring12   probable cause.  And you can't just walk in and say,13   well, there's a cost.  We know there's a cost.14               MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think, Justice Souter,15   that the Court has ever looked for an empirical count of16   how many cases.17               JUSTICE SOUTER:  Don't you think we should18   if we are in effect -- if you are making what sounds to19   me like an empirical argument -- there is a cost to20   society, cases are being lost, criminals are going free21   -- don't you think that we ought to have a factual basis22   to know what that cost is?23               MR. DREEBEN:  If the Court wants one in24   order to justify the exclusionary rule, then it probably25   needs to go back to scratch and start all over again.47the exclusionary rule --            MR. DREEBEN:  Well I think --JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- beyond the record.            MR. DREEBEN:  It's manifested in it everycase in which reliable probative evidence is suppressed.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Sure, sure it is.  But thatdoes not even get us to, as it were, to half the￼ - Subject to Final Review123456   Souter.  If the cost is very low because very few cases7   result in suppression, then deterrence is also very low8   because there are very few cases in which evidence is9   being suppressed.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  We've done an exclusionaryrule now and in effect you are arguing for an exceptionto it because the cost is too great, and it seems to methe burden is on you to tell us what the cost figure is.MR. DREEBEN:  I will say this, Justice10               JUSTICE SOUTER:  But if you take that11   argument to the extreme, we won't have an exclusionary12   rule at all, I suppose.13               MR. DREEBEN:  But my argument today does not14   require the Court to take that step at all because this15   is an area in which there is a local geography of16   incentive pertaining to the accuracy of warrants that17   allows the Court to conduct the balance in a way18   distinct from what it might do if it's confronted with19   police negligence or if it's confronted with a20   widespread pattern of negligence.21               JUSTICE STEVENS:  Of course, if you did the22   cost-benefit analysis the way Justice Stewart would, the23   cost is always zero to the State because they would not24   have had the evidence if they had obeyed the law.25               MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, but I think, Justice48￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   Stevens, that form of looking at the question has been 2   rejected in this Court's cases that have recognized that 3   the exclusionary rule has to pay its way because in 4   every case in which it results in suppression there is a 5   cost to society and the benefit therefore needs to be 6   appreciable and this Court needs to be confident of that 7   before it concludes that what the Court called the 8   "massive remedy of exclusion" is applied in any 9   particular case.10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We know what the11   cost was here, right?  I mean, not just a drug peddler,12   but somebody with an illegal weapon found in his car, a13   weapon that presumably he would use on an occasion in14   which it was in his view appropriate to do so.15               MR. DREEBEN:  Correct.  There was benefit in16   this very case and cost if the evidence is suppressed.17               JUSTICE SOUTER:  But don't you take -- I18   understood you to take the position and I thought the19   Court had previously taken the position that the cost20   benefit analysis had to be a systemic one.21               MR. DREEBEN:  I think that that's correct,22   Justice Souter, but I'm not aware of any case in which23   the Court has said the exclusionary rule has costs and24   now we need to see the numbers of statistically how many25   cases result in suppression.  I'm just not aware of any49￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   case in which the Court has done that. 2               JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, I think that's -- I 3   think that's true.  I mean, we operate -- quite think 4   frankly we operate on the basis of a -- of a good guess 5   and I think your argument is saying let's have -- let's 6   have an exception to the good guess.  And if -- if you 7   start with a good guess as the baseline it seems to me 8   you -- you ought to have something more than another 9   guess to justify the exception.10               MR. DREEBEN:  Well, Justice Souter what my11   case comes down to today I believe is the proposition12   that when we are talking about clerical errors made by13   the police, there are ample incentives for the police14   not to make those clerical errors that I've described15   earlier, such that the incremental benefit of the16   exclusionary rule which we know has a cost; it has a17   tangible cost in every case in which it's applied; does18   not pay its own way.  In other words, there is no19   sufficient incremental deterrence to warrant taking an20   isolated negligent error in a generally reliable system21   and saying we need to suppress evidence anyway; and22   Petitioner's argument goes farther than the isolated23   negligent error case.  It says even if the police have24   driven the error rate down as low as it's humanly25   possible by committing mass amounts of are resources to50￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   warrant database systems in order to avoid suppression, 2   which is what the Petitioner's theory posits, you should 3   still suppress; and that seems to me nothing other than 4   the return to the theory when there is a Fourth 5   Amendment violation, suppression automatically follows; 6   and this Court -- 7               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that's not what we 8   have here, and we have a 13 percent error rate.  If this 9   case goes your way, the police have limited resources;10   why should they spend them on upgrading their computer11   system when if there is an error it wasn't matter?12               MR. DREEBEN:  Well, it does matter, Justice13   Ginsburg, because the police officers that I'm familiar14   with and the agencies that I'm familiar with as15   exemplified by the NCIC which is the national database,16   says that the last thing that we want to do is send17   officers mistakenly out on a felony arrest where they18   are going to be placed in a potentially dangerous19   situation spending community police resources to arrest20   somebody who should not be arrested.  This is not what21   they want to do.  They have a good reason to avoid being22   placed in that situation and I would caution the Court23   against relying on a 13 percent figure in a study that's24   submitted in a brief to this Court for the first time25   without any kind of adversarial testing.  That is not I51￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   this think a reliable basis for the Court to infer that 2   this particular police department had that kind of an 3   error rate or that the exclusionary rule is necessary to 4   prevent it from having that kind of an error rate or 5   even that there were no procedures in place to prevent 6   errors and warrants from remaining in the system. 7               The record simply doesn't show that.  The 8   warrant clerks were on the stand and neither party asked 9   them the question so this Court doesn't have the10   information to say today was there a system that would11   have ferreted this out.  We know that if there was it12   failed in this case.13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In Hudson versus Michigan,14   didn't the Court engage in a very broad balancing of the15   social costs and the potential for increase in16   violations in saying that there was no necessity for the17   suppression rule in the no-knock case?18               MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, Justice Kennedy; the19   Court did just that and it began with the outset that20   the massive remedy of suppression of evidence is a high21   social cost that should not be borne by society, not22   just the police, by all of us, unless appreciable23   deterrence will result as a benefit; and the Court then24   examined the incentives that the police had not to make25   illegal no-knock entries and to add that whatever52￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   incremental benefit there might be from exclusion was 2   not justified in light of the possibility of 198e 3   liability and the increased professionalism of the 4   police which has made it less necessary to make the 5   exclusionary rule a remedy of first resort rather than 6   last resort.  While this Court could conceptualize the 7   case as one in which the government is looking for an 8   exception to the exclusionary rule, I think it's more 9   accurately one where the Court should extend the10   exclusionary rule to cover negligent police clerical11   errors.  For the first time, at this day and age when12   1983 recoveries have become effective --13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How many 1983 recoveries14   have there been when someone says the police, they15   convicted me on the basis of this evidence that wasn't16   suppressed, but they committed a Fourth Amendment17   violation so I should prevail in the 1983 action?  How18   many defendants in that situation have ever won a 198319   action?20               MR. DREEBEN:  No one knows, Justice21   Ginsburg, because a great many of these cases will22   settle out of court, but our brief does provide examples23   of conduct that was more serious and more egregious than24   anything involved in this case resulting in situations25   where courts denied summary judgments to the defendants53￼ - Subject to Final Review1   and ordered the cases to go to trial.2               And I'm not suggesting that in a case like3   this -- may I complete the answer -- there should be a4   1983 remedy, but I am suggesting that civil remedies5   will provide incentives to the police to avoid the bog6   of litigation by putting into place systems that will7   prevent this kind of error.8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,9   Mr. Dreeben.

He goes to the wrong house.25   And he never looks at the number; and he arrests, starts54MS.

KARLAN:  The answer to your question,Justice Breyer, is if the police officer in yourhypothetical was negligent the evidence would be16               JUSTICE BREYER:  He was not.17               MS. KARLAN:  Then he was not negligent.18               JUSTICE BREYER:  I want to know if he is19   negligent.202122   I'm getting a different view from the government.23               MS. KARLAN:  I'm absolutely certain that the24   answer is if he was negligent then there was not25   probable cause; if there was not probable cause and one55MS. KARLAN:  If he is negligent --JUSTICE BREYER:  Excuse me, because I think￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9of the other exceptions to the exclusionary rule doesnot apply, then the evidence will be suppressed.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And the definition ofnegligence is that he was not objectively reasonable?            MS. KARLAN:  That's correct.            JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So we've gotthis -- - Subject to Final Review            MS. KARLAN:  And the rule we are asking forhere -- the narrow rule for our Petitioner is when youhave negligent error by police officials, you suppressbut as Justice Scalia pointed out in my colloquy withhim earlier, that rule is perhaps slightly less workablethan a rule that says all error.101112131415161718   suppression.  And I just want to make up with factual19   correction here which is about the 13 percent.  It was a20   study by the FBI.  It's a very dated study because they21   haven't done a more recent one and it was statewide.22   But let assume for purposes of argument here that if 1323   percent of the errors in the file are there because the24   police are not maintaining their records properly, there25   ought to be suppression of a warrantless arrest based on56            Now we have given you a workable rule hereand we still have not heard I believe a workable rulefrom the government; because what Mr. Dreeben tells youis that under some circumstances there will be￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   that because otherwise you're really telling the 2   department that "good enough for government work" is, 3   you know, one out of six warrants is invalid, one out of 4   seven warrants is invalid, but that's okay. 5               So then what you would have to have in each 6   case is a hearing, and at the hearing we would be 7   entitled to discovery -- 8               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But in that -- but in that 9   hypothetical I think it might be easy to say that the10   policeman on the beat was not objectively reasonable in11 relying.MS. KARLAN:  But Justice Kennedy --12131415161718192021   that today is just unrealistic.  We have to decide today22   whether we are going to adopt a rule that down the road23   will turn every exclusionary request into a pretrial24   investigation of the procedures of the police.25               MS. KARLAN:  Yes.  That's --57            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that's certainly notthe case here.            MS. KARLAN:  But Justice Kennedy, if youbelieve in the government's rule we should have a rightto audit that system to show that 13 percent of thewarrants --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I agree with that.  If --to say with Mr. Dreeben that we don't have to decide￼ - Subject to Final Review1               JUSTICE SCALIA:  And a major -- major trial.2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Not the procedures3   of the police.  The officer is on the stand and you say,4   all right, you've been here a while, how many times have5   these warrants turned out to be wrong, just as simple as6   it was in this case?  And he says, gosh, this is the7 8 9first time that I've had this question.            MS. KARLAN:  But one of the things we knowfrom the oral argument and the transcript in Evans isthat clerk said this is the first time there has everbeen an error, and it turned out there were four errorsthem made the same day.1011121314   people.  These people are under oath, you cross-examine.15   You say, I don't think that's right.  How many times?16   It's not that big a deal to find out on what basis the17   arresting officer was acting.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  Cross-examine18               MS. KARLAN:  Right.  But we would be19   entitled I think, Mr. Chief Justice, to say to the clerk20   on the stand, have you ever conducted an audit?  She21   says, no, but our system is reliable.22               At that point I think we are entitled to an23   audit.  That is we are entitled to hire an expert at24   government expense to figure out how many times this25   department has gotten it wrong.58￼7 8 9you're going to have to have a hearing on who caused it.            MS. KARLAN:  Justice Alito, we had a hearing - Subject to Final Review1               JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't your rule also going2   to require hearings.  If negligence is required --3               MS. KARLAN:  The hearing in this case --4               JUSTICE ALITO:  -- you are going to have to5   have a hearing on whether there was negligence.  And if6   so, who was negligent.  If only causation is required,in this case that's adequate to the rule that we haveand it took approximately two hours.1011121314151617   basis do you have for saying that?  How do you know18   that?  How many of these hearings have you examined?19               MS. KARLAN:  Hearings in which there was no20   warrant?  I have examined none, but I can't imagine that21   it would take more than two hours.  In this case it took22   two hours.            JUSTICE ALITO:  And will that be the case inevery instance?            MS. KARLAN:  It will be the case more oftenthen that you'll have a two-hour hearing that you haveto show isolated --JUSTICE ALITO:  How do you know that?  What2324   there was a warrant when there wasn't one.  Was it a25   court employee under Evans?  The answer is then clear.59All you have to do is figure out who said￼ - Subject to Final Review1   You let the evidence in.  Was it not the court, that is,2   everybody concedes that the court called, everybody3   concedes the warrant was removed, everybody concedes4   that the warrant went back?  Then you answer it that5 way. 67 8 9            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose it were an agencylike INS or Customs in which they have many people thatare not sworn officers or some that are, does it make adifference who answered the phone?MS. KARLAN:  I don't think the sworn officer1011   distinction makes a difference.  I think the agency12   does.13               If I can refer to the State cases here, I14   think they can illustrate how to answer your question15   more precisely, Justice Kennedy.  That is, a number of16   States suppress evidence under these circumstances, and17   they ask what's a question of law that then applies to18   all future cases, which is, is this agency an adjunct of19   law enforcement or is it something else?20               So, for example, in California, the21   Department of Corrections, not.  They are not an22   adjunct.  So errors by the Department of Corrections,23   evidence is admitted.  The State of Florida, the24   Department of Motor Vehicles is an adjunct.  So there if25   the Department of Motor Vehicles makes the mistake,60￼202122232425error, that's enough.            Now, let me turn for just a moment to thequestion of the bloated records and their incentives.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's your bottom lineposition, it has to be a negligent error?            MS. KARLAN:  In this case, yes.  Yes.  I'm61 - Subject to Final Review 1   there is suppression. 2               This rule has been -- 3               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In Rand we said this is 4   exactly the inquiry we are not going to make. 5               MS. KARLAN:  I'm not sure. 6               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Rand was where we had a 7   traffic stop made by a narcotics officer.  And the 8   question was, well, he was going outside his 9   jurisdiction.  We said we are not going to get into the10   way police departments are organized.  We are just not1112131415   perfectly well, Justice Kennedy.  But the question here16   is not a Rand case.  It's what counts as the police?17   And that's the only question we are asking you to answer18   here, is what counts as the police?  Everyone who works19   for the police department.  When they make an negligentgoing to do it.            MS. KARLAN:  That's correct.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's Rand.MS. KARLAN:  No.  I understand Rand￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   perfectly happy -- 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:  What is the position you're 3   arguing for? 4               MS. KARLAN:  We are arguing for negligent -- 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:  You want to adopt a rule 6   that's only when it's a negligent error? 7               MS. KARLAN:  We are arguing for that rule 8   but wanted you to understand that there is a tradeoff as 9   you identified earlier.  Our rule is, I think, a clean,10   narrow rule.  It may require, as Justice Alito has11   pointed out, slightly more detailed hearings.12               Let me turn now to this question of the13   incentives, which is the incentives of departments, as14   illustrated in this case, are to leave the question of15   maintaining records to the end of the line in spending16   their resources, because they are not going to have to17   serve these warrants.  These warrants serve as an18   opportunity to stop and arrest someone they otherwise19   wouldn't be able to stop and arrest here, because they20   like probable cause.21               All they had to do to cite -- Justice22   Kennedy, to cite Rand to you is if they wanted to follow23   him for a while, I'm sure they could have found a motor24   vehicle violation at some point.  But they didn't even25   want to do that.  They just wanted to use this62￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7   violation. 8 910111213141516warrant -- - Subject to Final Review            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So that's assumingbad faith on the part of the police.MS. KARLAN:  No, it's good faith.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  They want to arresthim, so they follow him until they find a motor vehicle            MS. KARLAN:  This Court has said it'sabsolutely fine and it's not bad faith.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you'resuggesting it's bad faith --            MS. KARLAN:  No, I'm not suggesting that.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- because they --because they don't want to have to worry about getting awarrant that might be wrong?                 MS. KARLAN:  No, no.  That's not what I17   said, Mr. Chief Justice.  May I please --181920212223   then?  You're saying, well, they want to get this guy24   and they don't have to go through the warrant or            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What was the pointof -- well, sure, as long as I'm asking the questions,you can answer.(Laughter).CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What was your point25   anything else.  They can follow him, find the broken63￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   taillight and then they would have gotten that guy.  I 2   thought that was the point you were trying to make? 3               MS. KARLAN:  No.  The point I was -- the 4   point I was trying to make is that there are other 5   techniques here if you haven't as yet inarticulable 6   suspicion that somebody is a bad guy that you can use 7   that to comply with the Constitution.  What you can't do 8   is rely on a warrant that doesn't exist, and then turn 9   around and say police error, but we are entitled to rely10   on our own error.1112   Chief.13141516   police only use them incidentally.  I have always17   assumed that when a warrant is out, part of the job of18   the police is to -- is to arrest the person.  Isn't thatJUSTICE SCALIA:  May I ask one question,CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Your -- your comment seemsto assume that these warrants just lie there and the19202122   as I understand it.  One is warrants the police go and23   try and find themselves, and then they are trying to24   serve those aggressively.  But there are a lot ofthe case?different kinds of warrants out there, Justice Scalia,MS. KARLAN:  Well, there are really two very25   warrants like this one that sat in a file for five64￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425months, nobody tried to serve it during the vastmajority of that time because a lot of these warrants,as is true in this case, are for failure to answer acalendar call or for not paying a parking fine on timeor for not sending in your fine on a motor vehicle.            In the Ott case that we cite it was failureto pay child support.            So those are not the kinds of things wherethe police are serving the warrants aggressively.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank youMiss Karlan, the case is submitted.            (Whereupon, at 11:06 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.) -
