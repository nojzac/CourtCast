FREDERICK               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MR. FREDERICK:  Thank you, Justice Stevens, andmay it please the Court:          Pesticides are economic poisons designed to killliving things.  Sometimes they do not work as designed.For more than a century until the 1990's, courtspermitted farmers to bring claims againstmanufacturers for crop damage caused byroutinelypesticidepesticides.  In enacting amendments to FIFRA in 1972,Congress did not intend to displace those preexistingState law remedies.          The farmers here allege claims for defectivedesign, defective manufacturing, fraud, breach ofwarranty, and failure to warn for a brand new product thatseverely damaged their peanut crops.  I'd like to startwith our narrowest theories for reversal and demonstratefor threechallengereasons why those claims survive preemption.The defective design and manufacturing claimsthe product's composition, not its label.  The31111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 fraud, warranty, and negligence claims involve general2 legal duties, not pesticide-specific requirements, and the3 failure to warn and fraud claims are not different from or4 in addition to FIFRA requirements.5 Now, with respect to the first point, Dow6 concedes at pages 43 and 49 of its brief that defective7 design and manufacturing claims generally are not8 preempted. That concession warrants a remand here, as9 this case was decided before discovery, enable the farmers10 to develop their claims.11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But couldn't you make every12 failure to warn claim a defective design claim? That is,13 they didn't warn about the effects, but those effects14 would not have been present if the product had been15 designed to assure that there wouldn't be any adverse16 effect on the peanut crop.17 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Ginsburg, the way the18 Restatement of Torts and Product Liability in sections 119 and 2 describe, there are basically three theories that20 products liability claims can proceed on: a defective21 design, defective manufacturing, and defective warnings.22 The restatement explains that they are distinct legal23 theories that go to different problems that the24 manufacturer has caused with respect to the product. A25 defective design claim asserts that the composition was41111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425inadequate and that a properly designed product could havebeen put on the market that would not cause the harm.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Mr. Frederick, on thedefective design claim, presumably that's based on afactual theory that Dow could have reasonably designedStrongarm to be safe for growing peanuts in high-acidsoil.          MR. FREDERICK:  Correct.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  But doesn't that mean yourclient should have to put forward some evidenceestablishing a material issue of disputed fact on thatpoint?MR. FREDERICK: Certainly, but here -- JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And it didn't do that. MR. FREDERICK: Well here, Your Honor, themotion for summary judgment that Dow filed was not basedon the merits of the claims.  It was based on them beingpreempted, displaced as a matter of Federal law.  Theyalso asserted a limitation of -- of remedy provision.          But we never had discovery in this case.  TheDistrict Court, after finding jurisdiction, consideredDow's motion for summary judgment on preemption and lockedus out of the courthouse door before we ever had a chanceto prove that a safer design for the product could havebeen made.  And that's where we think the court's decision51111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 below was overbroad and should be reversed.2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the problem I have with3 -- with the Government's case and with the respondent's4 case is that -- it's really the obverse of what Justice5 Ginsburg said. Their problem is that they would recast6 everything as a warning.7 MR. FREDERICK: That's absolutely correct.8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the restatement have some9 specific provisions that say no matter how good the10 warning is, you're still entitled to proceed when there's11 a -- I don't know -- dangerous product or defective12 product or something?13 MR. FREDERICK: Yes. Restatement sections 1 and14 2 address this, and what the restatement says is that if15 you can show that the product could have been reformulated16 to be properly designed, then the existence of a warning17 that might go to certain of its uses would not negate a18 defective design claim. The Texas Supreme Court --19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Even -- even if the warning20 specifically covered that design defect?2122 correct. 2324 warning:25 not good enough?MR. FREDERICK: That -- that's -- that'sAnd what the restatement --JUSTICE KENNEDY: So even if this product said, may not be effective in high pH soils, that's61111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. FREDERICK: Under the restatement rule,2 which Texas has adopted in the Uniroyal case, which we've3 cited in our brief I think at page 47, that is true4 because the restatement explains that there are certain5 warnings that could be ignored or not observed or not6 understood properly and that if it can be proved that a7 properly designed product would be on the market, there8 are public policy reasons why that's what we want to9 encourage1011 it -- you12 will -- that will work in high pH soil, but it's going to13 be three times as effective. Do I have to sell it?14 MR. FREDERICK: Well, the --15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can't I just sell it for those16 people who don't need it for -- for high pH soil at a17 third the price with a warning that says, hey, by the way,18 don't use this in high pH soil? It's crazy to say you19 can't do that.20 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Scalia, to answer your21 question in several ways, that's a jury determination to22 -- to ascertain the reasonableness of the alternate design23 that the manufacturer would be asked to -- to do or to24 market a separate product that was separately designed for25 high-acid soils.71111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005manufacturers to do.  I mean, under --JUSTICE SCALIA:  At any cost?  I mean, what ifknow, yes, I can -- I can sell you stuff that￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it's never a question ofthe reasonableness or the adequacy of the warning?MR. FREDERICK: I don't think it's a question of warning in this sense, Justice Kennedy. If you take their theory, which is that a defective design claim always collapses to a failure to warn, they can put out a defectively designed product that admittedly causes harm, and all they have to do is change the label and say, if used in these particular circumstances, it may cause harm, because that would necessitate a change to the label --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, not necessarily.  Itwouldn't be always either way.  I would think that if infact you have a product and the product causes harm in asubset of cases, which you could warn against, then a jurycould decide whether the unreasonableness consists of nothaving designed the super-safe product or theunreasonableness consists of not having had a differentlabel.MR. FREDERICK: And that -- there are -- that's why the restatement makes clear that there are distinctive theories for defect --          JUSTICE BREYER:  And you're arguing that in thiscase you have the first.          MR. FREDERICK:  That's correct.          JUSTICE BREYER:  It seems implausible on -- you81111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 know, --2 MR. FREDERICK: Well, we have both actually.3 JUSTICE BREYER: -- because all they'd have to4 do is don't use it in pH soil.5 MR. FREDERICK: No. We have defective warning6 too, and -- and if I can address that as well. The7 statute here prohibits in section 136q(1) any false or8 misleading statement in the label as to any particular.9 Our position is that the 2000 label said, suitable for10 peanut-growing areas in all places where peanuts are11 grown. That was false. Under the statute, that is a12 misbranding, and that is actionable as -- both as a13 failure to warn, as a fraud claim, and as a breach of14 warranty.15 Now, the Medtronic majority made absolutely16 clear that that kind of claim is not preempted, and in17 fact all nine Justices agreed that when the State law18 claim is parallel to the Federal requirements, the19 existence of a State law remedy is not an additional20 requirement.21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So on -- on that aspect of the22 case, you put in your pleadings that this was a violation23 of FIFRA.24 MR. FREDERICK: We don't necessarily need to say25 a violation of FIFRA is -- so long as the requirement is91111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the same, although we can certainly --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's a -- that's a bitdifferent.  You were -- you were asserting a moment ago Ithought -- please correct me if I'm wrong -- that this wasa violation of FIFRA because it was misbranded.MR. FREDERICK: I --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It seems to me that you thenhave a suit under FIFRA, but I don't think that was thetheory of your complaint.          MR. FREDERICK:  No.  The theory of our complaintwas a failure to warn both for negligence and as adefective product.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  But the reason for that, I takeit, is that FIFRA does not -- I mean, I think you agreeFIFRA does not provide an independent private right ofaction.          MR. FREDERICK:  That's correct.JUSTICE SOUTER: So you've got to sue under State law, but you would -- you would kind of have a slam dunk for your position, I suppose, if your pleading said, the failure to warn only to the extent that in fact the -- the warning given in compliance with FIFRA was an inadequate warning. That would -- that would keep you within the -- the -- in effect, the -- the Federal limit, and it would also make clear that you had a State law101111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 cause of action, not a Federal cause of action.2 MR. FREDERICK: That's correct, and because --3 JUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and that's in effect4 what you're arguing.5 MR. FREDERICK: Yes. And -- and because of the6 preliminary of this suit, Justice Kennedy, we certainly7 should have the opportunity to amend our complaint. There8 are counterclaims that this is done at the motion for9 declaratory judgment.10 JUSTICE BREYER: In your view -- in your -- your11 opinion, if you were to follow that, would EPA -- suppose12 EPA does the following. EPA looks into this and they13 publish a reg that says in this case or in this subset of14 cases, or some kind of description that fits yours, we15 think that the labeling should be thus and so and we think16 that State tort suits will interfere with our ability to17 promote the uniform labeling and therefore they're18 preempted. Can the EPA do that on your theory?19 MR. FREDERICK: Yes, it can and the -- the20 interesting aspect of this, Justice Breyer, is that of21 course EPA hasn't done that. EPA has made very clear it22 never tested for efficacy. It never even gave notice and23 comment so that --24 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, EPA has -- has waived25 efficacy data requirements. Right?111111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. FREDERICK:  Yes.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Now, is it your position thata State can pass a law requiring labels to have efficacyclaims?          MR. FREDERICK:  They have to do it pursuant totheir powers under 136v(a) which is the regulation of saleor use or under 136v(c) which says that when a Statedesignates a particular locality requirement and a specialneed, it can impose a label -- it can impose requirementsthat the manufacturer has to comply with.Now, the EPA importantly -- and this is in their regulations at 163.152 -- has specifically said that States have labeling authority. The States can impose labeling requirements. Now, there's no reason why --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  But you're not relying onthat in this cause of action.          MR. FREDERICK:  No, Justice -- no, JusticeO'Connor, except to the extent that if the State canaffirmatively do it through a positive regulation, theirtheory has to be wrong that the -- that any incidentaleffect that induces a change to label is preempted.  Thattheory has to be wrong, and that's what the Fifth Circuitrelied on.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, does -- does FIFRArequire the manufacturer to say on the label what the item121111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 can be used for?2 MR. FREDERICK: Yes, but I want to address --3 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So how -- how does an express4 warranty claim escape preemption --5 MR. FREDERICK: As the --6 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- where -- where Dow just7 says the federally mandated statement is included on my8 label and910 O'Connor,11 is not a requirement under State law because it's a12 voluntary contractual arrangement between the parties.13 The Court I think has made clear that what has to be14 ascertained here is does the State cause of action or the15 State law create a requirement. That's not true in the16 warranty case because FIFRA doesn't speak to requirements17 in -- as to warranties. It speaks to requirements in18 other ways.19 So what Dow did here with its warranty was20 completely voluntary, and the fact that it breached that21 warranty by putting on the market a product that was not22 suitable for the use in all areas where peanuts are grown23 is a breach of a warranty that it voluntarily undertook.24 Breach of that is not a requirement imposed under State25 law. And that has been, I think, verified by seven131111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005it's true?MR. FREDERICK:  A warranty claim, Justiceas this Court made clear in the Cipollone case,￼1 Justices of this Court in the -- in the Cipollone case.2 Now, if I could speak to the fraud claim, it is3 important to understand that in both Cipollone and in a4 footnote in Medtronic, the Court made clear that where5 there are general legal duties that are not observed by6 the manufacturer that don't go to the specific product7 itself, those claims are not preempted.8 Here our assertion is that Dow put on the market9 a -- a product that was mislabeled and that they went out10 and told people fraudulently was suitable for their uses.11 We acted in reliance on that and we suffered damages.12 Those are general legal duties, not pesticide-specific13 ones. And the existence of the preemption clause of14 136v(b) does not displace us from the opportunity to try15 to prove to a court that fraud was committed here.16 Now, if I could briefly address two points. One17 is that the inducement to change theory should be18 rejected. That was the basis on which the Fifth Circuit19 decided this case and it is an overly broad theory for20 several reasons.21 First, it's not supported by the text of 136v(b)22 which says requirements for labeling. It doesn't say23 requirements that induce a change to the label. And24 that's how many of the courts have gone off track since25 the Cipollone decision was announced by this Court. They141111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 have read FIFRA as saying just because the word2 requirements is 136v(b), thereby any State law claim that3 imposes a requirement that might induce a manufacturer to4 change the label is thereby preempted. We think that's5 overly broad because it confers way too much discretion on6 manufacturers to decide what to put on labels, and they7 can claim immunity for any overly broad claim of efficacy8 so long as when they are sued, they can say we're induced9 to change the label.10 Because EPA does not evaluate the specific11 contents with respect to efficacy or the claims that are12 made on -- on a label, if a manufacturer makes an overly13 ambitious statement as to efficacy, all the manufacturer14 has to do under the inducement to change theory is go to15 court and say we would have to change the label and16 thereby 136v(b) preempts it.17 Now, I'd also like to stress that the other18 side's theory creates a huge regulatory gap. As your19 question, Justice O'Connor, noted, the EPA does not20 evaluate efficacy on the front end. And in fact, the21 history behind these provisions is that EPA understood22 from the very beginning that common law claims would serve23 an important incidental regulatory effect.24 If we could review the history for a moment.25 Prior to the 1972 changes to FIFRA, for decades farmers151111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 had brought claims against manufacturers for design2 defect, for failure to warn, for the kinds of common law3 claims that we have asserted in this case. It was so well4 established by 1972 that there was a huge section in the5 American Law Reports that annotated all the cases and6 explained what the common law duties of pesticide7 manufacturers were. Yet, notwithstanding that, when8 Congress enacted the 1972 act, despite thousands of pages9 of hearings, committee reports, legislative debates, there10 is not one mention of any effort to displace those11 preexisting common law claims.12 And when EPA, in discharging its13 responsibilities under the 1972 act, got overwhelmed by14 the requirement that it re-register products that were15 already out on the market, pursuant to the 1972 act's16 standards, it very promptly went to Congress and said, you17 should waive efficacy requirements because we simply can't18 do this. Congress responded, but importantly in the19 administrations on both sides, EPA has always understood20 except until just a couple of years ago when the Solicitor21 General changed the position of the Government, that these22 kinds of incidental common law suits would have an23 important regulatory effect.24 If we could just take the case of DDT. For 3025 years, manufacturers were sued for DDT and awarded damages161111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 until it became clear that the groundswell over the course2 of decades that DDT needed to be banned, and it was only3 at the back end that the expert agency regulators4 determined that in fact the product needed to be banned,5 but that was only after a very long history in which6 common law suits had provided remedies to farmers and7 others who were harmed by that product.8 Now, in 1982, the Reagan administration's EPA9 expanded the efficacy waiver and it included far greater10 products than had been done in the Carter administration11 in 1979. And in the Federal Register notice announcing12 that it was intending to expand that efficacy waiver, the13 EPA in 1982 said the reason why we think this can be done14 is because suits can be brought against manufacturers who15 put on the market ineffective products. We cited that on16 page 31 of our brief.17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But do you take the position18 that juries can do what a State regulation cannot do, or19 are they much -- are they on a par?20 MR. FREDERICK: Well, our broadest theory,21 Justice Kennedy, is that the word requirements in 136v(b)22 doesn't include common law claims at all.23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose we disagree with that.24 MR. FREDERICK: If you disagree with that, then25 they would have to be the same, and that's why our point171111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 about the existence of the parallel requirements is the2 same.3 I want to address the point of the discordance4 between what State juries can decide and what State5 regulators can decide because Dow and the Government have6 featured that in their case. The Government in the7 Medtronic case at page 27 of its amicus brief there said8 there was no problem to be had with juries rendering9 supposedly inconsistent decisions so long as they were10 following one Federal standard. The Federal standard here11 is clear: falsity. Tell the truth. That's what12 manufacturers are obliged to do under the statute and13 under the regulations.14 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's their strong point.15 So what is the response to that? Because you can easily16 get two juries in different parts of the country to decide17 absolutely opposite things as to what the label should18 say, and in those circumstances, they say, well, they're19 in an impossible situation and that's why Congress passed20 this statute, to be sure it would be EPA and not two juries21 in different places.22 MR. FREDERICK: First, the juries -- unlike a --23 a declaratory judgment or an injunctive type remedy,24 Justice Breyer, a jury for a common law damages claim is25 not saying what affirmatively should be on the labels.181111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm speaking practically. And2 I don't have to go into all the argument.3 MR. FREDERICK: Sure.4 JUSTICE BREYER: You know the argument. It's a5 very familiar argument.6 MR. FREDERICK: Sure. The answer is that --7 that Congress was prepared to accept a certain level of8 disuniformity when it enacted 136v because it made very9 clear in sandwiching the preemption provision of 136b --10 surround -- by (a) and (c) that it was prepared to allow11 States to depart in significant respects from what was12 nationally uniform. And the way it did so was to say13 States can regulate sale or use and they can also impose14 extra requirements for special locations.15 Now, what Dow did here I think illustrates the16 way the system is supposed to work, which is that when a17 problem was identified with their product in the States of18 Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, within 7 months it19 petitioned the EPA to append to its national uniform label20 a supplemental label. And that supplemental label says it21 is for distribution in those three States only and it22 provided 10 important changes to the label that it23 otherwise had as a nationally uniform label. That's how24 the system is supposed to work. If the incidental25 regulatory effect of jury verdicts or common law claims191111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 induces or causes some kind of change to the label, that2 can be done without an adverse effect to national3 uniformity through the supplemental labeling process. And4 what Dow did here was it has its label and then it5 attaches the supplemental label that addresses the6 particular conditions that exist in the State.7 And the EPA has recognized that as a perfectly8 appropriate and valid way to address the geographic,9 environmental, and climatic conditions that exist in the10 different regions of the country that engage in11 agriculture. There's nothing that is uncertain about that12 if you accept the premise of the Government's argument in13 Medtronic, which is that juries can be properly14 instructed, if it came to that, so that they could follow15 the appropriate Federal standard.16 Now, I would like to turn -- sorry. Did you --17 no, go ahead.18 I would like to turn briefly to the -- the19 requirements aspect of the case because we do think that,20 under our broadest theory, this is a different situation21 than Medtronic and Cipollone, and because of the important22 statutory indications that are in the provision 136v.23 Unlike in Medtronic, there is an explicit provision that24 is a non-preempted provision, and that is different from25 Medtronic. Where in Medtronic there was a provision that201111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 allowed the FDA to impose its own decisions as to2 requirements and whether or not the States should be3 displaced, here Congress made the determination in 136v(a)4 and in (c) that those kinds of requirements can be5 imposed. They're in addition to what the Federal standard6 is. That means that you have to look at requirements in a7 somewhat different way because the States have this8 authority that they did not have under the Medical Device9 Amendments.10 There's a textual indicator under (b) also which11 refers to (a) in the sense that (b) says such State that12 shall issue these requirements. Such -- the meaning of it13 in Webster's means what has been already described -- is14 in (a), and in (a) the States are authorized to promulgate15 regulations. So we think that there is a textual basis16 for distinguishing the word requirements that this Court17 -- five Justices in this Court in18 encompass common law claims.19 If there are no further20 I'd like to reserve the balance --21 JUSTICE BREYER: Let me22 you'll hear some variation of this, and you have a minute,23 which is the -- the statute sets up a24 of keeping this branded stuff off the25 complaining farmer has to do is to go211111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-perfectly good waymarket.  All anyto EPA and ask themWashington, DC 20005Medtronic said wouldquestions at this time,ask one because I think￼1 to pull it, and pulling it is an unbelievable sanction.2 It's like the atomic bomb on the company.

WAXMAN      ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT202122232425 the Court:1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MR. WAXMAN: Justice Stevens, and may it please 22￼1 FIFRA's preemption provision, which Congress2 specifically amended in 1978 to add the title uniformity,3 preempts by its terms, quote, requirements for labeling4 different 56 amendment7 passed an8 to get in9 -- it need not do so. And in fact we know it is not doingfrom those required under FIFRA.JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why -- why doesn't the otherlimit your argument?  Because Congress has alsoamendment to the effect that unless EPA choosesto the business of -- of passing on efficacy, it10 so. Why, therefore, doesn't the uniformity argument go to11 those subjects that EPA does review for and why doesn't12 the subject of efficacy, in effect, drop out of -- of the13 -- the whole preemption claim?14 MR. WAXMAN: There are -- there are two15 fundamental reasons. The first is that it is a principal16 requirement of FIFRA, and has been since 1972 and remains,17 that a manufacturer may only sell a registered pesticide18 with the precise labeling to the word and font size that19 EPA has approved, and that requirement applies whether the20 wording relates to human safety, environmental protection,21 or efficacy.22 Now, the specific amendment in 1978 was, as Mr.23 Frederick indicated, represented a representation by EPA24 to Congress -- and Congress' -- the -- the committee25 report plainly indicates this -- that the EPA was not231111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 saying we are no longer regulating efficacy, we are no2 longer concerned with efficacy. What they said was3 because the Department of Agriculture and the extension4 services and the State universities are all involved in5 this and, in particular, are involved in the statutory6 requirement that before a manufacturer can even apply for7 registration, even submit a registration application, the8 manufacturer must do extensive, rigorous efficacy testing,9 which Congress has indicated correctly is very expensive10 --11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's not monitored at12 all. The -- the manufacturer can say -- make up reports13 and EPA is never going to look at it.14 MR. WAXMAN: If the manufacturer makes up15 reports, it has committed a felony. EPA can enforce it.16 It can refer it to the Attorney General. It's just like17 the --18 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But maybe it isn't a labeling19 violation. I mean, there are claims made here that I have20 trouble shoehorning into your theory. For instance, why21 does a claim that Dow negligently failed to field test its22 product on peanuts on acid soil impose a label23 requirement?24 MR. WAXMAN: Justice --25 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I -- I just don't understand241111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 that.2 MR. WAXMAN: Justice O'Connor, I think -- I will3 address the negligent testing and, of course, the design4 defect --5 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes.6 MR. WAXMAN: -- discussion that's figured so7 prominently in my colleague's argument.8 It's very, very important to understand that9 unlike in Sprietsma and Medtronic and so many of the --10 and, for that matter, with respect to the preempted claims11 in Cipollone, the claims that were preempted below, we12 didn't file a rule 12 motion to dismiss. We couldn't have13 with respect to at least one of those two claims. We14 filed a motion for summary judgment that said with respect15 to -- let me take design defect first. With respect to16 design defect, it is possible under Texas State law to17 state a claim for products liability under defective18 design without impeaching the labeling.19 And there is a brief filed in this case by Dean20 Powers, the University of Texas Law School, for the -- the21 Texas Chemistry Council who's an expert on Texas tort law,22 and he goes through the Texas torts in detail to show why23 they are all preempted and all invalid under independent24 and adequate State grounds.25 But what we did is we didn't move to dismiss.251111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425We filed a motion for summary judgment, and in that motionfor summary judgment, we pointed the respondents in thiscase to this Court's decision in Celotex v. Catrett, andwe said, in effect, we know that you can allege a designdefect claim without impeaching the labeling, but we thinkthat what you are complaining about does impeach thelabeling.  Therefore, show us what you have.          Now, under rule 56, they had two alternatives.They could have filed an affidavit or a request under rule56(f), as this Court referenced in Anderson v. LibertyLobby, and said, hey, we don't know how this was made.  Wedon't know how this was tested.  We don't know how thiswas manufactured.  We're entitled to discovery, anddistrict courts recognize that all the time.  What theydid --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  And they didn't do that?          MR. WAXMAN:  They did not do that, and what theydid was to submit affidavits and documentary evidence,including expert affidavits.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. -- Mr. Waxman, you saidthey didn't file a motion to dismiss.  I thought youbrought the lawsuit.MR. WAXMAN: We brought the lawsuit and we -- JUSTICE STEVENS: But then they couldn't file -- MR. WAXMAN: No, no, no.

WAXMAN:  No, no.  Their counterclaims.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Oh, okay.          MR. WAXMAN:  In other words, this wasn't decided-- Mr. Frederick's reply brief talks over and over andover again about how this was decided on the pleadings,and you know, there was no discovery allowed.  Under rule56, they could have asked for discovery when we basicallysaid, okay, let's show our hands.  We got two jacks.  Whatdo you got?  And what their expert said and what theirresponse said was if the 2001 amended label had been onit, we wouldn't have been injured.          Now, rule 56(c) says that when you oppose asummary judgment motion with affidavit evidence, theburden is on the adverse -- the adverse party must byaffidavits, or otherwise provided in this rule, set forthspecific facts showing that there is a genuine issue fortrial, and they didn't do that.          Now, the classic design defect -- let me -- letme give you an example.JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, let's just try to boil it down a little bit for my purposes. Do you concede that there could be a claim based on no testing --271111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. WAXMAN: Well --2 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- that there could be a3 claim based on design defect, that there could be a claim4 saying there were off-label oral statements made that5 amounted to fraud or misleading --6 MR. WAXMAN: I'll take them in your precise7 order.8 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Okay.9 MR. WAXMAN: Under Texas law -- and the Court of10 Appeals opinion, the Grinnell opinion cited by the Court11 of Appeals opinion, says this, as does Dean Powers. Under12 Texas law, negligent testing is not an independent tort.13 It is of necessity a subset of inadequate warnings. It is14 an element of a -- the tort -- the claim of product defect15 related to warnings. And so it is not possible under16 Texas law, settled Texas law. Other States are different,17 but Texas in its sovereign capacity has chosen to make18 claims of negligent testing an element of the tort of19 defective product by failure to warn, and that --20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the way you proceeded in21 this case, you made it clear that it would be impossible22 for the Texas court itself to weigh in on this because you23 jumped the gun. They wanted to proceed in Texas court,24 and then we would have known what Texas law was on these25 subjects. You said, no, we want to be in the Federal281111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 forum.2 MR. WAXMAN: We want -- as the -- as the Fifth3 Circuit found and the District Court found, we filed a4 declaratory judgment in Texas after we received their5 demand letters because we wanted this to be adjudicated in6 a single forum, which the Texas venue rules would not have7 allowed, and we -- we actually filed this in Lubbock,8 Texas, which is the geographic center of where these 299 farmers operate.10 Now, with respect to defective design, yes,11 under Texas law if they had a -- they have to allege and12 they have to prove that there is a safer alternative13 design for this product, which they never even introduced14 one quantum of evidence about. But --15 JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me you're --16 you're arguing the merits of the tort claims rather than17 the preemption issue.18 MR. WAXMAN: Well, what we said was your claims19 are preempted if they impeach the labeling that we are20 required by Federal law to use.21 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But they now say they don't.22 They ought to be able to proceed on those claims. What do23 we do with that?24 MR. WAXMAN: Well, what this -- what -- what25 happens under rule 56 --291111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And also the -- also the2 claims of false, misleading statements outside the label.3 MR. WAXMAN: Yes. I'm going to get to the false4 and misleading statements outside the labeling in a5 minute, but just to finish the design defect point, they6 filed a complaint -- a counterclaim which had as a count7 this was defectively designed. It is possible under Texas8 law to prove that something is defectively designed. If9 they had come in and said, but we filed a motion for10 summary judgment that says here's our evidence and we11 don't think that you can satisfy -- that you are, in fact,12 complaining about a defective design --13 JUSTICE STEVENS: But if they did allege a14 defective design claim under Texas law, would that have15 been preempted?16 MR. WAXMAN: No. If -- if they had said, look,17 the problem with this, which as footnote 9 of our brief18 indicates, it's not a --19 JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me your argument20 is not whether there's preemption. It's whether there's a21 State cause of -- State law cause of action.22 MR. WAXMAN: No, no, no. It's -- it's both.23 With respect to defective design, what we said is, your24 claim is preempted because you aren't going to go to the25 jury on defective design without impeaching the label.

WAXMAN:  It is -- it is absolutely their9 burden in10 summary judgment, to show that there are material facts11 that are either in dispute or there are material facts12 that would allow them to go to the jury.13 JUSTICE SOUTER: But on your theory there is no14 material fact, it seems to me, because your -- what you15 say they cannot make good on that claim without impeaching16 the label.17 MR. WAXMAN: And they --18 JUSTICE SOUTER: Every time they sue on the --19 on the ground that -- let's say, that -- that the -- the20 actual use was inconsistent with what the label described,21 you could say, gee, if their theory is correct, we'd have22 to change our label to say that what's on the label now is23 in fact not properly descriptive of the product. So it's24 not a -- a question of needing more fact. On your theory,25 whenever they, in effect, sue on the basis of what you311111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005-- as the responding party to a motion for￼1 say, your response is going to be, as a matter of law,2 well, if they're correct, we'd have to say something else.3 That impeaches the label. Therefore, preemption.4 MR. WAXMAN: That is exactly right. What they5 could have done in response to our motion for summary6 judgment is to say this product assertedly harms -- when7 it is applied before the seed is planted, will harm the8 product it is -- the plant that it's supposed to protect9 if the soil pH is too high. They could have easily have10 come back and said if they had a -- a design defect claim11 that didn't impeach the label to say you should have --12 there was a way to manufacture this product. You could13 have it in pellet form rather than in the soluble form or14 if the problem was the alkalinity of the soil, there is a15 way to design this so that it is dissolved in a more16 acidic solution.17 The classic case, which is referenced in the18 NRDC brief, which has many, many examples of true design19 defect claims that don't impeach labels, is a case20 involving rat poison. It's a case called Banks v. ICI21 America. It's a Georgia Supreme Court --22 JUSTICE BREYER: So you quite clearly have23 I understand that.24 Let me ask you a question about the -- the25 preemption point because what I think they're saying321111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005both.is go￼1 read the red brief, your brief, pages 6 and 7, and there2 you see a statutory requirement and you see regulatory3 requirements, regulation. And I think one of their claims4 is we are arguing that that statutory requirement, without5 any change in the regulatory, that -- that it was6 violated. These are false. They're misbranded. So we7 are not imposing a requirement different from or in8 addition to the requirement of Federal law. We are9 enforcing a requirement that is the same as the10 requirement of Federal law, and if, by the way, the EPA11 were to think that tort suits in those circumstances in12 practice are too disuniform, let them promulgate a13 regulation to that effect. But they haven't.14 Now, what -- what is the answer to that15 argument?16 MR. WAXMAN: The answer is threefold. Number17 one, a challenge to a -- the wording of a statement on the18 label on the grounds that it is false and misleading is --19 does impose a requirement different than Federal law, not20 the requirement that -- that labeling not be false and21 misleading, but the fundamental requirement that a --22 unless and until the EPA says otherwise, the manufacturer23 can only sell this product with the precise labeling that24 EPA has approved. And it -- if you look at page 63a --25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, do I --331111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. WAXMAN: -- of the joint appendix --2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, do I take it from3 what you have just said that there is no -- even though4 the statute prohibits misbranding, that there is no way5 that that can be privately enforced, that misbranding is6 something strictly for EPA to deal with, that the statute7 has a prohibition on misbranding? I can see the argument8 that all we're doing is enforcing the provision that says9 no misbranding. So is EPA the only the player in the10 misbranding --11 MR. WAXMAN: Insofar as labeling is concerned,12 the answer is yes, and that's because the statute -- the13 statute has many, many instances in which it makes it14 clear that in service of the objective of a nationally15 uniform label, the expert agency that approves and16 dictates the language of that label be the one to decide17 what is or isn't --18192021 here?2223 point out 2425JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Waxman --JUSTICE BREYER: Where does it say that?JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- can I ask you onequestiongoing toJUSTICE BREYER: Because you were just where it says that --JUSTICE STEVENS: It goes to your -- JUSTICE BREYER: -- which I think is --34 1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Excuse me.          JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm sorry.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Just let me ask this onequestion.  Supposing the label says, this product containsvitamin A.  Period.  And it doesn't contain vitamin A, andthey prove that in court.  And you say you would have tochange the label.  I suggest you could change the productby putting vitamin A in it.MR. WAXMAN: Well, you can -- you're --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Why isn't that an answer tothe misbranding?  You change the product not necessarilythe label.MR. WAXMAN: Because the difference between a -- that would be a -- a manufacturing defect, which are cases that have been decided --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  It would be a false statementin the label.  The label happened to be false, amisrepresentation in it.          MR. WAXMAN:  If -- if the -- if it contains --I'm sorry.  Was it vitamin A?  If it contains vitamin Abecause that's what the manufacturer intended and that'swhat the manufacturer produced --JUSTICE STEVENS: No. The manufacturer knew it didn't contain it. He falsely put that in thestatement --351111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. WAXMAN: Oh, I see.

I don't know, but if it -- if it requires a8 change in the label, it has to be done by EPA because the9 manufacturer commits a Federal law violation if it sellsor could he change the product?MR. WAXMAN: Well, I believe that you have -- have to -- I mean, would it be efficacious with10 the product with any different label. If you -- if I can11 just direct the Court's attention to --12 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but I'm suggesting he13 could sell the product with the same label if he just14 changed the product to correct the misstatement.15 MR. WAXMAN: Well, the test, as the Fifth16 Circuit stated, Justice Stevens, is whether a judgment17 against Dow -- I'm quoting. Quote: whether a judgment18 against Dow would cause it to need to alter the Strongarm19 label. I'm -- and that's the -- those are -- that's the20 test that 212223 of action24 -- that different labeling be used --25 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but neither --was applied here and is always applied.JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but why --MR. WAXMAN: That is, does the State law cause -- is it premised on a State law duty that there361111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. WAXMAN: -- that is, a little bit different2 than what Federal law requires.3 JUSTICE SOUTER: The problem that I think some4 of -- several of us are having is that both the -- as I5 understand it, the Fifth Circuit test in your argument6 draws no distinction between the two following kinds of7 situations. Situation A: there's something that the8 manufacturer should have told you, should have put on the9 label, but the manufacturer didn't. Situation B: the10 manufacturer puts something on the label which in fact is11 wrong and12 it causes1314 purposes to say if the person who sues sues simply on the15 ground that I bought it in reliance on the label, thein Justice Stevens' example is in fact false andharm.It makes sense, it seems to me, for preemption16 label was false, I should get damages for -- for whatever17 harm was caused, that situation should be dealt with for18 preemption purposes differently from the situation in19 which the -- the manufacturer made no false statement. He20 simply should have said more. And if -- if you don't21 distinguish between those two situations, then the -- the22 prohibition against mislabeling means absolutely nothing23 because -- because it can never be enforced, in effect,24 except with respect to some prospective user. It can25 never be enforced with respect to the actual user. 371111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. WAXMAN: Justice Souter, that is a choice that Congress could have made.

It's -- it's9 welcome to change it, but it -- it's one thing to change10 it. It's another thing to change it and come in to say11 that the question is clear.12 MS. BLATT: Well, we think that -- we realize13 that our position was inconsistent with not only the14 Court's decision in Cipollone and in Medtronic that15 recognizes that requirement extends to common law duties.16 But more importantly, a system where a jury-by-jury on the17 same facts could come up with completely different reasons18 why a label is false --19 JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so if you have one20 administration thinking the one thing and the other21 thinking the other thing, why isn't the answer that the22 agency can promulgate the reg it wants? And therefore if23 the reg -- if the agency comes to that conclusion, let24 them promulgate that reg. And if a different one thinks25 it can work with the tort suits, let them promulgate that401111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 reg.2 MS. BLATT: Well, unlike Medtronic where3 preemption occurred by virtue of the FDA's regulation,4 under FIFRA there's preemption by virtue of the statute5 itself. And I just want to give one --6 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but why isn't there a big7 difference, for purposes of your argument, between the8 Medtronic situation and this one for the simple reason in9 this case you've got a statute that authorizes EPA to do10 absolutely nothing on the subject of efficacy? And EPA11 does nothing on the subject of efficacy.12 MS. BLATT: Well, that's just not true, with all13 due respect. I mean, they -- the -- we don't verify the14 accuracy of the efficacy labeling, but the requirement,15 both in the preemption provision and in the requirement to16 use the EPA label, clearly extends to efficacy.17 And you can have disuniform context whether it's18 safety or efficacy. Imagine a label that directs a19 product to be mixed for 20 minutes. One jury could find20 the label was false because the product should have only21 been mixed for 10 minutes. Another jury in the same22 courthouse could find the label was false because the23 product should have been mixed for at least 30 minutes.24 And this case is another really good example.25 Now the petitioners are saying the label says that the411111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 soil only 23 would not4 to change5 much time6should be a 7.2 level.

If it's a failure to test, if it's a -- adesign defect requirement, if it's an off-labeled, falsemisrepresentation, why are they preempted?MS. BLATT: On the face of the complaint, we agree that they're not preempted. Our only position is by the time it got to summary judgment, the courts decided that they had no evidence on what would have been non- preempted claims. If another farmer wants to bring an expert that says Strongarm can be manufactured --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But then do you endorse thetheory of the Court of Appeals in this case?MS. BLATT: Well, we think the Court of Appeals took it claim by claim and read the affidavit -- or at least the District Court did --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  And you think just mereinducement to change a label is sufficient to createpreemption.MS. BLATT: Mere inducement only to the extent that that's a shorthand way of saying the label was -- necessarily had to be required. Let me give you an example.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  If Congress wanted that, surelyit could have stated it more clearly than simply saying431111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the State shall not impose or continue in effect anyrequirements for labeling or packaging.  A tort suitbecause of -- of mislabeling is not a requirement forlabeling or packaging.MS. BLATT: If the --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And if Congress wanted to saythat, they could have said it.MS. BLATT: Well, I think they did say if a common law duty is necessarily premised on the requirement that the manufacturer used a different label than Federal law required him to use. In this case, the common law duty of a failure to warn is saying the manufacturer should have put something on --JUSTICE SCALIA:  You have -- you have thatwhich talks about requirements for labeling orin conjunction with another provision thatprovisionpackagingauthorizes the State to regulate the sale or use.          MS.

Imagine --19 imagine --20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Give me sale examples.21 MS.

BLATT:  -- that don't go to the labeling.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can they do the same thing by-- through jury verdicts?MS. BLATT: Absolutely not. It would be bad enough if a manufacturer had to shop his label around 50 States and had each --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So now -- so now you say aState can do something by regulation that a jury can't do.          MS. BLATT:  No.  A State absolutely cannotimpose labeling restrictions on a manufacturer.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm asking if the -- if juriescan do anything that the -- are -- are prohibited underyour view from doing anything that the State could do by aState regulation.MS. BLATT: Right. I'm sorry. Right. Under -- it -- the alternative theory would give more power to the jury to impose labeling restrictions than the State, and we don't think the State can do it. And it would be far more pernicious if a label were subject to jury-by-jury invalidation. No one would read the label, much less understand it.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Blatt, there's a brief in-- there's a brief in this case that just showsif not thousands, of crop damage claims.

Youhave to change the label so you can't bring that suit.          MS. BLATT:  Justice Ginsburg, it's just nottrue.  The lower courts well understand this distinction,and they -- they let go all the time claims as notpreempted that are true manufacturing defect or truedesign defect claims.  This is not a complete immunity.This is a narrowly targeted one as to labeling.There is a famous example of the Benlate --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  He says their claim is -- isvery simple.  You didn't tell us that using this in ourkind of soil would stunt the crop and wouldn't kill theweeds.          MS. BLATT:  Right.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you're saying that kindof claim can't be brought anymore.MS. BLATT: It can be brought if there's State law and evidence to support the State law that doesn't attack the labeling. And our --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I've described a set of factswhich your position I think you have to say affects the471111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 label. The -- the farmer says I bought this bottle. It2 said okay for all peanuts. My crop grew and it was3 stunted and the weeds stayed alive.4 MS. BLATT: If they found an expert that said if5 you had manufactured this differently or if you had6 designed it differently and there was evidence to support7 that, our view is that those claims aren't preempted. And8 the alternative to let juries --9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: No. I'm not giving you that10 case. I'm giving you exactly what happened.11 MS. BLATT: This case -- they didn't have any12 evidence other than saying that the label was inaccurate.13 But the next -- another jury could rely on the14 respondent's evidence to say the label was inaccurate15 because it works better on high pH soil, and another jury16 could say, well, we need a margin of safety and the label17 should have said 6.8 instead of 7.0, which is what their18 expert says. And you can have this time and time again19 with how often the pesticide has to be applied, when it20 has to be applied. And to -- and the -- the whole point21 of section 136v(b) was to have reliability --22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was that happening when EPA23 took the opposite view? Was there this tremendous24 disparity with juries going every which way --25 MS.

If I'm the plaintiff, my theory -- the theory8 was you mismanufactured this product. A reasonable9 manufacturer would have taken practices to prevent10 contamination, and it destroyed a lot of crops and EPA11 actually took enforcement action against that12 manufacturer.13 The rat poisoning example -- a 9-year-old kid14 died of rat poisoning because it tasted like a candy bar.15 The theory of recovery was all the manufacturer had to do16 was put a bittering agent in it that would have made the17 kid throw up and the rats still would have loved the18 poisoning. That has nothing to do with the label.19202122232425 the case,491111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Ms. Blatt.You have about 4 minutes.REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C.

We don't know why Congress put the21 word uniformity in. The legislative history is barren.22 It just says this is a technical amendment.

Until EPA had a sudden change of heart, there4 were decades in which juries made these decisions with5 respect to these kinds of products, and those preemption6 decisions really didn't take hold until after this Court7 announced Cipollone in 1992. And it was only at that8 point that the courts began to have preemption, but for9 the previous 2 decades, juries routinely decided these10 kinds of cases. The sky did not fall.
