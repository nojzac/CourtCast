McADAMS                  ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER          MR. McADAMS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:  There are three Democratic principlesat stake in this case.  First, the people may instructtheir legislators.  Second, the people may requestinformation and receive information on the ballot aboutcandidate behavior.  And third, the people may put theinformation called for by Article 8 on the ballot.  Noneof these activities violate any provision of the UnitedStates Constitution.          With regard to the instruct provision first,this is the issue that divided the panel opinion from thedissent.  The instructional provisions are contained inSections 15, 16, and 17, paragraph one, of Missouri'sArticle 8.  The Eighth Circuit said these instructionsviolated Article 5 because the voters were third partiesto the amendment process.  Article 5 doesn't say that.          Article 5 provides a specific mechanism by whichthe Constitution can be amended, and it allocatesfunctions in Article 5 for certain branches of thegovernment to perform.  The exclusion of the people from3                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9any specific one of those functions does not exclude thepeople from the right to communicate to theirrepresentatives that they want the Constitution amended.          QUESTION:  Mr. McAdams, precisely what is theinstruction provision?  You say this is the first of thethree you are talking about?          MR. McADAMS:  Yes.  This is the first of thethree principles that I'm talking about, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Okay.          MR. McADAMS:  And the instruction is physicallycontained in Section 17, paragraph one of the proposedamendment, and it relates to Sections 15 and 16 of theamendment, Your Honor, Section 15 stating the intention ofthe Missouri voters, and Section 16 specifically statingthe proposed constitutional amendment that the voters10111213141516    support.17              QUESTION:  Well, are you arguing to us now on18    the assumption that the instruction standing alone has no19    teeth, no enforcement part, and you are going to get to20    the enforcement part, the teeth part later?21              MR. McADAMS:  That is correct, Your Honor.22    Standing alone, the instructions provisions, these three23    sections, have no teeth.  They are a nonbinding24    instruction.  And as we were instructed by then-Justice25    Rehnquist's opinion in Kimble, the nonbinding instructions4                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9and advice by the voters to a legislature does not violateArticle 5.          QUESTION:  And this is the provision that JudgeHansen voted to uphold?          MR. McADAMS:  That is correct.          QUESTION:  In doing his dissent?          MR. McADAMS:  That is correct, Your Honor.Although I should say, he did not specifically mentionSection 17.1.  He only specifically mentioned 15 and 16.The instruction provision of 17.1 would be included in his          QUESTION:  But part 2 of the Missouriconstitutional Article 8, Section 17, is severable, is it?          MR. McADAMS:  Yes, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  The ballot proposition?          MR. McADAMS:  Yes, Your Honor.  Pursuant toSection 22 of Article 8, any provision the Court wouldfind unconstitutional in Article 8 is severable from the1011    logic.1213141516171819    remainder.202122232425          QUESTION:  And your point is just thatdisregarding for the moment the provision that has toappear on the ballot by a candidate's name, that the restof it doesn't violate Article 5?          MR. McADAMS:  That would be correct, Your Honor.          Moving on to the second principle, Missourians5                                                                                             1    may request information and may receive information on the 2    ballot about congressional candidate behavior.  This Court 3    has indicated and respondents do not contest that states 4    may provide information on the ballot. 5              QUESTION:  I think their argument is that it 6    goes beyond information to the point of putting the thumb 7    on the scale, because essentially it uses pejorative 8    language.  It's doing more than informing. It's saying, 9    you know, these people have, or this person has violated a10    trust.  And that's more than information.  That's a kind11    of conclusion of fault. That seems to be one of the points12    of their objection.  How do you respond to that?13              MR. McADAMS:  Well, Your Honor, there is nothing14    that really goes to point three that I made in my opening,15    that it goes to the specific ballot information and I16    respond to that by saying, there is nothing that provides17    voters valuable information that couldn't be used by those18    voters as the basis for a decision to vote against a19    candidate.  There is no indication in this case, no20    evidence in this case, that voters will be so overwhelmed21    by the information contained in the ballot information22    that they will have the will --23              QUESTION:  Well, it's not -- I don't know that24    they have to make the case that the voters are going to be25    overwhelmed.  The case that they are making is simply that6                                                                                                                                 1    the voters are being given something more than 2    information.  The voters are being given in effect a 3    judgment by the state that the particular candidates have 4    referred to, have done something wrong, and that is more 5    than information. 6              MR. McADAMS:  I simply disagree with that, Your 7    Honor.  The voters are not being given any more than 8    information.  The State of Missouri -- 9              QUESTION:  Mr. McAdams, can you point to any10    other example?  There have been examples in briefs11    certainly of instructions that were given at the time of12    the Constitutional Convention, but this has been labelled13    a Scarlet Letter label.  It's not the same as Democrat and14    Republican.  It says, disregarded voters' instruction.  It15    says, declined to pledge to support.  Are there any other16    such labels that go on a ballot at a time when the17    candidate has no opportunity to answer back?18              MR. McADAMS:  Well, I would say that party19    labels go on the ballot at a time when voters have, I mean20    candidates have no opportunity to respond back. The21    history of the country is such that party labels were22    outcome determinative in numerous congressional districts,23    Your Honor.24              QUESTION:  Well, I asked you, you gave the party25    labels example.  Is there anything comparable to7                                                                                                                                 1    disregarded voters' instruction on issue X, declined to 2    pledge? 3              MR. McADAMS:  Yes, Your Honor. 4              QUESTION:  I don't know of anything comparable5 to that. 6              MR. McADAMS:  There is something comparable, 7    Your Honor.  In the State of Nebraska, in the early 1900s 8    as the people became disaffected with Congress' 9    unwillingness to amend the Constitution to provide for the10    direct election of senators, they placed labels on the11    ballot about whether state legislative candidates --12              QUESTION:  Oh, but that's state legislative13    candidates, and that's different.  There is no federal14    Constitutional control, except perhaps there might be a15    First Amendment argument, but we are talking about here --16    whatever the state wants to do vis-a-vis state17    legislatures is different from what they can do, vis-a-vis18    people who are in a national body and when they are there,19    they are representing all the people.20              MR. McADAMS:  Well, First Amendment is one of21    the claims that they make, Your Honor, and the First22    Amendment claim would equally be evadable to a situation23    like the State of Nebraska did.  We would not have, for24    example, a Qualifications Clause analysis that would apply25    to the state.8                                                                                                                                          QUESTION:  Well, do you have any other exampleof someone running for federal office, the House or theSenate, where there is such a label?          MR. McADAMS:  I believe there -- not exactlylike this label, Your Honor.  There are situations wherefederal candidates have, for example, their address1234567    disclosed.8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  I think in Arizona, at least at onetime, candidates for the Senate and the House ofRepresentatives had to say they were pledged to recall,which meant that if the state legislature recalled them,they would have to resign.  Because they all pledged, andof course, it never happened, so --          MR. McADAMS:  I was not aware of that example,Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Excuse me.  And that was shown on theballot in Arizona as well?          MR. McADAMS:  I'm not aware of that, Your Honor.          The rules would seem to provide states, theelection clause would seem to provide states anopportunity to place information on the ballot.          QUESTION:  Well, doesn't the information, giventhe courts' cases here anyway, have to be generallyapplicable and evenhanded, like all the regulation becauseif it's not, that's -- I mean, that phrase comes from a9                                                                                             1    case called Anderson, but there are many of like tenor, it 2    seems to me, that if it's not generally applicable and 3    evenhanded, the state, for no legitimate regulatory 4    interest, is biasing the election, which, which hurts the 5    First Amendment rights of all those who happen to think 6    that term limits is not the most important issue in the 7    election, that would prefer the election were decided on 8    the basis of other issues. 9              MR. McADAMS:  Well --10              QUESTION:  Whatever.  The economy.  The11    environment.  Whatever.12              MR. McADAMS:  There is nothing about providing13    information that dictates that it is the basis upon which14    voters will choose.15              QUESTION:  Well, of course, that's generally16    true, and it's for that reason that when we get down to17    the ballot itself, which normally, regulation of the18    ballot is not for information providing purposes.  It is19    for fair vote purposes. And that's why it seems to me that20    these cases have held when we come down to ballot21    regulation, what we are interested in is whether the22    state's regulation is generally applicable and evenhanded.23              MR. McADAMS:  Well, I think Timmons used the24    phrase reasonable.  The state could enact reasonable25    regulations.10                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Yes.  Reasonable in terms of suchpurposes as the integrity of the electoral process,preventing voter confusion, ensuring orderliness, andensuring fairness.  Now, not, I haven't seen anything thatsays reasonable in terms of providing information aboutone issue but not other issues.          MR. McADAMS:  Well, Your Honor, right now, wehave a situation where the state only provides informationabout party affiliation.          QUESTION:  Party affiliation is not -- thecandidate, I take it, voluntarily associates himself withthat and wants that on the ballot.          MR. McADAMS:  Some do and some don't.  In thehistory --          QUESTION:  Well, are there instances where theaffiliation was put on the ballot over the objection ofthe candidate?          MR. McADAMS:  There are no cases in that regard,Your Honor.          QUESTION:  I suppose in most of the south, untilmaybe 25 years ago, I'm sure the Republican would not havewanted his name on the ballot.          MR. McADAMS:  I'm quite certain in the south.          QUESTION:  For his party affiliation on it.          MR. McADAMS:  I'm quite certain that is true,11                                                                                             1    Your Honor, and I think that's true for third party 2    candidates today as well.  In the example that the 3    respondents give about the one time this was done in 4    California, they give an example where a state legislative 5    candidate who had won a plurality in the party primary 6    came back in the run-off election and lost to someone who 7    did not have a label.  It seems that what respondents are 8    offended by there is that the party label designation was 9    not the piece of information that controlled the electoral10 result.11              QUESTION:  You can argue about whether a party12    label is generally applicable and evenhanded. So my13    question is, are you accepting the principle, but saying14    that this label is just as evenhanded as a party label, or15    are you denying the principle?16              MR. McADAMS:  I'm not denying the principle that17    the state cannot mislead voters.18              QUESTION:  That wasn't the principle.  The19    principle I'm reading from the cases, which I have said a20    lot of times, I just want to see if you accept it,21    generally applicable and evenhanded.22              MR. McADAMS:  And I believe this is generally23    applicable.24 25          QUESTION:  You accept the principle and theissue of whether this is evenhanded?12                                                                                             1              MR. McADAMS:  I am not aware of any basis for 2    disputing that principle, Your Honor. 3              QUESTION:  Do you say that it's evenhanded? 4              MR. McADAMS:  I do, Your Honor. 5              QUESTION:  Could you call it the Scarlet Letter? 6              MR. McADAMS:  I don't call it the Scarlet 7    Letter, Your Honor.  People who apply a pejorative label 8    to this enactment call it a Scarlet Letter. 9              QUESTION:  Could a Republican state label a10    Democrat dirty Democrats?11              MR. McADAMS:  No, Your Honor.12              QUESTION:  No?  Well, isn't that about what they13    are doing here.  Disregarded.  Refused to pledge or14    declined to pledge.  That's why we get into the Scarlet15    Letter analysis.  We would be in a Scarlet Letter analysis16    if the Republicans said dirty Democrats.  I don't see17    where you are going to draw the line.18              MR. McADAMS:  Well, in that situation the state19    is expressing a judgment on the candidate that actually20    invades the province of the voter.  Here we are not doing21    that.  There are eight specific behaviors that are being22    evaluated.23 24 25          QUESTION:  How does that invade the province ofthe voter in a way that is not true here? I mean, what'sthe distinction?13                                                                                            1              MR. McADAMS:  Well, the distinction is that that2    amounts to, in my mind, a recommendation to vote against3    the candidate.  It would be as if in this case we instead4    of using the label disregarded voters' instructions5    concerning term limits for this same behavior, we use the6    phrase traitor.  That is misleading.  It would essentially7    take away, I believe, and overbear the will of the voter8    if they believe they were voting for a candidate who was a9 traitor.10111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Well, if you are trying to tell usthat this does not disadvantage the candidate in any way,I just find that very difficult to accept.          MR. McADAMS:  And that is not what I'm saying,Your Honor.  This may disadvantage some candidates withsome voters.          QUESTION:  But on your theory, I suppose --          QUESTION:  But then it's not neutral.          MR. McADAMS:  Well, it's just as neutral asparty labels, because party labels disadvantagecandidates.  It is the equivalent --          QUESTION:  Do you know any state that requiresyou to put your party affiliation on the ballot when yourparty affiliation is not the reason you are on the ballot?          MR. McADAMS:  I do not know of any state thatdoes that, Your Honor.14                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  In other words, you can get on theballot without a party affiliation, if you acquire enoughsignatures, right?          MR. McADAMS:  Yes.  That's correct, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  But the state ballots have lines forthe major parties that in the last election got enoughvotes, so the reason they show that is they are showingyou why you are on the ballot, and if you are on theballot for some other reason, you think they could makesomebody who got on the ballot by popular referendum orsignatures, you think they could make him declare a partyaffiliation shown next to his name?          MR. McADAMS:  No, Your Honor.  I don't believe I          QUESTION:  That's right.1011121314    could.151617    were to uphold this kind of a provision, whether it18    wouldn't then be possible for a state to have by19    initiative or referendum a similar provision saying that20    we instruct our members of Congress that they are to21    support a constitutional amendment allowing prayer in22    schools, or a constitutional amendment reversing an23    abortion decision, or any other hot button issue where the24    voters of the state decide they are going to instruct25    members of Congress, and then under your theory, I15                                                                                                                                QUESTION:  I'd like to ask you whether if we123456    right?7suppose, a provision could be inserted on the ballotopposite the name of any candidate who refuses to expressa position or disavow that position that --                MR. McADAMS:  That is --                QUESTION:   -- informs the voters; is that 9    set forth the specific Constitutional provision that they10    wanted enacted and the behaviors that they wanted to be11    evaluated, so that there was no --12              QUESTION:  It certainly would change the13    election process as we have known it, wouldn't it?14              MR. McADAMS:  Well, in footnote four of Foster15    versus Love, this Court left open the question of whether16    or not states must use conventional means to hold17    elections.  But I submit to you that we already know the18    answer to that question.  And we know it because the way19    in which ballots have been distributed has changed20    throughout history. Initially, we started out with nothing21    but write-in ballots.  Then parties were actually around22    printing up ballots for people to cast and using that23    mechanism to control and buy elections, and the states24    came up with a mechanism which allowed the states to25    prepare the ballot.  So there is nothing that requires us16                                                                                                                                               MR. McADAMS:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.  Yes. That8    is correct, if they did it through this mechanism, they 1    to use the conventional method. 2              QUESTION:  But Mr. McAdams, the point has been 3    made very forcefully that this is a national legislature. 4    And you are saying you could freight down someone from a 5    state with all kinds of policies that may be preferred by 6    that state and that person would be laden with those 7    obligations, even though he or she is now a member of a 8    national, as opposed to a state body. 9              MR. McADAMS:  Well, Your Honor, first of all, I10    don't think they are obligations.  I think they are11    instructions, and they are nonbinding instructions.12              QUESTION:  But the list of things that the13    person is supposed to do if you are going to be faithful14    to that pledge, you have to do all those things.  You have15    to sponsor these measures, and you have to urge other16    people to join you, and you have to take a very active17 role.18              MR. McADAMS:  Your Honor, you only have to19    propose if it's not otherwise been proposed.  You only20    have to sponsor if it's not otherwise been sponsored.  And21    there is nothing in the instructions that require you to22    speak in favor of this proposed amendment.23              QUESTION:  But that interferes with the basic24    point, that the relation between the congressmen and the25    people is one that's direct and does not involve17                                                                                                                                 1    intervention by the state.  We have two sets of relations 2    in the federal system, each with its own duties and 3    responsibilities.  One is between the Federal Government 4    and the citizen without the intervention of the state. 5    The other is between the state and the citizen without the 6    intervention of the Federal Government, except in certain 7    instances where an accommodation has to be made like 8    regulation of time, place and manner of elections, but 9    those are neutral.10              MR. McADAMS:  But this doesn't interfere with11    that relationship, Your Honor.  The only thing this does12    is allows voters --1314 it. 1516    allows the people to evaluate candidate behavior.  We have17    in our country a tradition now where legislative18    candidates obfuscate their record to the point where it is19    difficult for the electorate to determine what they have20    done.2122232425QUESTION:  But it seeks to alter and to regulateMR. McADAMS:  I disagree, Your Honor. This only          QUESTION:  But the purpose of doing this is tocontrol the conduct of the Congressman in office, and Isubmit to you, there is simply no authority for the stateto do that.  The voters can certainly do that.MR. McADAMS:  The last sentence of Section 16,                  18                                       1    we, the people of the State of Missouri, have chosen to 2    amend the state Constitution to inform the voters 3    regarding incumbent and nonincumbent federal candidate 4    support for the proposed amendment.  This is an 5    informational provision to the voters, so that they can 6    evaluate candidate behavior, and this is information they 7    have asked for.  This is the kind of information that 8    could seriously improve the ability of the citizens to 9    engage in an educated electoral decision, and could10    combat, I think rather effectively, voter disillusionment11    with the system.12              QUESTION:  What about, there are a number of13    districts within Missouri where the people were not in14    favor of this proposition.  And if the person is supposed15    to represent, disregard voters' instruction, he might not16    have disregarded the voters' instructions from his17    district.  His district may have been overwhelmingly18    against this proposal.19              MR. McADAMS:  This proposal passed in every20    congressional district in the State of Missouri.  Now21    there are 28 counties that it did not pass in.22              QUESTION:  All right.  Someone is from one of23    those counties.24              MR. McADAMS:  Well, the Federal Government25    through the elections clause tells the states that the19                                                                                                                                 1    state regulates the ballot.  It is not inappropriate, 2    then, for the state to have consistent regulations across 3    the state regarding that proposal, Your Honor. 4              QUESTION:  But I -- Justice Ginsburg posed a 5    hypothetical that I'm interested in.  Suppose that, 6    hypothetical case, in a congressional district, the voters 7    are overwhelmingly against a certain proposition and a 8    state Constitution has this label providing they be 9    notified that they have voted to the contrary.  What10 result?11              MR. McADAMS:  The same result would apply12    because the elections --13              QUESTION:  So you are, you are allowing the14    state as an entity to interfere with the relations between15    the Congressman, the Congresswoman, and those people in16    the district.17              MR. McADAMS:  That's not true, Your Honor.18    Because if the people in that district voted against term19    limits, they will take a look at this ballot information20    and they will not use it as a rational basis to vote21    against a candidate unless their opinion has changed.  If22    their opinion has changed, then they will use this23    information.  But it does not interfere with the24    relationship.25 QUESTION:  Certainly state legislatures before                   20                                      1    the 17th amendment, if that was the one that provided for2    direct election of senators, communicated a great deal3    with their senators.4              MR. McADAMS:  Absolutely, Your Honor. There is a5    lot of historical evidence that state legislators6    instructed the state senators.  In fact, the first --7              QUESTION:  You mean federal senators, well,8    senators from the state.9              MR. McADAMS:  Yes.  Senators from the state10    impacted federal senators, and in fact, that is the11    mechanism in large part which propelled the first 1012    amendments and the 11th amendment to passage. After the13    enactment of Article 5, the states directed that those be14    passed.  Eight of the original 13 colonies issued such15    instructions for one of those 11 amendments.16              QUESTION:  This just applies to Congress17    persons, though, doesn't it?  It doesn't apply to18    senators.19              MR. McADAMS:  No.  It applies to both, Your20    Honor.212223242521                                                                                                                                QUESTION:  Oh, it does.          QUESTION:  There is something about this, theperception, say, of a voter.  We very carefully limit thespeech that's possible as you are approaching the poll.No electioneering by the polls.  And this Court has upheld 1    that against First Amendment challenge, and yet when they 2    get into the voting booth, this thing juts out at them in 3    capital letters, and that somehow seems inconsistent with 4    our notion that the voters should not be bombarded with 5    slogans for or against whatever issue when they go into 6    that ballot. 7              MR. McADAMS:  Well, we have -- we have -- the 8    Court has held that elections -- pardon me -- people 9    cannot politic within so many feet of the polling place,10    Your Honor.  That is true.  But the Court has never held11    that the people cannot have the information in the voting12    booth with them that they want.13              QUESTION:  We haven't held that people can't14    politic.  We have held that if a state doesn't want people15    to politic, it's okay.16              MR. McADAMS:  That is true, Your Honor.17              QUESTION:  In your view, could they, in addition18    to what's in the capital letters, could they add in the19    following respects, and then quote the paragraphs that20    were the failures, the basis for it?                MR. McADAMS:  Yes.  I believe they could, Your                MR. McADAMS:  Do federal congressmen take such                                  22                                                                                                                                2122    Honor.232425          QUESTION:  Does, in Missouri, do congressmentake an oath to uphold the state Constitution?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425an oath?          QUESTION:  No.  Do congressmen and senators inMissouri take an oath to uphold the state Constitution?          MR. McADAMS:  I'm not aware that federalrepresentatives and senators do that, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  I would be very surprised if thestate could impose that requirement.          MR. McADAMS:  I think that is true.          QUESTION:  Well, doesn't that prove the pointhere?  That the state simply cannot interfere with therelation between the congressmen and the voters directly?          MR. McADAMS:  Absolutely not, Your Honor. Thereis nothing that would suggest that the state couldn't askfederal congressmen to take such a pledge, and if theyfailed to do so, report that they declined to take such apledge.  The federal candidates --          QUESTION:  You think that the, that the statecan require congressmen and senators to support the stateConstitution by an oath?          MR. McADAMS:  I think they can ask them if theywill.  If I could reserve the remainder of my time.          QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. McAdams. Mr. Franklin,we will hear from you.           ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN                  ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT23                                                                                             1              MR. FRANKLIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 2    please the Court.  The State of Missouri has attempted to 3    use its control over the ballot to determine the issues 4    upon which federal elections will be decided and to 5    influence voters to vote against candidates who do not 6    support a state preferred political viewpoint. 7              QUESTION:  I don't know that that's true about 8    simply the 17-1 provision that Judge Hansen thought was 9    permissible, where it's simply the legislature instructs10    members of Congress to try to push for a term limits11    amendment.  Nothing appears on the ballot at all.12              MR. FRANKLIN:  Two points, Your Honor. First,13    clarification.  Judge Hansen did not find that to be14    constitutional.15              QUESTION:  Oh, I thought he did.16              MR. FRANKLIN:  No.  On page A-23 of the appendix17    to the petition, Judge Hansen clearly stated that he18    agreed with the majority that Sections 17, 18, and 19 were19    unconstitutional.  He differed as to whether 15 and 16,20    which is essentially the preamble, could be severed.  The21    severance question, Your Honor, is not before the Court.22    It was addressed by the Court of Appeals.  It has been23    waived.  The petitioner could have chosen if it had wanted24    to present that issue in its petition or its brief.  It25    did not, and perhaps the reason it did not is the question24                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425of severability is predominantly one of state law as towhether under Missouri state law various provisions wouldbe severable from one another, whether the voters wouldhave voted for a preamble that didn't do anything.  Thatis a question of state law.          It was not presented in the petition.  It wasnot presented in the brief.  If the Court had beenpresented with it, it's likely the Court would decline toconsider a question of state law such as that one.          QUESTION:  Well let me ask you this, then. Doyou think that the provision that instructs members ofMissouri's congressional delegation to use their powers topass an amendment is, stands on the same footing as theones that are, that are printed on the ballot?          MR. FRANKLIN:  We believe first that it standstogether with this law.  If, in a hypothetical --          QUESTION:  I mean constitutionally.          MR. FRANKLIN:  The answer is if there were a,just instruction, nothing else, which is not what thiscase is about, if there were, we would argue in such acase that it would be in that case an impermissiblechilling effect on speech.          QUESTION:  Well, but why can't that provision besevered from the other two?          MR. FRANKLIN:  The principal reason is because                            25                                                                                             1    the severance question is not before the Court.  If -- 2              QUESTION:  Well, but the Petitioner argues here 3    that the Court of Appeals was wrong right across the board 4    in throwing these out.  Now, if we were to conclude that 5    the Court of Appeals was wrong on one, but right on the 6    other two, that certainly is fairly raised by the7 petition. 8              MR. FRANKLIN:  I would say not, Your Honor, and 9    for the reason that the severability issue is one of state10    law.  However, if --11              QUESTION:  Well, why couldn't we say the12    dissenter was right on that point.  He said Article 15 and13    16.  Not 17.1, as you pointed out.  But why wouldn't it be14    open to us to say the dissenter was right on that point?15              MR. FRANKLIN:  I think it would be open to the16    Court, had the issue been raised and briefed and we had17    briefed the question under Missouri state law as to what,18    what is or is not severable.  However, one also needs to19    look at the remedy in this case. The remedy is not that20    certain provisions are excised from the Constitution.21    What the remedy says is the State of Missouri is enjoined22    from implementing or enforcing the provisions of the23    Constitution, including Section 17, which contains both24    the instructions and the labels through which they are25    enforced.  This Court need only affirm that judgment.26                                                                                                                                 1              QUESTION:  But if we agree with some of the 2    reasons they gave, that is, that some of the provisions 3    are bad, but we think that some of the other ones are 4    good, why -- we don't necessarily have to reach the 5    severability point ourselves.  Why couldn't we remand and 6    leave it to the lower court to decide the severability 7    question in light of our disagreement with them that all 8    the provisions they said were unconstitutional were? 9              MR. FRANKLIN:  Because the Court would be10    reaching the severability issue in that case and remanding11 it to --12              QUESTION:  No, we wouldn't.  We would be saying13    that we find that this is a difficult case. Some of these14    provisions withstand constitutional attack.  Others don't.15    Let me remand it for you and then can you figure out the16 state law.17              MR. FRANKLIN:  But the Court of Appeals did18    address the severability question.  In the last footnote19    of its appeal, it held --20              QUESTION:  But I think several of us feel that21    it isn't really an issue of severability that we would22    decide here.  We would simply say we disagree with one23    phase of the Court of Appeals opinion on the24    constitutional issue, we agree on two others or three25    others, and send it back to the Court of Appeals. You27                                                                                                                                 1    affirm in part and reverse in part without necessarily 2    getting to severability here. 3              MR. FRANKLIN:  Well, let me then get into why 4    the Court, if the Court were just to consider the 5    instruction provision standing alone, which I understand 6    is the issue that was raised, we would argue, for the 7    first time today, if the Court were to, just to consider 8    that, it would have to hold that contrary to Judge 9    Bartlett's decision in this case, the instructions10    provisions can be implemented or enforced, which is the11    injunction that this Court, we are asking the Court to12 affirm.13              QUESTION:  No.  Would you tell us whether in14    your view --15              MR. FRANKLIN:  Yes.16              QUESTION:  In a hypothetical case.17              MR. FRANKLIN:  Yes.18              QUESTION:  A state can simply instruct its19    federal representatives, congressmen and senators, that it20    wants them to work for a particular objective.  That's all21    it says.  It seems to me that's a classic right of22    petition on the part of the people.23              MR. FRANKLIN:  No, it is not.  And it would be24    in our view a violation of the Constitution. It would be25    unprecedented and we have uncovered no historical evidence28                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425to show that any, it has ever been tried before that aninstruction to a representative to vote and take otherlegislative activities in a particular manner --          QUESTION:  But certainly there was muchinstruction to the senators at one time.          MR. FRANKLIN:  The difference here, and it's animportant difference, is this instruction is codified aslaw, is given the force of legal command, it is in theMissouri Constitution.  Every person in this --          QUESTION:  Let's say they use the word advice.We wish, we, the legislature of the State of Missouri,wish our representatives to know that we think they shouldwork for the following objectives, term limits, whatever.          MR. FRANKLIN:  It would be different, YourHonor.  And we have a quote from George Washington in ourbrief in which --          QUESTION:  So the difference is betweeninstruction and advice?          MR. FRANKLIN:  Yes, Your Honor.  And GeorgeWashington said, and it's quoted at page 29 of our brief,he said the sense -- with regard to instructionsspecifically, he said the sense, but not the law of thedistrict may be given.  It is different to say we advisethat you do this.          QUESTION:  In what capacity was George                            29                                                                                             1    Washington speaking? 2              MR. FRANKLIN:  He was in that case writing a 3    letter to his nephew who was a future justice of this 4    Supreme Court, Bushrod Washington.  But he said that, and 5    we are not saying that that is a principle of law, but the 6    reasoning applies here and it applies for the following 7    reason.  People take seriously their obligations to follow 8    the law.  And I think that applies perhaps even more 9    strongly to members of Congress.  A member of Congress who10    is faced with a law that says we hereby instruct you as a11    matter of Missouri constitutional law, codified as a12    provision of law, given the force of legal command to do13    this act in Congress.14              QUESTION:  But it's not a legal command. I mean,15    if you are -- you don't have to say it's binding.  If it's16    a nonbinding instruction, it's not an instruction.  I17    mean, you can call it an instruction.  Is that the vice of18    this thing, misusing the word instruct, as opposed to19    advise, even though everybody knows and they acknowledge20    here that there is no enforceable mechanism on the21    instruct?2223 24 25          MR. FRANKLIN:  And all we are asking this Courtto do is to, as Judge Bartlett did, say that the state maynot implement or enforce the provision.          QUESTION:  May I get -- the only implementation                            30                                                                                             1    or enforcement that I'm aware of is the implementation or 2    enforcement in the form of the ballot statements; is that3 correct? 4              MR. FRANKLIN:  That is correct.  And they are -- 5              QUESTION:  So that our case boils down to 6    whether in the whole context, all the provisions in the 7    Constitution, may the state include these, as you put it, 8    ballot disparagements.  That's the only issue before us? 9              MR. FRANKLIN:  Yes.  No.  The issue, the issue10    before the Court is whether as the Court of Appeals held,11    Article 8 of the Constitution may not be implemented or12    enforced.  Again, the Court held that.13              QUESTION:  Right.  The only implementation or14    enforcement that we are dealing with, and that the court15    below dealt with, was the ballot statements?16              MR. FRANKLIN:  That is correct.  And Judge17    Bartlett was correct when he said that the remedy is, we18    hereby enjoin the state from implementing or enforcing19    Article 7, Section 17, which contains both the20    instructions and the enforcement.  To take a hypothetical,21    if a law came before this Court where at Section whatever22    of the statute and Section -- subsection A said no person23    may criticize the president, subsection B said anyone who24    violates subsection A will be given a $1,000 fine.  The25    remedy of such a case would be, as the remedy was here, to31                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9      enjoin or enforce, to enjoin the enforcement or      implementation of such a statute.  That is all we are      asking the Court to affirm in this case.                QUESTION:  Let me get this straight because      apparently, something may turn up that I don't fully      understand.  Was there an injunction against -- was the      part that simply we have been talking about, instructs or      advise, was that declared invalid?                MR. FRANKLIN:  There was no declaratory judgment      in this case.  There was simply an injunction.                QUESTION:  Well then, does the injunction have      any consequence with respect to that provision of the      Missouri Constitution?                MR. FRANKLIN:  Which provision, Your Honor?  I'm                QUESTION:  The provision that simply says the17    legislature instructs.18              MR. FRANKLIN:  Yes.  It is a consequence that19    they may not implement or enforce that provision.  The way20    they do it, as Justice Souter mentioned, was -- is through21    the instructions, through the labels.  And the labels we22    believe are unconstitutional for the principal reason that23    they exceed the state's limited delegated authority under24    the elections clause to regulate only the times, places25    and manners of holding federal elections.32                                                                                                                                101112131415    sorry.165 6 7 8 9          MR. FRANKLIN:  Certainly, Your Honor.  Adecision by this Court that an instruction to a sittingmember of Congress to vote in a certain way may beimplemented or enforced, we believe would be contrary tothe Constitution.  It would violate the First Amendment.It would be a chilling effect on speech.          QUESTION:  But what if Missouri had done nothingbut pass that part which said we instruct senators and --there is no known prospect of enforcement at all.          MR. FRANKLIN:  We would argue in such a casethat it would contravene the First Amendment because itwould be a chilling effect on speech for the reasonsessentially that George Washington stated, which is thatthe sense, but not the law of the district, may be given.This is unprecedented. We are not aware of any --          QUESTION:  But it wouldn't be the law. There isno enforcement mechanism.          MR. FRANKLIN:  It would still be the law, Your          QUESTION:  It seems to me, though, we get a lot,we used to get a lot of things that we call upon our33                                                                                            1011121314151617181920212223    Honor.2425          QUESTION:  And I suppose you would say that theinjunction has importance and continuing significance inthe event the legislature attempts some other means of1234    enforcement?1    delegation in Congress to declare this National Pork Week.2    I mean, there are a lot of those.  They are always passing3    things like that in state legislatures.  Are all those4    unconstitutional?5 6 7 8 9                MR. FRANKLIN:  No.  But they do not as --                QUESTION:  But if they said we insist that you      call this National Pork Week, I don't know if it's      National Pork Week or National Port Week, but regardless,      a lot of them come in.  Now you're saying if they use the      word insist, that it's unconstitutional?                MR. FRANKLIN:  We are saying if they use the      word instruct.  But the word, the instructions are just,      are not --                QUESTION:  You don't have to reach that in this                MR. FRANKLIN:  No.  No.  We do not.  And the17    reason is because the instructions are part and parcel of18    the law which the Court of Appeals has said stand or falls19    on its own, and the principal reason that the law as a20    whole falls is because it does exceed the state's neutral21    power to serve as a, an administrator of federal elections22    and instead has the state putting its thumb on the23    electoral scale.24              QUESTION:  Tell us about party labels, Democrat25    and Republican?34                                                                                                                                101112131415    case?16 1              MR. FRANKLIN:  Yes.  The reason that party 2    labels would be permissible generally speaking is because 3    they are integrally related to the conduct, the orderly 4    conduct of an election which itself is organized around 5    party lines.  In Missouri, as in elsewhere, one does not 6    come to be on the ballot strictly as an individual, but 7    rather as the nominee in most instances of a party.  It 8    would be a different case if the state, and I understand 9    it to be conceded here, if the state said to an individual10    who had achieved a ballot spot as an independent, that11    nevertheless, that person must disclose that they are, for12    example, a member of the communist party or the socialist13    party.  That would not be related to the orderly conduct14    of an election organized around party lines because that15    would not have anything to do with how the person got on16    the ballot.17              Second, a party label unlike the labels in this18    case, a neutral requirement that all party labels be19    listed is not related to the content of any individual's20    views on an issue.  Any connotation that the voters draw21    between parties and viewpoints is imperfect at best, but22    more important, it's a connotation that the party and the23    candidate voluntarily associate themselves with in the24    process of running in an election which itself is25    organized around party lines.35                                                                                                                                 1              Here, by contrast, the labels are both content 2    and viewpoint based.  They are content based because they 3    single out only one issue, term limits, and say to the 4    voters, that is the issue that we deem to be most 5    important of your consideration, most worthy of your 6    consideration.  And second, even worse, they are viewpoint 7    discriminatory.  They are viewpoint discriminatory because 8    the state is singling out one side of the issue and is 9    labeling only one side and it is doing it in such a way10    that it is telling the voters that this person has11    disregarded or failed, pledged to follow a policy which12    the state deems to be the correct one.  And --13              QUESTION:  I take it your First Amendment14    argument is an alternative argument to the first argument15    that the state simply lacks the power to do this?16              MR. FRANKLIN:  Yes.  The first argument is the17    state lacks the power.  It is an alternative argument18    under the First Amendment.  It relies on many of the same19    principles, however.  The elections clause is a limited20    delegation of authority to regulate only the times, the21    places, the manners of holding federal elections.22              QUESTION:  That particular argument wasn't put23    before Judge Bartlett.  It was before the Eighth Circuit.24    Am I right about that?25              MR. FRANKLIN:  No, Your Honor.  It was put36                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425before Judge --          QUESTION:  The election clause was put before --          MR. FRANKLIN:  Yes.  Yes.          QUESTION:  He didn't rule -- Bartlett didn'trule on that?          MR. FRANKLIN:  Yes, he did, Your Honor. One canfind the ruling at pages A-42 and 43 of the appendix ofthe petition, and A-45 and 46.          QUESTION:  Was an issue ever -- just a technicalpoint.  Was an issue ever made of the fact that the, whatwas objected to here was done by a constitutionalamendment rather than by the legislature which the clauseitself refers to?          MR. FRANKLIN:  No, Your Honor.  That was notraised below, but it has been raised by all parties inthis Court and has been briefed by all parties in thisCourt, but it was not raised below.          QUESTION:  May I ask before you are finished, isa threshold standing question with respect to the initialPlaintiff here.  In short, he said in the end, I'm gettingout because of Gephardt, I don't want to be a competitorof Gephardt, so this is beside the point as to Gralike?          MR. FRANKLIN:  Gralike.  Yes.  The Court, webelieve that that case would still be capable ofrepetition, yet evading review under this Court's37                                                                                             1    precedents.  However, Mr. Harman did intervene as a 2    respondent on appeal.  Mr. Harman has the same interests 3    as Mr. Gralike. 4              QUESTION:  I noticed in his affidavit that he is 5    running for the election in 2000.  I assume that's 6    tomorrow.  He doesn't -- or am I wrong?  But he doesn't 7    say that he, as in Golden versus Wickler, that he intends 8    to run again and it's likely that he will run again. 9              MR. FRANKLIN:  Two points.  First, Your Honor,10    he did run.  He was not successful in the primary.  He11    does intend to run again.  He has run in the past.  He12    intends to run again.  But the Court's --13              QUESTION:  But is that in the affidavit before14    the Court?  That's your representation to us now?15              MR. FRANKLIN:  It's my representation, but the16    Court's elections cases make clear that that is not a17    requirement in the Court's elections cases, and those are18    the cases that we have cited in our brief at footnote one,19    I believe in this context.  But in any event, I will20    represent to you that he does intend to run again.21              The state, as this Court has held, has the22    authority under the elections clause to enact procedural23    or mechanical regulations that are nondiscriminatory,24    evenhanded and politically neutral.  It does not have the25    delegated power to single out one issue which it deems38                                                                                                                                1    more worthy of voter consideration than others or to2    disadvantage candidates who hold disfavored views on that3    issue.45678910111213141516171819202122232425          The State of Missouri, purportedly to maintainthe integrity and the neutrality and the sanctity of theelectoral process, prohibits candidates and theirsupporters from expressing any views to the voters within25 feet of the polling place.  Yet the state itself nowseeks to be inside the voting booth to inject its ownpreferred views and viewpoints on the ballot.  Such amanipulation of the ballot would in our view, if upheld,seriously undermine the system of free and fair Democraticelections that sets this nation apart from so many othersin the world.  Thank you.          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Franklin. Ms.Underwood, we'll hear from you.          Ms. Underwood, Section 1 of Section 17 says wethe voters of Missouri hereby instruct each member of ourcongressional delegation to use all of his or herdelegated powers to pass the congressional term limitsamendment set forth above.  If that stood by itself, wouldthat have any constitutional flaw?           ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD     ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,                 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT39                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MS. UNDERWOOD:  Mr. Chief Justice, that woulddepend on the meaning of instruct.  If it were binding lawand unlawful for a Congressman to disobey it, then itwould have many of the same flaws as this statute.  If itwere advisory, then it would not, but we know --          QUESTION:  How do you determine whether it --          MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, one of the problems --          QUESTION:  I mean, suppose there is just nosanction for it.  We instruct you to do it, but there isno sanction whatever.          MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, the question would bewhether it was meant to have binding effect, and whether,for instance, the legislature might, somebody might seekmandamus to enforce it, whether it was seen as enforceableor not.          QUESTION:  Not enforceable.  It's not1011121314151617    enforceable.1819202122232425          MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, if it's completelyunenforceable, I think you are saying it is advisory, inwhich case --          QUESTION:  Well, but it says instruct.          MS. UNDERWOOD:  Instruct is a word that can havemany meanings and if it means advisory, then I think itwould not be objectionable, but we --          QUESTION:  It doesn't mean advisory.  I mean, we                            40                                                                                             1    really mean it.  We instruct you, but you know, if you 2    don't do it, there is nothing we can do about it. 3              MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, if you can say that the 4    legislator was a lawbreaker, violated the law, did 5    something unlawful, if that's the meaning of instruct -- 6              QUESTION:  Well, you can say he didn't take the 7    instructions, if you consider that to be a violation of8 the law. 9              MS. UNDERWOOD:  That's a different point. In10    Prince, this Court looked to instructions to sheriffs, for11    which there was no enforcement, and treated those as12    binding.  I think the question would be what that13    hypothetical statute, which we don't have before us,14    means.  This statute we know Missouri meant to make15    enforceable.  We know that because it created an16    enforcement mechanism, and so the difficult question that17    you put, which would require determining what that18    hypothetical statute meant, isn't here.19              QUESTION:  Is it accurate to call it an20    enforcement mechanism?  I mean, usually you enforce laws21    by punishing people who break them.  You send them to22    jail.  You do this or that.  Here, the punishment is23    simply telling people that you ignored the instruction.24    Is that a punishment?  I mean, leaving aside the, you25    know, the pejorative manner in which the announcement is41                                                                                                                                 1    made, if all you are doing is telling the people he chose 2    not to take on instructions. 3              MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, it's still the case that 4    it's, that it's an enforcement, one, because of the 5    pejorative language, which you have asked me to set aside, 6    but is present here.  Two, because it is a decision by the 7    state legislature to focus the attention of the voters and 8    judge candidates on a single issue.  And three, because it 9    is done in the voting booth and not in a public forum10    where there is an opportunity to respond and to debate, so11    it is an effort, it has the intended purpose and the12    effect of disadvantaging a class of candidates, and that's13    something this Court said in term limits that the state14    cannot use its elections clause authority to do.  It15    interferes with, as Justice Kennedy said, the direct16    relationship between the national government and its17 citizens.18              There is no other example of an effort to19    enforce an instruction with ballot labels in the case of a20    federal senator or representative, except for the -- the21    only one we have been able to find is the Arizona recall22    pledge.  That went off the ballot in 1973.  There is still23    a request to pledge, but it is no longer enforced by a24    ballot instruction.  And of course, it doesn't involve a25    position on an issue. It doesn't involve a commitment to42                                                                                                                                take a position on a particular issue in the legislature.          QUESTION:  No.  But it involves a commission tosimply give up your job if the legislature recalls it.          MS. UNDERWOOD:  It does.  It's unique, as far aswe have been able to tell, in the, in the history and thelaws of this country, and it has never come before the1234567    Court.8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Mr. McAdams' point was that the FirstAmendment arguments would apply equally to any stateelection.  So then if, if that's important, thedistinction you just drew, then I guess we are left with atime, place and manner clause.          MS. UNDERWOOD:  Yes, I think the principal, theprincipal concern of the United States in this case isthat the state has a limited authority under the electionsclause and has improperly or either abused, misused itsauthority or exceeded its authority.          QUESTION:  Then how would you draw the wordmanner?  How would you explicate that?  Which I take itwhat you would want to do is eliminate this, but then notreach the First Amendment question.  You see?          MS. UNDERWOOD:  It's not necessary to reach theFirst Amendment --          QUESTION:  Yes.  But how do you explicate theword manner?43                                                                                             1              MS. UNDERWOOD:  The word manner, in the context 2    of the Time, Place and Manner clause, means the mechanics, 3    the procedures of an election, neutral, evenhanded 4    regulations that enable the orderly election process to 5    occur, and what it particularly doesn't mean is putting a 6    thumb on the scale to influence the result. 7              QUESTION:  Of course that refers to the 8    legislature, too, and not to this, not to this process, 9    the state legislature?10              MS. UNDERWOOD:  Yes.  There is a question as you11    have noted, about whether the time, place and manner12    authority that the Constitution gives to the state13    legislatures goes to any entity that the state gives14    legislative authority to, or whether it actually only goes15    to legislatures.  We haven't -- in either case, even16    assuming that it isn't restricted to the legislature as17    such, it's our position that the power has simply been18    exceeded, doesn't go, doesn't authorize the making of19    nonneutral regulations that are designed to and have the20    effect of attempting to influence the outcome.21              With respect to other labels that do sometimes22    appear on ballots, party labels and incumbency23    designations, those have, those are all understood as24    helping the voter identify the candidates.  They are25    objective, identifying information.  They don't, for one44                                                                                                                                 1    thing, involve a state official in assessing whether the 2    label should apply or not, as this regulation does here. 3    The secretary of state, subject to a state review process, 4    has to determine whether the label applies, and the label 5    is a judgmental label, not simply an identifying piece of 6    information. 7              The other thing about parties, of course, is 8    that party labels recognize the role political parties 9    play in the electoral process, provide candidates with a10    reasonable level of community support, provide voters with11    a means of exercising their First Amendment right of12    political association, and the party label therefore13    reflects that the party is the mechanism that put the14    candidate on, on the ballot.  It's quite different from a15    label that is designed to influence the election and also16    to constrain the behavior of the legislator after having17    been elected as this, as this provision does.18              I think, if there are no further questions --19              QUESTION:  May I ask, if you have a minute, the20    Court of Appeals gave us a whole bunch of reasons to come21    out the way they did.  Which one do you think is the22    strongest?23 24 25          MS. UNDERWOOD:  The elections clause.  The Courtof Appeals actually didn't -- well, the elections clausehas been in the case from the beginning because it is the45                                                                                             1    provision that the state has used to defend its authority 2    against all other attack.  That is the argument, when the 3    argument is made that this is a qualification, or this is 4    an improper this or that, the state has said it's a proper 5    exercise of its authority under the elections clause, and 6    we say it is not.  I think that's the simplest way to 7    decide this case, even though there are a number of other 8    issues that could also be reached. 9              QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Underwood. Mr.10    McAdams, you have five minutes remaining.11               REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. McADAMS12                      ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER13              MR. McADAMS:  Thank you, Your Honor.  It14    Tashjian, this Court said, any claim that we enhance the15    ability of the citizenry to make wise decisions by16    restricting the flow of information to them must be viewed17    with some skepticism.  This is precisely respondent's18    claim, and it should be viewed with considerable19    skepticism.  As to the elections clause claim made by the20    respondent, the Court said in Smiley that the time, place21    and manner language are comprehensive words that embrace22    authority to provide a complete code for congressional23    elections.  And in Tashjian they said state control over24    the election process for state officers is co-extensive25    with that grant to the states under the elections clause.46                                                                                                                                 1    It is a broad power. 2              The alleged damage done to congressional 3    candidates because of the ballot label is something that 4    needs to be analyzed under a punishment analysis.  There 5    is no evidence in the record that suggests this language 6    is punishing, and that was respondent's burden.  Under the 7    qualifications clause, it was Respondent's burden to show 8    that the sole basis for putting this on was to add a 9    qualification indirectly.  The language of the amendment10    itself indicates that it is not the sole basis to add a11    qualification indirectly.  It is the sole purpose to one,12    inform the voters, and two, to amend the Constitution.13              It was argued that the severance issue was14    waived.  This is not so.  This is contained in the15    response to the, or pardon me, to the reply to the cert.16    In point four, we say specifically because we use the word17    or in the first question, we preserve the severance18    question and we have already dealt with that in the reply19    suggestions.20              If there are no further questions?21              QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. McAdams.  The case is22    submitted.23 24 25          (Whereupon, at 12:00 noon, the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)47
