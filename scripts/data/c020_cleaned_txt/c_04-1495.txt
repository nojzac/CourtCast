KNEEDLER               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MR. KNEEDLER:  Justice Stevens, and may itplease the Court:          Respondent alleges in this Bivens action thatpetitioners, who were postal inspectors, caused him tobe prosecuted in retaliation for activity protected bythe First Amendment.  In order to make out such aclaim, however, respondent must establish that therewas no probable cause for the prosecution.  That is sofor threemutually reinforcing reasons.First, that requirement accords with thethis Court has consistently held in Armstrongcases must be given to the prosecutorialdeferenceand otherfunction because that function is core to the executivebranch's operations and because prosecutorial decision-making isobjectiveill-suited to judicial second guessing.Second, that rule accords a -- an importantscreen and check against claims of31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 retaliatory prosecution in order to guard against the2 chilling effect that would otherwise routinely arise3 from inquiry into the subjective motivations of those4 involved in the prosecutorial decisionmaking process.5 And third, that rule is deeply rooted in6 history. A claim of First Amendment retaliatory7 prosecution is but one species of a claim of malicious8 prosecution, and it has long been required that an9 essential element of a claim of malicious prosecution10 is that the plaintiff show an absence of probable cause11 for the prosecution.12 JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm -- I'm not sure why --13 why we should make the classification that you did,14 that -- that retaliatory is simply a species of -- of15 malicious. I mean, I -- I can see the similarities,16 but we've also got an entirely separate First Amendment17 value here which just is not part of the -- the18 analytical mix when you're talking about malicious19 prosecution. So I'm not sure why we should -- we -- we20 should classify it as you argue.21 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- for several22 reasons. First of all, the -- the First Amendment --23 the alleged First Amendment retaliation describes the24 malice, a form of the malice that would arise in --25 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it's -- it's a peculiar,41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 if you will, a peculiar malice with its own set of2 constitutional values, and I don't know of anything3 comparable in -- in malicious prosecution generically.4 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, to be sure, what renders5 it malice or wrongful is the First Amendment, but --6 but the derivation of -- of the reason for why it's7 wrongful does not, I think, detract from the essential8 relevance of the tort of malicious prosecution.9 And if -- if I may add to that, the -- the10 reason why the -- the tort of malicious prosecution is11 highly relevant here is not simply because on the12 malice side of it, but also because it has long been13 recognized, beginning with Blackstone before the First14 Amendment and the Constitution were even adopted, that15 there are critical interests on the other side, not16 simply the defendant's interest in avoiding badly17 motivated prosecutions, but the important18 countervailing public interest of ensuring that19 wrongdoers are brought to justice and that those who20 have information about it will come forward.21 And -- and that was recognized by Blackstone22 early on and has been recognized consistent --23 consistently by this Court in -- in many, many24 decisions, including recent cases of this Court25 involving immunity issues, which is what we have here,51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 specifically recognizing that the tort of malicious2 prosecution is very instructive in deciding how rules3 should be applied when a Bivens action or a 1983 action4 is brought in the specific context of prosecution.5 67 cause for8 extremely9 cases andJUSTICE STEVENS:  But, of course, here --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose there is probablea prosecution, but the prosecutors arebusy and they -- they have to select theirthey select one in which they bring the10 prosecution against the defendant on account of his11 speech. Is that a violation of the prosecutorial duty?12 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, in -- in terms -- in13 terms of the responsibilities of the prosecutor, there14 --15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.16 MR. KNEEDLER: -- that -- that should not --17 that should not be a -- a selection criterion in18 itself, but it --19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm -- I'm asking is it a20 violation of the prosecutor's professional obligations21 and his professional duties?22 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- I would think23 ordinarily yes, but with this caveat. Unlike race24 which is never relevant to the prosecutorial decision-25 making process, there can often be a prosecution -- and61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 this case is one of them -- in which you might have2 claims of public corruption. And -- and in fact, there3 was a guilty plea here on the part of a member of the4 Postal Service board of directors for receiving5 payments to -- for his activity on behalf of6 respondent's corporation and others. This -- this --7 involving contracts for $250 million. This was a very,8 very important procurement by the Post Office9 Department and it is understandable that in connection10 with that prosecution, the prosecutors and the Postal11 Service investigators would look into issues of12 respondent's, or people in his behalf, approaching the13 Government.14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just going back to the15 hypothetical, if -- if you acknowledge -- and I think16 you must -- that there's a violation of the17 prosecutorial duty in -- in the instance I suppose,18 then why shouldn't the law recognize it and -- and give19 force to that sanction and give force to that rule?20 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, there -- there are21 certain restrictions -- certainly restrictions on what22 the prosecutor may do, but several points about that.23 First of all, this is not a Bivens action24 against the prosecutor. The prosecutor is absolutely25 immune from suit. The prosecutor's decision-making71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 process is -- is, in fact, as is the grand jury's, a --2 a critical protection against malicious prosecution --3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. Well, then4 we'll just change the hypothetical to make it the5 investigators. The investigators select their case6 based on this speech that they consider unwelcome.7 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, the -- the question is8 whether in that circumstance the -- the Bivens9 plaintiff, the criminal defendant, has a First10 Amendment right to be excused from prosecution or,11 after the prosecution is unsuccessful, to bring a civil12 action, whether he has a right not to have been13 prosecuted in those circumstances notwithstanding the14 existence of probable cause and the independent15 judgment by the prosecutor.16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, does he have a right17 not to be singled out because of his speech?18 MR. KNEEDLER: He does -- he does not have a19 -- he does not have a First Amendment claim in those20 circumstances where there is probable cause for the21 violation. The --2223 right not 2425 Amendment81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I asked does he have ato be singled out because of his speech.MR. KNEEDLER:  He does not have a Firstright not to be singled out in those￼1 circumstances.2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, you -- you3 would advise law enforcement officials that they can4 single out persons for prosecution based on distasteful5 speech.6 MR. KNEEDLER: I would not. I -- I'm not --7 I'm not endorsing the motivation. What I'm -- what I'm8 saying is910 agree. I11 principle12 even though there's that principle, there's a lot of13 problems with enforcing it because there are going to14 be too many suits, it's hard to -- it's difficult for15 the Government to defend, and -- and so forth and so16 on.17 MR. KNEEDLER: Right. I -- I'm not disputing18 that it -- that -- that a -- a prosecution should not19 be brought or should not be heard --20 JUSTICE STEVENS: And you're not disputing21 either, as I understand it. As the case comes to us,22 we assume the prosecution would not have been brought23 but for the retaliatory motive.24 MR. KNEEDLER: I -- it is -- we certainly25 disagree with that with our proposition.91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-what is --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What I want you to do is to-- I think you have to concede there is thisin the law, and I think your answer has to be￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But don't you assume thatfor the purposes of your argument?          MR. KNEEDLER:  For -- for purposes of ourprobable -- probable cause claim, yes.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, that's the onlyargument.          MR. KNEEDLER:  That -- that is true, butthat, of course, was also true at common law for -- formalicious prosecution.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But the -- one of thedifferences -- am I not correct, that at common law theprosecutor did not have absolute immunity?          MR. KNEEDLER:  At common law -- at commonlaw, yes.  As this Court has recognized inreformulating the common law principles of -- ofimmunity, the -- the public prosecutor now has absoluteimmunity under -- under these --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Now does, but not at commonlaw.          MR. KNEEDLER:  -- under these Court's --under this Court's decisions.          But at common law, the prosecutor did havethe protection of malicious prosecution, and asJustice Scalia observed in his concurring opinion inthe Kalina decision, the elements of the tort of101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 prosecution essentially had a built-in qualified2 immunity, and the probable cause requirement was3 essentially that. It afforded protection for the4 prosecutor. The -- the private citizen who -- who --5 the complaining witness -- he could not be the subject6 of a suit for damages if -- if the charges were7 dismissed, not simply upon a showing -- it required8 more than simply a showing of malice. It required a9 showing of an absence of probable cause for reasons10 that are essentially identical to the qualified11 immunity and absolute immunity -- the -- the reasons12 for qualified and absolute immunity.13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. --14 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, they're not totally15 identical because you didn't have the First Amendment16 interest involved in those cases, whereas you do have a17 First Amendment interest at stake here.18 MR. KNEEDLER: But -- but on -- on the -- on19 the governmental interest side of the balance, the20 interests are exactly the same in both -- in both21 circumstances. And that is not to chill -- not -- not22 to create circumstances where people would hold back23 from coming forward with information of violations of24 the law because of fear that they would be sued and25 retaliated against afterward. And that hasn't changed111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 now that we have public prosecutors. It's still2 critical.3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, may -- would4 you clarify just one point about this probable cause?5 There was a grand jury that indicted this man, and then6 there was a trial judge who said, I'm throwing this out7 at the close of the Government's case. There is not8 enough evidence here to convict this man.9 Are you saying that as long as the grand jury10 indicts, there can be no Bivens claim because in order11 to indict, the grand jury would have had to find12 probable cause?13 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, at -- at common law14 on the tort of malicious prosecution, the indictment15 created a presumption because an indictment does have16 to depend upon probable cause, and under the -- under17 this Court's decision in Gerstein v. Pugh and other18 decisions, that can't be reexamined by the court in the19 prosecution.2021 created a22 the -- by23 disagreement about what would be necessary, whether you24 would have to show fraud on the grand jury or whether25 you could just retry --But at common law, the -- the indictmentpresumption that was subject to rebuttal bythe civil plaintiff.  There was some121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, tell me about now,2 not at the common law.3 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. We do not -- we do not4 think that the existence of the grand -- it has not5 been our position that the existence of the indictment6 is dispositive and cannot be challenged, but we do7 think it --8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the grand jury did9 find probable cause. So what would the plaintiff have10 to show to overcome -- to -- to negate that finding of11 probable cause?12 MR. KNEEDLER: We -- we think in a -- in a --13 it would have to show by at least a preponderance of14 the evidence, maybe a clear showing, that there was not15 probable cause. And I think that also ties in to the16 -- to the standard for qualified immunity, which is17 could a reasonable person in those circumstances have18 believed that there was probable cause. I think, if19 the grand jury returns an indictment, that that should20 be pretty persuasive evidence but not compelling21 evidence -- I mean, not dispositive evidence that there22 was probable cause.23 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: The case that comes24 closest, as far as I can see, is probably United States25 v. Armstrong, and in that case, this Court said in the131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425ordinary case, so long as the prosecutor has probablecause to believe the offense was committed, thedecision to prosecute or go before a grand jury restsentirely in his discretion.  But, of course, thediscretion is subject to constitutional constraints,the equal protection component of the Due ProcessClause.  The decision whether to prosecute may not bebased on an unjustifiable standard such as race,religion, or other arbitrary classification.  And thestandard the Court articulated there was the defendantmust present clear evidence --          MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, clear evidence, and theCourt stressed that it was a --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  -- to the contrary.  Now,that's different from your proposition of probablecause.          MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I -- I think severalthings may explain that.          In Armstrong, that was a claim of selectiveprosecution that was brought --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Based on race.          MR. KNEEDLER:  Based on race.  That was oneof the distinctions I was going to point to.  Andsecondly --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So why should that be 141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 different than the First Amendment violation?2 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, as -- as this Court's3 decision in -- in Johnson, for example, shows, there --4 distinctions based on race are subject to strict5 scrutiny no matter what the context, in that case even6 in the prison context, whereas First Amendment claims7 often take account of the context in which they are8 raised. For example, this Court in the American-Arab9 Anti-Discrimination case held that there would -- could10 be no claim at all of selective prosecution in the11 immigration context because of the important12 countervailing interest in enforcing the law.13 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you're willing to14 acknowledge -- and -- and the Government concedes that15 you can have a different standard when the -- the basis16 for the selective prosecution happens to violate the17 Constitution from the standard you apply where the2223 different24 where the25151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-18 basis for the selective prosecution doesn't violate the19 Constitution, such as I'm prosecuting him because he20 was mean to my brother-in-law. Okay?21MR. KNEEDLER:  No.JUSTICE SCALIA:  Are you going to apply astandard there than you would apply where --reason is some First Amendment reason?MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, no.  The -- the other￼1 distinction -- and -- and I'm not sure if this goes to2 your point or not. The other distinction is that in3 Armstrong the claim was made in the criminal4 prosecution itself. Here, the claim is the civil5 action after the criminal prosecution is over with, and6 it's in that -- in that context especially that the7 analogy to malicious prosecution is very strong and why8 the element of -- that the person has to -- that the --9 there has to have been a favorable termination for the10 -- for the plaintiff and there has to be a probable cause.11 JUSTICE STEVENS: But that doesn't --12 JUSTICE SCALIA: But would you answer my13 question?14 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.15 MR. KNEEDLER: I'm -- I'm not sure that I --16 maybe -- I guess I --17 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's going be a different18 criterion -- you -- you say it's going to be different19 for the First Amendment and the -- and -- and the Equal20 Protection Clause, at least where race is involved.21 What if there's no constitutional violation at all, but22 I just selectively prosecute him just because I don't23 like this guy or because he was mean24 mine?to a relative of-- I don't --Washington, DC 2000525MR. KNEEDLER: No, I don't 161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  1-￼12 different 34 be any --5 common law --6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly, and would you apply7 a different standard because there isn't a8 constitutional claim?9 MR. KNEEDLER: No. There wouldn't be anyJUSTICE SCALIA:  Is there going to be astandard --MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  There -- there wouldn'tany constitutional claim and any -- any10 claim at all. I mean, there wouldn't be any basis for11 a claim.12 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- a malicious prosecution13 claim. You'd have a malicious prosecution claim.14 MR. KNEEDLER: There -- there -- and in the15 -- in the Federal sphere, if there was a malicious -- a16 common law malicious prosecution claim, that would have17 to be brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act against18 the United States.19 JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Kneedler, I20 understand your argument to be they should be treated21 just like a malicious prosecution claim, which22 distinction between a constitutional basis and23 -- and just that he hated his brother-in-law.24 you're saying they're the same. That's what I25 understand Justice Scalia to be asking you.171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  1-is noa commonI thinkWashington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's what I'm asking.          MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, yes.  I -- I am -- I amsaying that --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Which places no weight atall on the fact the Constitution is involved.          MR. KNEEDLER:  Oh -- oh, it does because the-- because the -- the first -- the existence of theFirst Amendment claim is what gives you the Bivenscause of action in the first place.  So otherwise,there wouldn't be any Federal cause of action at allwithout -- without the First Amendment claim.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  That's how you'd get atleast as much protection as if it was an ordinarymalicious prosecution claim, but you don't get any moreunder your view.          MR. KNEEDLER:  No, because -- and -- andagain, this -- this is -- this is because of the -- ofthe background of the common law tort of maliciousprosecution, which strikes exactly the balance that I-- that I'm talking about.          JUSTICE BREYER:  But you really want threethings.  You say we want the protection, number one, ofthere -- if you're -- if there's probable cause, that'sthe end of it.  Number two, if you're trying to showthere wasn't probable cause, you have to bear clear and181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425convincing evidence, and number three, we also havequalified immunity.  And I guess, number four, you haveto prove the whole thing by clear and convincingevidence.          MR. KNEEDLER:  Well --          JUSTICE BREYER:  It sounds a little bit likethe person who has the overcoat, turns up the heat, youknow, five or -- what about one?          MR. KNEEDLER:  The -- the --          JUSTICE BREYER:  What about this one?  And Iwant to know -- you simply say you need clear andconvincing evidence that that was the motive and itwouldn't have been brought otherwise.  And theexistence of probable cause is a strong factor, maybeeven a presumption, that suggests to the contrary.          Now, have States and other places triedthings like that without the world collapsing?          MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  My understanding from --from reading the treatises on -- on maliciousprosecution, for example, that there has been nowatering down of the probable cause requirement becauseit is understood to be a critical check against --          JUSTICE BREYER:  So as far as you know, everyState and every jurisdiction where -- and investigatorsif they don't have absolutely immunity, whatever -- in191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 all those jurisdictions, nobody has ever said that even2 a constitutional violation, if there's probable cause,3 that's the end of it.4 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I'm -- I'm focusing on5 the tort of malicious prosecution which is --6 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I'm not focusing.7 MR. KNEEDLER: -- which --8 JUSTICE BREYER: I want to know --9 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes.10 JUSTICE BREYER: -- if --11 MR. KNEEDLER: I'm not -- I'm not aware --12 I'm not aware that any jurisdiction has done that.13 But in response to your proposal, the -- the14 -- what -- what's wrong with that is that it would15 allow extensive inquiry, discovery, other inquiry into16 the subjective motivations of persons involved in the17 decision-making process with no mechanism analogous to18 immunity or the -- or the probable cause criterion to19 weed out --20 JUSTICE BREYER: We have no experience. We21 don't know. Okay. As your -- as far as you can tell.22 The other question I have, which you might23 want to be brief about, is in looking through this24 record, as far as I could see from the briefs, they25 went ahead and prosecuted this man with only two pieces201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425of evidence.  The first evidence was that he tore somepages out of his notebook.  But he introduced lots ofnotebooks to show he always tore pages out when he gavethem to his secretary.  And the second was that he toldsome witnesses be very careful and answer the question. Now, you know, he said a few other things, but theyall seemed like the kind of things that people wouldalways say to witnesses.          Now, if that's the only evidence, except forthe fact he owns the company, how is there probablecause here?          MR. KNEEDLER:  There -- there was much, muchmore evidence.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I didn't see any inthe brief.people inMR. KNEEDLER:  There --JUSTICE BREYER:  I saw a lot about otherthe brief, but not about him.MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, for one thing, it'sabsolutely conceded that there was a conspiracy.  Threepeople pleaded guilty, including --          JUSTICE BREYER:  There are all kinds ofthings about other people.          MR. KNEEDLER:  No, but -- but --          JUSTICE BREYER:  I didn't --211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. KNEEDLER: -- the -- it isn't all about2 other people. The -- the -- that crime included -- and3 it's accepted in this case that the Postal Service4 board of -- board member accepted 30 percent of the5 fees paid by respondent's company to the consulting6 firm. Respondent's company. He was the chief7 executive officer.8 JUSTICE BREYER: I would like you to limit9 yourself to what I didn't concede. I concede it's his10 company. I concede that he tore some pages out of his11 notebook, and I concede that he told -- which he did a12 lot of times. And I concede that he told witnesses13 answer the question, et cetera. Now, is there anything14 else connecting him, not his company?15 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. In -- in the summer of16 1984, before there was even a consulting agreement,17 there was a series of conversations between Voss, the18 postal board -- board member, and respondent, including19 one for which there are notes in which Voss said I am20 working for you.21 There -- there was an -- there is an22 abundance of evidence involving Reedy who is -- no. I23 -- I know, but just in -- just in terms of -- just in24 terms of the sequence.25 There is evidence that Voss and Moore were221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 good friends. Voss said that he had a close2 relationship with respondent, and when the contract was3 first being negotiated, Reedy acknowledged that Voss4 and Moore were good friends. They had a close5 relationship. They were not distant.6 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Kneedler, I know you're7 responding to Justice Breyer's question, but I think8 for purposes of our decision, we're not supposed to9 decide whether there was probable cause or not, but10 we're to give you the opportunity to prove there was if11 -- if you win on your --12 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, although I -- I certainly13 do not want to leave the misimpression that -- and14 there is -- there is much more.15 JUSTICE STEVENS: But that's a disputed16 issue, and we don't have to decide the probable cause17 issue. Is that not correct?18 MR. KNEEDLER: That -- that -- you do not19 have -- you do not have to decide it, but I would20 certainly urge the Court not to proceed on the21 assumption or make any comments that there is because22 there were -- there were --23 JUSTICE STEVENS: But because the other side24 is arguing that even if there is probable cause, the25 burden shifts when they prove the retaliatory motive,231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 and you have to prove that you would never -- you made2 -- you would have brought the prosecution even if there3 had been no retaliatory motive. That's what we're4 arguing --5 MR. KNEEDLER: Right, and that is their6 position. And that position accords -- yes, that is7 their position. And that accords no particular --8 JUSTICE STEVENS: And the question I would9 ask is why should this be different from a wrongful10 discharge case in which there's ample cause to11 discharge and the issue boils down to whether or not he12 would have been discharged anyway. Why isn't it the13 same -- same situation?14 MR. KNEEDLER: What is very different is that15 this is the prosecutorial function. As this Court16 recognized in Armstrong, that is a core executive17 branch function and it is one that the courts are ill-18 suited to second-guess because a whole variety of19 determinations can enter into whether to prosecute20 somebody, whether they -- whether the particular21 conduct -- how culpable the person is, whether the22 conduct fits into the overall prosecutorial priorities,23 whether there will be cooperating witnesses, what --24 what the office's resources are. There are a whole25 bunch of -- of judgments that courts are ill-suited to241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 second-guess, and it would be very chilling if the2 prosecutor had to --3 JUSTICE STEVENS: Wouldn't -- wouldn't all4 those considerations justify a rule that makes the5 burden of proving the retaliatory motive very high,6 say, maybe it has to be by clear and convincing7 evidence or something like that? But once you8 acknowledged -- I don't know if they're really9 acknowledged here, but there's strong evidencehave itof shiftdo not10 retaliatory motive -- why shouldn't the burden11 just on that, on the basis of that proof?12 MR. KNEEDLER: Well -- oh, not -- we13 think there is strong evidence of retaliatory motive.14 And I -- I can -- can address that, but --15 16 1718 burden of19 wouldn't that protect the interests that mainly concern20 you?JUSTICE STEVENS:  And if you had a --MR. KNEEDLER:  -- but --JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- if you had a heavyproof at that stage of the proceeding,21 MR. KNEEDLER: We -- we think the more direct22 -- I don't think so for -- partly for the reason that I23 -- that I gave to Justice Breyer is that -- that that24 would not protect against discovery and -- and the sort25 of chilling inquiry that this Court has recognized in251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425its immunity cases, and especially in the prosecutorialfunction where the prosecutor would be required todisclose.  Even though the prosecutor is absolutelyimmune, the prosecutor's decision-making process andhis communication with law enforcement agents would --would be exposed for judicial scrutiny, public scrutinyin a way that could chill the prosecutorial function.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Kneedler, the defendanthere is not the prosecutor.  Right?          MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Just someone who providedinformation to the prosecutor that -- that waserroneous and allegedly maliciously motivated.          MR. KNEEDLER:  I don't think erroneous.  Itwas allegedly maliciously motivated.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Allegedly maliciouslymotivated, at least.          I don't understand how you would apply thetest, would -- you know, would you have prosecutedanyway, when -- you know, but for the malicious motive,when the person you're -- you're suing is not theprosecutor.  It wasn't up to this person whether therewould be a prosecution.          MR. KNEEDLER:  I think that's a -- I thinkthat's a very important point, and before a -- a court261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 enters into that, in the end, unknowable question,2 maybe a court can -- can, in the end, determine3 probabilities, but before a court undertakes that,4 which requires looking not simply at the motivation of5 the -- of the law enforcement officers, but the6 prosecutor and -- and who knows whether the grand jury7 would have returned an indictment, and yet a court8 certainly couldn't be expected to inquire into that.9 Now, so we -- we think that that's another reason why10 the probable cause requirement is a critical gateway11 before a court is -- is going to enter into that12 determination.13 And all -- and it's important to remember14 it's not just proving the question of causation, but15 these are people who are several steps removed from the16 -- from the prosecutorial decision. And the -- and the17 personal liability would be visited on the law18 enforcement agents who were doing their job and19 cooperating with the U.S. Attorney's Office.20 This case was -- this case got attention at21 the highest levels of the U.S. Attorney's Office. The22 U.S. Attorney personally met with the -- the respondent23 -- lawyers for respondent.24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, the D.C.25 Circuit, looking at this case, looking at the record271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 closely, typed it one in which the evidence of2 retaliation was strong and probable cause weak. This3 is on 28a of the appendix to the petition for cert.4 That was the appraisal of the D.C. Circuit panel. And5 I think you've been arguing that that is not the case,6 but at least for our purposes at this posture, don't we7 -- shouldn't we accept that that is the picture here,8 weak evidence of probable cause, strong indications of9 retaliation?10 MR. KNEEDLER: I -- I don't -- I don't think11 there's any reason to accept that because there's no12 factual determinations to that effect.13 There -- there are really just two snippets14 of evidence that are primarily relied upon by the court15 of appeals for the view that there was a retaliatory16 motive here. And they were -- they were really17 observations that the -- that the inspectors made to --18 to show -- the first one was why the corporation should19 be indicted, not just -- not just Moore, but why the20 corporation should be indicted. And it was just an21 observation that the corporation, through its agents,22 was involved in a lot of activities and should be held23 accountable. It was not -- it was not evidence of a --24 of a retaliatory motive, and there were subpoenas for25 -- for documents about political contributions. But281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425let's remember that this was a case involving briberyof a public official, and it was -- it wasunderstandable that the AUSA and the -- and theinspectors would -- would look to see whether there wasmoney directed elsewhere.my time.If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance ofJUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. McCartan. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICK F. McCARTAN     ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. McCARTAN:  Justice Stevens, if it pleasethe Court:          If I may, Your Honors, I would like to startwith the very pointed inquiry that Justice Kennedy madeat the opening of the argument here.          The petitioners here do not challenge,because they cannot challenge, as was evident from theconcession made here this morning, that a criminalprosecution cannot be based upon the exercise of aconstitutional right.  What they want is an exceptionto that rule, an exception that would mean, despite theoverwhelming evidence of retaliation of record in thiscase, there would be no violation of the FirstAmendment here and that would treat any prosecutionbased solely upon race, religion, or protected speech291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 the same as a tort for malicious prosecution. And to2 accomplish this end, what they are trying to do is to3 force probable cause as a standard into a framework4 where it doesn't belong, where it won't work, and5 which, if done here, is going to be contrary to several6 existing decisions of this Court.7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. McCartan, how does --8 how does your standard work? The same question I asked9 Mr. Kneedler. The -- the test you would propose is10 whether but for the retaliatory motive, the prosecution11 would have been brought anyway?12 MR. McCARTAN: That would be the test, Your13 Honor, for recovery when the matter goes to trial.14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.15 MR. McCARTAN: The test that I would propose16 is the very test that this Court set forth in Harlow17 against Fitzgerald because we're here really on a very18 limited issue of qualified immunity. We have to19 determine whether the defense of qualified immunity is20 available to the petitioners here. The standard, the21 proper standard for making that determination was set22 forth by this Court in Harlow and it's whether the23 conduct alleged --24 JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. McCartan, I don't25 mean to interrupt you, but I thought the primary issue301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 was not the qualified immunity issue, but whether we2 have a cause of action in the first place.3 MR. McCARTAN: Well, Your Honor, whether --4 no, I think that the --5 JUSTICE STEVENS: And on that, they say you6 don't have a cause of action unless you're able to7 prove an absence of probable cause.8 MR. McCARTAN: I think what they are saying9 is the defense of qualified immunity should be10 available if there should be probable cause for the11 action that was taken here. I think the case before12 the Court is on the very limited issue of whether the13 defense of qualified immunity is available to the14 petitioners.15 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. I think they would say16 absolute immunity, not qualified. I -- I think they're17 saying if there's probable cause, the game is over. No18 -- no qualified --19 MR. McCARTAN: That's exactly what they're20 saying, and what I'm saying is that is the wrong21 standard to be applying.22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but there are two23 questions in the cert petition and it's the second one24 that's the qualified immunity issue, and the first one25 is whether there's a cause of action.311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. McCARTAN: All right. Well, Your Honor,2 let -- let me -- let me back up for just a moment then3 with respect to that.4 Let me say that probable cause is not the5 proper standard which should be applied here. The6 proper standard is the standard that is set forth by7 this Court in Harlow and as refined later in Anderson8 against Creighton and a number of other decisions.9JUSTICE SOUTER:  But the difficulty I thinkhaving with it is that the qualified immunitythe standard to which you are -- areresponds to a question that doesn't arisefirst assume that there is -- that there is a10 we're all11 issue and12 adverting13 unless we14 constitutional violation.15 MR. McCARTAN: That's correct.16 JUSTICE SOUTER: And our questions are, what17 is the standard for determining the constitutional18 violation? Once we get that squared away, then we'll19 get to Harlow.20 MR. McCARTAN: The standard that is to be set21 forth to determine whether there is a constitutional22 violation is that that this Court applied in Mt.23 Healthy City School District against Doyle and in24 Crawford-El against Britton, and that is if there is25 illegally or unconstitutionally motivated conduct, it321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 will not be excused simply because there may be some2 objectively valid basis for taking such action. That3 is the conceptual framework that was established in4 those cases and which should be applied by way of5 analysis.6 JUSTICE BREYER: If it is applied here, I --7 I thought we just granted question one. There were two8 in the cert petition. I -- my notes say we just9 granted question one. And that means what they have is10 the screen. We're going to screen out absolutely any11 such claim as yours if there is probable cause.12 Now, the reason they advance for doing that13 is that in the -- a reason is in the absence of a14 screen like that, here's what's going to happen. Every15 single case -- not every one, but millions of cases or16 thousands, anyway -- involving companies -- well,17 companies are going to Congress all the time. They18 have ads all the time. They run into agency hostility19 all the time. The Hell's Angels? That's a pretty20 unpopular defendant. They say things all the time that21 investigators disagree with. And what will happen is22 in a vast number of cases the defendant will decide to23 bring a Bivens action, particularly if he gets off, and24 then we'll have discovery and we'll look into every25 statement that the -- the investigator made to the 331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 prosecutor, and before you know it, we have a nightmare2 of tort cases. And they say that's unfortunate to cut3 off a claim like yours, but after all, the prosecutors4 totally cut them off because they have absolute5 immunity.6 Now, we're saying at least let's restrict7 them, where investigators are involved, to cases where8 it turned out there was no probable cause, otherwise9 the criminal process itself will be seriously injured.10 Now, I take it that's the argument. I'd like11 to hear your reply.12 MR. McCARTAN: That is exactly the argument,13 Your Honor, and what it comes down to is whether the14 burdens of litigation in a situation of this kind will15 justify judicial alteration of the protection of the16 First Amendment. And I think that's been very clear17 from the outset in the first question Justice Kennedy18 asked.19 JUSTICE BREYER: No, but are you going to --20 I mean, is there any light you could shed? And that's21 why I asked in my question initially. I thought maybe22 there were some jurisdictions somewhere that -- that23 survive without the rule they want, but maybe I'm24 wrong. And -- and how do I judge this? I would be25 concerned. I don't -- the -- after all, these other341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 cases you mentioned are civil tort cases and -- and2 they don't involve the criminal process. And when we3 get into criminal prosecutions, we have rules on4 selective prosecution that are designed to screen out5 all but the very worst.678 for here. 910 those are11 Probable cause was evident and was present in United12 States against Armstrong and Wayte against the United13 States. It was not deemed by this Court to be a bar to14 the selective prosecution claims that were advanced in15 that -- in those cases.16 JUSTICE BREYER: Leaving -- is there anything17 you can say before I give up on this? And maybe the18 answer is no. Is there anything you can say that would19 relieve my concern, which is completely practical at20 the moment, that if I decide in your favor, there21 suddenly are going to be large numbers of criminal22 cases where defendants will say the reason I was23 prosecuted was because of something I said? I was24 advocating motorcycles. I was advocating beating25 people up. I was advocating a congressional change of351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-MR. McCARTAN:  But see --JUSTICE BREYER:  And that's what he's arguingMR. McCARTAN:  That's what he's arguing, andnot screening mechanisms, Your Honor.￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425something.  Many, many such cases.  They'll all get atleast discovery, and the prosecutor's door will becomeopen to the world.  Now, that's what's concerning.  Canyou say anything to relieve that concern?          MR. McCARTAN:  Yes.  I think, first of all,empirically, Your Honor, there's no evidence to theeffect that Bivens has had that result after 35 yearsin full force and effect.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  But if this Court opensthat door, don't you think we might see a differentproblem?          MR. McCARTAN:  I don't think so, JusticeO'Connor.  I think if you examine part IV of theCourt's opinion in Crawford-El, there is a very carefulpattern that is set forth as to how cases of this kindshould proceed and what protections are available toprotect Government officials against overly burdensomelitigation.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Which opinion was that?  Imissed that.          MR. McCARTAN:  Pardon, Your Honor?          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Which opinion are youtalking about?  I missed it -- missed it.          MR. McCARTAN:  The opinion in Crawford-Elagainst Britton.361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Okay.          MR. McCARTAN:  There, the Court held that ifthere are factually specific allegations that wouldindicate a violation of the Constitution, that at thatpoint the court may consider whether some additionaldiscovery should be permitted even if there should bean independently valid basis.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  This wasn't addressing --this wasn't -- didn't involve prosecution, though.  Itdidn't involve unlawful prosecution.          MR. McCARTAN:  It did not, Your Honor, but itprovides the same --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  It -- it was a suit againsta prison.          MR. McCARTAN:  It provides the same frameworkfor the proper analysis of a claim of this kind.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, but -- but we treatprosecutions quite differently.  We do not give, forexample, absolute immunity to the wardens of prisons aswe give absolute immunity to prosecutors.dangerousMR. McCARTAN:  That's --JUSTICE SCALIA:  This is a speciallyarea in which to allow litigation.MR. McCARTAN:  It is far less dangerous, YourHonor, than when this is asserted by way of defense in 371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 the middle of an ongoing criminal prosecution. It can2 be far more disruptive to allege a violation of3 constitutional rights as a defense to a criminal4 prosecution, while that prosecution is in progress, and5 an effort is made to examine prosecutorial decision-6 making than in an after-the-fact, after-acquittal civil7 action for damages, such as we have here. You have8 already permitted that kind of examination in criminal9 cases where probable cause is present.10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. McCartan, I -- I still11 don't entirely understand what you would want the12 Government to prove under your system in order to13 order to -- to win this case. They would have to14 what? That -- that --15 MR. McCARTAN: They would have to prove16 something other than hostility to protected speech was17 the reason for the prosecution being advanced.18 JUSTICE SCALIA: And it would not be enough19 to show that the prosecution would have gone forward20 anyway.21 MR. McCARTAN: No. That's -- that's what I22 mean. Absent -- if there is an objectively valid basis23 --24 25JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.MR. McCARTAN:  -- the Government claims there381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1--- in provethat￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425is an objectively valid basis for the action theyaction they would take.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.          MR. McCARTAN:  Then if the plaintiff has madea showing that there was an improper motivation, theburden shifts to the Government to show that theprosecution would have proceeded absent the illicitintent.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You see now in -- in theemployment cases where -- where somebody is dismissedfor a -- a racially discriminatory reason and -- andyou have to prove that the same action would have beentaken anyway, you ask the person who fired them withthe discriminatory motive whether that person wouldhave taken that action anyway.  Whereas here, theperson who brought the prosecution is not in this case. It's somebody who gave information to the prosecutor. I don't know how that person could -- could possiblyestablish that the prosecution would have been broughtanyway.  It wasn't up to him.          MR. McCARTAN:  Well, as --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  It had nothing to do with --          MR. McCARTAN:  -- as -- as you pointed outearlier, probable cause is not the standard thatgoverns the investigator's conduct.  These391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 investigators procured a prosecution based upon a2 violation of the petitioner's -- or excuse me -- the3 respondent's constitutional rights.4 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, they did, but wouldn't5 you have to prove under your standard not that they6 would have procured or tried to procure it anyway, but7 that in fact the prosecutor would have prosecuted8 anyway? In other words, that's the distinction between9 the -- the normal case and -- and the case that we're10 dealing with here --11 MR. McCARTAN: No, I --12 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- with a prosecutor who has13 absolute immunity.14 MR. McCARTAN: Well, the prosecutor has15 absolute immunity. There's a qualified immunity here16 with respect to the investigators, and that means that17 the facts and circumstances of the case are going to18 have to determine whether there's liability.19 JUSTICE SOUTER: No. All right --20 MR. McCARTAN: The burden would shift once21 the illegal motivation is shown. It would shift to the22 Government to establish that the prosecution would have23 proceeded 2425 have beenabsent the illicit event.JUSTICE STEVENS:  But would it -- would ita complete defense?  Suppose the prosecutor,401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425who is immune, gets on the witness stand and says,well, I know all about this -- the First Amendmentstuff, but I was going to bring this prosecution anywaybecause it seemed to me there was a serious crime here. That's all he says.  Wouldn't that be the end of thecase?          MR. McCARTAN:  It shouldn't be the end of thecase.  It would be an issue of causation at thatpoint, Your Honor, if there were evidence.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But -- but the question isthe motivation for his decision to bring the case.          MR. McCARTAN:  The motivation for hisdecision --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  And he says I -- I wouldhave brought it anyway.          MR. McCARTAN:  But in this case, theprosecutor's decision to bring these charges to thegrand jury I don't think has any probative forcewhatsoever.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you think the defendantcan subpoena the prosecutor?          MR. McCARTAN:  Of course.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why?  I thought theprosecutor had absolute immunity.411111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. McCARTAN: The prosecutor is not a2 defendant, Your Honor.3 JUSTICE SCALIA: You say he -- he can't be4 brought into court to defend his own -- his own5 judgment, but he can be brought into court when -- when6 an investigator is sued in -- in order to take his7 testimony 89 this caseas to what would have happened?MR. McCARTAN:  His testimony was taken inand can be taken in this case because at that10 point in these proceedings -- and you have to look at11 the evidence of record to this point in this proceeding12 -- there is very clear evidence of retaliation as a13 motive for this prosecution.14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he may have done it15 voluntarily here, but I find it hard to believe that he16 could be subpoenaed, when -- when he has absolute17 immunity from suit against himself, to testify in a18 suit against somebody else. It seems to me a very19 strange kind of a --20 MR. McCARTAN: Your Honor, the fact that he21 has absolute immunity does not immunize him from giving22 testimony in the case.23 JUSTICE BREYER: So he's a witness. Suppose24 his testimony --25 MR. McCARTAN: He's a -- he's a witness.421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE BREYER:  Suppose that the person isconvicted.          MR. McCARTAN:  Suppose the person isconvicted.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  Can you bring yourBivens claim anyway?          MR. McCARTAN:  Well, Heck against Humphrey Ithink would stand in the way of that, Your Honor.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Really?  So that's a -- butit's not a civil case.          MR. McCARTAN:  Well, it's not a simple case.          JUSTICE BREYER:  So you say that if he'sconvicted, after all, he may have been convicted but itmay be because of the retaliatory motive.          MR. McCARTAN:  Well, if he is convicted and acivil action for damages is then brought --frameworksay --JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.MR. McCARTAN:  -- then I think you are in theof Heck against Humphrey --JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So you -- so youMR. McCARTAN:  -- where the court --          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- if he's convicted, that'sthe end of it --MR. McCARTAN: No. 431111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- whether there was aretaliatory motive or not.          MR. McCARTAN:  No.  I think it's verydifficult in that case.          In Heck against Humphrey, which this Courtviewed as a collateral attack on an outstandingconviction, the Court held that there had to be afavorable termination of the criminal proceeding inorder to maintain the civil action for damages undersection 1983.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, that's 1983.          MR. McCARTAN:  The Court went on to say,however, that if the civil damage action would notnecessarily impugn the conviction, that the case couldproceed even though there had not been a favorabletermination, reversal, or expungement --is he --JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So what he doesMR. McCARTAN:  -- of the conviction.          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- he brings his action andhe says here I am 20 years in prison and I agree I'mguilty, but they never would have prosecuted me withoutthe fact that they hate the Hell's Angels and they, infact, criticize everything that we say.MR. McCARTAN: I don't think that action 441111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425wouldn't be permitted to proceed.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Because?          MR. McCARTAN:  It would be viewed as acollateral attack on an outstanding conviction.          JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  He's saying I was-- I was guilty, but the -- all right.  Anyway --          MR. McCARTAN:  I -- I don't think --          JUSTICE BREYER:  I won't force you into that.          MR. McCARTAN:  -- with all due respect, YourHonor, that's a real-world example.          JUSTICE BREYER:  I'll take basicallyvirtually never if he's convicted.  They concede thatyou could bring this kind of action if there's noprobable cause.  So we're talking about that rangewhere there was probable cause but acquittal.  That'swhat we're talking about here.          MR. McCARTAN:  That's right.  And whyprobable cause is not the appropriate standard isbecause it does not distinguish between what might bean unconstitutional prosecution -- that is, one basedsolely upon race, religion, or protected speech -- andone that is not.  When you look to these earlier cases,Your Honor, I agree they arose in employment contexts. They arose in the context of a prison.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, you're -- you're in the451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 cases, but I'm -- I'm trying to pursue this. You've2 given me another idea --3 MR. McCARTAN: Yes.4 JUSTICE BREYER: -- which is I would like to5 say one word about this. I'm sorry to interrupt your6 train of thought here, but look.7 I'm looking for other screens. Is there --8 is there -- the particular point that they're worried9 about is you say we want to establish the retaliatory10 motive. That's what's worrying them because they see,11 in that establishment of the retaliatory motive,12 discovery, and discovery means you not only talk to the13 investigators, but you're also talking to, as a14 witness, the prosecutors to find out who said what to15 whom in order to see if you could establish that they16 didn't like the speech of the defendant. Now, can you17 give me any screen, not your case, but any kind of a18 screen that will help --192021 the lambs -- 222324 or whatever --25 MR. McCARTAN: Your Honor --461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-MR. McCARTAN:  Yes.JUSTICE BREYER:  -- weed out the sheep fromMR.

McCARTAN:  -- I submit the screen is thatby this Court in Harlow, which is anstandard and which is whether the conductset forthobjectiveinvolved violated a clearly established statutory orconstitutional right of which a reasonably prudent lawenforcement officer or Government official should beaware.          That's why I tried to say earlier thisstandard that should govern this case is not probablecause, but the standard set forth by this Court inHarlow --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  So the -- the screen, ineffect, is --screen.MR. McCARTAN:  And is a screening.JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- the qualified immunityMR. McCARTAN:  That's right.          And there was no screening mechanism inUnited States against Armstrong.  The Court made itvery clear that what you were applying there wereordinary equal protection standards.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Have there been cases wherein the context of the prosecution, there's been amotion to dismiss the prosecution because it was471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425brought in retaliation for the exercise of the FirstAmendment right?          MR. McCARTAN:  This Court has not decidedwhat the proper remedy would be there, Your Honor.  Andthe cases --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Have there been cases inthe other courts?          MR. McCARTAN:  I'm not aware of any caseswhere that has succeeded except at the circuit courtlevel --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  No, but it did in theArmstrong --          MR. McCARTAN:  -- where the conviction hasbeen invalidated for that reason.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But in the race context, itis a dismissal of the prosecution itself.  Isn't it?          MR. McCARTAN:  Yes, Your Honor.  It might bethe same here.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- with Harlow here.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  My -- my question wasdirected to the First Amendment.          MR. McCARTAN:  For the First Amendment.  No,I'm not aware of -- certainly no decisions of thisCourt, and I think the only cases arise --JUSTICE SCALIA: Well -- well, surely the 481111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425prosecution --          MR. McCARTAN:  -- in the circuit courts ofappeals, Your Honor.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Surely the prosecution wouldgo ahead if there were probable cause.  No?  No?  Imean, suppose it was brought up during the prosecution.          MR. McCARTAN:  Well, the question --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You mean to say if there was-- if there was perfect probable cause for theprosecution, that you can stop the prosecution in itstracks by -- by an allegation of the First Amendmentviolation?          MR. McCARTAN:  You can move for dismissal ofthe charges.          But look, as far back as 1886, this Court --this Court found a violation of the Equal ProtectionClause in a racially motivated prosecution in asituation where there was clearly probable cause and,indeed, overwhelming evidence of guilt for violation ofa facially neutral statute.  In United States againstArmstrong, the existence of probable cause did notstand as a bar to the selective prosecution claims.          JUSTICE BREYER:  But that -- that's true.  Inow think we're making some progress.  I don't think itis quite a qualified immunity.  I think it's possible491111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425and don't -- I'm putting words in your mouth and denythem if I am.  One, he's convicted, no case.  Two, noprobable cause, everybody agrees there's a case.Three, now there is probable cause, but he's acquitted.Okay?          MR. McCARTAN:  That's this case.          JUSTICE BREYER:  In that circumstance,suppose you say we cannot even allow discovery.  Youdon't even get to discovery on your retaliatory motiveunless you show clearly, question mark, or unless youshow likely, question mark, that the investigator notonly retaliated, but he retaliated under conditionswhere any reasonable person would have known that whathe was doing was contrary to the Constitution.          MR. McCARTAN:  Exactly, Your Honor.  That --          JUSTICE BREYER:  And if you don't show thatas a -- as a threshold, you don't even get discovery.          MR. McCARTAN:  We don't -- that is exactlythe Harlow standard.  That is exactly the standard thatwas applied in Crawford-El against Britton as the firststep in the stage of developments in that case.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  But if you turn the Harlowstandard around -- I mean, you're -- you're making the-- the negation of the Harlow standard the screeningdevice --501111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. McCARTAN: Exactly.2 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- in Justice Breyer's3 example.4 MR. McCARTAN: Exactly.5 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.6 MR. McCARTAN: That's the threshold7 determination in a Bivens action of this kind.89 1887 caseJUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. McCartan, what was theor 1880 --MR. McCARTAN:  Yick Wo against Hopkins.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yick Wo.10 11 1213 Armstrong.14 MR. McCARTAN: No, no. Armstrong --15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yick Wo.JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought you said16 MR. McCARTAN: -- much more recently, but17 Yick Wo against Hopkins.18 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought it was --19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let -- let me ask you this.20 Suppose the law enforcement official -- the postal21 inspectors bring the prosecution to the prosecutor22 because of their disagreement with his First Amendment23 views. The prosecutor said, I don't care about the24 First Amendment views. I'm glad you brought this to25 me. I'm going to prosecute because there's probable511111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 cause here and this is a bad actor. What results?2 MR. McCARTAN: The result is that's a3 question of causation, Your Honor, if there is4 evidence.5 67 here with8 whether the independent act of the prosecutor somehow9 immunizes that conduct is a question of fact for theJUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's why --MR. McCARTAN:  Yes.  If there is evidencerespect to retaliation, then the question of10 trier of fact in the case. If the action --1112 said, you13 -- you're14 But now that it's here, I have my own independent15 interest in going ahead.16 MR. McCARTAN: That's the evidence the17 Government can bring forward when the burden of proof18 shifts upon a showing of an illegal or unconstitutional19 motive for bringing the prosecution to begin with.20 That's the kind of evidence the Government would21 present to show that the prosecution would have taken22 effect in any --23 JUSTICE SOUTER: And if the burden does shift24 that way --25 MR. McCARTAN: Exactly.521111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose the prosecutorshouldn't have brought this to me because you-- you're motivated by the First Amendment.￼1 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- wouldn't it be consistent2 with the screening mechanism that Justice Breyer3 suggested and -- and that you accepted? Wouldn't --4 wouldn't the -- the -- when the burden shifts, wouldn't5 the obligation be on -- on the point of substance, as6 opposed to the point of -- of screening, not to show7 that the -- that the prosecutor would have brought the8 prosecution anyway, but to show that the investigator9 would have acted to procure that prosecution anyway?10 So you would have parallel standards.11121314 immunity, 15MR. McCARTAN:  Exactly.JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.MR. McCARTAN:  Because the prosecutor hascannot be a defendant in the case.JUSTICE SOUTER:  All right.  But just -- Ito nail this --MR. McCARTAN:  No, absolutely.JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- to make sure I understand16 just want 171819 it. So you're -- you're modifying your position of a20 minute ago in which you said the standard would be21 would the prosecution have been brought anyway, and22 you're now saying, which I think would be consistent23 with your answer to Justice Breyer, the -- the question24 is would the investigators have tried to procure the25 prosecution anyway. And do I understand you correctly,531111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 and -- and have you changed your position?2 MR. McCARTAN: Well, I think that is a3 significant distinction, Your Honor, but I think we4 have to establish that they procured the prosecution5 and that it did proceed by reasons of the illegal6 motivation and not for some independently objective7 standard.8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right, because the9 prosecutor could have gotten a lot of other information10 from other people.11 MR. McCARTAN: Absolutely.12 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you're not going to13 throw out the prosecution just because this one piece14 of information was bad.15 JUSTICE SOUTER: So it's a dual --16 MR. McCARTAN: Consider too what the facts of17 record are here. This prosecutor was a complicit18 conduit in this action. He admitted in the presence of19 a grand jury witness that he couldn't care less about20 the guilt or innocence of these people. He just wanted21 a conviction so he could obtain a lucrative position in22 private practice. I understand he is still a23 prosecutor at this time. But that decision of the24 prosecutor, based upon facts of that kind, has no25 probative value whatsoever in terms of the independent541111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 action that might have broken the chain of causation in2 a case of this kind.3 Nor does the indictment of the grand jury4 have any probative value because exculpatory evidence5 was withheld from the grand jury. And I think in6 determining the value of the grand jury's action, you7 have to really determine not only what was presented to8 the grand jury, but also what was withheld from9 examination.10 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I go back to one11 question Justice O'Connor asked you earlier? To what12 extent are there -- is there precedent out there in13 other courts that have decided this very issue? Are14 there -- is there precedent for what you're asking us15 to do?16 MR. McCARTAN: There -- there is precedent in17 the courts of appeals, Your Honor. The cases, I think,18 are cited in our brief where prosecutions have been19 invalidated based upon violations of constitutional20 rights.21 JUSTICE STEVENS: But a violation of First22 Amendment rights or --23 MR. McCARTAN: First Amendment rights. I24 think that is the case. Not cited in our brief. But25 there are cases to that effect.551111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE STEVENS:  And -- and were those casesin which the prosecution itself was brought to a halt,or were they post-prosecution damage actions?          MR. McCARTAN:  Post-prosecution.  Not post-prosecution damage actions but appeals, direct appeals,to invalidate the conviction --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  The conviction.          MR. McCARTAN:  -- based upon the violation --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But is there any precedentfor a damage action of this kind?          MR. McCARTAN:  Well, Bivens is.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, but not quite.Bivens isn't exactly like that.  This is FourthAmendment.          So is there -- is there precedent for adamage action brought on the theory that theprosecution was brought for -- to retaliate for FirstAmendment speech?          MR. McCARTAN:  I'm not aware, Your Honor, ofany precedents --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  I'm not either.          MR. McCARTAN:  -- in the three circuits whereprobable cause is not a bar to an action of that kind.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Now, that -- that means oneof two things:  either what you're arguing for is not561111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425going to bring a flood of litigation, or everyone hasassumed that probable cause is a -- is a requirement.          MR. McCARTAN:  Well, I think it would be theformer rather than the latter, Your Honor, sinceprobable cause does not distinguish between what may bean unconstitutional act on the part of the Governmentand one that might be motivated by a legitimategrievance.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but -- but I'm notsure that that proposition has been established in thecases.          MR. McCARTAN:  No, Your Honor, and that's whyI think this case is before this Court at this time.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Neither -- neither doesabsolute immunity for the prosecutor distinguishbetween whether the prosecutor was acting justillegally or just acting unconstitutionally.  I mean,yes.          MR. McCARTAN:  If I may --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You apply the same rulethere.          MR. McCARTAN:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.  Isthat -- was that an observation or a question?          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, well, your -- yourpoint that -- that there -- there has to be a571111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 difference between whether there's a constitutional2 violation or not in this context seems to me not well3 taken because we don't make that distinction in the4 context of giving absolute immunity to the prosecutor.5 We don't6 when he's78 -- questioned whether the prosecution was procured for9 unconstitutional reasons, the immunity of thesay he doesn't have absolute immunity when --been guilty of a constitutional violation.MR. McCARTAN:  But as Justice Souter brought10 prosecutor has nothing to do with the reasons for which11 the prosecution is brought. It only protects him from12 civil damage liability. The investigators themselves13 have no such immunity. It is qualified.14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. But the point15 remains that if in the prosecutorial context that the16 immunity exists whether or not there's a constitutional17 violation, then that teaches us that the same rule18 should apply to this case. That was Justice Scalia's19 --20 MR. McCARTAN: No. I think that is the21 difference, Your Honor, between absolute and qualified22 immunity. The Court has given absolute immunity only23 to those functions that are so intimately associated24 with the judicial process, that they have to give25 immunity to those people, otherwise there would be an581111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 unjust interference with --2 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question?3 Maybe I should ask Mr. Kneedler. But am I correct in4 assuming that even if you should lose on the issue that5 we're faced with today, the case would, nevertheless,6 go forward because you would still seek to prove an7 absence of probable cause?8 MR. McCARTAN: Well, certainly that would be9 a question for the jury, Your Honor, absence of10 probable cause.11 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but the case wouldn't12 be over if you lose here.13 MR. McCARTAN: Well, it depends on what14 ground we would lose here. If the Court went on to15 decide the sufficiency of the allegations in a Bivens-16 type case, which I don't think it should and which the17 Court declined the invitation to do so in Harlow, then18 we would not lose. If you did --1920 that, Mr. 212223 malicious24 analog for the analysis of cases of this kind?25 The interests that are protected by the First591111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-JUSTICE SCALIA:  I wouldn't worry a lot about--MR. McCARTAN:  All right.May I say one word about the tort ofprosecution, which I say is not a proper￼1 Amendment are far different from those that are2 remedied by the tort of malicious prosecution, and the3 injury to which is of far greater magnitude than what4 the common law sought to address by the tort of5 malicious prosecution. The tort of a malicious6 prosecution tells us nothing about the interests7 protected by the First Amendment. It remedies8 different interests. It is not a proper analog and,9 therefore, shouldn't be involved in definition of what10 the First Amendment rights may be.11 If you look at those cases where the Court12 has referenced the common law in determining how13 constitutional rights should be remedied, they have14 been situations where the interests protected at common15 law are identical to those that are protected by the16 particular constitutional provision that is involved.17 A good example is Wilson against Arkansas, Fourth18 Amendment situation, the question of whether the knock-19 and-announce principle of common law should be20 incorporated into the reasonableness determination of21 the Fourth Amendment. The interest protected by the22 common law in that situation against unreasonable23 searches and seizures was identical to the interest24 protected by the Fourth Amendment. For that reason,25 the Court said that should be taken into consideration601111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425in determining the reasonableness of the action underthe Fourth Amendment.          JUSTICE BREYER:  I'd like to ask you oneother question.  Suppose you win on this on the groundswe've been discussing.  What happens in the middle ofthe trial when a defendant wants to say the same thing? Can he avoid conviction by showing the same thing?          MR. McCARTAN:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.          JUSTICE BREYER:  What happens when the sameclaim is made in the middle of a trial that I --whether I'm guilty or innocent?  I haven't beenconvicted yet, and I want to show that this prosecutionwouldn't have been brought in the absence of theretaliatory motive.  Can he make that claim in themiddle ofenough totrial or not?MR. McCARTAN:  Well, if he were foolishmake such a claim --JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, no, he believes it.MR. McCARTAN:  I can't believe that ain a criminal prosecution who is acquitted indefendanta subsequent civil suit --          JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  He's not acquitted.          MR. McCARTAN:  Oh, I'm sorry, Your Honor.You say he's not acquitted.JUSTICE BREYER: He's in the middle of trial 611111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 and he wants to say --2 MR. McCARTAN: Well, I don't think he'd be in3 the middle of trial under Heck against Humphrey.4 JUSTICE SOUTER: It's the criminal trial.5 JUSTICE BREYER: It's a criminal trial.6 JUSTICE SOUTER: The original criminal trial.7 JUSTICE BREYER: He's in a criminal trial,8 and what he wants --9 MR. McCARTAN: This is not a civil action for10 damages.11 JUSTICE BREYER: No.12 MR. McCARTAN: This is a criminal case.13 JUSTICE BREYER: They read our opinion which14 holds in your favor. Then the next thing is in -- in15 the criminal cases the defense lawyers say, hey, I -- I16 think my client wouldn't be here today were it not that17 the FBI had a retaliatory motive.18 MR. McCARTAN: That would not suffice.19 JUSTICE BREYER: Because?20 MR. McCARTAN: And that was the whole purpose21 of Harlow, mere --22 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. They're going23 to show exactly the elements that we write in our24 opinion.25MR. McCARTAN: If the -- if the defendant in 621111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that case had established evidence tending to show the2 essential elements of the claim, it would present a3 question for the court, but I think the court would use4 the admission against interest as a basis for paying no5 attention 67 McCartan. 89 10 11 1214 application of the Harlow qualified immunity standard.15 With all respect, I don't think that that would really16 work at all because if -- if the point is that it would17 be unconstitutional to bring a prosecution only because18 of protected First Amendment activity, that could be19 taken as a given and still be enormous inquiry into20 what actually happened between the investigator and the21 prosecutor, what the real motivation was, what the22 prosecution's policies were. That is the concern we23 have for the post hoc inquiry into the process.24 And not only that, it isn't just the25 discovery.

KNEEDLER:  Thank you, Justice Stevens.I'd like to respond to Justice Breyer's 13 suggestion that this could all be solved by an￼1 have on law enforcement generally if police officers2 operate under the assumption that if the prosecution3 fails, they will be subject to civil liability, which4 is exactly what Blackstone said, as this Court quoted5 in Dinsman v. Wilkes.6 The reason for the rule is that it would be a7 very great discouragement to public justice if8 prosecutors, who have a tolerable ground of suspicion,9 were liable to be sued at law whenever their10 indictments miscarried.11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we're not talking12 about prosecutors there --13 MR. KNEEDLER: No, but -- but that included14 complaining witnesses. That -- that was what15 prosecutor meant at common -- at common law. And16 there's no reason to grope for some sort of screen17 because the common law furnishes it. The tort of18 malicious prosecution is what this Court relied upon in19 Heck v. Humphrey for the favorable termination rule,20 that you could not bring a 1983 suit unless the21 conviction had been set aside and the proceeding was22 terminated in favor of the plaintiff.23 That same tort, that tort of malicious24 prosecution, contains the probable cause requirement to25 guard against an objective screen, to guard against the641111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 very thing that Blackstone was worried about and that2 this Court noticed in -- in the Dinsman case. And that3 is, that it is important not to have law enforcement4 officers be chilled from the important function of5 furnishing information to prosecutors.6 And this Court's decision in Armstrong7 imposed an important objective test that you have to8 show that there's somebody similarly situated before9 you even inquire into prosecutorial motives. You have10 to show an objective factor that someone else was11 similarly situated. Respondent's position would offer12 no such -- no such protection.13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about the judge14 granting a motion to quit at the close of the15 Government's evidence? Why isn't that objective?16 MR. KNEEDLER: Because at -- at common law --17 and I think this was an important insight. At common18 law, it was not even evidence of the absence of19 probable cause because a judgment of acquittal turns on20 the determination that a factfinder -- a reasonable21 fact finder could not find beyond a reasonable doubt22 that the defendant had actually committed the crime.23 Probable cause is a very different standard, which is24 whether it would lead a reasonable, cautious, prudent25 person to believe that a crime had been committed.651111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425That is the --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I wasn't --          MR. KNEEDLER:  An acquittal does not --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Your opponent says -- saysthere is no probable cause requirement.  You are now onthere's no objective test.  It's all subjective.  Isuggest that there could be an objective test.  This isnot going to the probable cause question.  Objectivetest?  Was this case thrown out at the close of theGovernment's evidence?          MR. KNEEDLER:  But -- but my -- my point wasat common law, that the wisdom of the courts was that-- that that wasn't even evidence of a -- that should-- that -- that shouldn't allow the suit to go forwardbecause it was a sufficient guard -- protection for theprosecutors.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.          The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 12:19 p.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)1111 14th Street, NW Suite 40066 1-Washington, DC 20005
