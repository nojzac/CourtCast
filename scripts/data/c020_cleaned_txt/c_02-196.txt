GELLERON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. GELLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court:This case concerns the applicability of theContract Disputes Act to contracts between National Park Service and the private concessioners who contract to provide visitor services and to operate and maintain facilities in more than 100 of our national parks.QUESTION: Mr. Geller, I have a couple of preliminary questions.First of all, this is a facial challenge made by the National Park Hospitality Association, I take it. How is the claim ripe for adjudication? Has the association been injured actually? There's no case pending.MR. GELLER: Your Honor, to begin with, let me say that as to this facial challenge point, this -- this was an argument that was never made below. It was not made in the district court. It was not made in the court31111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425of appeals. It was not made in the opposition to certiorari.QUESTION: Is it one that we're precluded from concerning ourselves with?MR. GELLER: Well, I'm not sure it's a jurisdictional issue.QUESTION: Right.MR. GELLER: So it -- it may well be waived. But let me also say quickly that I think thiswhole --QUESTION: Mr. Geller, I think that -- I think the ripeness issue --MR. GELLER: Yes, I was going to address ripeness.QUESTION: -- subsists whether or not it's a facial challenge.MR. GELLER: Right. I was going to address ripeness separately, Justice Scalia. In terms of this facial/as-applied, this is an APA challenge to a regulation. I'm not aware that the Court has really used this facial/as-applied nomenclature --QUESTION: Okay.MR. GELLER: -- in that -- in that context. After all, under the APA, the question is whether a -- an -- a regulation is arbitrary or capricious or contrary41111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425to law. Here we have a regulation that categorically states no NPS -- no National Park Service concession contracts are subject to the CDA. If there -- there are, in fact, some such contracts that are subject to the CDA, as we believe there are, then that regulation is arbitrary and capricious. The agency should have to go back and draft a more refined regulation.QUESTION: Is that -- is that the standard for ripeness --or--MR. GELLER: I --QUESTION: -- whether the regulation is arbitraryMR. GELLER: No, no, no. I --QUESTION: Why is this any different -- you contend that the agency has no authority to speak authoritatively on this -- on this issue anyway. And therefore, this regulation, as I understand your -- your position, is -- is of no more effect than the agency's announcement of what its litigating position will be.￼MR. GELLER: Not quite, QUESTION: All right. MR. GELLER: I'm tryingdistinguish the facial/as-applied O'Connor raised from the ripeness to in just a minute.51111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005Justice Scalia.to -- I'm trying to point that Justice question, which I'll get1 This is not a -- a -- there was an as-applied2 challenge, to begin with, made in the district court.3 This is not a facial challenge in the sense that we're4 asking the Court to strike down the regulation based on5 hypotheticals or on factual situations that may never6 arise. We know what these concessions contracts look7 like. The NPS has issued standard concessions contracts.8 It seems to us rather easy to determine whether the9 services that are called for in those contracts bring the10 contracts within the -- within the CDA. So I don't think11 there's anything to this facial challenge.12 QUESTION: Well, presumably there are many13 different kinds of concession contracts. Some might be14 covered; some might not.15 MR. GELLER: Well, I don't think so, Justice16 O'Connor, because there are standard concessions17 contracts. They're in the record and it's clear that they18 call for certain types of services. And we think it's19 clear that the Court, as the two lower courts did, can20 determine whether those contracts call for the procurement21 of services that would bring them within the CDA or call22 for the repair or maintenance of real property.23 Now --24 QUESTION: How many -- what are there? 1025 standard concession contracts?61111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. GELLER: Three. There are, I think, three.2 QUESTION: Three?3 MR. GELLER: And they all call for the same4 types of services at national parks. There are -- there5 are copies in the -- in the record.6 Now, in terms of your ripeness argument, Justice7 Scalia, once again, the -- the Government never made any8 suggestion that this case was not ripe below. The reason9 it's not unripe is that the standard concession contracts10 and the contracts that, in fact, the NPS is putting out11 for bid incorporate within them the statement that these12 contracts are not subject to the CDA. The NPHA and its13 members need to know now, in terms of deciding whether to14 bid on certain contracts, what their rights are under15 those contracts, and therefore --16 QUESTION: But how -- how does it hurt you to --17 in the present posture, as I understand it, the18 contracts -- whatever it's called -- the ICBA decides19 these cases in your favor. So in the -- in the setting of20 a concrete dispute, the contracting officer rules against21 one of the concessionaires. The concessionaires goes to22 that board if they want to and the board will rule, at23 least on the jurisdictional point, that -- that the24 Contracts Dispute Act does apply. So how are you hurting25 by--71111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. GELLER: We are harmed, Justice Ginsburg,2 because it is important for the concessioners to know, at3 the time that they're deciding whether to bid on a4 contract and -- and the time they're deciding how much to5 bid on a contract, what their rights are under that6 contract. It's a pre-bid -- it's a solicitation in7 the--8 QUESTION: That would be the same case if9 agency simply announced, our litigating position inwhichthe11 Contract Disputes Act.these 10 contracts is going to be that they are not covered by theMR. GELLER: Yes, but the --QUESTION: You'd be in exactly the same121314 position. 151617 to sue? 1819 provision20 incorporates the regulation that states that they are not21 subject to the CDA. So this is a proper challenge to the22 solicitation as including an illegal term. The contracts,23 on their face by incorporating this regulation, say you24 have no rights under the CDA. It seems to us -- and we25 think the law is clear, although the Government never made81111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005MR. GELLER: And we would be --QUESTION: Would -- would you have the ability￼MR. GELLER: We would be -- because it is a of these contracts, Your Honor, that1 this challenge, so it's not been briefed -- that the2 concessioners have a right to know at the outset, in3 deciding whether or not to bid, whether the Government is4 right in asserting that they have no rights under the CDA5 if they enter into these --6 QUESTION: Well, if it's an invalid provision,7 could the contracting party simply contract and then go8 into court later on and say, well, this clause is9 unenforceable?10 MR. GELLER: Well, I don't know, Justice11 Kennedy. You would be signing a contract that agrees to12 the provision in the contract that says that you have no13 rights enforceable under the CDA.14 But beyond that, the Government has taken the15 position you have no rights enforceable under the CDA. So16 it's not clear how you would follow through on your rights17 under that --18 QUESTION: Well --19 QUESTION: If you're -- if you're right,20 Mr. Geller, I suppose your client could go into court and21 ask for a declaratory judgment, even though there's22 nothing in the contract saying, we want to find out which23 provision of -- as to review applies to us.24 MR.

GELLER: But there is a --QUESTION: -- I might have an argument down the8 line and I want to know where I want to go. That seems to9 me--10 MR. GELLER: But -- but, Justice Kennedy, the --11 QUESTION: -- speculative. I just don't see the12 harm to your client in waiting.13 MR. GELLER: The harm, Your Honor, is in not14 knowing, at the time you're being asked to bid on15 contracts, what your rights are under those contracts.16 QUESTION: So it's --17 MR. GELLER: It's like any other provision.18 QUESTION: Is it established -- I mean, my -- my19 guess is it is, but -- but if the Government, the Defense20 Department, any other Department, presents a -- a private21 individual with a contract with 14 conditions and one of22 those conditions, in the view of the private person, is23 unlawful, not authorized by statute, contrary to statute,24 that that person, before bidding on the contract, can go25 to court and say, I would like this set aside as unlawful.101111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200057￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. GELLER: I think that there is a -- QUESTION: Is there authority on that?MR. GELLER: I think that there's -- QUESTION: If there is authority on that, Iguess that's the end of it. You're right.MR. GELLER: Yes, I think there is authorityunder -- under the -- under the Tucker Act, which is one of the provisions of -- that we cited in the complaint, that allows you to bring challenges to bid solicitations on the ground that they --QUESTION: And these regulations are incorporated into the contract.MR. GELLER: And these -- these are -- absolutely regulations are incorporated into the contract.QUESTION: What is the authority, Mr. Geller? You said there is --MR. GELLER: I think it's section 1491. I mean, it -- it is one of the provisions that we relied on in the -- in the complaint in this case to bring this challenge.And I might say to the Court --QUESTION: Is there -- is there any case that supports this particular --MR. GELLER: Yes, there are, but -- but I was about to say, Mr. Chief Justice, that this -- that the111111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Government has never challenged ripeness, and that's not suggest -- it is not to suggest that it's not something that this Court can consider, but I think it's unfair to decide that issue on the -- when it hasn't been fully briefed by the parties. It's never been challenged at any time in this case.QUESTION: Unless it force -- unless the failure to consider it forces us to decide a case on -- on facts that we find, you know, rather amorphous.MR. GELLER: But they're not amorphous, Justice Scalia --QUESTION: That's the purpose of the ripeness doctrine --MR. GELLER: -- because --QUESTION: -- to make it easier for us to decide the case.MR. GELLER: I'm not suggesting the Court doesn't have the authority to do it. I'm suggesting the issue has not been briefed, that we did present the Tucker Act as the basis for jurisdiction in the Court --QUESTION: Then is the issue before us -- MR. GELLER: Excuse me?QUESTION: Is the issue before us whether thethree contracts that are in the record are procurement contracts within the meaning of the statute?121111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR.

I mean, what -- MR. GELLER: For example --QUESTION: -- what's at stake?MR.

We broughtan APA challenge to the regulation, as well as a Tucker Act challenge and a pre-bid solicitation challenge to the inclusion of these -- this -- this illegal term in the -- in the contracts.QUESTION: But isn't it the case that unless you have an -- an APA issue, there's nothing else that you can litigate at this point? I mean, if the only thing that you have to complain about is that they want to put a term in a contract that you think they shouldn't be putting in, it's up to you to decide whether you want to contract it on those terms or not.MR. GELLER: No, because I think under the law we're entitled to challenge that solicitation as illegal. We have to bid on these contracts, we're entitled to know --QUESTION: No, but at this stage of the game, they're not claiming that their regulation is -- is what they call a legislative regulation.MR. GELLER: They are claiming that that is the position that they're going to take and that it is entitled to some level of deference.QUESTION: Well --191111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. GELLER: That footnote clearly says that it is entitled to some level of deference.QUESTION: And --MR. GELLER: This is clearly the position, and it's been upheld by the D.C. Circuit. There's no reason to suggest they're not going to adamantly enforce their -- their views.QUESTION: But then -- but if the case isn't ripe and we should so hold, I assume the appropriate thing to do would be to vacate the D.C.

But my notion was that in order to have a pre-enforcement challenge, you had to have a pretty strong claim that you are hurting now, as they were, if they didn't -- if they spent all that money.MR. GELLER: Yes. Abbott Laboratories is -- is obviously an APA case. I think we could meet that standard because we need to know now whether we should bid on these contracts.But there's a separate body of law involving solicitations for Government contracts is what I'm saying to the Court.￼think.QUESTION: And does that get you --QUESTION: That -- that's your stronger card IMR.

The two really overlap because the regulation is incorporated into the contract.221111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Was there any finding in the district court that the inclusion of this provision was critical as to whether or not you'd go ahead with the contract?MR.

GELLER: Yes.13 QUESTION: -- you keep referring to these14 contracts. They're -- actually you're talking about three15 contract forms. You're -- you're not discussing any16 particular --17 MR. GELLER: Well, there are --18 QUESTION: -- bid solicitation. You -- you have19 no particular bid solicitation, do you?20 MR. GELLER: Well, no. Well, that's not21 precisely true, Justice Scalia, because there were bid22 solicitations. In the district court, there were -- there23 were lawsuits brought both by the National Park24 Hospitality Association on behalf of its members, as well25 as -- as lawsuits brought by several concessioners241111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 challenging specific bid solicitations as to them. And --2 and therefore, there was both facial and as-applied, in3 effect, challenges to the -- to the CDA point in the -- in4 the--5 QUESTION: What they say then is the6 Government -- as far as I understand it, the basic point7 is that this is not a procurement contract regardless of8 who's entitled to what deference. And the reason that it9 isn't is because we are not buying anything, and that10 isn't a technical point. That is an important point11 because you and us -- you, the private, and we, the12 Government -- are both in the business of selling things13 to the Government. We need somewhat more control over the14 interpretation of these contracts. And that's why the15 number of procedures you have to go through in the parks16 department is greater, and all the things that you don't17 like about it are things we do like about it. Namely, we18 get a little bit added control. But that's why19 legitimately these are not procurement contracts.20 Now, your point in response to roughly that,21 or--22 MR. GELLER: Well --23 QUESTION: I'm just trying to get you to the24 merits, so I thought I'd --25 MR. GELLER: Yes. I'd like to turn to the251111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 merits. Thank you, Justice Breyer.2 Can I -- I'd like to begin by saying it's purely3 a matter of statutory construction, and we think that the4 statute on its face unambiguously answers the question5 before the Court. And I think it would be helpful if the6 Court could look at section 3(a) of the Contract Disputes7 Act which -- which appears in many places, including8 page 1 of the blue brief, because you'll see that section9 3(a) states that unless specifically excluded therein, the10 CDA applies to, quote, any express or implied contract11 entered into by an executive agency for, among other12 things, the procurement of services or the procurement of13 construction, repair, or maintenance of real property.14 QUESTION: The reason that doesn't help you is15 because --16 MR. GELLER: The --17 QUESTION: -- the question is what's18 procurement.19 MR. GELLER: Well, I'm not sure that that's20 necessarily the question, but let me address it this way,21 Your Honor.22 The National Park Service does not contend that23 its concessions contracts are not contracts within the24 meaning of the CDA. It doesn't contend that it's not an25 executive agency. And the NPS doesn't contend that any261111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 provision of the CDA or, for that matter, any other2 Federal statute specifically excludes these contracts from3 the -- from the CDA. And, Justice Breyer, the NPS really4 doesn't even take issue with the fact that these5 concessions contracts procure services and procure the6 construction, repair, and maintenance of real property.7 In other words, every single statutory requirement on the8 face of the statute would seem to be satisfied --9 QUESTION: But I thought they did challenge that10 these are -- that it's procurement.11 MR. GELLER: They do not challenge, Your Honor,12 that -- that these contracts procure services --13 QUESTION: In the -- in the sense of procurement14 as used in Government contracting?15 MR. GELLER: Well, I think that's the issue in16 the case. The Government claims --17 QUESTION: That's -- that's the issue in the18 case.19 MR. GELLER: The Government --20 QUESTION: I tried to --21 MR. GELLER: And I would like to turn to that22 now because the Government claims that these contracts are23 not within the protection of the CDA. And why? Its24 entire argument amounts to the following.25 The Government says that the word procurement271111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 and the phrase, procurement contract, we are told, have a2 universally understood and well-settled meaning. And they3 tell us that to qualify as a procurement contract, the4 Government says, an acquisition must be for the direct use5 and benefit of the Government and it must be paid for with6 what the Government calls Government funds.7 Now, the first thing to be said, Justice Breyer,8 about the Government's argument is that it is a complete9 invention. It is a complete invention. No Federal10 statute defines the word procurement or the word,11 procurement contract, to include the two requirements that12 the Government tells us are essential. In fact, the13 Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act -- the Government14 cites lots and lots of --15 QUESTION: Well, the word procurement has a16 natural meaning. If they -- if they have a concessionaire17 to come and sell balloons on the Fourth of July, they18 don't say they've procured some balloons. They say19 they've arranged for some balloons.20 MR. GELLER: Well, you'd say arranged. You21 could say they procured having someone sell balloons at22 the Fourth of July.￼2324 Act -- 25The -- the Office of Federal Procurement Policy QUESTION: No, but that -- that -- that's not281111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the usual meaning of -- of procure, I should think.MR. GELLER: But the -- but there is no statutethat -- the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, which is a companion statute to the CDA, actually has a definition of the word procurement. You wouldn't know it from reading the Government's brief because in their -- it doesn't refer to that, but it contains a definition of the word procurement that does not contain either of the two requirements that the Government tells us are essential to a Government procurement.No court has ever construed the word procurement to include the two requirements that the Government tells us are clearly established and well-settled by Federal procurement --QUESTION: Mr. Geller --QUESTION: What about acquiring -- QUESTION: -- I'm looking at page 19 of theGovernment's brief, and they -- they define procurement. They're taking it from the -- the Federal acquisition regulations to say acquiring by contract with appropriated funds supplies or services by and for the use of the Federal Government. So --MR. GELLER: Yes. That's -- that's not a statute, but let me address that, Justice Ginsburg.First of all, appropriated funds. It is291111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 clear -- and the Government has not challenged the fact --2 that the CDA applies to contracts even when appropriated3 funds are not used. That's clear on the face of the CDA.4 So the Government is forced to come -- come up with this5 new phrase, Government funds, which has, as far as we can6 tell, no basis at all in any prior statute or any Federal7 procurement law. And the fact --8 QUESTION: It does have a basis in just what9 Justice Ginsburg was quoting, 48 C.F.R. 2.101. So they10 say it's not without foundation in the law. What -- what11 that's from is, I take it, it's a memo that -- or a policy12 issued jointly by the Secretary of Defense, the13 Administrator of General Services, and the NPS14 Administrator. So when they have a reg like that, I'd --15 I'd think that it's not so that it isn't somewhere in16 Federal law. It's right there.17 Now, there are some other things there --18 MR. GELLER: But --19 QUESTION: -- that you say are not necessarily20 part of procurement. But that fact that there are other21 things that overstate it doesn't mean this does.22 MR. GELLER: But, Your Honor, there are many23 other -- the Government principally relies on other24 statutes that have the -- have certain provisions like the25 ones they would like to introduce into the CDA in them.301111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425But I think it's quite significant that Congress didn't put these provisions in the CDA.QUESTION: But what about -- he put one in -- in the CDA, 41 U.S.C., section 612(c). It's discussed at the bottomofpage18andthetopofpage19of--ofthe Government's brief. And what it says is that the monetary awards in favor of a contractor will be paid out of the judgment fund and in turn provides for the reimbursement to the judgment fund, quote, by the agency whose appropriations were used for the contract, which would suggest that in all cases --MR. GELLER: I don't think it -- it does not -- QUESTION: -- where there's been a judgment --MR. GELLER: It Justice Scalia. First of incompletely. It also -- QUESTION: Yes,that your --MR. GELLER: Indoesn't suggest that at all,all, they only quote that well, tell me why. I -- I know --inour--￼QUESTION: -- reply brief -- I don't see how the -- the --MR. GELLER: In our reply brief, it says, by such appropriated -- by -- by the appropriations of that agency or such other appropriations as the agency has to get.311111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Now, the NPS is a -- a --QUESTION: But -- but it clearly envisions appropriations, whether they have it already or they have to get it later.MR. GELLER: But the -- the CDA on its face -- and the Government concedes this -- applies to contracts that don't involve appropriated funds agencies.QUESTION: Well, we'll ask the Government about that. That's a -- that's a much more serious point.MR. GELLER: Yes. I think it's clear there's no -- there's no doubt that the CDA applies to any contract whether or not it's an appropriated funds agency or not.Let me just say that in addition to being, I think, totally unsupported as a matter of law, the limitations that the NPS asks this Court to read into the CDA would be completely unworkable as a matter of practice. I think we've already talked about the Government funds point which is, I think, a phrase that they have dreamt up. It has no basis in law, unlike appropriated funds, which is not the case of the CDA.But I think it's also the case that this use or benefit to the Government notion is completely unworkable. If, for example, the NPS were to go out and procure water coolers for use in the Department of Interior building,321111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 the NPS would concede that those would be within the2 Contract Disputes Act because they're -- they're for the3 use and benefit of the Government. If the Government were4 to go out and procure the same water coolers for use on5 the Mall during the Fourth of July, the Court -- the NPS6 would say, well, that's not for the use or benefit of the7 Government. I don't know how you could decide what is for8 the use or benefit of the Government.9 When -- if the Government -- if the NPS issues a10 contract to build a -- the World War II Memorial on the11 Mall, which is now being -- is now happening, is that for12 the use of the public or it is used for the Government?13 We don't think this is a defensible position, and it14 certainly finds no basis in the CDA. We think it's an15 irrational reading of the act that has no support in the16 language or the legislative history or the purpose of the17 statute.18 And I want to say that even if there was a use19 or benefit to the Government limitation in the CDA, we20 think it would -- these contracts would still clearly21 satisfy it because these concessions contracts are being22 let in part to help the Department of Interior, the NPS23 fulfill its statutory mission. If these concessions were24 not there operating these restaurants or guest facilities,25 the NPS would have to operate them themselves in order to331111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425satisfy its -- the statutory requirement that they provide for the use and enjoyment of the national parks. So we don't think it's possible to say that these concession contracts the -- that the NPS is completely indifferent to these concession contracts. They are clearly for the use and benefit not only of the public, but also of the NPS.If the Court has no further questions, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Geller. Mr. Elwood, we'll hear from you.ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. ELWOOD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:QUESTION: Will you tell us why the Government doesn't want the CDA applicable here? I mean, what's -- what's at stake for the Government in not applying it?MR. ELWOOD: Justice -- Justice O'Connor, the reason why the Government doesn't want this applicable here is that the Contract Dispute Act was passed to address specific shortcomings in the remedial scheme that was available for procurement contracts, and because it was designed specifically for those purposes, it have -- has terms that we don't think are appropriate in this context. For example --341111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: But that just doesn't tell me, as a2 practical matter, why the Government doesn't want it3 applicable here.4 MR. ELWOOD: For example, the pre-judgment5 interest remedy. Congress --6 QUESTION: You don't want to pay pre-judgment7 interest.8 MR. ELWOOD: Right, and we don't think it's9 appropriate. Congress provided pre-judgment interest in10 the procurement context because procurement contractors11 would be required to perform under the contract even12 during the pendency of a dispute when they weren't being13 paid. And it was because of that unique position where14 they were both being required to make outlays without15 getting any income that Congress thought that because16 there was a --17 QUESTION: Okay. So at bottom, that's it, the18 pre-judgment interest feature.￼MR. ELWOOD: I -- I think that and because -- other things as well. For example, the purpose one of the purposes of the CDA was to cut1920 there are21 of the --22 through all of these requirements that you exhaust23 administrative remedies, but those simply aren't present24 in the concessions context. Traditionally concessioners25 had a direct right of access to courts, and Congress has351111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425never indicated that they thought the remedial scheme was inadequate for concessioners. And --QUESTION: Is this -- is this claim ripe? And why didn't you ever talk about it below? What's going on? It's -- it comes in such an odd posture. What is the Government's view on that?MR. ELWOOD: The reason why we did not raise this -- why we did not raise this is because we did not raise it below. And as you can tell from the pleadings --QUESTION: Why not?MR. ELWOOD: -- is -- because the CDA was kind of a side show below. It was a relatively small issue and it was just not the focus of the proceedings, as you can tell by the opinion.But I think that the Court has raised validconcerns about the ripeness in this sense. The Court has traditionally said in a pre-enforcement challenge to a regulation that a claim is ripe if it affects primary conduct so that -- so that if they don't comply, they might be held liable. That's the Abbott Labs line of cases.And here this doesn't affect primary conduct. It -- it predominantly just says whether or not -- which forum you're going to have a remedy in.QUESTION: Well, I -- I would agree --361111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: What about this -- what about the --2 the reply? I came in thinking ripeness was a problem, and3 your brother on the other side gave to me what was a very4 convincing answer. What's wrong with that answer?5 MR. ELWOOD: And that is -- the thing is because6 it predominantly just determines which forum you have --7 which forum you bring your claim in, I don't know --8 QUESTION: I know it doesn't affect -- but what9 they're saying is that where the Government offers general10 contracts to the industry and there is a term in all of11 those contracts which, in the view of the industry, is12 unlawful, they -- it's ripe for them to challenge that.13 Now, what I'm afraid here would be that we or you or14 somebody, in deciding whether that's an incorrect15 argument, would upset what could be -- I have no idea if16 it is -- a practice of contractors objecting to terms in17 offered contracts as contrary to law.18 So are you saying now that that is not ripe?19 Are you saying that a contractor who comes into a court20 and objects to a term in a proposed contract as contrary21 to law does not have a claim because it is not ripe? Is22 that the Government's position?23 MR. ELWOOD: No, I don't think that would be our24 position. If it affects their primary --25 QUESTION: No. I would think probably you would371111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 at least want to brief it.2 MR. ELWOOD: Right.3 I think that if it affects their primary4 conduct, if affects what their obligations would be under5 the contract, I think that that claim would be ripe for6 pre-enforcement review. But where it simply determines7 which forum they'll bring the claim in, I don't think it8 would be covered.9 QUESTION: But they said it's the first that's10 at issue here. Now, is it not because -- you heard what11 he said. So --12 MR. ELWOOD: That -- that's correct. But I13 think simply because it determines which forum you bring14 your claim in, I don't think it would be covered. If I15 were --16 QUESTION: So you -- so there's a dispute17 between the two sides on what the case law says as to18 whether -- and it isn't even a general -- a general attack19 upon the form of -- upon a form contract. But as we20 understand from petitioners, there were particular bids21 outstanding that were challenged because -- because of a22 term in them that -- that was claimed to be unlawful. And23 it is your position that you cannot challenge a particular24 bid because of an unlawful term unless that unlawful term25 affects your primary conduct.381111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. ELWOOD: No. If it affects something other, I think, than the forum in which it was brought, I mean, if it affects what you think your obligations will be,if -- if it affects the price that you think you should pay or that you should bid on a contract, I think that that would be --QUESTION: Well, it -- it does on your analysis. MR. ELWOOD: -- subject to pre-enforcementreview.QUESTION: Doesn't it? I mean, you said one of the things that is important is pre-judgment interest. So I -- I suppose their liability under the contract is going to be affected by -- by the correctness of the reg.MR. ELWOOD: I don't think their liability --QUESTION: Their primary conduct won't be, but their potential liability, if there is a contract dispute, would be.MR. ELWOOD: Your Honor, I confess that I am not sure if the Government gets pre-judgment interest under theCDAornot. Butifitwere--if--ifitsimplyran to the contractors, I think that -- that the prospective interest on a claim that has not even arisen yet seems a little vague --QUESTION: Why is that vague? I mean, they -- they have to make a bid. They have accountants. These391111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 are big companies. They calculate everything down to the2 finest penny, and -- and they say, you know, we take into3 account whether we're going to get pre-judgment interest,4 which we -- if we have a dispute. And by the way, we have5 one dispute every 3 hours, and so it's a lot of money to6 us. And we will bid $42.36 less if we're not getting7 the -- whatever. All right? So they work it all out.8 They have accountants who do it.9 And so, if that's so -- of course, if it isn't10 so, it's a different story. But they've said something11 like that's so.12 MR. ELWOOD: I think it -- it would turn on --13 in that case I just don't think that in advance you can14 say with enough sort of concreteness and specificity that15 you know how much a particular claim -- the -- the as-yet16 unfiled, unrealized contract claims would be worth. You17 could say --18 QUESTION: But, Mr. Elwood, isn't it really --19 isn't a waiver of pre-judgment interest comparable to a20 waiver of punitive damages, for example, which if you21 insist on it, would affect the -- the amount one would bid22 for a contract? I don't understand why you say it's worth23 nothing.￼24 25MR. ELWOOD: I mean --QUESTION: I mean, it's something -- if the401111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 Government is willing to fight about it here and insist --2 and put it in every contract, it must be of value to the3 Government.4 MR. ELWOOD: What is actually -- just if I could5 clarify this. What is put into the contract is just a6 general term that applicable law will apply and because7 applicable law includes all regulations, it is8 incorporated that way. It doesn't specifically include a9 CDA waiver or anything of that sort.10 QUESTION: So the contract itself does not11 specify that the CDA does not apply.12 MR. ELWOOD: No. It just says applicable law13 governs the contract.14 But I think it's just a matter --15 QUESTION: And is it -- is it your view, since16 you said your -- your interpretation now of the -- the17 position that the Park Service is taking that it -- it18 doesn't constitute law? How can it constitute law? First19 of all, the Contract Dispute Act is not within the Park20 Service bailiwick. It isn't -- as you concede, it isn't21 the -- doesn't administer this act. So does that22 regulation constitute any kind of law?23 MR. ELWOOD: I think that that's a valid concern24 because our position is that this is basically just an25 interpretive rule announcing the position that the Park411111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Service will take and the Park -- and the position that the Park Service employees will take in administering it. QUESTION: So you're saying -- you -- you claim that this provision is not incorporated in the contracts.Is that the position the Government is taking?MR. ELWOOD: I think -- honestly, JusticeScalia, I think it's just -- it's a -- it's a new proposition for me, and I think that a good argument could be made that it does not include it because it -- it really just represents the position of the National Park Service.QUESTION: Even leaving aside the question of inclusion, what is -- what do you understand your difference to be from the petitioners with respect to the status of the regulation itself? Is there any difference at all?MR. ELWOOD: I don't know that there is a -- a difference with respect to the petitioner's view. It's an interpretive rule that the Park Service has --QUESTION: Have we got any jurisdiction left?MR. ELWOOD: I believe so because it is the announced position. It's not just a policy statement. It is basically a directive to the --QUESTION: Yes, but what's the difference between a policy statement and an announced position?421111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 The -- the point at which each one is going to have2 practical effect is the point at which there is a claimed3 breach and an argument, if there is one, over what the4 remedial process is.5 MR. ELWOOD: Yes, but I think that the only6 difference would be the -- the principal difference would7 be policy statements are more -- involve more variance in8 that they say as a general policy we will do this, whereas9 the -- as an interpretive rule, it just says that we do10 not believe that concession contracts are procurement11 contracts.12 QUESTION: What -- what is the position of the13 Government? Now, I know this is hitting you cold, but I14 think it would be helpful.15 Position one. We have not thought of ripeness16 before, and the case has been argued and submitted on the17 assumption that, for example, the bidding would be18 affected by this term which is incorporated into the19 contract. That's been the assumption, and we see no20 reason to depart from it. It's not jurisdictional. So21 decide the issue we briefed. That's position one.22 Position two. We haven't thought of ripeness23 before, but now that we think about it, we think it's24 quite a serious problem and we're not certain what the --25 what the -- what the issue is in ordinary contracts, and431111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425we're not certain whether it's incorporated. So we think you should say that this case is not ripe.Now, do you take position one, which will mean we perhaps could go to decide the issue for which it wasgranted, ripeness further?MR. ELWOOD: Well, Justice Breyer, it's clearly position of the Court that it is not bound by the failure of the parties to raise it. That's in Reno versusCatholic Social Services, and of course, you can raise it--QUESTION: I'm not asking you what the law is exactly. I'm asking you what's the Government's position.MR. ELWOOD: I -- I think our position would be -- I mean, we -- we filed a brief in opposition and I think, you know, if -- if we can win on ripeness grounds, that's great too.QUESTION: Well, you wouldn't necessarily -- (Laughter.)QUESTION: You wouldn't necessarily win. Imean, I -- I don't know if you would win. I mean -- MR. ELWOOD: Right. We might lose the -- thejudgment of the D.C. Circuit as well, but --QUESTION: You -- you would have to. If it's441111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005been theor do you take position two, which means you see as a big problem here that we ought to look at￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425not ripe, we'd have to vacate it to that extent. But this -- in the D.C. Circuit --QUESTION: Put you back to square one. No --QUESTION: In the D.C. Circuit, this was a giant, one of those typical wholesale attacks on many, many regulations, on the whole -- on the whole rulemaking. Is that correct?MR. ELWOOD: That's correct, Your Honor.QUESTION: And this was just a tiny, tiny piece of a long, long opinion --MR. ELWOOD: That's correct, Your Honor. QUESTION: -- treating -- so maybe just nobodynoticed.QUESTION: It seems unfair to pick it apart in this way. Just a little part of a major opinion.MR. ELWOOD: Well, I think that it -- it just points out the fact that, I mean, they -- they had an awful lot on their plate, and it perhaps eluded them for that reason.QUESTION: Now, the as-applied/facial. Was the as-applied challenges -- did those center on this issue or did they relate to the -- to another issue?MR. ELWOOD: They related to other claims, Justice Ginsburg. Xanterra has characterized their claim as an as-applied claim although they're -- they're not451111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 asking for as-applied review in this case. But if you2 look at their -- their complaint, their complaint involved3 their intention to bid on an as-yet unreleased prospectus.4 And so, in that sense, I don't think that is an as-applied5 change for two -- for two reasons. Not only is there no6 contract dispute, but at the time that the complaint was7 filed, there was no contract. So we think that it would8 be a facial challenge.9 QUESTION: Mr. Elwood, if I can assist you in10 giving the merits here, is it -- is it the case, as the11 petitioners contend, that the Government concedes that not12 all contracts covered by the CDA are contracts in which13 appropriated funds are used?14 MR. ELWOOD: That's correct. To the extent that15 it covers non-appropriated fund instrumentalities, it16 covers contracts that would involve the expenditure of17 non-appropriated funds. Those are, however, Government18 funds, funds of Government entities known as non-19 appropriated fund instrumentalities.20 QUESTION: Well, once you slip off from21 appropriated into -- into Government funds, you don't put22 any -- you don't have any statutory text you can appeal to23 as -- as separating out the CDA from -- from your Park24 Service concessions.25 MR. ELWOOD: I -- I don't agree, Justice Scalia.461111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 Both the -- well, to begin with, just in terms of giving2 an indication of what the commonly accepted meaning of the3 term was at the time, the Commission on Government4 Procurement Reform, which was the -- which was the impetus5 for all of these reforms, defined procurement as purchase6 of product or service for Federal use, which incorporates7 both a -- a notion of expenditure and Federal use. And8 both the -- the 1969 act --9 QUESTION: Yes, but Federal use, of course -- it10 is of use to the Park Service to have facilities available11 to the public. So that doesn't really answer the12 question. The parks -- the Park Service wants parks13 available to the public with services in them, restrooms14 and buildings and restaurants and so forth. Doesn't it?15 So in a sense, it is for the use of the Park Service and16 the Government as well as for the public.17 MR. ELWOOD: It is for the use -- well, it is18 not for the direct use of the National Park Service, and19 that is where the Federal grant and cooperative agreement20 comes in. 8 months before passage of the CDA, Congress21 explained its understanding of what different types of22 instruments would be used for, and it explained in that23 that a procurement contract would be an instrument whose24 principal purpose is the acquisition by purchase, lease,25 or barter of goods or services for the direct use and471111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 benefit of the Government. And --2 QUESTION: Well, it doesn't really say that.3 And the language in the CDA is broad, and presumably this4 was a -- an act that was presumed to have broad5 application.6 MR. ELWOOD: It was presumed to have broad7 application among procurement contracts. There's no8 indication that they did not intend the word procurement9 to have the ordinary meaning that it does in that sense,10 as indicated in the Commission on Government Procurement11 Reform and the way it was used there, as indicated in the12 1969 act creating the commission and the OFPP Act where13 the simple use -- word procurement was understood to14 mean --15 QUESTION: Was -- was there ever any amendment16 offered in Congress to make clear that it didn't apply to17 concession contracts?18 MR. ELWOOD: There was no -- no, there was no19 indication in the entire legislative history that the --20 that concessions came up, and in 1,200 pages of reports on21 both procurement and non-appropriated fund procurement,22 there was not a single mention of -- of -- national parks23 concessions.24 QUESTION: And how long -- at -- at any point25 did the CDA -- was it applied or followed with any481111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 concession contracts, or is this something that has arisen2 recently? Was it used at one point?3 MR. ELWOOD: There are a number of Armed Service4 Board of Contract Appeals that assume CDA jurisdiction,5 and the Board of Contract Appeals of the Department of6 Interior started using it in 1989. But I'm not familiar7 with usage prior to that --8 QUESTION: These are for what concessions?9 PS -- PX concessions, for example?10 MR. ELWOOD: Yes, Justice Scalia.11 QUESTION: Well, why isn't that -- I mean --12 because I was about to ask that question because I thought13 you're drawing the distinction between a concession to14 provide food and hot dogs and amusement to visitors to the15 park, which you say is not covered by the CDA, and it16 seems to me, a contract to provide food and hot dogs17 and -- I don't know -- maybe amusement -- I don't know18 what they have at PX's -- to members of the armed forces.19 Why isn't at least the latter, although it's a concession20 contract, why isn't that clearly for the benefit of the21 Government even -- even in the narrow sense in which you22 use that term?23 MR. ELWOOD: No, Justice Scalia. We would -- we24 would agree that that is for the benefit of the25 Government. It's -- it doesn't involve the expenditure of491111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 Government funds, but it's for the benefit of the2 Government. And for this reason --3 QUESTION: So that would be covered by the CDA.4 MR. ELWOOD: I -- I don't believe it necessarily5 would because it doesn't involve the expenditure of6 Government funds. It's still private contractors coming7 in and being -- and paying the Government for the8 opportunity to do that.9 But as far as the benefit goes, I think agencies10 have a direct interest in providing benefits to their11 employees and especially in the PX example because PX's,12 for example, are basically a fringe benefit for servicemen13 and women and their dependents in that it's -- it's --14 basically access is limited to them. And salary and15 fringe benefits of that sort are how agencies procure16 employees. That is how they attract and retain qualified17 personnel. And in fact, agencies have drawn a distinction18 between benefits provided to employees and benefits19 provided to the entire public --20 QUESTION: But isn't that the --21 QUESTION: You'd say -- it still isn't covered,22 you say, unless the Government pays out cash. Is that23 right?24 MR. ELWOOD: I think that that would be the25 better view, but I think obviously a stronger argument501111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 could be made for concessioners.2 QUESTION: Well, why did you say it was not in3 the legislative history in that respect? What -- what is4 this? You -- you quote in your brief -- I just want a5 little clarification. There's a committee report. The6 Senate report says that, quote, concessions contracts do7 not constitute contracts for the procurement of goods and8 services for the benefit of the Government or otherwise.9 And -- and there's something odd about that statement, but10 I got it out of -- you quoted it. And that seems to be11 the legislative history of the act, and apparently it12 isn't. Where -- what's -- what's the status of that13 particular remark?14 MR. ELWOOD: No. Those are both the -- those15 are committee reports --16 QUESTION: Yes.17 MR. ELWOOD: -- for the 1998 act. So it's part18 of the legislative history.￼1920 history? 2122 know that 2324 contracts 25QUESTION: So why isn't that legislativeMR. ELWOOD: Oh, it is -- it is -- I don'tI understand your question.QUESTION: It says concessions contracts are not for procurement of goods and services.MR. ELWOOD: Oh. I was addressing the -- the511111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425legislative history of the CDA, not the 1998 act. QUESTION: Well, is -- aren't we concerned --oh, the 1998 act is which? That's the --MR. ELWOOD: That is the act -- the currentconcession authority, the current authority under which the National Park Service issues concession contracts. QUESTION: So what we have is in that act --QUESTION: That was an act that said they're -- QUESTION: Yes, I see. I see.QUESTION: -- they're not continuously renewedwith the same --MR. ELWOOD: That's correct. It eliminatedthe --QUESTION: -- provider. It was the act that said, but we're going to terminate these things.MR. ELWOOD: That's correct.QUESTION: When did the Park Service first install this -- when did it first take this position? It wasn't just under the regulations, as I understand it. When did the Park Service take the position that concession contracts were not procurement contracts?MR. ELWOOD: The first time they took that position publicly was in 1979 in a Board of Contract Appeals case, Yosemite Park & Curry Company. The court -- the IBCA, rather, did not address it, though, because it521111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 was actually before the effective date of the CDA, and2 they took it specifically with respect to the CDA there.3 But traditionally -- although it's impossible because of4 absence of institutional memory, traditionally concession5 contracts have not been viewed as procurement contracts by6 the National Park Service.7 QUESTION: But they --8 QUESTION: You indicated that there's a stronger9 argument in some instances than in others for the fact10 that it's a concession. A concession contract can be a11 procurement contract. Does that go back to our basic12 question about ripeness and we don't know what we're13 involved with here? Or can we take these contracts where,14 I take it, they did involve the construction of facilities15 at national parks, et cetera, which does benefit the16 Government in the long term?17 MR. ELWOOD: Well, to the extent that the Court18 thinks that the specific terms of concession contracts and19 what is accomplished under them affects the determination20 of whether or not they're procurements, I think that the21 Court would have some difficulty in saying authoritatively22 whether they all are or an unacceptably high portion of23 them are procurement contracts without having a better24 idea of what is included with them.25 If I could --531111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: But if -- on a case-by-case basis,2 then that would indicate the regulation is deficient3 because the regulation doesn't purport to--touse4 this -- this kind of fine distinction.5 MR. ELWOOD: But still it -- it's something that6 could be addressed in as-applied challenges where you7 could say, in my particular case, where it requires me to8 build a lodge or whatever, this is a procurement contract,9 and under those circumstances it would be very clear10 exactly what was required of the procurement contractor.11 And they could -- they could -- of the concessions12 contractor and they could determine whether or not that13 particular contract was a procurement.14 QUESTION: The regulation -- the regulation15 would then be invalid to that extent.16 MR. ELWOOD: Yes, but the Court has held -- this17 Court has indicated in INS versus National Center for18 Immigrants' Rights, Babbitt versus Sweet Home, and cases19 like that that -- that merely because a regulation is20 invalid in some applications, it will not be invalidated21 on a facial basis.22 If I could just address specifically --23 QUESTION: Mr. Elwood, is there anyplace we24 could look to see how much pre-judgment interest the Park25 Service has had to pay each year? Is it a big-ticket541111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 item?2 MR. ELWOOD: It's not a big-ticket item. The3 only three cases in which the -- the CDA has been applied4 to national park concessions are the three IBCA cases5 mentioned, and in two of those, the Government wound up6 winning on the merits, so there was no pre-judgment7 interest paid. So it's only in that R&R Enterprises case8 that the Government would have paid any pre-judgment9 interest in this case.10 If I could just go to your example, Justice11 Kennedy, about the building of buildings on national12 parklands. I believe that is not a procurement for -- for13 a variety of reasons. First, just as a statistical14 matter, 78 percent of concessions contracts do not involve15 any capital improvements. And that is a very broad term.16 It's much broader than just structures. It's structures,17 unremovable property, and fixtures.18 But on the merits, many concessions contractors19 have been required, since the very beginning of the --20 of -- of concessions, 1872, to require -- they've been21 required to build their own buildings. And historically22 that has not been considered something that the Government23 gets. It doesn't get the benefit of those services24 because it enters the contracts not for purposes of25 getting a building, but because it wishes to have551111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 concessioners provide services to park visitors. And in2 order to do that, it tolerates the building. The National3 Park Service doesn't want buildings in the parks. It4 wants nature in the parks, and it tolerates the buildings5 to the extent that they are used to provide visitor6 services. And I think this comes across in the way these7 are treated by the contract.8 Even though the Government has bare title in9 these buildings, in a very real sense it doesn't buy them.10 Every concessioner who builds a building in the national11 parks under a concessions agreement will have a leasehold12 surrender interest equal to the construction cost of the13 building plus inflation minus depreciation. And they14 cannot be put out of that building by anyone until they15 are paid that leasehold surrender interest; that is, until16 the building essentially is bought. As long as a17 concessioner is operating out of that building, a18 concessioner will hold the leasehold surrender interest,19 not the Government.20 Also, I think it's telling that the form21 contract indicates that if the concessioner ever leaves22 the -- ever abandons the building, ever -- that they have23 constructed, that the Government can require them to knock24 it down and restore the site to its natural -- its natural25 state. That's section 9b of the standard contract and in561111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 the contract that it's in the joint appendix. So again,2 that's an indication that they're not interested really in3 procuring the construction services. They're interested4 in authorizing a concessioner to provide services to5 visitors to the national parks.Finally, I think it's noteworthy that Congress knew that concessioners would be building under the 1998 act, which was enacted against67 obviously8 buildings9 the backdrop of this regulation setting forth the Park10 Service's consistently held view that concessions11 contracts are not procurement contracts. And far from12 displacing that view, they actually seem to embrace it13 both in the text of the act and in the legislative history14 that Justice Breyer mentioned.15 As far as the text of the act goes, I think it's16 telling that -- the different types of language they use17 for both the concessions side of the house and the18 procurement side of the house. On the concessions side,19 they use distinct language that I don't think you're going20 to find in any procurement statute anywhere. Instead of21 saying procure or purchase, they say they -- the -- the22 Park Service can authorize concessioners to provide23 services, and it even specifies that the services will not24 be provided to the Government. It says they're provided25 to visitors, which is obviously very different from571111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 procurement statutes, many of which specifically state2 that the service will be provided to the agency.3 QUESTION: Maybe the Park Service wrote that4 portion of the committee report.5 MR. ELWOOD: No. That -- Justice -- Justice6 Scalia, that's the actual text of the statute.7 QUESTION: Okay.8 MR. ELWOOD: And by contrast with that, the9 actual text of the procurement provisions of the 1998 --10 section 5959, used typical procurement language and11 specified that the Park Service will be benefitting from12 it. It says that the -- that the service can enter into13 management consultant agreements whereby management14 consultants provide services to assist the Secretary in15 administering the program. So it's a contrast both -- I16 think in both ways.17 Finally, one other thing that I think is telling18 is that Congress specifically provided that some of the19 most likely to arise disputes under the act, including20 specifically franchise-free disputes, which I think people21 would think would -- would arise frequently, would be22 subject to mandatory arbitration. And if Congress had23 thought there was an administrative remedy for this under24 the CDA, I just don't think there would be any need for25 them to provide for an -- a mandatory arbitral remedy.581111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Mr. Elwood, is the petitioner right in saying that -- that when the Government sell goods -- sells goods, that comes under the CDA?MR. ELWOOD: That is correct. Under 602(a)(4), the -- when the Government disposes of property that is not -- when the Government -- Government disposes of personal property, those sales are covered by the CDA. However, petitioner has never raised that theory in this Court -- in any court.QUESTION: Those are not procurement contracts, are they?MR. ELWOOD: No, but they -- they don't purport to be. If you look at the CDA, the word procurement is always used in the clause for procurement of services, procurement of construction, repair. And -- and that was tacked on at the end basically because GSA at the time subjected sales contracts to the same dispute clause, that was problematic, that procurement contracts were. But that still -- in order to get coverage under the CDA under petitioner's theory, they still must be a procurement contract or must involve the procurement of services.￼Court.If there are no further questions from theQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Elwood.Mr. Geller, you have 2 minutes remaining.591111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER2 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER3 MR. GELLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.4 The complaint -- the complaint in this case was5 filed under the authority of 28 U.S.C. 1491(b). The Court6 will find that at page 13 of the joint appendix. And7 that -- that statute provides for district court8 jurisdiction to adjudicate challenges to the terms of9 proposed Government contracts. And I think if you look at10 paragraph 62 and 114 of the joint -- of the complaint,11 which is in the joint appendix, you'll see the allegations12 that were13 provision1415 Government makes much of the fact that no, quote,16 Government funds were used here. And I cannot stress17 enough that that is a phrase that they've invented for the18 purposes of this case. It makes much of the fact that the19 concessioners received monies here from the visitors to20 the national park, remit some of it to the NPS as a21 franchise fee, and keep the rest of it. But these22 contracts could just have easily been structured so that23 the NPS got all the money in the first instance, kept some24 of it as a franchise fee, and paid the rest of it back to25 the concessioners. And in fact, some Government601111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005made in the complaint to fall within that of -- of title 28.As to the substance of the CDA claim, the￼1 concessions contracts are written that way. In that case,2 even the Government, I think, would have to concede that3 Government funds were used. We can't believe that the CDA4 coverage of the CDA, these important procedural and5 substantive protections, turns on such flimsy6 determinations as to who gets the money in the first7 instance.8 Now, secondly, we -- we've already talked about9 the fact that so many services are being provided here10 that are for the use and benefit of the Government, as11 well as for the visitors of the national parks.12 But I also want to point out that the Government13 is the sole beneficiary of the contractual provisions in14 virtually every concessions contract requiring the15 construction, repair, and maintenance of facilities in the16 national parks. You know, if the Court will look, for17 example, at page 96 of the joint appendix, which is a -- a18 provision of the Grand Canyon contract that's in the19 record, you'll see there that this contract -- under this20 the contract, the NPS is there procuring maintenance,21 repair, housekeeping, and groundskeeping for all22 concessions facilities. It seems to us if you look at the23 language of that -- of that procurement and compare it to24 section 3(a)(3) of the CDA, which -- which provides that25 CDA coverage for contracts for the procurement of611111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425construction or repair or maintenance of real property, it's impossible to conclude, I think, that this procurement contract doesn't fall within the CDA.Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Geller. The Court wishes supplemental briefs on theissue of ripeness, simultaneous briefs, due 3:00 p.m. Friday.The case is submitted.(Whereupon, at 11:18 a.m., the case in the above-entitled matter was submitted.)￼621111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005
