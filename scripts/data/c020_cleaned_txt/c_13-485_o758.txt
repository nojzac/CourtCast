Wynne.      Mr. Brockman.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM F. BROCKMANON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. BROCKMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      A State's broad power to impose a personalnet income tax on its own residents is grounded in thespecial benefits that a State affords to its ownresidents particularly because they are residents.  Thatis, things like public schools, social servicesprograms, medical assistance services, and of course theright to vote in the process that determines both thelevel of those benefits and the level of taxes that arepaid in return for them.      There is no reason that a State should haveto subordinate this power, this taxing power, justbecause another State, exercising an equally legitimatetaxing power, but on a very distinct ground, is taxing aportion of that income merely because it was earnedwithin that State's borders.3￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      JUSTICE SCALIA:principle that life is not fair, right?MR. BROCKMAN: Life is not fair. Maryland taxes are.(Laughter.)MR. BROCKMAN: Because all residents are treated the same. They are taxed on their entire income regardless of where it is earned.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but as ­­ as your friends on the other side point out in their example at pages 22 to 23 of their brief, if you do the internal consistency test, it ends up not being equal. What it ends up is imposing a special tax ­­ they even call it special, right, the special nonresident's tax ­­ on those who live in one State and work in the other, that people who live in the State and work in the State do not have to pay. That doesn't sound ­­ that sounds unequal, whether fair or not.MR. BROCKMAN: Your Honor, let me try and explain why I ­­ why I disagree that it's unfair. The special nonresident tax and the county tax both apply, one to residents, one to nonresidents. One has been upheld, the special nonresident tax, as a complimentary tax to the other.      But we can abstract from all of that because4￼Right, you're relying on the￼1 our position as a constitutional matter is that Maryland2 is not required to provide a credit at all.3 So, it would be just as accurate to do the4 math this way. The special nonresident tax accounts for5 6/10ths of 1 percent of total personal income tax6 collections, both resident and nonresident, combined7 State and local. If we've said instead there's only one8 tax, it's a State income tax, and you may take a credit9 up to the lesser of what you paid the other State or10 99.4 percent of what you would have paid to Maryland,11 whichever is lesser, we would have the same result.12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's the case13 now. If we uphold the situation where you charge a14 special nonresident tax in a way that is a special tax15 on people who live in one State and work in the other,16 then you're free to raise that to whatever amount you17 want. The fact that it's a smaller amount now18 doesn't ­­ if we say it's okay, then you're free to19 raise it.20 MR. BROCKMAN: Well, I don't think we are,21 Your Honor.

You have a hot dog stand in Hawaii. All right? It has a $1,000 income. It comes back to California. You pay a 13­1/2 percent California tax. Hawaii wants to charge another 12. So you're paying 25 percent. Can California say: That's fine; we give them no credit for the 11 percent they're paying in Hawaii? So the bottom check that you get is $750, not a 1,000. But if your hot dog stand were in California, the check would not be 750, it would be approximately 900. Okay?Now, is that constitutional or not?MR. BROCKMAN: It is, Your Honor.

But of course ­­JUSTICE SCALIA : A lot are moving out of Maryland, too.JUSTICE KENNEDY: What is your best case that you can rely on for your answer to Justice Breyer? What's the best case you can cite,Complete Auto? I don't think that works for you.MR. BROCKMAN: I wouldn't cite Complete Auto. I don't think it works here.JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, I wouldn't if I were you trying to justify the answer either.What would you cite? What would your best cite be.MR.

It's called an income tax, okay?2 And they run it in both States the same, and the problem3 that I would like you specifically ­­ and you are4 addressing with Justice Kennedy ­­ is what California5 says, open your hot dog stands in California. You go6 and open them in every other State and any other State,7 but particularly Hawaii, you will pay $125 more in8 income tax, not some flat other thing, not property tax,9 not some other kind of tax, in income tax. Okay. Now,10 that's constitutional because?11 MR. BROCKMAN: Because California taxes the12 income from hot dog stands without regard to where the13 hot dog stand is located. The ­­ the additional taxThe question is not whether 18 California can tax the income of its residents wherever19 they make it or whether California can tax all income20 earned within the border of California. The question is21 whether it can do both, whether ­­ and that's the22 question with respect to you. Can you tax all income23 earned within your border, whether by resident or by24 nonresident, and also tax income earned by your25 residents in ­­ in other States?8￼1 The tax economists' brief points out that2 this ­­ what you've done operates exactly like a tariff,3 because it provides an incentive to earn income in4 Maryland and not outside of Maryland. Now, do you5 dispute that as a factual matter? And if you don't6 dispute it as a factual matter, why shouldn't this tax7 system meet exactly the same fate as a tariff?8 MR. BROCKMAN: I don't dispute the9 mathematics. They lose me when they switch from tariffs10 to income taxes, but I'm not an economist. The11 difference, though, is that the ­­ we're talking about12 the effect of two States's taxes. Now, they've talked13 about two States' taxes by using what they call a14 heuristic device of hypothesizing that the other State15 has the exact same set of taxes. Fine. We can do that,16 too.17 But the point is that it's the combined18 effect. That means that Maryland's taxes, the validity19 of Maryland's tax, will turn on how another State20 exercises its taxing powers.21 JUSTICE SCALIA:22 MR. BROCKMAN:23 JUSTICE SCALIA:24 don't I understand why it is that California has to25 yield in this California­Hawaii situation. Why is it9  Yes.Every State ­­That's my problem, is I￼1 that the State that taxes all the income of its2 residents has to yield rather than the State that taxes3 all income earned in the State? Why can't you just as4 well say, you know, Hawaii shouldn't be able to sock on5 an addition?6 MR. BROCKMAN: Well, there are good7 reasons ­­8 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, as far as fairness9 is concerned. Now, maybe it doesn't work the same way10 with respect to the imaginary negative Commerce Clause,11 but ­­ but as far as fairness is concerned, I don't ­­ I12 don't see the difference.13 JUSTICE GINSBURG:14 position is that the residents15 worldwide income, period. And16 with that. The question is: Does the domicile have to17 give a credit because somebody else is also taxing it?18 Do you stop having the power to tax worldwide income19 because other States may tax on a different basis?20 MR. BROCKMAN: I think that is the question,21 Your Honor: Must the State yield to another State's22 taxation of a portion of that income, but on a very23 distinct ground, a territorial ground? It was ­­ the24 argument that State would make is: Well, we think you25 earned it here, and if you did we have a right to tax10Your position ­­ your­­ the domicile can taxI think everybody agrees￼1 it.2 Our argument with respect of our own3 residents is: We think you live here, and the Wynnes4 indisputably do, and that you benefit from the same5 privileges ­­ I'm sorry, Your Honor.6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I was just7 going to say it's not a question of yielding. The way8 you test under our precedents whether one State has to9 yield or not is to say, well, let's suppose each State10 does exactly the same thing, neither one is yielding.11 And as indicated earlier, the example in the12 Respondents' brief is that if each State did what we're13 talking about, people who work in one State and live in14 another would pay higher taxes overall than people who15 live within one State and work in the same State. And16 that sounds to me like a tariff.17 MR. BROCKMAN: Well, perhaps this is another18 way to address the internal consistency analysis and19 demonstrate why we think it doesn't do very much good20 analytic work here. If you take just a single sentence in21 one of this Court's opinions in Curry, "Income may be22 taxed both by the state where it is earned and by the23 state of the recipient's domicile," points internal24 consistency, that's it. If you add the feature that25 there ­­ there's a credit or not, that's the issue here,11￼1 and if, as in Chickasaw Nation that the offering of that2 credit is understood correctly as an independent policy3 decision that states make and is not of constitutional4 magnitude, is not done as a matter of constitutional5 compulsion, then the internal consistency problem6 remains.7 We think the internal consistency test works8 better, though not perfectly, when we're talking about9 two states taxing on the same basis. Because there, it10 may detect instances where one state is overreaching11 jurisdictionally, exercising a power that it does not12 lawfully have. The respondents don't argue that13 Maryland lacks this power, they acknowledge it. They ­­14 and they acknowledge it as an attribute of Maryland's15 sovereignty. If it were Situs v. Situs, Source v.16 Source, there the internal consistency test can tell17 whether ­­ sometimes ­­ whether the multiple taxation,18 the tax is a result of discrimination or of19 extraterritorial application of laws. But that neither20 of those is present here ­­21 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not the Commerce22 Clause test, though. The cases where we've applied that23 test, has that ­­ have they been decided under the24 Commerce Clause?25 MR. BROCKMAN: The internal consistency12￼1 test?2 JUSTICE SCALIA:3 MR. BROCKMAN:4 have ­­5 JUSTICE SCALIA:6 it's a matter of state power.7 MR. BROCKMAN: Well, I think this case does8 not present any issues that are unique to the Commerce9 Clause case, because it's undisputed that Maryland's tax10 does not facially discriminate. It's even­handed in its11 application. Only after the tax liability is determined12 does it take into account the source, and there it gives13 an advantage to the people who have earned some of it14 out of state.15 So what we're left with is an argument of16 the discrimination here is in the supposed17 malapportionment itself. And that question, the18 question of apportionment, fair apportionment, I think19 is common to both the due process and Commerce Clause20 jurisprudence of this Court, and I think Maryland's tax21 survives that scrutiny under both ­­22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about ­­ we're23 dealing with an individual because it's a Chapter S24 corporation, but what about a corporation that is25 domiciled in Maryland? I think Maryland, like all13  Yes.I think ­­ I think theyI thought it ­­ I thought￼1 states, uses an apportionment formula for both domestic2 and foreign corporations.3 MR. BROCKMAN: We don't believe this case4 implicates any question of how corporations would be5 taxed. The residence principle that we're relying on as6 a basis for the broad taxing power and the benefits that7 one receives as residents is unique to individuals, and8 it's always been articulated in cases involving9 individuals, so we're talking about personal income10 taxes here. And it might very well ­­11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I suppose you could12 argue that some states are very ­­ have very good13 corporation laws and that's why corporations are14 domiciled there. They're, let's say, director friendly15 or that they are laws that are easy to apply and well16 understood. That ­­ that's a significant advantage.17 MR. BROCKMAN: I think that's absolutely18 correct, Your Honor. I think this Court's precedents19 recognize some benefit that's accorded merely in the20 fact of domiciliary status, whatever ­­ however that's21 defined. And ­­ but being in the net income tax22 situation for corporations, I'm not aware of any23 that tries to assign a value to that because24 non­domiciliary and domiciliary corporations are25 equally.14statetreated￼1 Now, I do know that Delaware, known to be2 hospitable to corporations for incorporation purposes,3 does impose a tax, a yearly franchise tax, that ranges4 from $180 ­­ from $225 to $180,000 annually, and that5 it's not based on income, it's based on a very complex6 measure of the worth of the entire enterprise.7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can we go back to the8 Chief's initial question.

BROCKMAN: I reserve.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.Mr. Feigin.ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGINBEHALF OF UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,   SUPPORTING PETITIONER16￼￼1 MR. FEIGIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,2 and may it please the Court:3 I'd like to begin, if I could, by the4 interaction of taxes imposed on the jurisdictional5 rationale of residency, and taxes imposed on6 nonresidents by virtue of their doing business in the7 state.8 I don't think there's any constitutional9 rule that says a state can only impose one tax or the10 other. And to the extent the internal consistency test11 might suggest that the special nonresident tax that12 Maryland imposes, which is a special tax imposed only on13 nonresidents, may be taking too great a portion of14 nonresidents' income, I think it's kind of backwards for15 respondents to be able to raise that challenge because16 they are residents. They pay only the residential17 income taxes and, in fact, benefit from any overtaxing18 of nonresidents.19 The other thing I would ­­20 JUSTICE KAGAN: You only have to look at the21 tax scheme as a whole including the tax on nonresidents?22 I mean ­­23 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I think the24 very important thing to understand here is we're talking25 about two very different kinds of income taxes with17￼1 distinct jurisdictional rationales. Maryland is taxing2 respondent's income because they are residents of3 Maryland. Other states are taxing their income because4 they do business there. I'm not sure you would5 necessarily look at them and mix and match. And I'm not6 aware of any case in which this Court has taken a7 completely nondiscriminatory tax ­­ like Maryland's8 county income tax which applies at the same rate to a9 county resident no matter where he earns his income in10 state or out of state, and finds that tax to be11 unconstitutional by yoking it to some other tax like the12 special nonresident tax that's going to look13 discriminatory no matter what other scheme of taxes you14 throw it into.15 But, if you really did think there was a16 problem ­­17 JUSTICE BREYER: I thought that we held that18 quite a lot in respect to corporate taxes. The three19 cases we found here, J.D. Adams, Gwin White & Prince,20 Hennerford, Central Greyhound of New York, all said that21 corporations, when they are taxed on their income by a22 state, that they have to apportion in a fair manner. Is23 that right?24 MR. FEIGIN: No, Your Honor, I don't think25 that that's precisely what they hold. I think the most1825 JUSTICE KENNEDY:But that's a due process￼1 salient distinction between those cases and this one is2 that none of those cases address a tax that was3 justified on the basis of the taxpayer's domicile as the4 Maryland county income tax is.5 In Gwin and Greyhound, the Court didn't even6 address any argument that the tax was based on domicile.7 And in J.D. Adams, although the highest court in Indiana8 had ­­ believed that the tax was justified on the basis9 of domicile, this Court looked at the structure of the10 tax and concluded that it wasn't ­­ that that11 justification didn't actually fit the tax.12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: When you say ­­ it seems13 a little bit of hairsplitting. You say it's a test on14 residency, but not income. But we have previously said15 a tax on sleeping, measured by the number of pairs of16 shoes you have in your closet, is a tax on shoes. So17 you can call it residency, but if it's still using18 income as its basis as opposed to property values or19 whatever else these residency taxes are based on, then20 why isn't it a tax on income?21 MR. FEIGIN: Let me be as clear as I can,22 Your Honor. It is a tax on income, but the23 jurisdictional rationale for the tax is different from24 the jurisdictional rationales employed by the states.19      MR. FEIGIN:if every State ­­      JUSTICE KENNEDY:question, isn't it?Well, first of all, Your Honor,     I mean, that is theYes, I think that is part of      MR. FEIGIN:the analysis of the question.￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425argument.  The question here is whether or not a numberof States impose taxes like this it would be additionalburden on interstate commerce.      But if every State enacted an income taxthat looked exactly like Maryland's county income tax,that applies one uniform rate no matter where income isearned, every U.S. citizen would pay income tax at theexact same rate no matter where they earned theirincome.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Except if they also imposed the special nonresident tax, and that changes the whole scenario.MR. FEIGIN: That's right, Your Honor.      In addition to what I said to Justice Kaganabout that earlier, let me add a further thought, thatif you really thought there was a problem with theinteraction of resident and nonresident taxes then Ithink it would probably be much more logical to locatethe problem in the nonresident tax rather than the20￼1 resident tax, for three reasons.2 First, the nonresident tax is the only one3 that's triggered by economic activity that crosses State4 lines. Maryland's county income tax applies whether the5 business is done in State or out of State.6 Second, any differential incentives that a7 taxpayer might have to do business in one State versus8 another aren't arising from the county income tax, which9 applies evenly, but instead from the differential tax10 rates that various other States which their nonresidents11 might have. So Illinois might impose a 3 percent rate,12 Idaho a 5 percent rate, and Iowa an 8 percent rate.13 And the third thing is that the resident tax14 is the only one that the taxpayers actually have some15 political power to get in there and to influence.16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In your answer that you17 gave to my ­­ the hypothetical of 100 percent, that18 would be a burden on 100 percent of interstate commerce,19 because a resident who did not go into interstate20 commerce would pay less, so there is a burden. All21 you're saying is, well, if there's going to be a burden,22 it could be a great big one.23 MR. FEIGIN: So, Your Honor, there is ­­ in24 some cases, a Maryland resident will be taxed more on25 commerce that they conduct outside of Maryland then21￼1 inside of Maryland, but I don't see why that's2 discrimination attributable to Maryland. It arises from3 the combination of the income taxes of two States.4 And I think for the reasons I was just5 explaining to the Chief Justice, one could file a6 perhaps more persuasive brief challenging the7 nonresident tax which the Maryland taxpayers exposed and8 that's not a reason for invalidating the uniform9 residence tax.10 And, Justice Breyer, if I can get back to11 your point.12 JUSTICE BREYER: Justice Kennedy asked a13 question I was curious about that. I wanted you to14 address that specifically, and you're just trying to say15 who's at fault. I don't know who's at fault.16 Switzerland has a tax on milk from cows that are17 pastured at less than 5,000 feet. It's Belgium's fault.18 They don't have any mountains.19 (Laughter.)20 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I don't know who's21 at fault, but that is a discriminatory tariff.22 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I've23 explained to explains why if someone has to be at fault,24 I think it's the nonresident tax. But let me explain25 why I think ­­22￼1 JUSTICE BREYER:2 fault. Actually in the corporate area it was a tax on3 gross income in that first case, and so I don't know why4 human beings ­­ well, no, I won't go into that issue.5 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, it wasn't ­­6 Your Honor, just quickly on J.D. Adams, in addition to7 it not being a domicile­based tax, it was a tax on gross8 receipts, which are taxes on transactions and the entire9 revenue of those transactions. But let me explain why I10 think neither tax here ­­11 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, just to understand12 what you said a minute ago, are you saying that if this13 same claim were brought by a nonresident challenging the14 nonresident tax in Maryland that would succeed?15 MR. FEIGIN: No, Your Honor. I'm saying it16 would be a stronger claim. But let me try to explain17 now why I think both taxes can peacefully coexist.18 JUSTICE ALITO: All right. So that was19 irrelevant, then., the fact that it would be ­­ it would20 be a stronger claim, but also a bad one at the end?21 MR. FEIGIN: No, Your Honor, I don't think22 it's irrelevant. I think it's quite relevant because23 the only tax that Respondents have paid and the only one24 they are challenging is the even­handed residential25 income tax, and the existence of this other tax that23I don't see anybody at￼1 could be perceived to have an undesirable affect2 shouldn't affect the validity of the tax they've3 actually challenged. But let me explain ­­4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they are5 linked ­­ they are linked together. I mean, the special6 nonresident tax is set at a particular level in relation7 to the county tax. It is obviously intended to reach8 nonresidents in a way that the county tax reaches9 residents. I'm not sure you can artificially separate10 them.11 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Maryland has upheld the12 special nonresident tax, not on the ground that it's not13 discriminatory. The Maryland courts recognize the14 special nonresident tax as discriminatory, which the15 county income tax clearly is not, and they've upheld it16 under this Court's compensatory tax doctrine. Whether17 the Maryland courts were right on that or whether they18 wrong on that, I don't think it should affect the19 validity of the county income tax, which is the question20 presented in this case.21 But the reason I think that nonresident22 taxes can peacefully coexist with resident taxes is that23 although they are both income taxes, they are on24 distinct jurisdictional rationales, and when two taxes25 are imposed on the same value based on distinct24￼1 jurisdictional rationales, it's not impermissible double2 taxation under the Commerce Clause, and let me give an3 example.4 If an operation manufactures all of its5 widgets in State A and sells them all in State B, it's6 clear under this Court's decisions in McGoldrick v.7 Berwind­White Coal Mining Company and Armco v. Hardesty8 that State A can impose a manufacturing tax that is9 measured by the value of the revenue of the sales even10 though the sales occur in State B. And State B can11 impose a gross receipts tax on the sales that occur in12 State B which is paid by the seller, the mining company13 or the widget manufacturer in my example, which is also14 taxed on that same value, the taxes that occur in State15 B.16 The reason that's permissible is because17 they're distinct jurisdictional rationales, which is18 what we have here. One is a tax based on the residency19 and the other is tax based on doing business in the20 State.21 Previous apportionment cases this Court has22 considered have all involved the second rationale, doing23 business in the State. And in that circumstance, it24 makes sense to try to divide up the pie because you25 don't want California asserting, well, we're responsible25￼1 for 90 percent of your income, and Oregon says, we're2 also responsible for 90 percent of your income. But3 there's no real way to compare apples and oranges and to4 say that a residency­based tax is better or worse than a5 tax based on doing business there. And so you don't6 have the same conflict between the taxes and have to7 divide up the pie in the same way that this Court's8 previous cases have suggested.9 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Feigin, if we were to10 rule against Maryland, how many States are in the same11 position as Maryland, either because they do a county12 tax themselves or because they allow local jurisdictions13 to impose their own taxes?14 MR. FEIGIN: I'd look at pages 17 to 18 of15 the Municipal Lawyers Association brief, Your Honor, but16 if I could add just one quick sentence beyond that.17 Even States that do offer credits of the kind Respondent18 is seeking would be affected by a decision in this case19 because it would constitutionalize that requirement and20 create constitutional questions about whether a credit21 ­­ when a credit is required.22 Thank you.23 JUSTICE SCALIA: I have one more question.24 Do we ­­ does the Federal Government allow25 credits for all foreign income tax paid and do you think261 it must do so?2 MR. FEIGIN: There are limits. It does3 offer a foreign income tax credit. There are some4 treaties about this, I believe, but I don't think5 there's any overarching principle of international6 law ­­ 78910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SCALIA: In and of itself, it wouldn't violate the negative foreign commerce clause, right?(Laughter.)MR.

PERELLAON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSMR. PERELLA: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:      Justice Alito, you asked my friend on theother side whether it's correct to say that if youperform ­­ you know, if you look at the real economicanalysis of this tax and see what it does to interstatecommerce, whether it amounts to a tariff, and myopponent conceded that it does.27￼11 point the Court to page 5 of12 Taxation brief ­­ that would13 businesses in this country.14 JUSTICE BREYER:the Council on Stateapply to 90 percent of the                                  When you do business in15 California and you live somewhere else, your hot dog16 stand is going to be subject to pretty high property￼1 A tariff is the quintessential unlawful tax2 under the dormant commerce clause and I'd like to3 illustrate why by pointing to Justice Breyer's hot dog4 stand. Again, as my opponent on the other side5 conceded, a small business like a hot dog stand could6 operate in two different States. It might not be7 California and Hawaii, but wherever it might be, and it8 would be exposed to 100 percent double taxation. The9 only limitation would be the rate that the State chooses10 to set on that. And that would apply ­­ and I would17 taxes. It's going to be subject to special use taxes.18 It's going to be subject to taxes that they have for one19 time to finance the schools. It's going to be subject20 to da, da, da, da, da. Okay? And so what they are21 really saying is, well, nobody claims that California22 can't do that and Maryland can ignore it for purposes of23 their income tax. It's tough to do business in24 California, according to some. Not to Californians.25 But nonetheless, this is just one more28￼1 burden that you have to suffer and that's because2 they're on ­­ you heard the argument. So what's your3 response to that.4 MR. PERELLA: My response is that in cases5 like Container Corp., Jefferson Lines, and others, this6 Court has said: Look, we can't and don't want to7 constitutionalize everything about State taxation.8 Different States impose different taxes, impose9 different burdens, and we're not going to try to stop10 them from doing so. We can't stop them. They have that11 power. But the line we're going to draw, and it's the12 line the internal consistency test draws, is that we're13 not going to allow States to structure their taxes so14 that they are taxing more than one ­­ they're exposing15 income to more than 100 percent of the tax base.16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Perella, suppose we17 had a Maryland resident and all that resident's income18 is earned out of State. And each of the States where19 the income is earned tax at or above the Maryland rate.20 That would mean, I suppose, that the Maryland resident21 owes nothing to Maryland because he could take a credit22 for all what he's ­­ leaving the residents without23 anything, without a penny from this resident who may24 have five children that he sends to school in Maryland.25 MR. PERELLA: Justice Ginsburg, a couple of29￼1 responses to that. Firstly, I agree that it can happen.2 I think it happens rarely. And just as a practical3 matter, let me point out Maryland has reciprocal4 agreements with its surrounding jurisdictions ­­5 Washington, Virginia, Pennsylvania, et cetera ­­ where6 they say we're going to ignore commuting of that sort7 and we're going to tax people at their residence.8 But even if that weren't so, I think the key9 point here is that that resident is paying substantial10 taxes to State B, and residents of State B who happen to11 do work in the State in Maryland are paying substantial12 taxes to Maryland. So this comes out in the wash.13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Maybe ­­ no, maybe so, and14 maybe ­­ maybe not so. Why can't ­­ suppose not many15 other people in ­­ in ­­ in Maryland are in ­­ in this16 position, or the reverse? This ­­ this man is getting a17 free ride.18 MR. PERELLA: Well, I disagree respectfully,19 Justice Kennedy, that he's getting a free ride. I mean,20 he's paying, first of all, again, substantial income21 taxes to the other States where the income is earned.22 He's paying substantial property taxes.23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But he's getting a free24 ride off Maryland school. Now he rents the property.25 MR. PERELLA: Two answers.

Maryland is anoutlier here, and the other States are not here todefend its rule.      But I also think it's worth mentioning that,yes, there will be occasional cases where a Stateresident does not pay any tax to the ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can there be some minimum tax imposed on a resident?MR.

So, for example, the New York City income tax would be the classic example of that.MR. PERELLA: Yes. Justice Kagan, as ­­ as my opponent on the other side said, the IMLA brief catalogs some foreign localities that impose local income taxes. Some of them don't appear to have a credit.      But I think it's important to point out, andwe did in our responsive brief, that the IMLA's math issubstantially exaggerated.  I mean, for example, they'vepointed to ­­ a lot of the local taxes they point to arein Pennsylvania.  Thousands of them in fact.  Andthey're simply wrong about Pennsylvania.

PERELLA: I think it's fair to say that there are some. I think it's also fair to say that the number is substantially lower.JUSTICE GINSBURG: But before you said there were zero.MR. PERELLA: No, sorry, Justice Ginsburg.I said that there are no States that don't impose ­­ that don't allow the full credit on other States' income taxes.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, Maryland does allow the credit against the State income tax. It's just the county tax.MR. PERELLA: Well, I mean, not to split hairs, but as this case comes to the Court, you know, the State courts have held, and Maryland hasn't disputed, that this is, in fact, a State income tax. The court held that in Frey case in the Maryland Court of Appeals.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. But they ­­ the lion's share of it would be this State part, not the county part. And on that, Maryland does give a credit.MR. PERELLA: I think the key point here is that if you conceive of this all as a State tax, which is how, again, how the Maryland law stands and how the case comes to the Court, what Maryland has done here is34￼￼1 say we're going to arbitrarily cut our credit2 essentially in half. We're going to give you half the3 credit.4 Now, some of the topside briefs, the IMLA5 brief, for example, make an issue of that. They say,6 hey, this is just a rational compromise; we're going7 part way. But the rule Maryland suggests is not a8 compromise. The rule they suggest is you can impose9 complete double taxation. And it's a rule ­­10 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Perella, you're not11 saying that we have to or that we should establish a12 priority rule as to different taxing schemes, do ­­ are13 you? You're not saying it has to be source­based over14 residence­based, or ­­ or vice versa?15 MR. PERELLA: I think that the holdings of16 this Court in Standard Oil, Mobil Oil, Central Railroad,17 are that in a situation where one State is taxing on the18 basis of residency and the other on the basis of source,19 it is the State of residency that yields.20 JUSTICE KAGAN: So you are saying that21 that's the priority rule.22 MR. PERELLA: Well, I'm saying that in the23 case where there is the risk of overlap, yes.24 Now, the other side has construed our brief25 saying that we're requiring apportionment, right? The35￼1 whole point of their reply brief is how can it be that2 the due process cases say you tax everything wherever3 earned, and the Commerce Clause requires you to tax4 nothing outside the State. I want to just be clear that5 that's not the rule we're suggesting.6 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, let me ask you: I7 mean, suppose we were to say what Maryland is doing is8 not okay, but then States could choose. Some would do a9 source­based tax, some would do a residency­based tax.10 And if you had a situation like that, it seems it could11 lead to double taxation in exactly this kind of way. If12 you were living in the wrong State and all of a sudden13 the combination of one State having a pure source­based14 and one State having a pure residency­based tax was15 going to lead to double taxation. Why is that any16 different?17 MR. PERELLA: So I think that if you had18 that situation, and of course you don't because all the19 States do this the same way, but if you had it, I think20 there would be an argument to be made that that tax21 would be unconstitutional because it would produce22 massive double taxation. And, you know, the Court has23 said residency yields in that situation.24 But I want to be clear that this is a much25 easier case. Here we have a situation where the tax is36￼1 simply not internally consistent. And, Justice2 Sotomayor, to answer your question earlier, there's ­­3 there's no way to argue that it is. And Maryland to4 this ­­ to this day refuses to actually apply the test.5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's only6 internally inconsistent because of the special7 nonresident tax. And your ­­ your clients don't pay the8 special nonresidents tax, so why should we worry about9 it in this case?10 MR. PERELLA: The reason you have to worry11 about it in this case ­­ and let me say, Mr. Chief12 Justice, there are other ways to ­­ to rule in our favor13 without doing internal consistency. But if that's the14 approach that you take, the only way the internal15 consistency test makes any sense is if you look at both16 the residence tax ­­ you know, the inbound tax and the17 outbound tax. Because the whole point of the test, as18 the economists' brief points out, is to look at what19 happens when two States have the power to tax, one on20 the basis of residence and one on the basis of source.21 So to suggest that you would only look at22 the inbound piece makes nonsense of the test. That's23 not how it's ever been applied. I'd like to ­­24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: A resident ­­ you're not25 disputing the proposition that the State of residence371 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425can tax worldwide income, can impose an income tax onits residents worldwide, wherever they earn it.  You'renot questioning that proposition.saying is they don't haveincome ­­MR. PERELLA:38￼      MR. PERELLA:matter of due process.      JUSTICE GINSBURG:what?  Would you questionCommerce Clause, that theworldwide income?      MR. PERELLA:matter of the Commerce Clause?  I think the gravamen ofour position, Justice Ginsburg, is that States have theraw power, right, putting aside all other factors andall other States' taxes, to reach their residents'income wherever earned.  But the Commerce Clauseoperates to force them to structure their taxes in a waythat avoids double taxation.      Now, there will be ­­      JUSTICE GINSBURG:I'm not questioning that as a     Well, as a matter ofit as a matter of a dormantState of residence can taxWould I question it as a     Well, then what you'rethe power to tax worldwideNo, that ­­     ­­ if another State has a      JUSTICE GINSBURG:tax based on source.  So,tax worldwide income, is subject to what other Statesgoing in proposition, they can￼1 do, and if other States have a tax, then the resident's2 State has to recede.3 MR. PERELLA: Two answers to that, Justice4 Ginsburg. First, under our position, which is not5 something we've invented for purposes of this case, but6 is the steady holding of this Court for 80 years, the7 question is not what other States are actually doing.8 The question is whether Maryland's tax is structured in9 such a way that eliminates the pervasive risk of double10 taxation.11 Because, of course, as the Chief ­­ as ­­ as12 the Chief Justice pointed out in the opening argument,13 other States can exercise their right to tax on the14 basis of source to any degree. And so what this Court15 has said is we're not going to make the16 constitutionality of the tax turn on the shifting17 incidents of the other 49 States. We're going to18 require that you structure your tax so you're not going19 to open the door to all this double taxation.20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You talked about what21 this Court has been doing for I don't know how many22 years. Have we ever had a case under the Dormant23 Commerce Clause where a resident is complaining, an24 insider is complaining. The Dormant Commerce Clause25 cases involved outsiders who are saying, this State397 MR. PERELLA:8 JUSTICE GINSBURG:9 outsider?Yes.     ­­ rather than an￼1 where I don't vote is imposing something arbitrary on2 me. Here we have an in­state person complaining under3 the Dormant Commerce Clause that its State is4 discriminating against it.5 Is there any other State where ­­ case where6 it's an insider complaining ­­10 MR. PERELLA:11 number of cases, and let me give them to you. Boston12 Stock Exchange, for starters, is a resident complaining13 about their own tax. The complete audit ­­ or the14 Commerce Clause was imposed. Goldberg is the same,15 although you ruled against the taxpayer in that case;16 the test was applied. And most importantly, I think,17 J.D. Adams, Gwin and Central Greyhound are all18 domiciliaries. Now, they are, of course, corporations.19 But my opponent, I don't think, has offered20 any rationale to distinguish between the two. The21 question this Court has always identified is: Is this22 tax double taxing ­­23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, one thing, one24 obvious distinction is the corporation doesn't have five25 children to send to school.40There are ­­ there are a￼1 MR. PERELLA: Well, you know, I think that2 that rationale maybe proves a little bit too much.3 Because, of course, corporations do receive an awful lot4 of benefits from their domiciliary States, and5 especially the States where they have their principal6 place of business. And I would argue, although there's7 no, you know, empirical evidence in the record, that8 they probably use more in the way of services ­­ fire,9 water, structure, legal, you know, legal mechanisms,10 et cetera ­­ and yet this Court has said, you absolutely11 cannot double tax and it's forbidden.12 And, you know, again, Maryland is ­­ the13 only distinguishing factor they have for those cases ­­14 and actually this is an important point I would like to15 address ­­ the only point either Maryland or the United16 States has used to distinguish J.D. Adams and the like17 is the idea that the tax in those cases was on gross18 receipts.19 That argument has been long since20 foreclosed. This Court held in Moorman, both the21 majority and the concurring opinion, that there is no22 analytical difference between net and gross income in23 this area.24 And furthermore, in Westinghouse v. Tully,25 the Court said, look, there's no difference for our41￼1 analysis between the tax and ­­ a burdensome tax imposed2 on interstate transactions and a burdensome tax ­­3 excuse me ­­ a burdensome tax imposed on interstate4 income. They said it cannot be, quote/unquote, that you5 can impose that unlawful burden by doing it in the6 aggregate.7 And so I think the idea that that8 distinguishes our cases is not available to them.9 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Perella, we said in this10 American Trucking case, we said we were going to allow11 States to impose a neutral, local tax even though it12 violated internal consistency.13 Why shouldn't we see this as pretty14 equivalent to American Trucking? In other words, a15 State saying, we're going to impose a small tax to16 ensure that you are paying for some of the very basic17 services that we provide.18 MR. PERELLA: Well, I guess several19 responses, Justice Kagan. First of all, there's nothing20 small about this tax. Maryland is imposing, by their21 own lights, $50 million in double taxation on its local22 businesses annually when they operate across State23 lines.24 JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sure that if you25 aggregate the American Trucking tax, it was a lot of42￼1 money, too.2 MR. PERELLA: Maybe. The distinction3 that ­­ that Justice Breyer drew for the Court in that4 case was that in American Trucking it was a fee. It was5 a flat fee and it was imposed only on intrastate6 transactions. He said no interstate transactions, no7 interstate commerce appears to be at issue in this case.8 In this case, by striking contrast, Maxim,9 the S corporation that earned this income, operates10 essentially in every State in the country. And, of11 course, under S corporation principles, the income that12 the Wynnes earned through that is passed through income13 just like a partnership.14 And furthermore, you know, if you look at15 the ­­ how the tax affects other State residents, again,16 90 percent of businesses in this country are organized17 as passthrough entities or sole proprietorships. And so18 you have all of that income crossing State lines, and19 every time it does, there's a tariff, there's a barrier20 at the State lines that says you're going to pay twice.21 And this Court has never, I don't think, approved a tax22 like that. American Trucking certainly did not.23 I'd like to ­­ to mention a couple of other24 things. The IMLA brief and Maryland's reply brief25 suggest that if you accept our position, Maryland has no431 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425choice but to make its tax code more  regressiveI'djust like to point out that that's not so.  Maryland, totake just one example, could raise the top marginalincome tax rate to close the gap.  That would impose thedifference only on, you know, higher income citizens andit would not double tax anyone.  The thing thatMaryland ­­      JUSTICE SCALIA:comfort?     (Laughter.)     JUSTICE SCALIA:￼                             Why should that give me                             What difference does that                          Well, I don't think it     JUSTICE SCALIA:to ­­ is to ­­ I don't understand the argument.MR. PERELLA: Justice Scalia, Maryland can close the gap however it likes. It can raise the property tax ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what I think.MR. PERELLA: It can raise the income tax generally. The point that I wanted to make is that if the suggestion is that this tax is somehow unfair because, as a ­­ as a necessary result you're going to soak people with lower incomes, that's simply not so.44make?     MR. PERELLA:makes ­­Where the only way out is￼1 That's not what Maryland has to do to the fix the2 problem here.3 And, again, this is a problem that only4 Maryland has. Every other State with an income tax5 allows the credit in full.6 Let me also mention another argument7 Maryland makes in its reply. It suggests that8 S corporation owners or S corporations should not be9 heard to complain about double taxation because10 C corporations are double taxed. That misunderstands11 the concept of double taxation in Commerce Clause cases.12 In a C corporation, you have the first tax imposed on13 the, you know, the corporation itself, and then down the14 line you have a tax imposed either by the same State or15 another on the ­­ on the person who's getting a16 dividend.17 That's not the same person being taxed18 twice, nor is it anyone being taxed twice for crossing19 State lines. And so both the dividends recipient and20 corporation are indifferent to where they live and where21 they work. There's no double taxation there in the22 sense of the hydraulic pull, pulling the commerce into23 single State. And in fact, in that respect, it's just24 like Jefferson Lines. In that opinion, this Court said,25 "The reason this is different from Central Greyhound and45      MR. PERELLA:      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:      MR. PERELLA:the same.      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:As an income tax?      As an income tax.I think the result would be￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the only reason we're not striking this tax down isbecause the first incidence falls on the bus ticketbuyer, and the second incidence falls on the buscompany.  And so no one discouraged from crossing statelines."  That's not how the Maryland tax operates.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What if they didn't do it on gross income, but just said every resident has to pay X amount?                                It's not being based ongross income.  Just says every resident has to pay$1,000.MR. PERELLA: Justice Sotomayor, I think theresult would be the same because ­­ and as I stand here,I'm thinking about this ­­ I believe it would be thesame because the question would be, as the Chief Justicepoints out, is the tax internally consistent.  And, youknow, that sounds obscure but all it's really saying is,is that tax creating a risk of pervasive double taxationfor anyone who does interstate commerce.JUSTICE KAGAN: But why doesn't Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical, isn't it exactly the same as46￼1 the American Trucking hypothetical? You just2 distinguished the flat tax versus the percentage income3 tax. I thought that that was your principal distinction4 of American Trucking.5 MR. PERELLA: I think ­­ I think that the6 thing about American Trucking that made it unique,7 Justice Kagan, and I confess I don't completely8 understand the rationale of American Trucking, but I9 think the thing that makes it unique is that it's a flat fee10 for use of the State services. That's what Justice11 Breyer said to the Court in that case.12 JUSTICE KAGAN: I thought that that was what13 Justice Sotomayor was positing, a flat fee for use of14 the State schools and everything else that comes along15 with being a State resident.16 MR. PERELLA: All right. Well, perhaps,17 then, you know, maybe that tax could survive under the18 rationale ofAmerican Trucking too. But, again, I think19 it's important to point out this is not that case. I20 mean, this is a case where it's clearly an income tax.21 It's clearly pegged to, you know, adjusted gross income22 and it clearly does not offer the credit that every23 other State offers.24 And, you know, I think just to illustrate25 how this ­­ how this functions in reality, the other47￼1 side suggests, well, this is just some sort of ­­ we're2 asking for a special benefit for ­­ for, you know,3 people who own these big interstate companies. If you4 own, for example, an independent taxi and you happen to5 take rides, give people rides across the line into6 Delaware and Pennsylvania, you're going to be double7 taxed, under their theory, on any piece of that commerce8 that can be taxed by Pennsylvania or Delaware. Whereas,9 the exact same operation that happens to be an10 incorporated bus company could not be constitutionally11 double taxed.12 JUSTICE SCALIA: But, you know, there ­­13 there's an inequity either way. The inequity on the14 other side is you have two neighbors side by side.15 Their kids both use the school. One of the neighbors16 makes most of his income out of the State and you want17 to say that would not be taxable, whereas the other18 neighbor makes all of the income in the State and pays a19 very high, very high tax. You know, that's not fair20 either, is it?21 MR. PERELLA: Three responses, if I could,22 Justice Scalia. First response, as I mentioned earlier,23 it's going to work the other way as well. If you look24 at this across 50 States without State lines, as you're25 supposed to for Commerce Clause purposes, people who are48￼1 nonresidents are going to be paying taxes into the2 State.3 Secondly, even if there is some inequity4 there, the lodestar of this Court's Commerce Clause5 cases has always been that whatever else you do, you6 can't create the substantial nationwide risk of double7 taxation. So that has to be the first principle.8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's quite9 interesting, because New York City's normal population,10 I think now we have gone down to 7 million, but11 out­of­state residents that come in are 25 million a12 day, who work in the city. So, New York's 7 million13 pays for those 25 million.14 MR. PERELLA: I'm not sure totally sure how15 the New York City income tax regime works, Justice16 Sotomayor, but I think the point I was driving at is,17 you know, States have different policy preferences. You18 know, they want to have a tax on this and a tax on that,19 that's almost always ­­20 JUSTICE BREYER: What's your third?21 MR. PERELLA: Yes, that's what I was getting22 the line is drawn at the idea that you can't double tax.23 And the third point I was going to make is,24 you know, Maryland is complaining about a very small cab25 of limitation that this Court always enforced on their49￼1 taxing power. And as this Court has said in a number of2 decisions dating all the way back to Chief Justice3 Marshall, States have some limitations on what they can4 do with taxation under the Commerce Clause, but what5 they bought in exchange for, you know, agreeing to those6 limitations in the Constitution is a nationwide network7 of commerce. They don't have barriers at State lines,8 there are no tariffs as Maryland admitted this functions9 as. They can ­­ you know, they can take advantage of10 that nationwide network and they can market their goods11 and they can market their employees in any State in the12 country and vice versa. And so I think the idea that13 this is a one­way ratchet and that Maryland is only14 losing in this proposition is not correct.15 And just as a final matter, let me just say,16 with respect to the idea that residency is a17 get­out­of­jail­free card, I'd like to quote Chief18 Justice Marshall from Brown v. Maryland. "The19 distinction between the tax on the thing imported and on20 the person of the importer can have no influence on this21 part of the subject. It is too obvious for controversy22 that they interfere equally with the power to regulate23 commerce."24 I think that's the bottom line here. And if25 the Court has no further questions, I'll submit.50￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.2 Mr. Brockman, you have three minutes remaining.3 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM F. BROCKMAN4 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER5 MR. BROCKMAN: Thank you. The bottom line6 is not that a tax on the thing is the same as a tax on7 the person. That is true in the trilogy of cases that8 the Wynnes mostly rely on, the J.D. Adams cases where the9 gross receipts tax is understood, at least at that time,10 to be very different from a net income tax going all the11 way back to 1918 in U.S. Glue. And the reason was12 because it was viewed as taxing the transaction itself.13 The net income from the transaction is different. It's14 the thing that the person receives and enjoys in their15 home State. And people choose to live in States for16 reasons different from the ones that they consider when17 they choose to do business elsewhere. They may choose18 because there are lower property taxes relative to sales19 taxes, as in Maryland.20 Maryland is not unique.21 can probably correct me if I'm wrong22 but there are 92 counties in Indiana23 a local income tax. None offers a credit. So ­­ and ­­24 and the fact that other States aren't here is just a25 harbinger because if this becomes a constitutional rule,51The Chief Justiceabout the number,and they all impose￼1 they will be.2 The reason we have offered a compromise and3 why it is a compromise, is because ­­ because this tax4 falls on the State's own residents, they have the5 capacity to change it. That's always been an important6 consideration from McCullough all the way through United7 Haulers. And the norm that ­­ that supposedly prefers8 source to ­­ to residents as a basis is nowhere to be9 found. It's ­­ it's a norm only. And in Bernard v.10 Brooks, in answer to Your Honor's question, this Court11 said that the United States has never believed that when12 it decides to limit its own sovereign taxing power over13 its own residents that it's doing it because it has to.14 It's never been thought that. And the States could not15 have thought that when they were joining the union, that16 the unique relationship between a State and its own17 residents would be ­­ could not be accounted for in the18 State's tax system, that the Constitution would19 determine how, as Mr. Perella says, the States can20 structure their own taxes.21 Maryland made some choices and they ought to22 be able to make the choices they did. They said that23 the taxes one pays to the county should not be different24 based on factors that the county services are25 indifferent to. You don't get 18 percent of ­­ of a5222 23 24 25￼1 fire truck or a day of school because you earned 70 ­­2 82 percent elsewhere. You get 100 percent just like3 your neighbor does.4 And in that respect, the reason the rates do5 matter and the reason you should nevertheless be very6 uncomfortable about it is because under the rule that7 they're proposing, Maryland's tax system is at the mercy8 of the other State's taxes. In the foldout section of9 the Joint Appendix at page 77, you see there are 3910 jurisdictions, there's a 40th not shown there that taxed11 a portion of the income. 27 of them taxed it at a12 higher rate than the Maryland and Howard County tax13 combined in 2006. So ­­ thank you, Your Honor.14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.
