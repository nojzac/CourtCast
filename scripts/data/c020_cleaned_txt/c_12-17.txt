GUPTA:  That's right.  All of theseJUSTICE SCALIA:  In the '60s.3this morning first in Case 12-17, McBurney            Mr. Gupta?             ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEEPAK GUPTA              ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS            MR. GUPTA:  Thank you, and mayCourt:            All 50 States have public records laws.  47of those States make access available to residents andnonresidents on equal terms.  Virginia, by contrast,enforces a discriminatory access policy, and, becausecommercial requesters make up the vast majority ofrecords requesters, out-of-State businesses bear thebrunt of Virginia's policy.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  When -- when was the firstof those laws enacted?  Do you know?  I think it's -- Ithink it's in my adult lifetime that Florida was thefirst to enact a sunshine law.  Is that -- am I correctabout that?v. Young.it please the￼21 correctly, they would be entitled, as a22 matter, under their theory, to preclude23 other States from accessing even deeds.24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'll25 didn't understand that to be their position, but -- but41 MR. GUPTA: In the '60s and the early '70s. The2 Virginia law was enacted in 1968. And we don't deny3 that -­4 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you say that's a5 fundamental -- that's a fundamental right covered by6 Privileges and Immunities Clause, which nobody had until7 the 1960s?8 MR. GUPTA: Well, to be clear, the modern9 transparency laws are new, but they sit on top of10 well-established common-law right -- rights to access11 that are based, not on modern notions of transparency,12 but on the right to secure property and other basic13 interests -­14 JUSTICE SCALIA: But those -- those rights15 still exist in this State, don't they? Cannot you get16 records of deeds and whatever the common law would have17 covered?18 MR. GUPTA: Well, it's true that -- that19 Virginia's law exempts deeds from its Freedom of20 Information law, but, if I understand their position￼constitutionalpeople fromask them -- I1 I guess we can ask them.2 client, Mr. Hurlbert,3 is in the business of gathering property records for his4 clients. Now, it's true that, in Virginia, he could get5 the deed, but what he can't get and what he principally6 gathers for his clients are real estate tax assessment7 records, and those are a much richer storehouse of8 property-related information than simply the deed.9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you -- can you10 explain that business a little more fully than you did11 in the briefs? He's in the business of collecting12 records from all the States about tax13 MR. GUPTA: That's right.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And he15 that for a client who could very well16 what is the service that's being performed?17 MR. GUPTA: Well, he -- you know, he doesn't18 just do the routine request. The -- the large data19 companies are the ones who hire him. And they -- if20 they're routine requests, they can do them themselves;21 although if they're not based in Virginia, they would22 still have to hire a Virginian to do it.23 But they bring him in when there's some flaw24 in the -- the routine process where the -- the State is25 being recalcitrant or the local official is being5MR. GUPTA:  Well, myassessments.-- and he doesask himself.  So￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425  recalcitrant.  And he's an expert in being able to  gatherthese -- these records and knowing the process is  knowing what he's allowed to do and what he's not  allowed to do.              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  All -- all he has to  do is get somebody from -- from Virginia to ask for him,  right?              MR. GUPTA:  Well, he could hire someone from  Virginia to do that, but that's -- you know, that's sort  of precisely what the -­              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but you don't  have to pay the person too much, he just has to write a  letter saying, give me these documents, right?              MR. GUPTA:  He would still have to hire  someone, and that would be an increased cost.  And -- for              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, an increased  cost of -- I don't know how much -- 100 bucks, right?  Go -- write a letter, say you want these documents, and,  when they come to your house, give them to me.              MR. GUPTA:  Yeah.  For the large data  companies -- you know, they will hire someone other than  him to perform this service.  They will -- if you're  talking about routine requests.  But even -- you know,  even for them, if you're talking about a -- a request  that isn't routine, if he has to do something further to6￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425  enforce the rights, he's going to have to do that in his  ownname, or the data company will have to hire someone  other than him, someone based in Virginia, to do that  for them.  And then he will lose that business.              So the lower you go down in the food chain  of the data industry, the bigger the effect of  Virginia's policy.              JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How much -- how much of  an impact, in fact, does it have on his business?  I  mean, there are 47 States who will provide this  information.              MR. GUPTA:  Well, for -- for him, in the  Virginia market, it completely forecloses him from doing  access -- business in the Virginia market.              And, if other States were to have policies  like this, he wouldn't be able to do business in those  States as well.  So if -- if the focus is on him and his  business in Virginia, it completely cuts him off.              If the focus is on -- on what the effect is  in the aggregate, on the market as a whole, because most  public records requests are commercial requests, it's  going to have an effect on most commercial requesters  who are out-of-State.  And -­              JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Gupta, I -- I  understand that the -- the reasoning of Virginia in not7￼1 allowing out-of-State people to -- to get these FOIA requests2 is the following: That the purpose of these -­3 these laws -- and I remember it when the first ones were4 enacted -- government in the sunshine. The purpose of5 it was not to enable people to get information, per se;6 it was to enable people to see how their government is7 working, so that they could attend to any malfeasance8 that is occurring in the process of government.9 It seems to me entirely in accord with that10 purpose of these laws to say it's only Virginia citizens11 who -- who are concerned about the functioning of12 Virginia government and ought to be able to get whatever13 records Virginia agencies have.14 What's -- what's wrong with that reasoning?15 MR. GUPTA: A few responses, Justice Scalia.16 First, transparency was one purpose, but, as17 I said, these laws also carried forward the much more18 longstanding rights to access based on personal19 interests and property interests. Also, even at the20 time that these laws were enacted -­21 JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but you don't need22 any personal or property interest under these laws. You23 can just -- just out of curiosity, if you -- if you were a24 Virginian, at least, in Virginia, even though you have25 no interest in the matter at all, you can ask the agency8￼1 for records about this or that. It -- it2 based on -- on the3 traditional property interest. It's based on the4 ability of the citizens of the State to find out what5 the -- what the government of the State is up to.6 MR. GUPTA: Even -- even at the time that7 these laws were enacted in the -- in the '60s, it was8 well-understood that they were going to have a big9 commercial impact. The property records industry wascan't be10 full swing by the end of the late 19th Century.11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the point is that12 FOIA is tied to, as Justice Scalia said, the citizens13 should know what their government is doing. And you14 don't have to give any reason at all, if you were a part15 of that political community. Now, Virginia doesn't16 allow people from out-of-State to vote. They're not17 part of Virginia's political community.18 So why isn't this -- if you're not part of19 the political community, then you don't fall under FOIA,20 which is a peculiar statute, in that everybody who is21 covered by it can get whatever they want, and they don't22 have to give any reason for it.23 MR. GUPTA: Right. Well, elections just24 simply don't work if you -- if you allow noncitizens to25 participate in elections or if you can't wall off the9in￼1 State in that respect. But what the State can't say is,2 simply because one purpose of this law is that we want3 to constitute ourselves as a political community, that4 we can exclude activities that have a big commercial5 effect.6 And -- you know, when we're looking under7 the Dormant Commerce Clause or under the Privileges and8 Immunities Clause, this Court's cases have said9 repeatedly you don't look to uncover the original10 legislative purpose, you look to whether there is11 discrimination, which there is here, on its face, and12 you look to whether there is a discriminatory effect.13 One example of how this policy is actually14 being -­15 JUSTICE KAGAN: And is the only thing that's16 necessary -- excuse me -- is the only thing that's17 necessary that the law affect a few people commercially?18 I mean, how much -- how many of the requesters have to19 be engaged in some kind of commercial activity in order20 for your arguments to work?21 MR. GUPTA: Well, what this Court has said22 is that there is no de minimis exception, if there's23 discrimination against commerce, but, here, what's going24 on is anything, but de minimis. Virginia does not deny25 that the -- the vast majority of the requesters are10￼1 commercial requesters -- the vast majority of out-of-State2 requesters are commercial requesters.3 Their -- the amicus brief supporting their4 side, the Local Government Attorneys of Virginia amicus5 brief, at page 30, explains the way this policy -­6 policy is being implemented, is that noncommercial7 requests are typically honored, but out-of-State8 requests by data miners are being categorically denied9 under the policy.10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But this -- this is11 not -- this is not a regulation of commerce. It's a12 State practice that may have an incidental effect on13 commerce, and the incidental effect may be14 disproportionate, depending upon whether you're State or15 local, but it's not a regulation of commerce.16 MR. GUPTA: But that's -- that was the17 Fourth Circuit's theory, and I think incidental can mean18 a few different things, and I think in -- in their19 opinion, it -- it does mean at least three different20 things. So maybe it would be helpful if I try to unpack21 that.22 If it means incidental in terms of the23 effect on my client's business, I think, as I've24 explained, it's anything, but incidental; it completely25 forecloses him from the market. If it means incidental11￼1 in terms of the -- the aggregate effect of this statute,2 again, it's not incidental because the vast majority3 of -- of affected parties under this policy are4 out-of-State commercial requesters, particularly data5 companies.6 And -- you know, if it means incidental7 compared to the purpose of the statute, as I've said,8 transparency was one purpose of the modern FOIA laws,9 but they also subsumed and sit on top of all of the10 longstanding rights of public access that have been11 around since the -- the first settlements in the United12 States -- or before the United States, when, in order to13 have a functioning property system, we recognized that14 you've got to have records of who owns what and -- and15 those records have to be made available to anyone in16 order to exercise property rights.17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the State of18 Virginia says, as a policy, we want to help Virginia19 businesses, and so we're going to open a business20 training, best practices institute, where you're going21 to learn how to be a better business person, but the￼22 only people23 businesses.24 25who can come in are -- are VirginiaMR. GUPTA:  Right.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Under your theory,121 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425  because that will have an effect -- an incidental effect  oncommerce in a way that's discriminatory, is -- is  that unconstitutional?              MR. GUPTA:  I don't think so.  And there are  a couple of distinctions.              First, that's not something that the State  exclusively is able to provide.  It's not like the  courthouse or the public archives across the street or  the road that runs between them that only the -- the  State is able to provide.              Anyone can provide a business training  institute, so the State is just one player among many.  Also -- running a              JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that -- that just goes  to the extent of the impact, not -- not on the  principle.  And you say extent doesn't matter.  You say  there's no such thing as a de minimis exception.              MR. GUPTA:  No -­              JUSTICE SCALIA:  So that -- that explanation  doesn't -- doesn't seem, to me, to hold water.              MR. GUPTA:  Well, maybe I didn't explain it  very well.  To be clear, I think it's more than just a  difference in degree; it's a difference in kind.  These  are fundamentally different when -- when you're talking  about running the courthouse or running the public13￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425  archives, nobody else can do that.              Nobody elsecan collect -- you know, make  tax assessments, collect those records, and keep the  official public archive of those things.  That -­JUSTICE SCALIA: So what? So what? Except to the extent that that bears upon how much of a -- an imposition this is upon interstate commerce. It seems, to me, that's the only relevance of that point.              MR. GUPTA:  Well -­JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and you dismiss that relevance. You say it doesn't matter how extensive the impact is on -- on interstate commerce.              MR. GUPTA:  Well, to the extent that you -­  you think it does matter, I mean, that -- that  distinction doesn't matter in this case because the  impact is -- is great.  The principal impact is an  impact on out-of-State commerce.But let me -­              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is that -- when  you're talking about impact, is that a Pike analysis?              MR. GUPTA:  No.  I think this -- if you were  in -- in the dormant Commerce Clause, this would be the  per se rule of invalidity.  You have facial  discrimination.  The -- the -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought, if14￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425  it was facial discrimination, you're not concerned aboutimpact.              MR. GUPTA:  That's right.  That's right.              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought a question  of talking about the effects on interstate commerce,  that's the -- you know, the Pike analysis.              MR. GUPTA:  No.  What this Court has said is  that -- that the first -- sort of first-tier scrutiny,  the per se rule is -- is for cases where there's  discrimination on its face or discrimination in effect.  And then you've got this other category for the -- the  Pike analysis, where the State regulates evenhandedly.              JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What's your closest case  in support of the proposition that this is impermissible  as a discrimination against interstate commerce?  What's  your best case?              MR. GUPTA:  When you say, "this," you mean  the -- that public records access is commerce?              JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If -- if you -- you are  arguing, as one of your arguments here, that this is  discriminatory as to -- as to interstate commerce, as I  understand your argument, what is the best case you have  to support your position?  What's the closest case?              MR. GUPTA:  Well, I think if you're -- if  you're -- if the question is about whether or not15￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425  records access is commerce, there's Reno v. Condon thisCourt's unanimous decision -­              JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, my question is  what's the best case you have for your argument?              MR. GUPTA:  Well, I think -- you know, this  Court's unanimous decision in Reno v. Condon held that,  because people buy public records and sell them in  interstate commerce, that's, indisputably, interstate  commerce.  So we -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that wasn't a discrimination. That wasn't a -­              MR. GUPTA:  That's right.              JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's just -- that goes  to the question whether or not this is commerce.              MR. GUPTA:  That -- that's right.              JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What -- what is your best  case to show that this is discriminatory in violation of  our precedence?              MR. GUPTA:  Well, Virginia doesn't deny that  there's discrimination on its face, so I take your  question to be asking -- you know, what about the  commerce aspect?  And in Reno v. Condon -­              JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Now -- if I have  to write the opinion, what case do I put down?  I'm  waiting.16￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425              MR. GUPTA:  Yeah, I mean, you -- okay.  So  youcan also look to Camps Newfound, which, I think -­  you know, was much -- much more attenuated to commerce.  There, you had a generally applicable law, a property  tax law -­one case -­JUSTICE BREYER:  If I only have time to readMR. GUPTA:  Yeah.            JUSTICE BREYER:  -- or possibly two, whichwould you like me to read?  I think that's, basically,the question.(Laughter.)            MR. GUPTA:  Yeah.  I mean -- you know, look.There's no case that's -- that's entirely on all fours,but -­            JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  But I assume youdon't want me -­            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's why you're here.            (Laughter.)            MR. GUPTA:  So right.  So -- so -- okay.  Sothe Camps Newfound case is -- is a case where you had agenerally applicable law.  It was a property tax law.It exempted -- you know, charities that served primarilyin-State residents.            It was -- there is no evidence that the17￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425  State of Maine intended that to be a -- you know, adiscrimination against commerce and, obviously, swept  more broadly and affected both commerce and  non-commerce.  But this Court said that -- you know, you  had facial discrimination against commerce because there  were people operating these summer camps, and they were  treated differently -­              JUSTICE BREYER:  I'll look at those.  But I  think the Commerce Clause, basically, has, as its  objective, insofar as it's dormant, to prevent a  legislature or decisionmaker within its State  discriminating in favor of their own State producers.              MR. GUPTA:  Right.              JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, it's pretty hard for  me to put this case into that mold.              MR. GUPTA:  Well, I mean, one -- you know,  one piece of evidence, Justice Breyer, is the media  exception to the Virginia statute.  It -- this -- this  makes it clear that Virginia was aware that people who  were requesting information for commercial purposes were  going to use this statute and they exempted the press -­              JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's just Virginia media,  though, isn't it?  Isn't it only media that -­￼So it's -­MR. GUPTA:  That's right, Justice Scalia.181 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Virginia?it's -­JUSTICE SCALIA: -- exists or is broadcast intoMR. GUPTA: That's right. So it's -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's consistent with their purpose, that this statute is meant to assure good, honest government in Virginia.            MR. GUPTA:  Well, if this is a statute, it'sa pretty unusual statute that discriminates amongnewspapers, so it says -­            JUSTICE BREYER:  If it does what the -- Ihad exactly the same question for both parts of yourargument, that what it's their -- am I right in thinkingthat anyone can get any information -- anyone in anyState can get any information that pertains to him orher?  Is that right or not?            MR. GUPTA:  There is a separate Virginia -­            JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that right or not?            MR. GUPTA:  Yes.  There is aseparate Virginia statute that allows this.            JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  That's what I wantedto know, whether it's separate or not.            MR. GUPTA:  That's right.            JUSTICE BREYER:  Anyone from Alaska toHawaii can get any information that pertains to him or19￼2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425judicial records, there is a different statute thatmakes judicial records public.            MR. GUPTA:  That's correct.            JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So we're, now,talking about the class of information, other than thetwo classes I've mentioned.            And I then ended up -- and I'd like you toadd something to this, if you can, that, really, this isabout -- since getting information involves usually abenefit to the recipient, but, sometimes, harm to theperson the information is about, that willing to runthat harm and risk of harm is the interest in State goodgovernment, okay?            MR. GUPTA:  Uh-huh.            JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, if that's theinterest, that's an interest that probably a State hasthe right, just as it has the right to say other peoplecan't vote in State elections, if that's the interest,then I guess it could take reasonable measures relatedto that interest.            All right.  Now, that is the -- the argumentor the position that I would appreciate your addressing.            MR. GUPTA:  Sure.  You know, that -- we201 her. Second, that this has nothing to do with￼1 don't deny that that's an interest that the State has, but2 then you have to see whether the -- the interest is3 reasonably furthered by the statute. And, here, you4 have a resource that is not finite, and the statute5 allows the State to recoup its expenses.6 So nothing is lost to Virginians. There7 isn't any loss in transparency to Virginians by8 extending access to out-of-State data companies.9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if it costs for10 Virginia -- Virginia has to take care of its own, and,11 if it has to service FOIA requests from all over, it's12 going to cost the State. It's going to have to hire13 people to do this. They're going to have to spend many14 hours going through these records, so the State15 doesn't -- it wants to conserve its resources for its16 own people.17 MR. GUPTA: But -- but there's no loss in18 resources, Justice Ginsburg, because the statute allows19 Virginia to fully recoup any administrative expenses.20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I'm having -­21 JUSTICE SCALIA: But they -- but they just22 don't want out -- they -- they don't want outlanders23 mucking around in -- in Virginia government. It's24 perfectly okay for good old Virginians to do that, but25 they don't want outlanders to do it. Why -- why is that21￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425  unreasonable?              MR. GUPTA:  Yeah.  That -- that iscertainly  their interest.  But you've got to see whether the  policy serves -- serves -- you know, the interest,  and -- and this is a statute that is supposed to promote  transparency.  It actually makes it less transparent.              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I'm -- I -­  there is underlying your argument a sort of fundamental  belief that you are entitled to relief -- pardon the  alliteration -- simply because the statute discriminates  between citizens and noncitizens.  Is that your  position?              MR. GUPTA:  No, not at all, I mean -­              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So if it's not, what are  the two rights that you -- or what rights are it that  you're claiming have been violated?  You say privileges  and immunities.  What's the privilege or immunity?              MR. GUPTA:  It's the privilege or immunity  of pursuing a common calling across State borders.  So  there's no dispute here that Mr. Hurlbert's common  calling is -- is gathering data.  In fact, those are the  principal users of public records laws.              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So is this -- is this an  as-applied challenge to the -­MR. GUPTA: That's right.22￼18 But you're saying the out-of -- the19 in-Stater, it doesn't matter. Out-of-Stater, is it your20 argument that, if this out-of-Stater has a good reason21 for getting this and it's related to the out-of-State's22 business, so you -- you're changing the character of a23 FOIA statute, which is it doesn't matter what you want24 it for.25231 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. MR.2 GUPTA: That's right.3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So this is an as-applied4 challenge?5 MR. GUPTA: Yes. So -- so it's an6 as-applied challenge with respect to Mr. Hurlbert's7 common calling. There's no -- there's no dispute that8 that is his common calling and that this law has the9 effect of completely cutting him off from pursuing his10 common calling in the Virginia market and that 47 other11 States -­12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you would be doing13 something very strange with this statute because you14 would be saying Hurlbert has a right to this because15 it's his business. But the statute, the character of16 this statute is it doesn't matter what you want the17 information for.￼MR. GUPTA:  Right.  I mean, you would -- you1 know, we would -- we would ask that you rule that the statute2 is unconstitutional, as applied to him, and then3 Virginia would have the choice, if it has a -­4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I'm having a5 problem, and then I think it's Justice Ginsburg's6 problem, which is, absent the statute, he can't demand7 that Virginia provide him with this information because8 that's how he wants to work, correct?9 So what's the added value that gives him a10 right to demand it merely because a statute exists? He11 doesn't have a right to the information.12 MR. GUPTA: Well, he's -- all he's asking13 for is information that's available in the public14 archives on equal terms with Virginians. In the same15 way that -- that someone who -­16 JUSTICE BREYER: He -- he has a very17 reasonable request in my view, but the question isn't18 the reasonableness of his request. The question's -­19 you know, whether they can do it. And the -- the way -­20 the work -- the thing that's bothering me on the work21 part is this: It seems that the work is sort of22 tailored to the statute.23 It's in this way. I -- I have a job, and my24 job is to study election processes. And I write25 reports, and I find amazing things about differences24￼1 among States. They're truly amazing. And I say2 -- you know, it would help me a3 lot if I was actually a voter in each of these States.4 That would help my job. It would lend authenticity, and5 I could learn things that I probably couldn't learn6 otherwise.7 Now, does that add anything to the argument?8 I mean, I don't think so, but it sounds a little bit9 like you're making that kind of argument -­10 MR. GUPTA: No.11 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and -- and they either12 do have the right or they don't. And I don't know that13 it helps that I -- that I say, well, I really want it14 for my work.15 MR. GUPTA: Right. But this is -- this is a16 profession that has existed since the founding era. I17 mean, we've -- you know, we've cited cases in our18 opening brief of -- of people hiring professionals to19 search the records for them before engaging in property20 transactions. By the late 19th Century, you had an21 enormous industry that was designed to do this.22 So this isn't -- Mr. Hurlbert isn't someone23 who's making up some profession. He's part of a very24 large industry that has done this for a very long time.25 And that industry, yes, like lawyers depend on25￼1 courthouses or truckers depend on roads, his industry depends2 on access to the public archives.3 And -- you know, it's true that -- that now4 you have these modern public records laws, but I -- I5 think Virginia's argument would be the same if you were6 just talking about can -- can they bar the doors to the7 archives building? Can they bar the doors to the8 property records? So there's no -- I don't see any9 distinction in kind -­10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is this -- is this11 your Privileges and Immunities argument or your dormant12 Commerce Clause argument?13 MR. GUPTA: You know, I think the logic of14 both arguments are similar, but I think it, most15 clearly, is illustrated in the Privileges and Immunities16 context where -­17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So then it's not18 enough that this is a big deal to your client. It has19 to be something that is essential to hold the country20 together as a national unit. And it seems, to me, it's21 a bit of a stretch to say somebody gathering records22 about commercial -- under FOIA fits that description.23 MR. GUPTA: I don't think it's a stretch at24 all, Justice -- Chief Justice. The -- the aggregators25 of records make possible mortgage origination, credit26￼1 reporting, insurance adjustment. The -- the economy -- and2 you have an amicus brief -­3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but, see,4 they're just to get into those. Again, I think a lot of5 those examples you -- you do have access under other6 statutes. You're talking about mortgage rules and all7 that. Aren't those all -­8 MR. GUPTA: No, no. Not to this kind of9 information. The -- the information that Mr. Hurlbert10 is gathering, tax assessment information, is essential11 to -- to mortgage origination and credit reporting. The12 people who hire him are large data companies, and the -­13 the data industry brief explains the uses of this14 information.15 That -- that information is essential to16 these activities. And Virginia, virtually alone among17 the States, is -- is erecting this barrier to access18 that market and reserving the right to access that19 market to only people who live in the State.20 And -- and -- you know, this would be no21 different if it were just talking about the archives22 that -- that include all the information that the -­23 yes, it's true that Virginia has exempted of the title24 itself, but I don't see that the logic of their position25 allows them to make that distinction. I mean, that's27￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425  just a feature of their -- of their statute.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could I -- I'm still trying to  tease out what your claim is.  Let's suppose Virginia  passes a statute that says, We'll let nonresidents have  access, but they have to pay all the costs.  Nonresidents don't.              Would that satisfy you as valid?              MR. GUPTA:  I think that would be a closerquestion, but I think thatwell.  I mean, so, in yourthe citizens of the State,cost on to out-of-Staters.presents some problems ashypothetical, it's free tobut they're just passing the            And -- you know, this -- this Court, incases like Toomer and Mullaney, have said that atleast -- you know, where the State can show that thenonresidents pose some unique evil, that the -- theState is entitled to pass the costs on.            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why isn't it just -- youjust being costs them more?            MR. GUPTA:  Right.            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That was JusticeGinsburg's point, which is every time you've put in arequest, you're costing them more money.            MR. GUPTA:  Right.  But -- but that would bediscriminating against non as -- noncitizens solely28￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425  because they're noncitizens.  So, if there's some  particular-­              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, why?  You were  costing them more.              MR. GUPTA:  Right.  Well, that's -- that's  precisely the rationale that -- that in  Justice Kennedy's opinion for the Court in Barnard v.  Thorstenn, this Court rejected.  This -- the Virgin  Islands wanted to say if we open up our bar to people  from all over the country, it's going to increase the  administrative resources.  And this Court said, no,  that's not a good enough reason.  That's just  discriminating on the basis of citizenship.              But if, for example, the State could show  that there was -- you know, there were shipping costs  that were uniquely posed by nonresidents and they wanted  to assess a $5 shipping fee for all nonresidents, that  might be permissible.              And, if there are no further questions, I'd  like to reserve my time.              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.              General Getchell?        ORAL ARGUMENT OF EARLE DUNCAN GETCHELL, JR.,                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS              MR. GETCHELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it29￼1 please the Court:2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure how you3 save administrative costs under this statute. They4 could go to any Virginia resident, it's not illegal, and5 probably will, it'll cost them something more, but not6 you, and get the very same information.7 So how do you justify this discrimination?8 Because it's so easily -- the administrative cost is9 going to be1011 the purpose12 commercial,13 going to subsidize with tax dollars this function14 because we can't recover our overhead; we can over -­15 only recover the actual cost.16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you want to give more17 businesses to Virginia citizens who will now charge18 out-of-State residents money to process their FOIA19 requests?20 MR. GETCHELL: No, Your Honor. I don't21 think anybody was thinking about businesses of any sort.22 I think they were saying that we have a political23 hygiene statute. They were very much the fad. It24 happened in -- in my lifetime, too. I remember when2530The -­imposed anyway.MR. GETCHELL:  I would -- would suggest thatof the statute, which is political, notleft the State with the position that it was￼1 they were adopted. Nobody thought they were commercial in2 nature.3 And I do want to -- want to repel the notion4 that there is even substantial discrimination in this5 case because Mr. Hurlbert, in his admission that this is6 an as-applied challenge, has a difficulty with7 substantial equality of access, because it turns out8 that Mr. Hurlbert, in his reply brief, when he teed up9 the 1786 statute, which does give access -- did give10 access, he focused his argument on that statute.11 And if you run that statute, you will find12 that between 1830 -- 1813 and 1840, that you did not13 have general access. They went back to having to show a14 particular interest. But that -- from 1840, '41 until15 today, through the codes of 1819 and -- and up until the16 present code, Section 17.1208, he has the right of17 access to tax assessment records.18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the -- if I19 understood your answer to Justice Sotomayor, the only20 reason you don't let out-of-Staters get these records is21 because of the added overhead costs?22 MR. GETCHELL: No, Your Honor. It's just23 not part of the interests the State was trying to serve.24 The State -­25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know.31￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425  But -- but -- so why don't you do it anyways?  Just --  justas I asked your friend, it doesn't seem like that  big a deal.  It doesn't seem like that big a deal for  you either.  If you can recoup overhead costs from  people who request -- and I'd assume you would be able  to -- why don't other people -- people from West  Virginia may have interest in how Virginia government  operates, too.              And -- and, again, if -- what cost is there to  you, other than overhead?  You don't want to keep how  Virginia government operates quiet from outsiders when  you let in -- its citizens get the access, do you?              MR. GETCHELL:  The -- we are here to defend  the decisions of the two lower courts that apply  existing doctrine.  And, under existing doctrine, only  if we discover that this is a fundamental right, do I  have to justify -­              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's under  the Privileges -- the Privileges and Immunitiesargument.              MR. GETCHELL:  That's correct.              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  But what  about the Dormant Commerce Clause?              MR. GETCHELL:  Under the Dormant Commerce  Clause, we would first have to have a regulation of32￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425  commerce that's discriminatory.  And I would say that  a -­that this is a governmental function.  I would saythat -­              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, I know -- I  understand your argument.  I'm just asking you why  bother?  I mean, what -- what's the -- and that's  certainly pertinent to some of the Commerce Clause  analysis.  And I haven't heard anything, other than the  overhead costs.  And I think you can recoup that from  the requesters.              MR. GETCHELL:  I cannot, Your Honor.              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why not?              MR. GETCHELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, the  statute says I cannot recoup the cost of maintaining and  generating the database, which is, by definition,  overhead.  I cannot -­              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you've got to  maintain and generate the database, anyway, for Virginia  citizens who are going to ask for it.  This is not an  added cost.  It's an added cost if you  have to hire an additional person to handle -- as far as  I can tell, just these two people.              MR. GETCHELL:  It's an added burden, too.  It's not all -­JUSTICE SCALIA: But the Virginia citizens33￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425  pay for that database, right?              MR. GETCHELL:  Theydo.  This is ataxpayer -­              JUSTICE SCALIA:  And the out-of-Staters  don't pay for the database.              MR. GETCHELL:  This is a taxpayer-subsidizedsystem.              JUSTICE SCALIA:  And, besides, do -- do  you -- is it the law that -- that the State of Virginia  cannot do anything that's pointless?              Only -- only the Federal Government can do  stuff that's pointless?(Laughter.)              MR. GETCHELL:  The -- there is a  burden -- there is a non-financial burden as well  because, as one who is subject to FOIA requests, we have  a finite number of officials and employees who have to  address these things.  And that -­              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You keep making that  argument.  But you don't stop residents for asking for  the information from someone else.  I mean, that's one  of the points of your law, which is they can hire a  Virginia resident to get it for them.  Most of the big  people are doing that already.              So you're not saving any money if they can34￼1 get the information simply by paying someone in Virginia to2 get it for them.3 MR. GETCHELL: In -- in fact, the State of4 Virginia has made the policy decision to give this5 information to its citizens and not to inquire behind it6 to see whether or not somebody's doing it for an7 out-of-Stater. And not -­8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or even for commercial9 purposes. Don't you think if -- if those who created10 these government in the sunshine laws could have drafted11 them in such a way that inquiries for commercial12 purposes would not be allowed, but only those inquiries13 that are intended to look into the workings of State14 government and produce government in the sunshine, don't15 you think that they probably would have excluded16 commercial inquiries, if they could?17 But you can't tell which ones are commercial18 and which aren't.19 MR. GETCHELL: And we don't -- and we don't20 try. We have a policy decision that we want to have a21 very simple system that allows our citizens to make22 inquiries without a demonstrated need or cause because23 we want there to be sunshine.24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's no more25 complicated a system if you let out-of-Staters have35￼1 access, too. You say we want a simple system. It's going to2 be the same system, whether you win or lose.3 MR. GETCHELL: The thing that is of -- of4 great concern -- why do we care, why do we bother -- is5 the principle that when a government is providing a6 taxpayer-subsidized service of recent origin to its7 citizens, that it does not have to explain its choice,8 either under the Privileges and Immunities Clause or9 under the Dormant Commerce Clause.10 It is very important that we not find11 ourselves with lawsuits that say, "services." Voluntary12 services are, in fact, things that, now, have to be13 justified under those two provisions of the14 Constitution.15 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that -- that's where16 he comes in with his argument because I -- I agree, you17 can -- you don't have -- let's say the most fabulous18 reason for doing this, but you have a reason.19 (Laughter.)20 JUSTICE BREYER: And so the question is,21 does it have to be better than that? And -- and they22 are saying yes. And, as I heard it, this -- what I23 would characterize as a strong argument -- this sort of,24 first of all, strikes me as a stronger argument, is25 that, look, if we go back into history, out-of-State36￼1 real estate people could always get information about2 property -- let's say they had a client who wanted to3 buy it.4 Now, you've protected that. But, in today's5 world, it's important that we get statistics about this,6 too, because our economy is national. If we understand7 how States are taxing their real estate, we will know to8 what extent they increase the value, to what extent they9 increase the rate, to what extent they really get the10 money they are supposed to, to what extent they might11 get money or not get money in the future.12 And all of those things are nationally13 important, so that people can put them together and14 make -- better than we have done in the past -­15 predictions16 and, hence,1718 making. And he says, so, therefore, there is a national19 interest in the flow of this information. And that￼about what is likely to happen to Statesthe national economy.  All right.That's -- that's the kind of argument he's20 means you have to have a better than "uh-huh" kind of21 rationale. That's -- that's what he's saying, I think.22 MR. GETCHELL: But it's very difficult for23 Mr. Hurlbert to make that fairly expansive argument24 because it turns out -­25 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, to be fair, I -- I371 was sort of expanding it.2 MR. GETCHELL: But, in point of fact,3 because he is entitled to the tax assessment data in the4 clerk's office, in the case of Henrico County, where he5 went, you go in the same building and -- if you're6 Mr. Hurlbert, you turn in one direction, you go to the7 clerk's office.8 And, if somebody in Virginia and wants to -­9 for whatever reason, get it from the tax assessor's10 book, instead of from the clerk's book, you turn in the11 other direction.12 JUSTICE KAGAN: But you don't deny that, in13 general, this does affect out-of-State data collectors,14 people who are engaged in the kind of business that(Laughter.)￼15 Justice Breyer was talking about, is that right?16 MR. GETCHELL: I have no idea in this record17 because we were on summary judgment -- cross motions for18 summary judgment, and the district court and the court of19 appeals, both in our judgment, correctly ruled that20 there's a two -- two-step inquiry.21 And the first step is whether or not22 there is a fundamental right. And in the absence23 of a -­24 2538JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's only in his1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425  Privileges and Immunities Clause claim.              MR.GETCHELL:  Well -­              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  He claims that the  dormant Commerce Clause has been effected because he  reads this statute as saying only Virginia recording  companies have access; out-of-State can't.  And it's a  fair reading of the statute.  It only permits Virginia  residents, which include commercial and noncommercial,  to access the information.              So assume, hypothetically, that the statute  reads "only Virginia commercial businesses have access  to this information" -­              MR. GETCHELL:  If -- if, in fact, you want  to rewrite the statute to -- subject to -- it to attack,  obviously, that would then raise questions about a  nongovernmental protectionist intent, but that's not the  way this statute was written.  It's not how it was  crafted.  It -- it has nothing to do with commerce.              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that's the  question I'm -- I'm raising the best argument for your  adversary, okay?              MR. GETCHELL:  Right.              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because we could call it  a direct -- he calls it direct discrimination because  commercial businesses are being permitted in Virginia,39￼1 but not noncommercial. You say it's indirect. How do we2 draw the line between direct and indirect, when the3 bottom-line consequence is the same?4 MR. GETCHELL: I would -- I would have about5 three answers to that. The first -- the first one is6 that we don't trigger the dormant Commerce Clause7 analysis, unless we are exercising the police power of a8 State to regulate commerce. And that means -- it does9 mean that not every statute a State passes triggers an10 inquiry, even if it has an indirect effect on commerce.11 Whereas, here, we have a statute that has a12 solely political intent, the fact that -- that now that13 the amici want to tell us about this great burgeoning14 enterprise, they -- they want the Court to take that15 into account.16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you -- are you telling17 us that there is simply no commercial consequences to18 this statute at all, that Virginians find this to be of19 no commercial value, in any instance?20 MR. GETCHELL: I am totally agnostic on this21 record because we don't have any data on that.22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you were the one23 with summary judgment. Now, maybe -- maybe they didn't24 come forward with the information, but we interpret25 summary judgment in favor of -- of the losing party.40￼1 And you're -- so you say you are totally2 agnostic. I am concerned that you are preventing them,3 by the summary judgment, from showing that there -- even4 with Virginians, there is a commercial value frequently5 to this information.6 MR. GETCHELL: All right.7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not just political.8 MR. GETCHELL: On this -- on this record -­9 on this record, the position that was accepted by the10 two courts below, entirely in accordance with this11 Court's existing doctrine, was the first inquiry under12 Privileges and Immunities, was whether there was a13 fundamental right. If there -- if there is not, then we14 make no further inquiry.15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's talk about -- let's16 talk about the Commerce Clause. You are saying you are17 agnostic. You have no idea whether or not there might18 be some commercial value to this information. I would19 think, as an officer of the State of Virginia or as a20 matter of judicial notice, we could -- we could take21 notice that there is.22 MR. GETCHELL: I'm saying that, under this23 record, that never came up, nor should it have come up,24 because what the court said on dormant Commerce Clause,25 both of the courts below, was this is not a regulation41￼9 10MR. GETCHELL: I believe -­JUSTICE SCALIA: You say that it's up -­MR. GETCHELL: Correct, Your Honor. JUSTICE SCALIA: -- whether -- whether1 of commerce, it is a governmental action --2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it has -- it has -­3 JUSTICE SCALIA: You are saying that it's no4 more necessary for you to show that there's no5 commercial value to allowing out-of-Staters to do this6 than it is necessary for you to show that there is no7 commercial value to your not allowing out-of-Staters to8 hunt deer in Virginia.11 to Virginia 121314 out-of-Staters can hunt for Virginia game.15 MR. GETCHELL: Correct.￼16 JUSTICE SCALIA: And it's up to Virginia17 whether out-of-Staters can have access to the State's18 records, that they have no interest in, personally,19 under -- under this law. It seems, to me, perfectly20 logical.21 MR. GETCHELL: But, remember, they do -­22 they do have access to this information, both Hurlbert23 and McBurney.24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, that assumes25 the question as to whether or not there is a general421 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425  commercial interest in these -- in these -- in thesedocuments.  And you say, oh, you are agnostic.  At least  that means you are open to the possibility that there  might be a commercial interest.(Laughter.)              MR. GETCHELL:  Well, here's the problem in  this case is because I think that we are not at  first-tier analysis, because there is no regulation of  commerce that is discriminatory -­JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't understand -- if that's your argument on it, I reject it as Justice Kennedy does. I -- I didn't understand you to be arguing that there is no commercial value.              MR. GETCHELL:  I'm trying to explain why it  doesn't matter.              JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, that's what I thought.              (Laughter.)              MR. GETCHELL:  It doesn't -- it doesn't  matter because if -- if, on the threshold inquiry, we  don't have a discriminatory regulation of commerce, but  just an ordinary governmental function, then only  Pike-Church analysis could possibly -­              JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- you can't say  discriminatory regulation.  What about a tax?  I mean,  you can't tax discriminatorily, and I wouldn't call43￼1 taxation, in and of itself, a regulation of commerce, would2 you?3 MR. GETCHELL: The -- the fact of the matter4 is that it has been -- taxes have been found to be both5 violations of privileges and immunities and dormant6 Commerce Clause, where there were -- there was unequal7 taxation of 89 even thoughcommerce.JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, even though it's -­it's not a regulation of commerce?MR. GETCHELL:  Okay.  Well, I -­JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  I mean, I guessargument, then.MR. GETCHELL:  I apologize I chose a wordas apt as it should have been, but a101112 that's your 1314 that is not15 regulation or taxation centering around commerce16 intended to affect and actually affecting commerce, it17 just -- this just isn't that kind of activity.18 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, General, can I-- just19 indulge me with a hypothetical. Suppose that the background20 for these statutes was different. The statutes were the21 same, but, in addition to talking about people's right22 to know about how their government works, the people￼23 spend a lot24 benefits of25of time also talking about the economica free flow of information in our country.Would that -- if that were true -- and I441 want to put2 statutes were3 4myself on record as not remembering when  thesepassed -- you know.(Laughter. )JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, if that were true,5 would this case be different? Or would you still be up6 here saying the same thing?7 MR. GETCHELL: If -- if I had -- if I had a8 statute which, on its face, dealt with -- with9 commerce -­10 JUSTICE KAGAN: The statute does exactly the11 same thing. I'm just suggesting that there might be two12 interests behind the statute. One is about knowing the13 way your government operates, and the other is about14 free flows of information in our economy.15 And, if both of those things had gone into16 the mix to create statutes of this kind, would you17 be up here saying the same thing or not?18 MR. GETCHELL: I would be saying something19 at least slightly different, if I had different facts20 that I had to deal with, but I think, in principle, I21 would be arguing the power of the State to pass this22 kind of act without having to submit to the dormant23 Commerce Clause, at least first-tier dormant Commerce24 Clause analysis.25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What else -- what else45￼1 can Virginia do besides -- I don't know if there are elks in2 Virginia, but besides -- to reserve for its3 own -- for its own people? You say, this is -- good4 government in Virginia is for Virginians. Big game5 hunting, scarce resource can be reserved for in-State6 people.7 What else can Virginia do?8 MR. GETCHELL: Well, Virginia can -- can do9 things including have in-State tuition. It can have -­10 it can subsidize its own businesses, either by training11 programs or even by other direct subsidy from public12 FISK. It limits welfare payments to residents of the13 Commonwealth.14 When the Commonwealth is just acting as a15 government and not as a regulator or taxer of interstate16 commerce, it has the status of a coequal sovereign that,17 in its own sphere, is allowed to do its own policy18 choices.19 JUSTICE KAGAN: I think the thing, General,20 that I was trying to get at, it seems to me you have a21 very good case that these statutes were -- were meant22 for a different purpose. But, in fact, it seems as23 though your friends there have a good case that these24 statutes have been taken over, to a large extent, across25 the country by economic enterprises doing economic46￼1 things. And, at that point in time, Virginia's -­2 and -- you know, you are only one of two States -­3 Virginia's maintenance of this kind of -- no, it's4 Virginians -- you know, Virginia information for5 Virginians,6 looked like78 say, if you9 inquiry that needs to be made under the Commerce Clause,looks very different from what it might havewhen the statute was originally passed.MR. GETCHELL:  If -- if we were going towere going to say that -- that this is an10 this would be a particularly poor vehicle for doing it11 because the Fourth Circuit held that the Pike analysis12 of the district court was not appealed, and, therefore,13 this case could not be sent back on remand to develop a14 burden analysis of a record -­15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But Pike is not relevant16 here. Pike involves -- the Southern Pacific v. Arizona17 the -- where there were -- where there were melons -­18 where there were melons, and Arizona wanted to make sure19 that you had labels and packing of the melons in20 Arizona. That was -- that was discriminatory against -­21 against interstate -- against interstate commerce.22 That's not -- that's not dormant Commerce23 Clause, but that is discrimination, and there is24 discrimination here.2547￼1 MR. GETCHELL: Well, there's -- there's2 discrimination, only in the sense that we discriminate3 against people who we don't let vote because they don't4 live in the5 statute has6 and -­78 same thing,9 who want to10Commonwealth as well.  I mean, we -- thisa function.  It's a legitimate functionJUSTICE KENNEDY:  You -- you could say thewe don't discriminate against Californianscome and pack their melons in Arizona.MR. GETCHELL:  Well, I would say that -­11 that whether or not somebody can deal with an item in12 commerce is -- is -- raises Commerce Clause questions.13 And just, like in Reno v. Condon, where the State of14 South Carolina was choosing to take its records and sell15 them into the stream of commerce, there, the Court held16 that -- that they thereby became a thing in commerce.17 The records of the tax assessor of the18 County of Henrico, which are available through the19 clerk's office to Mr. Hurlbert, are not things or20 persons in commerce, nor are they -­21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It -- it would surprise me22 if an out-of-State investor, who was thinking of putting23 a large plant in Virginia, had absolutely no interest in24 Virginia's tax policies.25 MR. GETCHELL: But they are available. They48￼1 are publicly available. They are not just not available2 through this adjunct service. All -- all FOIA is, is a3 device where you don't have to go and look. There has4 always been public access for these -- these records.5 JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so suppose -- I mean,6 I think they have an argument, saying, of course, this7 information would be useful for gathering national8 statistics and helping the national economy. I think9 that's true.10 On the other hand, you say, well, but, look,11 there must be something left that the States can reserve12 to their own citizens, there must be something. They13 can't protect their own commerce; that's clear. They14 can't discriminate against people who want to come here15 and live here. That's clear.16 They can't do this and that and the other17 thing, but, gee, there must be something. I mean, can't18 they reserve at least their -- their beaches for their19 own citizens? No. Parking near their beaches? Well,20 maybe. And -- and maybe deer. And, if not this, what?21 That's the end. Okay?22 So that's, basically, what you are saying.23 This is just an interest in trying to find out how State24 institutions work, and the voters have the main interest25 there, and this is other -- so you say the other one is49￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425  attenuated, but not non-existent.  He says the other isimportant, though he recognizes States should be able to  do something.              So if you were me, how would you decide?  How would you choose?              (Laughter.)              JUSTICE BREYER:  What is the standard,  because you know the -- the Privileges and Immunities  Clause is -- is considerably opaque, and there are very  few cases on it.  And so what -- how would you tell me  to -- to resolve that -- that tension because there is a  tension.              MR. GETCHELL:  I -- I think there that -­  that the important policy issue in this case for us is  precisely as you articulated.  There -- there is  residual sovereign power in the State to act, and we  have to violate the Constitution, clearly, before we  lose that authority.              And, under existing privileges and  immunities doctrine, the privileges and immunities  are -- are few; they are -- they have been enumerated in  the courts, they are similar in character, having to do  with commerce, not governmental action.  So I would say  you would not extend privileges and immunities.              JUSTICE SCALIA:  We are talking about50￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425  State-owned documents, aren't we?              MR. GETCHELL:Yes, Your Honor.              JUSTICE SCALIA:  There is not much that's as  close to the sovereignty of the State as the possession  and right to exclude people from its own records and its  own documents, right?              MR. GETCHELL:  I agree, Your -­  Justice Scalia.              JUSTICE SCALIA:  So the -- the issue is can  the State allow its own citizens, for purposes of seeing  that the government is -- is being run on the up-and-up,  have access to those documents, without letting the  whole world?              MR. GETCHELL:  Yes, Your Honor, that is ourposition.              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why doesn't the  dormant Commerce Clause affect the hypothetical I laid  out?  Because, directly, this permits Virginia  commercial businesses to get something that  out-of-Staters can't.  The State is putting this  instrument into commerce.  You say, I don't know that.  But make the assumption that we think the record's clear  enough on that point.              I know you want to fight me on that, but  it's hard -- it's a fight with no legs because you have51￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425  to know that commercial enterprises in Virginia seek  theserecords.              MR. GETCHELL:  I am -- I am arguing that, of  course, I think we say in our brief that -- that they  can be put into commerce.  They are put into commerce,  but we don't put them into commerce.  And we have -- in  the architecture of our bill -- our act has nothing to  do with commerce.              And if a State can't deal with -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Tell us, under our jurisprudence -- the dormant Common Commerce  jurisprudence -- and I have some colleagues who don't -- who  don't believe it should exist.  Take that argument out.  Why is this not a dormant Commerce Clause case?              MR. GETCHELL:  Because it is not an exercise  of the State police power to regulate commerce.  The  documents in the -- in the tax assessor's office of the  County of Henrico are not things or persons in commerce,  nor are they channels or instrumentalities of commerce.  They are just the records of the sovereign, which we  will allow our citizens to obtain.              Unless the Court has further questions, I  think this argument has been developed from ourstandpoint.￼CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, General.521 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            Mr. Gupta, you have three minutes remaining.     REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DEEPAK GUPTA              ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS            MR. GUPTA:  Thank you.  Just a few quickpoints:  First, I just want to clear up, on the statute,I want to make it clear that this statute does allow theState to fully recoup its costs, includingadministrative costs, and the State hasn't saidotherwise.            And, secondly, the suggestion has beenmade -­            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  The -- I -- Ithink what he's saying is you don't have to pay thecosts of developing and maintaining those records, whichcosts are paid by the citizens of Virginia, which givesthem an additional interest in being able to get tothose documents.            You -- you don't claim that -- that you payfor the development and the maintenance of thoserecords.  You just pay for the incremental costs ofgiving it to you, right?            MR. GUPTA:  That -- that's right,Justice Scalia -­￼the rest?JUSTICE SCALIA:  And Virginians pay for all531 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425              MR. GUPTA:  That -- that's right, Justice  Scalia,and that's true of other things, like roads and  courthouses.  And I think this gets to -- Justice Breyer  asked for our test, to try to differentiate this from  other services, and I'd like to try to provide one.              I think, at least where you've got a  function that is reserved to the State -- only the State  can do it, only the State can run the archives -- it's  necessary as a channel to -- to commerce.  And in the -­  in the modern economy, this is as much part of the  information infrastructure as transportation is, like  courthouses, like archives, like roads.              It would not stretch limited resources.  It  would not cost the State additional money, and it would  not jeopardize important local traditions or  institutions -­              JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Are you leaving out -­              MR. GUPTA:  -- that I think you can feel  comfortable -­JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you leaving it -­you -- you switched now to-- and you were led there, but you switched to the dormant Commerce Clause. What about your other client, McBurney? He doesn't have any dormant Commerce Clause claim.              MR. GUPTA:  Right.  And I -- I think the54￼1 test that I just laid out would work for both clauses. It's a2 limiting principle on the justification side.3 But -- but that's right, Mr. McBurney does not have a4 dormant Commerce Clause claim. His claim is based on5 equal access to proceedings.6 He wanted to get recovery of child support7 that he was owed. So he is a creditor seeking to pursue8 a debt on equal terms with people in the State of9 Virginia, and the State set up a process. As one step10 along the way to court, you go to the agency, you ask11 the agency to enforce. The -- the agency has unique12 enforcement tools.13 It can suspend someone's driver's license,14 for example. It can -- it can intercept income tax15 refunds, and it can go to court on your behalf. And all16 he's asking for is the rules of the game. He wants to17 know what procedures apply to that process. And at18 least where a -- an agency has a process that directly19 affects a non-stater in the pocketbook, all we are20 saying is that equal access to the proceedings means21 equal access to the information governing those22 proceedings.23 And, finally, I would just like to close by24 saying that -- you know, what I don't think we heard on25 the justification side from the State was really any55￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425  justification because the State can recoup its costs.  And sothey are not saying that this will cost them  anything more, which was the only justification they  pressed in -- in the courts below.              And so they are left with the position that  they can discriminate simply because they think they  can.  And, if you look at the Privileges and Immunities  Clause, it sits right next to the Full Faith and Credit  Clause, which indicates, if anything, that the framers  thought that the movement of public records across State  lines was important to interstate comity.              They changed the Articles of Confederation  version, which did not include public records; it only  referred to judicial records.  They added a mention of  judicial records -- nonjudicial records and saw that  that was important to -- to comity across State lines.              But -- but their position is about the step  before that.  It's about whether you get the records in  the first place.              Thank you.              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.              The case is submitted.
