CASTELLANO      ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. CASTELLANO:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it7 8 9                                              (10:55 a.m.)          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argumentnext in Number 99-1238, Christopher Artuz v. Tony Bruce1011121314151617    tolling.18              QUESTION:  I take it it all comes up because19    we're construing the language, properly filed, in the20    applicable statutory provision.please the Court:          The issue before the Court in this case iswhether a State prisoner can extend the 1-year limitationsperiod for Federal habeas corpus petitions by filingrepetitive motions in State court that are procedurallybarred from review under State law.  There are at leastthree reasons why these motions should not be afforded21              MR. CASTELLANO:  Absolutely, Your Honor, yes.22    These State post conviction motions, Your Honor, cause23    unnecessary delays from repetitive litigation that advance24    no purpose of the tolling provision.  They provide State25    prisoners with a simple expedient to defeat the statute of3 1    limitations at will, and allowing tolling for such motions 2    undermines core principles of comity and federalism. 3    They're at the heart of this Court's habeas corpus 4    jurisprudence, and at the core of the AEDPA. 5              The statutory language supports the position of 6    the States here.  Under a plain reading of the statutory 7    language the words, properly filed, must mean something 8    more than simply filed. 9              QUESTION:  Well, the courts are all over the lot10    on what the words, properly filed, mean.  It seems to me11    there are several different approaches.  Maybe just12    properly filed in the sense of being timely and in the13    proper place, or maybe getting permission from the State,14    a certificate of appealability if the State requires it,15    that kind of thing.16              MR. CASTELLANO:  Yes, Your Honor.17              QUESTION:  So not every lower court has thought18    that it also encompasses a review of substance to see19    whether it's procedurally barred.20              MR. CASTELLANO:  Yes, that's right, Your Honor.21    There are many --22              QUESTION:  And I guess the court has to later23    decide whether it's procedurally barred.  The State court24    presumably would reach that question, or the Federal25    court, in due course, wouldn't it?41 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. CASTELLANO:  Yes.          QUESTION:  The Federal habeas court would, Isuppose, at the end of the day have to address that issue.          MR. CASTELLANO:  Yes, absolutely, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Yes.          MR. CASTELLANO:  Here there are severaldifferent definitions.  Even among the cases upon whichthe respondent relies, and that demonstrates, if anything,that there is some ambiguity in the language of thestatute.  The word properly is not easily susceptible ofdefinition.  Here --          QUESTION:  And what is your definition ofproperly filed?          MR. CASTELLANO:  It's this, Your Honor.  There'sreally a three-step analysis, if you will.  The first stepis this.  Properly filed must mean something more thanfiled, in addition to the ordinary rules of statutoryconstruction, which would so indicate.          In addition, here Congress used the word filed24 times in the habeas corpus statute but modified it withthe word properly only once, so it must have meant thatthe words properly filed had something more than aninconsequential or nominal meaning.          Second, there's a plain sense, plain commonsense reading of the words, properly filed, under which a5 1    document, to be properly filed, has to be filed in the 2    right place, in the right court, and even some of the 3    cases upon which the respondent relies so indicated. 4              QUESTION:  That gets you to the situation where 5    the petition is filed in a court that didn't even have the 6    authority to grant any sort of relief. 7              MR. CASTELLANO:  Absolutely, Your Honor. 8              QUESTION:  But you want to go further than that. 9              MR. CASTELLANO:  Yes, Your Honor.  We say that10    here this Court did not have the authority to grant the11    relief requested because there was an absolute mandatory12    State procedural bar in the way.13              QUESTION:  And is that the third part of your14    test, or the second part of your --15              MR. CASTELLANO:  That's the second part of the16    test.  The third part of the test is that a -- is a plain17    common sense understanding of the words, right place, or18    right court, under which a document can't be filed in the19    right court if it's filed in a court that can't entertain20    the merits of it.  That's really the third --21              QUESTION:  Well, but does it follow that the22    court can't entertain the merits?  I mean, a procedural23    bar is something that can be waived and, as24    counterintuitive as it may be, I mean, we occasionally do25    get cases before this Court in which there seems to have6 1    been a procedural bar that the State didn't invoke, so it 2    seems to me that we're not in the position of even being 3    able to analyze this on a merely -- or I shouldn't say 4    merely, on a jurisdictional basis, because it really 5    doesn't go to the State court's jurisdiction.  It goes to 6    the discretionary decision by the State prosecutor to 7    invoke the bar, and so I don't think we can do it on the 8    third prong that you mentioned, which I understood was in 9    a sense in effect a jurisdictional prong.10              MR. CASTELLANO:  No, Your Honor, the third prong11    is not a jurisdictional prong.  It's simply a prong that12    says that if the State court can't, under the State's13    procedural rules, adjudicate the merits, then that motion14    is not properly filed in that State court.15              QUESTION:  You mean, if it can't adjudicate the16    merits it's not properly filed.17              MR. CASTELLANO:  It's not properly filed if it18    can't adjudicate the merits.19              QUESTION:  No, but it can adjudicate the merits.20    It can adjudicate the merits if the State doesn't invoke21 the bar.22              MR. CASTELLANO:  Not in this case.  First of23    all, Your Honor, these are absolute mandatory bars, and24    there's no indication that if the State waives these bars,25    that the Court has the authority to examine these71 issues -- 2              QUESTION:  But doesn't this --  doesn't your 3    answer, and I realize I'm shifting my position here, but 4    doesn't your answer point out another difficulty of your 5    position, and that is, a Federal court is, it seems to me, 6    hard-pressed in these cases if it's got to decide whether 7    a particular bar is jurisdictional or whether it's not 8    jurisdictional under State law, and this is just adding 9    one more complication, as against the position of the10    other side, which takes a kind of a plain language, almost11    physical act interpretation.12              You're putting yet another burden on the State13    court to decide whether a bar is jurisdictional or not,14    and it seems to me that that counts against adopting your15    interpretation.16              MR. CASTELLANO:  No, Your Honor, I don't believe17    we are imposing an additional bar.  I wouldn't use the18    sense jurisdictional.  I would use mandatory State19    procedural bar which, under the procedural default20    doctrine, is a concept that the Federal courts are very21    familiar with.22              This Court in Teague v. Lane, for example, did23    the type of analysis that we're advancing here.  In other24    words, it decided whether or not to send a State prisoner25    back to State court in order to pursue a State remedy, or,8 1    on the other hand, whether that State remedy is no longer 2    available -- 3              QUESTION:  Well, there's no question that the 4    Federal courts in a sense can do this.  Sometimes the 5    Federal courts have to do it, but it seems to me that it 6    does count against your position that a Federal court will 7    have to go through this every time a State court issues a 8    laconic one-word order, denied. 9              QUESTION:  And that essentially usurps the10    function, or at least duplicates the function of the State11    court and is, it seems to me, contrary to the Federal12    interests that underlie this statute.13              MR. CASTELLANO:  I don't believe it duplicates14    the function of the State courts at all.  I believe that15    simply it shows respect to the State court procedural16    rules and respect to the individual State court decisions17    that have been --18              QUESTION:  Could I --19              QUESTION:  Well, presumably the State court made20    that determination when it made the underlying order, and21    it seems to me that this is really contrary to the22    federalism concerns that in large part were the basis of23    the statute.  You're asking the Federal courts to make a24    determination which brushes up against the merits, just in25    order to determine the tolling provision.9 1              MR. CASTELLANO:  Actually, Your Honor, what the 2    Court could do is to adopt the Harris v. Reid plain 3    statement rule, and the Coleman exception to the Harris v. 4    Reid plain statement rule and in this -- so that 5    ordinarily there would be a plain statement on behalf of 6    the State court applying the particular State procedural 7    bar in that individual case. 8              QUESTION:  Let's back up just a minute, Mr. -- I 9    suppose you'd be on stronger ground if you're talking not10    about a procedural bar to the merits in the sense of plain11    statement, that sort of thing.  Supposing you just have a12    failure to file within the time limit provided by the13 State.141516171819202122232425          MR. CASTELLANO:  Yes, Your Honor, that's --          QUESTION:  I take it you believe that in orderto be properly filed the thing must be timely.          MR. CASTELLANO:  Yes, absolutely, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Even though perhaps in a pleadingsense, in the New York courts, a statute of limitations,if it isn't pleaded by the defendant, might be waived.          MR. CASTELLANO:  Right, Your Honor.  In New Yorkthere is no statute of limitations for post convictionreview, but certainly in many States, such as Florida,which is represented here, there's a statute oflimitations that does have exceptions to it, and as to10 1    which there should be some judicial review with regard to 2    the application of that particular -- 3              QUESTION:  So then the Federal court would have 4    to determine not only if there is a procedural bar, but 5    what exceptions exist, and whether this particular case 6    fits within that exception, like statute of limitations 7    often have tolling accoutrements, so you're getting the 8    Federal court involved in a lot of up-front decisonmaking 9    that substitutes for the State, and my question is I think10    the same as Justice Kennedy's.  That is, you're asking the11    Federal court, as it does in the Erie area, to make a12    determination of what State law is.13              Isn't it more respectful of the States to say,14    State -- State court, this is for you to decide.  We don't15    know how to apply your procedural bar rule.  We'd rather16    have you tell us, does this fall within an exception?17              It seems to me that ordering the Federal court18    to decide the State law question is not as respectful of19    the States as it would be to say, that's a question that20    the State courts should decide.21              MR. CASTELLANO:  Well, Your Honor, in the22    ordinary case the State court will have already decided23    that very particular issue and applied that procedural bar24    to the very case that's now in front of the --25              QUESTION:  But here we don't know, because the11 1    State order is opaque.  It doesn't tell us. 2              MR. CASTELLANO:  I think the application here is 3    a little bit different.  If you apply, for example, the 4    Harris v. Reid plain statement rule, and the Coleman 5    exception to it, we fall within that, so for example, 6    under Coleman this Court held that there was no need to -- 7    there was no need to have a plain statement, because from 8    all the facts and circumstances it didn't fairly appear 9    that the State court decision was based primarily on10    Federal law or interwoven with Federal law.  That's11    exactly the situation that we have here as well.12              QUESTION:  The Federal court is always going to13    have to decide, when this question comes up, whether or14    not the State petition was, quote, properly filed.  I15    mean, that was Congress' choice.  I mean, it isn't16    necessarily any court's choice.17              MR. CASTELLANO:  Yes, absolutely, Your Honor,18    and it's the exact same interpretation.19              QUESTION:  And the question is what properly20    filed meant, and one thing to say, we look to State law to21    see if this is an application for whatever, and we look to22    see that it is, in fact, filed in the court, the stamp and23    everything, there it is in the properly filed, in the24    right court.  It seems to me that those mechanical things25    are easy for a Federal court to check, but going beyond12 1    that, this is a rather complex operation. 2              MR. CASTELLANO:  The problem with reducing the 3    word properly to such a limited view, to a view that just 4    says, rudimentary filing requirements, is in part this. 5    That means that a document that satisfies service and 6    notice requirements only, but is filed in, for example, a 7    surrogate's court, or a court that's -- can't possibly 8    decide the claim, might be included. 9              QUESTION:  So what?10              QUESTION:  Well, but if -- I suppose that a11    State could have its own State rule for second or12    successive petitions in State court for post conviction13    relief, such as a requirement that the applicant get a14    certificate from some reviewing court as a prerequisite to15    filing the successive petition, and if there were that16    kind of mechanical requirement, just like the requirement17    for a filing fee, or filing in a certain court or within a18    certain time, all those things are in the nature of kind19    of mechanical rules, so the State can certainly protect20    itself, it seems to me.21              MR. CASTELLANO:  Yes, Your Honor, the State can22    protect itself.  The problem with that is this.  There are23    only very few States that enacted their post conviction24    review schemes in terms of prefiling review, and it would25 mean --131              QUESTION:  Yes, but it's open to a State to do2    it.3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. CASTELLANO:  It's open to a State to --          QUESTION:  I mean, there's no reason why we haveto construct something to save the State that the Statecan take care of on its own.          MR. CASTELLANO:  But it would be to assume thatCongress meant that it's statute would not have any realor meaningful effect in all of those States in which therewas no prefiling review, and that it would be --          QUESTION:  Well, it does have a meaningfuleffect in the sense of looking to any State requirementsfor timing, place, et cetera.          MR. CASTELLANO:  Except that that view, therespondent's view and the Second Circuit's view heredoesn't look to all of the procedural rules.  It looks toa very small subset.          QUESTION:  Well, maybe we should expand itslightly, but not to include a procedural bar andsubstantive law component.          QUESTION:  We don't have to take either all oneor all the other.          MR. CASTELLANO:  Absolutely, Your Honor, yes.          QUESTION:  If we go beyond the mechanical,mechanical things are easy to check, but once you get14 1    beyond the mechanical, you both have the Federal courts 2    interpreting State law later, and it seems to me something 3    worse.  Any reasonable defendant who has a lawyer, 4    certainly, who has any kind of complicated State issue, 5    will know that he better file a protective habeas petition 6    in Federal court. 7              Now, what's the Federal judge supposed to do 8    when he gets that habeas petition -- 9              MR. CASTELLANO:  That --10              QUESTION:  -- prior to the State court deciding11    the issue, and that's going to happen all over the place.12    He now has to decide questions of State law which the13    State court might later say he's wrong about or risk14    dismissing it, or avoid the exhaustion problem.  It sounds15    like a real mess as soon as you depart from the16    mechanical.17              MR. CASTELLANO:  No, not at all, Your Honor,18    because that's the same position that that Federal court19    is in if it's deciding whether to send that petitioner20    back to State court to exhaust his State remedies.  We21    say, make that exact same determination.22              In other words, when it comes to Federal court,23    you make that Rose v. Lundy determination.  Are you going24    to send that petitioner back to State court, or are you25    going to presume that there's a State court procedural bar151    that's in the way, that renders that remedy no longer2    available.3 4 5 6 7 8 9          Make that determination, and that's adetermination that's made regularly by the Second Circuitwith regard to the very same procedural rules that are atissue in this case, and made regularly with regard --with -- by the Federal circuit courts in New York withregard to the very same procedural rules that are at issuein this case.          QUESTION:  But I'm --          QUESTION:  What difference does it -- go ahead.          QUESTION:  Well, I'm puzzled.  There'slitigation in the State court over whether or not aprocedural bar exists.  While that litigation goes on,what is a Federal judge supposed to do, decide the issue?          MR. CASTELLANO:  Your Honor --          QUESTION:  Or say the remedy hasn't been          MR. CASTELLANO:  There's more than onealternative.  One of the reasonable alternatives wouldjust be to dismiss the case under Rose v. Lundy to allowthe exhaustion to take place.          QUESTION:  Right, and then it takes more than ayear to resolve the procedural bar issue in the Statecourt, and eventually you end up saying you're16101112131415161718    exhausted?192021222324251 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425procedurally barred.  Why do you need the statute oflimitation, then?  Why don't you just rely on theprocedural bar?          MR. CASTELLANO:  The statute of limitations is atiming device, separate from the procedural bar.  In otherwords --          QUESTION:  Yes, but whether the statute has runor not depends on whether or not the case was procedurallybarred, and if it was procedurally barred, why do you needthe statute of limitations?          MR. CASTELLANO:  The procedural bar goes toindividual claims.  The statute of limitations goes tothe --          QUESTION:  Right, but you find in the State allthe claims were procedurally barred, otherwise the statutewould not have run, and if they find that, why do you needthe statute of limitations?          MR. CASTELLANO:  You need -- well, you need thestatute of limitations for other types of cases.          QUESTION:  That are not procedurally barred.          MR. CASTELLANO:  No --          QUESTION:  Under your rule, what would happen ifthere were some petition -- some claims that wereprocedurally barred and some that were not?          MR. CASTELLANO:  Under our position, that                            17 1    petitioner would receive exhaustion, and to go back to 2    Justice Stevens' example, the court should dismiss that, 3    or could, at least, dismiss that claim under Rose v. Lundy 4    and during that period of time, that period of time in 5    which the State -- in which the State prisoner was 6    exhausting State remedies, he should receive tolling if 7    this was a proper dismissal under Rose v. Lundy.  That 8    should be an automatic result of the dismissal under Rose 9    v. Lundy, is to allow the tolling for the petitioner.10              QUESTION:  Yes, but then I'm asking you, at the11    end of this 14-month litigation in the State procedure the12    State court ends up saying, all the claims are13    procedurally barred.  Why do you need a statute of14    limitations if that's the holding of the State court?15              MR. CASTELLANO:  You need the statute of16    limitations because that petitioner, first of all17    shouldn't be -- that petitioner, if he knows beforehand18    that those claims are procedurally barred, of course,19    shouldn't be --20              QUESTION:  Well, I'm assuming he doesn't know21    until the 14 months of litigation in the State court have22    resolved the issue, and there are lots of times23              MR. CASTELLANO:  Right.24              QUESTION:  -- it's a contested matter.25              MR. CASTELLANO:  Well, you need the statute of18 1    limitations for one thing to keep that -- to encourage, 2    not just that petitioner, but other petitioners who don't 3    have to go through that process of 14 months of litigation 4    into Federal court more quickly. 5              QUESTION:  But they all have to go through that 6    process if the State's going to plead a procedural bar. 7              MR. CASTELLANO:  I'm sorry, Justice -- 8              QUESTION:  I really think there's tension 9    between the exhaustion rule and your interpretation of10    properly filed.11              MR. CASTELLANO:  Not at all, Your Honor.12    That -- this interpretation follows the exhaustion rule to13    a tee.  It says that if you would send this case back to14    State court for exhaustion purposes, then this petitioner15    receives tolling.  If you wouldn't receive -- if you16    wouldn't send it back for exhaustion purposes, then you17    don't receive tolling.1819    rebuttal.202122232425I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time forQUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Castellano.Mr. Schweitzer, we'll hear from you.    ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN SCHWEITZERON BEHALF OF FLORIDA, AS AMICUS CURIAE,       SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERMR. SCHWEITZER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it                  19 1    please the Court: 2              The language, structure, and objectives of 3    section 2244(d) tell us that Congress intended the tolling 4    provision to harmonize the limitations period and the 5    exhaustion doctrine.  Respondent's construction of the 6    term, properly filed application, undermines the 7    limitation period and reads the word properly out of the8 statute. 9              I'd like to turn to some of the federalism10    questions that were raised in terms of how the State's11    construction of the term furthers the State's federalism12    interests.  It does so when we recognize the fact that the13    limitations period itself was enacted by Congress to14    further the State's comity concerns by speeding up the15    date at which the Federal habeas process will take place.16              Congress was motivated by the fact that it often17    took many, many years for the Federal courts to possibly18    order a new trial, or generally to provide finality to the19    State conviction.  It may be that as a consequence of the20    State rule there will be a protective Federal filing such21    as that which Justice Breyer and Justice Stevens22    mentioned.23 24 25          Notwithstanding the fact that this may takeplace at the same time that the State proceeding isoccurring, it still furthers the State's comity interest,20 1    because often the State -- the Federal court will be able 2    to recognize that the application is plainly procedurally 3    barred, at which point the Federal court can proceed to 4    rule on the habeas application and would be doing so many 5    years sooner than it otherwise would have been, which is 6    precisely the goal that Congress had in enacting the 7    limitation -- 8              QUESTION:  What about the case where it just 9    isn't clear?  I mean, the easy cases can sort themselves10    out under either interpretation, I think, but what about11    the cases which are tougher?12              MR. SCHWEITZER:  Where it's not clear, and so13    the prisoner isn't certain --14              QUESTION:  It's a difficult -- you know --15              MR. SCHWEITZER:  Right.16              QUESTION:  -- frivolous cases aren't really that17    tough.  I mean, we deal with them.  But the cases that18    might -- may have some merit, and you're not sure, and the19    State law's uncertain, those are the ones that take the20    time.212223242521          MR. SCHWEITZER:  Though I should make clear, alarge percentage of these cases will be the frivolousones, the second, third, fifth applications, but --          QUESTION:  It's no problem, if the Federal courtsees somebody abusing the State system this is an1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425equitable statute, tolling, and they can deal with it.But I'm worried about the complicated, close cases.  Whathappens there?          MR. SCHWEITZER:  Right.  In that case where theprotective Federal habeas filing is made, and the Federalcourt looks at the case and says, it's a close callwhether or not the State procedure is available, so itmight be possible for the State remedies to be exhausted.          At that point the Federal court would dismissthe Federal application under Rose v. Lundy.          QUESTION:  It goes back, and now the State courtsays, oh, well, I guess, in fact, there's a independentState ground, or the statute of limitations wasn't tolledunder State law, et cetera.  Now what happens?          MR. SCHWEITZER:  Right.  If, upon return to theState court, the State court says, in fact, this isprocedurally barred, in that case we believe would be anappropriate instance for equitable tolling to toll thattime back --          QUESTION:  How could you, under yourinterpretation?  It's more than a year.          MR. SCHWEITZER:  Right, but the time back inState court would equitably toll the Federal 1-yearlimitations provision.          QUESTION:  Even though it turns out that, in                            22 1    fact, it's not -- even though it was in the wrong court, 2    it should have gone to the surrogate court, or something? 3              MR. SCHWEITZER:  Well, if the Federal court, 4    upon looking at the habeas petition says, this might, in 5    fact, be a proper case to be back in the State courts, 6    there may be those State remedies available.  If the 7    prisoner properly invokes those very State remedies that 8    the Federal court had in mind -- 9              QUESTION:  It was wrong.  It was wrong under10 State --11              MR. SCHWEITZER:  Well, the Federal --12              QUESTION:  The Federal court was wrong.  It was13    a close question.14              MR. SCHWEITZER:  But in essence, since the State15    prisoner shouldn't be penalized for the Federal court16    being wrong, we think that would be an appropriate time17    for the limitations period to be tolled.  It's presumptive18    that Federal statutes have equitable tolling available,19    and we don't challenge that here.20              QUESTION:  Mr. Schweitzer, the problem I have21    with your position is, I don't know how you can get out of22    the word properly the kind of line that you want to draw.23    I can see how you can say, properly filed means, you know,24    the technical things, the proper court, the name's right,25    that I can understand, but you want to say it includes23 1    procedural bars, that the claim is invalid on the merits 2    because of a -- it's invalid because of a procedural bar. 3              If that is embraced within the word, properly 4    filed, why wouldn't the fact that the claim is 5    unmeritorious for a substantive reason be included as 6    well?  It's not properly filed if it's a -- you know, it's 7    a ridiculous, nonmeritorious complaint.  How do you get 8    the word properly to cover only procedural bars and not 9    substantive bars?10              MR. SCHWEITZER:  Well, the first answer to that11    question is that we think it makes sense to believe that12    Congress took the word -- inserted the word properly here13    and created the phrase, properly filed application,14    borrowing from its past use of the word properly with15    respect to the terms, proper exhaustion, and proper16    presentation, both of which deal with the presentation of17    claims to State courts which, if it's properly done,18    provides the State courts with the opportunity to rule on19    the merits, regardless of how the court ultimately rules20    on that merits decision.21              In terms of the question respondents focus on,22    which is, how does properly modify file, it's just that it23    means more than mere filing requirements.  Respondents24    treat the word properly as merely modifying how a document25    is filed, almost the physical manner by which it's filed,24 1    but properly can also be read to modify the question of 2    whether the document should have been filed in the first3 place. 4              If the lawyer drafts a complaint that clearly 5    violates Rule 11, but then files that complaint anyway, 6    that's an improper act on the part of the attorney, and it 7    would be an improperly filed complaint. 8              QUESTION:  So also if it makes a frivolous 9    merits claim.  You could say that's not properly filed.10    There's no substance to it.11              MR. SCHWEITZER:  Well, in the habeas corpus12    context, where there's such a focus on compliance with the13    various procedural bars, and where the procedural default14    context expressly exists to accommodate the situations15    where State procedural rules aren't complied with, but16    prisoners aren't considered to have done anything wrong if17    they have exhausted their State remedies but lost on the18    merits, we think that same -- Congress had that same mind19    set here, where the prisoner isn't treated as having done20    anything wrong, having done anything improper or incorrect21    by bringing losing claims, but the prisoner has done22    something wrong by bringing claims that are barred by23    mandatory State court rules, and then attempting to delay24    the limitations period, possibly indefinitely, by filing25    repetitive, improper claims in the State court.25 1              QUESTION:  Mr. Schweitzer, does Florida have 2    either a statute of limitations or any rules taking care 3    of the repetitive and successive filing problem as a 4    matter of State law? 5              MR. SCHWEITZER:  Well, Florida has a 2-year 6    limitations on noncapital cases and a 1-year limitation on 7    capital cases, both of which have exceptions for new facts 8    or new law, and mere existence of that exception means 9    that under respondent's theory you can violate the time10    bar, and that's -- and it would still be a properly filed11    application.12              QUESTION:  Mr. Schweitzer, you have conceded, I13    think, in agreement with Mr. Castellano, that Congress14    could have been, as he put it in his brief, more specific15    in defining the scope of the tolling provision.16              MR. SCHWEITZER:  Yes.17              QUESTION:  And you say that -- well, Mr.18    Castellano says the reason probably that Congress was not19    more specific, that 1) it's Members couldn't agree on a20    definition, or because the types of State procedures that21    could be invoked were so varied, Congress thought it best22    to leave the application of the provision for the courts,23    but that seems -- why shouldn't the court say, well,24    Congress, we'll just go as far as you did.  You were25    ambiguous about this.  You left room for one26 1    interpretation or the other.  We're going to pick the one 2    that favors the petitioner. 3              MR. SCHWEITZER:  I wouldn't want to speculate as 4    to why Congress didn't do a better job of defining the 5    exact contours of the tolling provision, but I don't think 6    that an ambiguity in the statute requires an answer one 7    way or the other.  I think for better or for worse we're 8    left with the task of trying to determine what makes sense 9    in light of the limitations period generally.10              QUESTION:  Well, it's not one or the other,11    because everyone would agree that at least it's got to be12    an application for habeas corpus, and has got to be filed13    in the court, so it's not -- it's -- that's -- no question14    about it.  The question is whether there is something more15    than that, and I'm asking why the Federal court should16    read something into the statute that Congress didn't17    clearly put there.18              MR. SCHWEITZER:  Because the problem, without19    reading more into it, is that it would essentially allow20    subsection 2 of 2244(d), the tolling provision, undermine21    subsection 1, the limitations period, and it's an unusual22    provision of law which defeats itself.23              As Mr. Castellano mentioned, if subsection 2,24    the tolling provision, is read as respondent suggests,25    then repetitive filings can be made by the prisoners who,27at will, can extend the limitations period indefinitely,and there's certainly no --          QUESTION:  Not if the States, as JusticeO'Connor suggested, enacts one of these -- you have to getpermission before you can file such an application.          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Schweitzer.          Mr. Futerfas.  Am I pronouncing your name          MR. FUTERFAS:  Yes, you are, Mr. Chief Justice.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN S. FUTERFAS                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MR. FUTERFAS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          The State of New York has stood before you forthe last half-an-hour, as well as Attorney General fromFlorida, and argued for a rule which, if adopted, willensure that thousands of prisoners will file their Federalhabeas petitions before exhausting their State postconviction remedies.          If adopted, it will be malpractice for a lawyer,we respectfully submit, not to file in Federal courtfirst, or as soon as possible, because the defendant andthe lawyer will never know under the State's rule whetheror not they are properly filed until it is determinedwhether or not their claims are procedurally barred.2812345678    correctly? 910111213141516171819202122232425          We respectfully suggest that that rule isinconsistent with 2244(d)(2), other provisions of theAEDPA, and this Court's decisions which encourage1234    exhaustion.5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  What do you think the term properlyfiled means, Mr. Futerfas?          MR. FUTERFAS:  As we state in the brief in theSecond Circuit, and in fact the majority of the circuits,I tend to disagree with petitioner.  There are a number ofcircuits who have construed this in --          QUESTION:  I mean your position.          MR. FUTERFAS:  Our position is, a properly filedapplication is an application which is delivered to thecustodian designated to receive it in accordance with therules governing its acceptance for filing.          QUESTION:  Well, supposing, to use Mr.Castellano's example, there's a habeas corpus petitionthat is delivered to the clerk of a surrogate's courtwhich has only probate jurisdiction?          MR. FUTERFAS:  It's not properly filed.Properly filed -- the word properly, we respectfullysubmit, has meaning, has real meaning.  Prisoners who wantto exhaust their State remedies, Congress has created asimple mechanism for them to do so, but they must followit accurately.  They must file the right document with the291 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9right custodian in the right time.  It's a burdenplaced --          QUESTION:  And also, a timely filing?          MR. FUTERFAS:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  And in the correct court that wouldhave the authority to grant relief?          MR. FUTERFAS:  Yes.  When we look at what --          QUESTION:  How about a State requirement for a          MR. FUTERFAS:  They have to require -- ourposition is -- our position, we respectfully submit,respects State court systems.  If a State court sets up aprocedure for its judicial screening, prisoners are onnotice through the word properly that they have to filesuccessive position, petition that there be some --something akin to a certificate of appealability?10111213141516    that.17              They have to get it to the right recipient,18    whether it's a judge or a clerk, and they have to put it19    in the right document, on the right time, and we think20    it's a simple mechanism, but it's one that -- you know,21    Congress has kind of allocated burdens and risks here.22    They want State petitioners to be able to exhaust and not23    have to worry about making a protective filing.  They24    don't have to worry about going to Federal court, but they25    have to do it right.30 1              QUESTION:  Your quarrel then, really, with the 2    petitioner is on the procedural bar type of thing, where 3    it's uncertain whether this can be raised. 4              MR. FUTERFAS:  That's exactly the problem. 5    If -- and I call it, for lack of a better word, the 6    uncertainty principle. 7              If a petitioner, or the lawyer knows with 8    certainty that tolling will be affected, the lawyer will 9    not have to file a protective filing, but if there's10    uncertainty as to whether tolling will be affected, that11    uncertainty creates, there's no question, as I stated in12    my opening statement, that it be almost malpractice not to13    file a protective filing, and what's wrong with protective14 filings?15              I think the petitioner takes a somewhat relaxed16    view of how Federal district court judges are going to17    view protective filings.  I don't think Federal district18    court judges are going to be happy with them at all.19    What really will happen if there's uncertainty of tolling20    is that all State -- word gets around quickly in the21    jails.  We all know that.  This Court knows that.22              These State prisoners will begin filing first in23    Federal court, and what they will be seeking and obtaining24    is essentially a declaratory judgment by the Federal judge25    on State substantive and procedural law, so they'll have a31 1    Federal judge in the first instance say, okay, these three 2    claims are exhausted, these four claims are not exhausted, 3    so now you can go back. 4              And now, of course, the certainty of tolling, 5    which Congress set up to be in the mechanism of the 6    properly filed application, now that certainty of tolling 7    is resulted by pronouncement of a Federal district court 8    judge and, of course, this increases a Federal judge's 9    workload immeasurably, because many of these claims, or10    some percentage of these claims where a State prisoner is11    exhausting will be resolved.  Maybe the State prisoner12    will get relief on the merits in State court, and they'll13    never have to bother a Federal district court judge.  But14    if there's uncertainty of tolling, the Federal judge will15    deal with all these cases before they're allowed to run16    through the State court system.17              And the other thing to, I think respectfully to18    focus on is, as this Court stated unanimously in Michael19    Williams v. Taylor, quote, we start as always with the20    language of the statute.  This statute says, properly21    filed application.  Properly is an adverb, modifying the22    verb filed.  The subject of that phrase is an application.23              The State and amici have suggested that although24    Congress chose the words, properly filed application, it25    really meant to say something else, a properly presented32 1    claim, an application presenting claims the defendant has 2    a right to raise, but in fact, Congress had all of that 3    phraseology and language at its disposal, and it's used 4    that very language in other parts of the statute. 5              For instance, where Congress sought to define 6    exhaustion, they did so.  2254(c), as this Court's 7    recognized in the Wainwright and Duckworth and O'Sullivan 8    decisions, that statute defines exhaustion, so if 9    Congress -- if Congress wanted to write a statute that10    conditioned tolling on actual exhaustion, they could have11    simply said that tolling will occur with a properly filed12    application presenting questions the applicant has the13    right to raise by any available procedure.  That language14    was right there for Congress to use just a few pages15    later, after 2244.  Congress did not use that language.16              Where Congress sought to limit successive17    applications and predicate tolling on one application18    only, they did so not in one but in two places,19    2244(b)(3), which requires judicial approval, and 2263 in20    the opting provision, where you have tolling for a first21    post conviction application, so Congress had that language22    available it could have used.23              In the very statute at issue, 2244, Congress24    specifically sought to address a claim presented in an25    application.  Those series of words occur a number of33 1    times, at 2244(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(4). 2              So all of this language that the petitioner 3    suggests really, Congress really meant to say, was used, 4    and under this Court's decisions we start with the 5    language of the statute and I think in this case we also 6    end with the language of the statute. 7              QUESTION:  May I ask a question about the 8    operation of the State procedural bar in this scenario? 9    Let's assume that as your opponent suggests, that there10    is, in fact, a State procedural bar in this case, and11    let's assume that you're right that that doesn't factor12    into this 1-year statute of limitations determination by13    the Federal court.  Then what impact, if any, would the14    State procedural bar have on the Federal habeas corpus15    proceeding?16              MR. FUTERFAS:  I'm not sure if I understand Your17    Honor's question.18              QUESTION:  In other words, there is a State --19    the State will not hear this case because its court will20    determine there's a procedural bar.  Let's say that21    Mr. Castellano is right about that, what a State court22    would do in this very case, but that you are right that23    that kind of complex determination should not be made by24    the Federal court, so the Federal court just checks to see25    that it is an application, and that it has indeed been34 1    filed in the right court. 2              What impact, if any, does the State rule that 3    this claim is procedurally barred in State court have in 4    the Federal habeas corpus proceeding? 5              MR. FUTERFAS:  Well, in terms of tolling, I 6    don't think it would have any effect.  Rules governing the 7    granting of an application, which is I think what Your 8    Honor's question concerns, rules governing whether an 9    application shall be granted, whether relief shall be10    granted, are different than State rules governing the11    filing of the application, so in one instance whether a12    defendant's claims are procedurally barred or not should13    not have any effect on whether they toll the statute.  We14    suggest that properly filed application was meant to15    promote federalism, promote defendants --16              QUESTION:  Yeah --17              MR. FUTERFAS:  -- and encourage them to exhaust.18              QUESTION:  -- I'm accepting both their position19    that this is, in fact, procedurally barred in the State,20    your position that that doesn't -- you don't get into that21    on the statute of limitations question.  I'm asking you22    then, when there's no time bar in the Federal court, what23    effect, if any, does the State rule that this claim would24    be procedurally barred in State court, have on the Federal25    habeas proceeding?35 1              MR. FUTERFAS:  Well, if I understand Your 2    Honor's question, certainly the time -- if the application 3    is filed and it contains barred claims -- that's -- under 4    the hypothetical it contains barred claims, the time is 5    tolling.  I think the best way I can answer Your Honor's 6    question is to suggest that if we don't -- if it's not 7    tolling, and the defendant's petition in State court 8    contains barred claims, and there's not tolling 9    occurring --10              QUESTION:  Right.11              MR. FUTERFAS:  -- then this Court's decisions,12    for example in the Coleman case, where this Court has a13    whole body of law governing cause in prejudice or14    miscarriage of justice, that will essentially almost be15    rendered a nullity, because yes, a defendant can have --16    can be procedurally barred, and procedurally defaulted,17    and have waived everything, and not really present a good18    procedural picture when it gets to the Federal court.19              But at least under Coleman, and the other20    decisions of this Court, at least when the defendant gets21    there, if the defendant can prove cause in prejudice, if22    the defendant can show a miscarriage of justice, then a23    Federal habeas court can overlook those procedural24    defaults and still reach the merits.25              However, if, under the State -- if the State's36 1    rule is adopted, the State determines that there's 2    procedural bar, it makes that determination a year 3    after -- you know, after 1 year has passed, now the whole 4    jurisprudence allowing delving into the merits on cause in 5    prejudice will not happen, because now the State prisoner 6    can't even get before a Federal court because the 7    statute's been tolled. 8              QUESTION:  The significance of the procedural -- 9    of the bar decision in State court is that you have to10    show cause in prejudice when you come into Federal court11    before those claims could be reached, don't you?12              MR. FUTERFAS:  Well, you -- in -- I'm not -- I13    apologize, I'm not sure I understand Your Honor's question14 --1516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Well, perhaps my question -- I thinkJustice Ginsburg asked, you know, then what is the Statecourt determination that a claim is procedurally barredreduced to if it doesn't have any effect of tolling.Well, it still has an effect on the Federal court'sability to review the merits of the claim, doesn't it?          MR. FUTERFAS:  Yes.          QUESTION:  Because unless the person can showcause in prejudice the Federal court can't reach it.          MR. FUTERFAS:  No, that's right.          QUESTION:  Yes --37 1              MR. FUTERFAS:  We understand that, but that 2    assumes, obviously, that the defendant can file, and that 3    the tolling is occurring, so the defendant can at least 4    get into the door in Federal court and try at least to 5    avail himself or herself of the Coleman doctrine. 6              There were -- there was a question of 7    petitioner, I believe by Justice Souter concerning whether 8    or not the statute would be mooted.  I think that was the 9    essence of the question, and we suggest that it would be.10    If -- I think we can safely assume that adoption of the11    State's rule would encourage protective filings.12              The result will be, we respectfully submit, as13    if Congress said there's a 1-year limitations period which14    is tolled where a Federal court finds a mixed petition,15    because that essentially will be the result, the practical16    result of adoption of the State's rule.17              The -- there were concerns certainly raised in18    petitioner's brief about vexatiousness, about a defendant19    who's going to file and file and try to basically abuse20    the State court system.  First, we don't have that in this21 case.22              Mr. Bennett filed only two post conviction23    applications.  A second 440 is the one that's here before24    this Court, and there's no question he wasn't trying to25    delay.  Right in that second application he cited 2254, he38 1    wrote in the application that I'm doing this to exhaust. 2    When he didn't get a decision quickly, within a couple of 3    months, he actually wrote to the courts.  He wrote to the 4    court and he said, when am I getting a decision, and he 5    continued writing, and -- 6              QUESTION:  Did the State court here ever issue a 7    written order? 8              MR. FUTERFAS:  No, it did not, so in terms of 9    delay, Mr. Bennett --10              QUESTION:  To this date we have no written order11    from the State court?12              MR. FUTERFAS:  That's correct, so the delay here13    has been a 4-year delay, but the 4 years is in truth14    attributable to the State.  Once Mr. Bennett found out15    that there was actually a decision, something he didn't16    learn until a year after the decision took place, he17    immediately, 3 days later he wrote to the court and he18    said, please get me written order so that I can at least19    seek leave to appeal.20              And again, this is inconsistent -- consistent21    with this Court's rule in O'Sullivan, which says, if you22    want to exhaust you have to try, at least seek leave to23    appeal on these claims that you're trying to exhaust, and24    he did so.  He wrote to the court.  He wrote again and25    again.  All of 1997 was utilized by him writing four or39 1    five letters to the court saying, when am I getting a 2    decision. 3              It was only until February of '98, after '97 had 4    gone, that he finally went in on 2254 and in his habeas 5    petition itself -- he wrote to Judge Gershon.  In the form 6    it says, well, why haven't you appealed, and he said 7    because the State hasn't given me the order, so this case 8    certainly is not a question of delay. 9              This is a defendant who clearly did try to10    exhaust, and there's no question here that he complied11    with New York's filing requirements, filed his motion.12    The State responded, he filed the reply, and the court13    eventually ruled.  There's no question that there wasn't a14    properly filed document here within the meaning of New15    York State's filing rules.16              With respect, however, to the vexatiousness17    concerns that the petitioners have addressed in their18    brief, we think there are a number of answers to that.19    One answer is that properly filed application only permits20    tolling.  It does not force the States to permit21    repetitive filings.  I don't think we should be22    paternalistic, and I don't think we should suggest to23    States -- there may be some States who say, you know, we24    have no problem with successive applications.  We don't25    need to amend our laws because we have no problem with401 them. 2              There may be other States, and Florida might be 3    one, that says, we have a significant problem.  We're 4    going to amend our laws.  We're going to put strict 5    statute of limitations in our laws, we're going to limit 6    the numbers of successive filings so -- 7              QUESTION:  Of course, counsel, the States draw a 8    distinction between noncapital cases and capital cases. 9    It's always in the petitioner's interest to get prompt10    disposition when he's not -- in a nondeath case.  In a11    death case, the stakes are reversed, and there is a motive12    -- a potential for repetitive filing just to delay the13    execution, so maybe you should address the capital cases,14 too.15              MR. FUTERFAS:  Very well.  We think there is a16    difference, and we think we have a number of answers to17    that.  The first answer is that Congress was very18    concerned with delays in capital cases.  That wasn't a new19    concern.  In 1989, the Chief Justice appointed the Powell20    Commission.  The Powell Commission assembled, wrote a21    report called the Powell Commission report.  Those22    findings were embodied in very large part in Chapter 154,23    so delays in capital cases is something that Congress has24    been concerned about.25              They -- a commission was -- dealt with it, and41 1    they recommendations of that commission were largely 2    incorporated in Chapter 154, so with respect to death 3    penalty cases, one thing is for sure, Congress said yes, 4    we're concerned about it and we have an answer, and our 5    answer is the opt-in provision, so if States comply with 6    the opt-in provision, they get the one collateral review, 7    and they have 180 days to go to Federal court, with some 8    exceptions, so that's clearly -- Congress has dealt with 9    that, number 1.10              Number 2, States can always set an execution11    date, and in that regard --12              QUESTION:  How many States have opted in?13              MR. FUTERFAS:  At this point I'm not aware of14    any that have adopted -- opted in at this point, but that15    was Congress' -- that was Congress' considered judgment on16    the issue and I respectfully submit that this statute, a17    tolling statute, should not be judicially amended in order18    to somehow satisfy States that for whatever reason have19    not adopted in -- opted into the -- to Chapter 154.20              In addition, this Court's decision in Gomez is21    very important, because it sets an incentive for22    defendants.  What happened in Gomez, this Court may recall23    is, the defendant did abuse the State court system and24    started bringing last minute claims, new claims on the eve25    of the execution, and finally came before this Court and42 1    said, well, please grant me a stay, and this Court in 2    Gomez said no.  You've abused the State court process, 3    you've let too much time gone by, you haven't properly 4    presented your claims, we're not going to give you a stay. 5              So the Gomez decision provides an enormous 6    incentive on a capital defendant to use the State court 7    process wisely and not abuse it. 8              Rule 9(a) -- Rule 9(a) of 2254 talks about 9    laches.  There again, where a defendant abuses a State10    court system, and the State can come in and say, you know,11    defendant abused the State system.  Now we are prejudiced12    because so much time has gone by.  Courts can avail13    themselves of Rule 9(a) and preclude a defendant from14 filing.15              We respectfully submit that problematic16    defendants, defendants who are abusing State court17    systems, that's an ad hoc problem and it can be dealt with18    on an ad hoc basis.  This Court, even in some of those19    cases where clearly petitioners maybe with mental problems20    that filed 40 or 50 or 60 applications with this Court,21    that's an ad hoc problem, and this Court took ad hoc22    measures and said with respect to those defendants we will23    not grant an in forma pauperis application, so there are24    many measures --25              QUESTION:  But it still is the case that if a43 1    State has not opted in and a petitioner wishes to simply 2    continue the tolling period he can make repeated filings 3    in the State and if a district judge prefers not to hear 4    the habeas petition he can just simply wait. 5              MR. FUTERFAS:  The -- I think there is a 6    theoretical possibility of a defendant filing repetitive 7    applications for whatever reason to toll the time that the 8    defendant has to go into Federal court.  I think that 9    clearly is a theoretical possibility.  In practical10    effect, practical effect I think most defendants who are11    noncapital defendants are going to have an incentive to12    get their claims dealt with promptly, number 1.13              Number 2, if that happens, the State can --14    State judge can simply send an order to the clerk's15    office, do not accept this defendant's applications either16    without leave of court, or simply don't accept them any17 more.18              In death penalty cases, a State can say, we've19    had enough of this, we're setting an execution date, and20    that will force the defendant to go straight to Federal21    court, so I think there are a lot of ways to deal with the22    vexatious litigant.23              And also, keep in mind that even though tolling24    occurs, that during the periods of time that there is no25    tolling, that the clock is running, so if defendant files44 1    an application and the application is denied, and then a 2    month later files another one, or 2 months later, that 3    time is going to toll, but I think these are ad hoc 4    problems, and that State courts are certainly 5    well-equipped. 6              If a State determines that there is a general, 7    more general delay problem the State, under our version of 8    the rule, has absolute freedom to adopt any kind of 9    procedure the State wishes to do, whether it's timing10    requirements or successiveness limitations.  In fact,11    2244(b)(3) is a wonderful model that States could follow.12    They could set up a system where, under successive13    application, the State prisoner must obtain judicial14    review first, or approval first to file, so there is a15    whole panoply, really, of options available to a State to16    deal with these problems.17              One concern that we suggest occurs with respect,18    however, to the interplay between 153 and 154 is the19    following hypothetical.  If a State opts in, in a death20    penalty case, the State opts in, the defendant gets an21    attorney, a competent attorney, the defendant gets one22    run-through of the State collateral review process, and23    there's no question that they can bring up any claim they24    want, there's no suggestion in the State's briefs that25    they're limited on what kinds of claims they can bring up45 1    in that one review process, be it procedurally barred 2    claims or otherwise, when that petition is disposed of, 3    they have 180 days to get into Federal court. 4              Now watch what could happen with a death penalty 5    defendant if the State's rule is adopted, because under 6    153, the death penalty defendant now is convicted, files a 7    post application, post conviction application, does -- may 8    or may not have a lawyer, because the State has not opted 9    in, and it turns out all of the claims in the post10    conviction application are procedurally barred and more11    than 1 year has gone by.12              The defendant, who is not represented because13    the State has not opted in, now has lost his or her right14    to even get into Federal court on a habeas, so that's a15    possibility with the State's view of the rule.16              If I may just have a moment.17              The other cases that we respectfully suggest the18    State's rule conflicts with are this Court's decision in19    Rose v. Lundy.  Rose said that an application, the mixed20    application should be dismissed.  The State suggests,21    well, we can kind of modify Rose v. Lundy and say that the22    application will be held in abeyance, but Rose v. Lundy23    says no, it should be dismissed.  Of course, if the24    application is dismissed, and 1 year passes, that25    defendant could be deprived of going into Federal court.46 1              The O'Sullivan decision was just decided a year 2    ago says the defendants must bring all their claims -- 3    must seek leave to bring their claims to the highest court 4    in the State.  There again, this is exactly, actually, 5    this case, Tony Bennett's case, is O'Sullivan, because 6    here Tony Bennett is, having lost in the trial court, now 7    is trying to seek leave to the Appellate Division, Second 8    Department, hasn't received the order for 4 years in which 9    to do so, so he's trying to comply with O'Sullivan.10              But meanwhile, the clock is running, and under11    the State's rule -- well, because the trial court12    determined that his claims are procedurally barred, he's13    already lost his right to get into Federal court, even14    though at the same time O'Sullivan says you must be trying15    to seek leave and appeal your petitions in order to16    exhaust, so there's a conflict there as well.17              Finally, this Court's decision in Lonchar v.18    Thomas, this Court said that dismissal of the first habeas19    corpus is a very serious matter, and any rule that would20    deprive a first habeas corpus application should be clear21    and fair.  There's no limitation in 2244(d)(2) as to first22    habeases or second habeases, or first post conviction23    applications or second post conviction applications, so we24    respectfully submit that the State's rule is inconsistent25    as well with this Court's considered judgment and47pronouncements in Lonchar v. Thomas.          And if no Justices have any further questions, Iwill submit.          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Futerfas.          MR. FUTERFAS:  Thank you.          QUESTION:  Mr. Castellano, you have 1 minute          REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN M. CASTELLANO                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. CASTELLANO:  Your Honor, I would just liketo address the question, I believe it was JusticeGinsburg's question actually about why adopt our rule.  Ifthere are many different applications of the words,properly filed, there are many different reasonableinterpretations of the words properly filed, why ours?Why not just the petitioner's?          Ours because the purpose of a statute of -- thepurpose of a tolling provision is exhaustion, and our rulefollows the purpose of the tolling provision to a tee.  Itfollows it much more closely, certainly, than therespondent's.  Exhaustion does not require a Stateprisoner to return to State court to exhaust a remedythat's no longer available under State law because it'sprocedurally barred.          The respondent also mentions the workload costs.                            481234567    remaining.8 910111213141516171819202122232425 1    If the Court views the workload costs, it should view them 2    as a whole.  The States are saving much in the way of 3    workload here, and the Federal courts, for example, are 4    pushing most of these defendants forward.  These are 5    defendants who would in any event file in Federal court, 6    but much later, and the purpose of the statute of 7    limitations is being affected by drawing closer that 8    period of time between final -- between direct review and 9    Federal review.10              And finally, as to time bars, the danger with11    requiring the States to enact time bars --12              CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.13    Castellano.  The case is submitted.14              (Whereupon, at 11:52 a.m., the case in the15    above-entitled matter was submitted.)16 17181920212223242549
