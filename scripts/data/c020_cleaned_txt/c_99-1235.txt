Larketta Randolph.          Mr. Phillips.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice andmay it please the Court:          The central flaw in the jurisdictional and theenforceability of holdings in the court of appeals in thiscase is the manifest hostility that court demonstratedtowards arbitration.  The view reflected in those holdingsis, to use a phrase that this court used in similarcircumstances, quote, far out of step with this Court'sendorsement over the past 15 years of arbitration as aneffective and an efficient method of dispute resolution ofFederal statutory claims.          QUESTION:  I can understand yourcharacterization of the second holding that way about thepossibility that the arbitration might entail costs, butthe jurisdictional holding, do you think that manifests ahostility to arbitration?          MR. PHILLIPS:  I do, Mr. Chief Justice, largely                             3 1    because it's reasonably clear that had the Court treated 2    that order as an interlocutory order, then this matter 3    would have gone immediately to arbitration, and the 4    arbitration process would have been allowed to go forward. 5    By treating it as a final judgment, as the Court did, it 6    then undertook to review the merits of arbitrability -- 7              QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Phillips, there was a 8    crucial difference here.  The Court purported to dismiss 9    all the claims.  It didn't just enter a stay order, as10    would typically be the case.  It said everything else is11    dismissed, and I take it that would mean then that the12    statute of limitations might run before the case ever got13    back, or something like that, and isn't there a real14    difference between the entry of a stay order pending the15    arbitration versus a dismissal?16              MR. PHILLIPS:  There is no question, Justice17    O'Connor, that this case would have and probably should18    have been dealt with as a stay order.19              QUESTION:  Yes.20              MR. PHILLIPS:  Section 3 of the Federal21    Arbitration Act quite plainly states that the Court shall22    enter a stay.  In this context I think he did this to23    clear his docket, although that was not specifically our24    request.  That was his decision.25              QUESTION:  Well, why is that wrong,4 1    Mr. Phillips, if what the district judge says is, gee, 2    there's nothing before me, I think every single issue in 3    this case belongs in the arbitral forum, so I'm going to 4    dismiss, and I look at section 3.  What I see that as 5    telling me is, don't move forward.  It's not stay versus 6    dismissal, but it's stay versus letting the case continue. 7              Why should a district judge who says, there's 8    nothing to come back to me, this is not a case where some 9    issues are to be referred to other -- to the arbitral10    forum, and then there are other issues that I'll decide11    after the arbitration.  Why isn't it perfectly proper for12    a district judge to say, there's nothing here for me to13    decide, everything is for the arbitrator?14              MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I think at the end of the15    day this is still an embedded proceeding, and even though16    he ultimately dismisses everything, it is certainly17    available to come back to him at the end of the18    arbitration and have these issues reviewed, and it would19    certainly be much easier --20              QUESTION:  What issues?21              MR. PHILLIPS:  -- as a matter of judicial --22              QUESTION:  What issues?  In this case, as I23    understand it, I understand the formal distinction.  This24    is the plaintiff consumer suing rather than an action to25    order arbitration, but it seems to me even if you're right51    that the district judge should have stayed, what in fact2    happened was the district judge dismissed, total, case3    gone, and that seems to me as final a judgment as there4    could be.  You could argue, he shouldn't have done that.5              MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.6              QUESTION:  Just like erroneously entering7    summary judgment, we don't say it isn't the final8    judgment.  Judge says, I award summary judgment to9    defendant.  Plaintiff says, gee, judge, you shouldn't have10    done that, but it doesn't make the judgment any less final11    that the judge maybe should have done something other than12    dismiss.13141516171819202122232425          MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, if you take it to the flipside, though, Justice Ginsburg, what happens in thesituation where you deny summary judgment but style it asformally a final judgment, even though it in fact isn't afinal --          QUESTION:  It doesn't matter how you style it.You've got something before you.  You've held ontosomething.  It doesn't matter what label you pin to it.If a district judge disassociates itself from the case,that's the classic definition of a final judgment.          MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I --          QUESTION:  This district judge says, out.  Thiscase isn't here any more, gone, as distinguished from, I'm6 1    entering an interlocutory order. It's not what's -- 2              MR. PHILLIPS:  Clearly that's not what the judge 3    did here, and the question is, what should an appellate 4    court do when it's presented with this particular problem, 5    and my answer to you is to recognize that the dismissal in 6    this context was an inappropriate way to proceed, treat it 7    as a stay, and therefore conclude that it was not 8    appropriate to go beyond that, and entertain the question 9    of arbitrability, because to do that is to create a new10    class of problems under section 16 that otherwise wouldn't11 exist.121314151617    that.18          We know that if it's a true independent actionand you order something to arbitration, then there's anappeal on that --                QUESTION:  But when you say treat it as --                MR. PHILLIPS:  -- but that's the only case like20    Treat it as, district judge, your wrong, you should not21    have dismissed, we have to review and reverse at least22    that much to say, you should not have dismissed the case,23    you should have stayed it.24              So I could see if you're right about that, that25    the proper result here is always stay, never dismiss, then                QUESTION:  When you say treat it as, you're19    already saying -- this district judge says, dismissed. 1    the court of appeals says, this judge was wrong in 2    dismissing, we certainly have to review that, that's as 3    final as it could be, and on the merits of that decision 4    to dismiss, just as we would do with a summary judgment, 5    we say, district judge, you're wrong, you had no authority 6    to dismiss, you should have stayed.  I don't know that 7    courts of appeals treat dismissals that are wrong as if 8    the judge had not dismissed. 9              MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, the ultimate question, it10    seems to me, Justice Ginsburg, is going to be whether you11    treat form or substance in this context as the most12    important, because it's pretty clear to me that while the13    judge did, in fact, formally dismiss the action, what was14    both required under section 3 of the Federal Arbitration15    Act and what we asked for him to do was to stay this.16    This is the plaintiff's choice of forum.17              There's no reason the case couldn't have stayed18    there.  We can respond directly to the Chief Justice's and19    Justice O'Connor's concerns about judicial administration20    by retaining the case under those circumstances, and we21    can fulfill the overall purposes of the Federal22    Arbitration Act appellate review standards by insisting23    that matters, when all doubts are -- you know, when you24    can resolve all doubts in favor of making sure they go to25    arbitration, rather than go through what we are today,81 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425which is having adjudicated this issue at three differentlevels of the Federal court system over 5 years, tens ofthousands of dollars, and we're no closer today toresolving the merits of this dispute over the $15 chargeand whether that's a finance charge or not --          QUESTION:  Sure, but if you lose this case itwon't take another 5 years and another case, becauseeverybody will know pretty much where we stand.          MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, there's no question --          QUESTION:  I mean, the problem of the longlitigation here is that you've got an unresolved question.          MR. PHILLIPS:  There's no question about that,Justice Souter.          QUESTION:  Yes.  You --          MR. PHILLIPS:  What we need is an answer.          QUESTION:  You said the -- we should see this asa choice of form versus substance.  Haven't we got a formversus substance problem, in effect, whichever way we go?I understand your form and substance argument here, but ifwe follow the embedded-independent distinction we've got aform and substance problem, too, and it seems to me thatif we follow the embedded-independent distinction we arein effect going to be leaving it up to a matter ofpleading in a great many instances as to what theappealability may be, and let me just throw out the9 1    suggestion that we might be better off to let district 2    judges, in effect, make the form-substance distinction and 3    decide the appealability question than leave it to parties 4    who are pleading to make that distinction for us. 5              MR. PHILLIPS:  I think where we ought to look 6    for the appropriate legal standard is the statutory 7    scheme, and I think Congress clearly incorporated embedded 8    versus independent into the subcomponents of section 16. 9    They clearly recognize there are independent proceedings10    and there are embedded proceedings, and it has specific11    rules about how appeals ought to be followed in that12 course.13              So to be sure, there may be some potential for14    manipulation by the parties, but I don't know of much15    evidence to reflect that that's any kind of a problem, and16    Congress essentially bought into that distinction in 198817    when it adopted the statute in the form that it did.18              QUESTION:  Well, it did set forth specific19    rules, but it certainly didn't adopt the embedded-20    nonembedded criterion as a test for anything else, and the21    word it used for appealability was a classic word that has22    nothing to do with embedded versus nonembedded.  I mean,23    if that's what they meant by final, you know, final24    decision, they should have said something else.  It's a25    very strange word to use to convey embedded versus101    nonembedded.2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9                MR. PHILLIPS:  To be sure, Congress could have      been clearer here, and I think what the Court said in      Cortez-Byrd last term applies equally here, that      enlightenment is not going to come from parsing the      language of this particular statute.                At the end of the day what we know is that the      final decision language in section 16(a)(3) covers the      classic situation involving an independent proceeding.      Whether it should be extended beyond that to a new class      of claims that will interfere with the implementation of      the goals of arbitration is the issue before this Court.                I find it difficult to get passionate about this      because I believe Justice Souter is right, at the end of      the day what really matters is that we have a rule.  Once      we have a rule, the rest of us will presumably --                QUESTION:  What did they mean --                MR. PHILLIPS:  -- be able to line up behind that                QUESTION:  What did the -- the only -- I'm21    totally puzzled, frankly, by this statute, and I did22    notice the only people who seem to understand it, because23    I guess they wrote it, was the judicial conference, and24    they put in the legislative history that it would allow25    appeals from final judgments, including the final judgment1110111213141516171819    rule.20 1    in an action to compel arbitration, or a final action 2    dismissing an action in deference to arbitration, so I 3    didn't see that last -- what could that last statement 4    mean, other than this case? 5              MR. PHILLIPS:  I think that last statement could 6    be read directly to apply to this case.  Whether or not it 7    was meant, and whether Congress adopted that, I've no8 idea. 9              QUESTION:  I mean, it's not a -- an obvious10    thing that you would want to allow an appeal in this kind11 of a case.121314    wouldn't.1516    you would not want --17              QUESTION:  Why not?18              MR. PHILLIPS:  -- to appeal in this -- no,19    Justice Breyer -- that's wrong.  It is clear to me that20    you would not want to go through the delay and21    forestalling, allowing these matters to go to arbitration.22    That's what the parties voluntarily agree to.23              QUESTION:  But you do the other way.  You see,24    there's situation A, where a plaintiff -- a plaintiff25    wants arbitration, and the defendant doesn't.12MR. PHILLIPS:  Exactly.QUESTION:  And it's not obvious that youMR. PHILLIPS:  Oh, I think it's quite obvious 1              MR. PHILLIPS:  An independent action you're 2    talking about. 3              QUESTION:  That's right.  Well, the plaintiff 4    would love to go to arbitration, defendant doesn't. 5              MR. PHILLIPS:  Right. 6              QUESTION:  So what is he supposed to do?  The 7    defendant won't show up in the room, won't set it up. 8              MR. PHILLIPS:  Right. 9              QUESTION:  He goes to court and asks the judge,10    judge, send him to arbitration, and the judge does or he11    doesn't.  Either way, he gets an appeal.12              MR. PHILLIPS:  That's correct.13              QUESTION:  Either way.14              MR. PHILLIPS:  No question.15              QUESTION:  Now, the converse case, the plaintiff16    does not want arbitration, but the defendant does.17              MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.18              QUESTION:  The plaintiff runs into court and19    brings his case.  The defendant says, judge, send me to20    arbitration.  If the judge doesn't send him to21    arbitration, there's an immediate appeal, and if he does22    send him to arbitration, on your view he's out to lunch,23 stuck.24              MR. PHILLIPS:  Right, because --25              QUESTION:  On their view it's at least --13123456    situations.7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.          QUESTION:  -- consistent.  You know, both          MR. PHILLIPS:  Well --          QUESTION:  -- you get an appeal under both          MR. PHILLIPS:  It's not consistent in the sensethat if you look at the way 16(a) and 16(b) are set up,they really are designed basically to say if you have anultimate order that says arbitrate you don't want to go toappeal, and if you don't --          QUESTION:  But you can do it where it's --          MR. PHILLIPS:  There is -- there is a --          QUESTION:  -- where's the --          MR. PHILLIPS:  -- there's a single exception,that's true, Justice Breyer.          QUESTION:  Well, that's a big exception.          MR. PHILLIPS:  And all I'm saying is, thequestion is, do you want to drag in another exceptionunder these circumstances where it's a perfectly sensibleto say, what should have been entered in here in thiscontext was a stay that's not appealable, and in thefuture, go on forward in other cases.          QUESTION:  Well, if we look at the language ofthe statute dealing with the final decision, we look at14ways -- 1    the fact that it was a dismissal, so we say, okay, there's 2    jurisdiction.  Now are you going to talk about question 2? 3              MR. PHILLIPS:  I'd love to talk about question 4    2.  Thank you, Justice O'Connor. 5              (Laughter.) 6              MR. PHILLIPS:  Obviously, if the Court finds 7    that there is jurisdiction, the hostility that I mentioned 8    at the outset of my argument applies with particular force 9    with respect to the presumption that the court of appeals10    employed in deciding --11              QUESTION:  May I ask a question, to be sure I12    get it in before the hour goes by, on question 2.  Do you13    think there are -- let's assume you're dead right, that14    the arbitration clause does not have to specify the costs15    in detail and so forth.  Now, are there cases, and I'm16    wondering in -- take care of this one -- in which an17    arbitration clause could be so one-sided that it's not18    enforceable?19              This clause, as I read it, preserves the20    company's right to judicial remedy.  It says the21    arbitration clause shall not interfere with their right to22    use the judicial process to secure relief, but it does23    interfere with the other side's right.  Now, I don't know24    whether that's sufficiently one-sided to raise a question25    or not, but are there clauses that are so one-sided that15 1    it might not be enforceable? 2              MR. PHILLIPS:  There may well be.  My -- let me 3    answer the first part which is that we know -- is that -- 4    is the particular imbalance in this clause sufficient to 5    render this unenforceable.  I don't -- I don't understand 6    the other side to have argued that.  If they did argue it 7    below, they -- clearly that was rejected because the 8    district court analyzed and dealt with all of the 9    unconscionability issues, so I don't think that issue's on10 the table.11              With respect -- I mean, is it possible to have12    an arbitration clause that says in order to get entry into13    arbitration you -- you know, the plaintiff would have to14    file a million dollars, I think obviously a clause like15    that would be unenforceable under those circumstances16    because it would interfere with the ultimate enforcement17    of the statutory right, and that is one of the conditions18    of allowing arbitration of general statutory claims, and I19    don't have any problem with that.20              The problem is that if you have a clause like21    the one we have in this case, which is silent on these22    issues, the clear presumption, then, must be that you23    would favor arbitration.  You would not assume all of the24    costs are going to be extreme or excessive.25              QUESTION:  You're saying in effect that the16 1    burden is on the person challenging the fairness of the 2    clause to show some unfairness -- 3              MR. PHILLIPS:  That -- 4              QUESTION:  -- and that the, what, the Eleventh 5    Circuit here just, without any showing on the part of 6    the -- that party simply said because it might -- 7              MR. PHILLIPS:  That is exactly right, Mr. Chief 8    Justice.  The Eleventh Circuit said we will presume all of 9    the potential costs, large filing fees, pay for the costs10    of the arbitrator and pay for everything else, without any11    showing being made by the plaintiff under the12    circumstances of this case, and therefore we're going to13    say that there is an inherent conflict.14              What I suggest to you is that the language,15    inherent conflict, doesn't remotely entertain that kind of16    an analysis.17              QUESTION:  Is the relief you're asking for on18    that ground that we send it back and give the plaintiff19    the opportunity to make that showing?20              MR. PHILLIPS:  No.  The plaintiff had the21    opportunity to make that showing.  She had a full and fair22    opportunity to engage in all of the discovery she wanted23    to.  She chose, on a motion to reconsider, to throw some24    materials from the American Arbitration Association over25    the transom to try to make some kind of a showing.17 1              The answer is, she should go to arbitration, 2    ascertain whether the arbitrator -- whether the fees for 3    arbitration would be waived, what the costs of the 4    arbitrator will be, and then, if it turns out at the end 5    of the day that either those costs are unconscionable as a 6    matter of state law -- 7              QUESTION:  Mr. Phillips, from what you just said 8    I take it you disagree with the D.C. Circuit.  The D.C. 9    Circuit said, plaintiffs, employees -- and I take it10    consumers would fall in that same boat.  They're going to11    not go to an arbitration if they're gong to face the12    possibility, which they never face in court -- in court,13    they don't have to pay the judge.14              Arbitrators sometimes charge a lot of money per15    hour of their time, so unless the contract says, or unless16    the court reads into the contract that the seller in this17    case, or the finance company, the employer in that case,18    pays at least for the judge, then this would be an19    unconscionable arrangement.  You can't require the20    consumer or the employee to pay the judge, and that has to21 be clear.22              MR. PHILLIPS:  I think that the decision of the23    court in Cole is completely premature for this Court to24    entertain at this point in time, because we don't know25    what kinds of costs we're talking about.  In the record18 1    before the D.C. Circuit in Cole, they had some evidence 2    about what they thought the costs would be, given the 3    nature of those claims.  Here, we have no evidence like4 that. 5              Is it possible in a particular case that the 6    court could declare something unenforceable because the 7    costs are too great? 8              QUESTION:  Well, but -- 9              MR. PHILLIPS:  As I say, yes, I think you could10 but --11              QUESTION:  Mr. Phillips, supposing that, unlike12    the case here, the person objecting to arbitration had13    made a significant showing in the district court, not14    going to arbitration but saying, look, here are some15    figures from past arbitrations; we think this is going to16    be just like this one; the party who wanted to go to17    arbitration doesn't contradict that; the district court18    says yes, these kind of costs are going to be incurred in19    the arbitration, and therefore it's unconscionable.  I20    don't see why the -- that party should have to go to21    arbitration if they can make a persuasive showing to the22    court.23242519          MR. PHILLIPS:  I don't disagree with that,Mr. Chief Justice.  I think that you have either of twoways to try to prove up your case, either through 1    discovery, which she had a full and fair opportunity to 2    do, and didn't present any evidence with respect to that, 3    or, assuming that there's going to be doubts -- and I 4    think all doubts, again, ought to be resolved in favor of 5    pushing toward arbitration in order to ascertain this. 6              Remember, if you read the American Arbitration 7    Association's amicus brief it says that they consistently 8    waive their filing fees, they often reduce arbitrator's 9    fees, and we know -- and it's the reason why I think it10    makes much more sense for the court to entertain these11    issues after an arbitration rather than before an12    arbitration -- is that we may find out at the end of the13    day, if the plaintiff prevails, that all of those costs go14    back to her, and so she's really out of pocket nothing15    except for the marginal costs during the pendency of the16    proceedings.17              QUESTION:  But supposing the arbitration, say,18    goes on for a week, and the arbitrator's time is consumed,19    and the plaintiff's, and the defendant's, and then it20    turns out that a court is going to find the arrangements21    were unconscionable, that the plaintiff was required to22    put up thousands of dollars, or the party objecting, and23    so you've basically spun your wheels in the arbitration24    proceeding.25              MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, hopefully that wouldn't                                  20 1    happen, obviously, and you wouldn't expect it to happen 2    very often, but again I don't disagree with you, Mr. Chief3 Justice. 4              If what you're saying is, should the plaintiff 5    have an opportunity to prove unconscionability at the 6    outset of the process, I don't have any problem with that, 7    assuming she does more than what she did here, which was 8    to say, I'm not going to arbitration, I'm not going to do 9    anything, I'm simply going to put in a study from the AAA10    which may or may not apply to the circumstances of this11    case.  I'm not even going to ask Green Tree whether or not12    they're willing to pay for the fees in the circumstances a13    la what the D.C. Circuit required in the Cole case.14              QUESTION:  Well, she had other reasons, too, and15    one the Eleventh Circuit didn't deal with because they16    didn't have to, and that is, she said, I don't have to go17    to arbitration because under the Truth-in-Lending Act I18    have a right to make this a class action and I'm not going19    to get the class action.20              The Eleventh Circuit, as I understand it, said21    we're not going to address that issue because we've22    already decided she has to have security that she's not23    going to have to pay for the arbitrator under any24    circumstances.25              MR. PHILLIPS:  They make that argument, and they21 1    ask the Court in this case to affirm on that alternative 2    ground, and our position here is that there is no 3    distinction between this case and Gilmer with respect to 4    the treatment of class action.  There is no greater right 5    to a class action -- 6              QUESTION:  Yes, but we can't address that as a 7    matter of first view.  I mean, the -- 8              MR. PHILLIPS:  As a matter, I'm sorry, of what? 9              QUESTION:  First view.10              MR. PHILLIPS:  Oh, first view.11              QUESTION:  The Eleventh Circuit didn't address12    it at all.  It said, that's a question we leave open.  We13    don't have to get to it on our theory of the case.  Our14    theory of the case is that the party seeking arbitration15    has to pay the arbitrator, period.16              MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.17              QUESTION:  So we -- so at least I feel that the18    class that question, whether there could be arbitration at19    all because of the class action provision of the Truth-20    in-Lending Act, we can't address that in this proceeding21    because it hasn't been aired below.22              MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, you know23    as well as I do that it's largely a matter of the court's24    discretion what alternative grounds which are asserted by25    a party in litigation to defend a judgment the court will221 entertain. 2              They have raised a class action issue.  We have 3    responded to the class action issue.  The Court of Appeals 4    for the Third Circuit in a recent decision in Johnson, 5    which we filed a supplemental brief on, has exhaustively 6    analyzed the class action issue, and the bottom line is 7    there is nothing in TILA that is any more pro-class action 8    than there was in the Age Discrimination in Employment 9    Act, which this Court held in Gilmer did not prevent10    enforceability of the arbitration clause in that context11    and, indeed, TILA has provisions that clearly envision12    providing significant opportunities for plaintiffs to13    recover in these kinds of cases.14              There are statutory damages provisions that give15    significant moneys even without showing of injury --16              QUESTION:  The -- you're saying there's enough17 in here --18              MR. PHILLIPS:  -- and there are attorney's fees19    and reasonable costs.20              QUESTION:  -- for us to deal with the class21    action issue, but you've mentioned Gilmer more than once,22    and one of the things about Gilmer that struck me is that23    the securities industry said, unlike what you're saying --24    you say, wait and see.  Let's see what the arbitrator25    does.  We're not going to tell you one way or the other.                                  23 1    The securities industry said, we pay for the judge, and so 2    that was out of the case. 3              When Gilmer came to this Court it was presented 4    with a situation where the employee was not going to have 5    to pay the cost of the arbitrator because the party 6    seeking arbitration, the securities industry, said, 7    what -- don't worry about that.  We pay the arbitrator. 8              MR. PHILLIPS:  But the problem with the 9    situation is that you don't presume, in the face of10    silence, that there's going to be a problem with going to11    arbitration.12              This Court has said consistently for 15 years,13    in interpreting the relationship between the Federal14    Arbitration Act and Federal statutes, that we presume they15    should go to arbitration and, if there are gaps, we assume16    that the arbitrator will provide for them and we know, as17    this case comes to the Court at this point based on both18    what was in the record below and what the amici briefs19    have shown, is that this does not need to be an expensive20    enterprise.  It may not cost her anything with respect to21    either filing fees or arbitrator's fees.22              QUESTION:  In taking this position you have to23    be saying the D.C. Circuit not only was premature, but it24    was just wrong.25              MR. PHILLIPS:  No.                                  24 1              QUESTION:  Because as I read the D.C. Circuit 2    they said, to make this contract fair and enforceable, it 3    must be not the arbitrator's decision, it must be, as a 4    matter of law, that the party seeking arbitration pays for 5    the arbitrator, as a matter of law, not for the individual 6    arbitrator to decide in each arbitration. 7              MR. PHILLIPS:  I am troubled, Justice Ginsburg, 8    by the idea that you would adopt a rule judicially that, 9    as a matter of law, one party must always front the costs10    regardless of the circumstances of the particular case,11    and I agree with you, to that extent I think the D.C.12    Circuit's opinion is overbroad.13              I don't know whether it would necessarily be14    applied as broadly as the language seems to suggest, but15    what I do know is that the problems inherent in that kind16    of a rule, which has not been tested particularly, are17    such that it's completely premature for this Court to go18    down that path.  Where this Court ought to focus is, what19    was before the district judge when that court decided to20    send it to arbitration, and what was before that judge at21    that time was, silence, which you construe favorably to22    arbitration and therefore send the matter to arbitration23    with no further judicial review.24              QUESTION:  Did your client makes its position on25    this issue known to the district court, what the -- how251    the costs would be allocated and so forth, or did they2    just say, we'll fight it out when we get to the3    arbitrator?4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. PHILLIPS:  We said -- we were never askedspecifically our views with respect to this.          QUESTION:  You didn't volunteer them, of course.          MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, the issue came up in amotion to reconsider, Justice Stevens.  That was the firsttime they suggested that these costs were excessive.          They did raise the class action earlier in theprocess, but they didn't raise the question of costsspecifically and, frankly, even in the Eleventh Circuitthe cost question was more of a second thought than it wasa primary portion or focus of the attention of the court.          If you're asking me, would we pay those costs inmost cases, I can tell you that I know that Green Treedoes pay those costs in a lot of instances, but that's thewhole point.  The plaintiff has the obligation --          QUESTION:  Even if they --          MR. PHILLIPS:  -- at least to ask that question.          QUESTION:  They pay the costs even if theydidn't lose?          MR. PHILLIPS:  Even if we didn't lose.  We frontthe costs at a minimum, and oftentimes we can't get thosecosts back.261 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          If there are no questions, further questions,I'd reserve the balance of my time.          QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Phillips.          Mr. Sellers, we'll hear from you.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH M. SELLERS                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MR. SELLERS:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it pleasethe Court:          Very importantly, the Federal Arbitration Actdid not divest the district courts of discretion todismiss cases, as the district judge did here, as opposedto staying a case.  Therefore, the district court had thatdiscretion, exercised the discretion and, as JusticeGinsburg observed, I think once the decision was made todismiss with prejudice there was nothing else left for theCourt to do, and that satisfied the classic standard offinality that made it subject to immediate appellate          I am happy to address the first issue briefly,and then turn to the second issue, second question.1011121314151617181920    review.21              QUESTION:  But Mr. Sellers, if you took the22    position that I thought Mr. Phillips -- he will straighten23    us out on it -- was embracing at this argument, although24    not in his brief, that Alabama -- the amici, The Housing25    Institute took, they said, yeah, you could say this was a271 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425dismissal in the final judgment, but the Eleventh Circuitshould say, district judge, you're wrong, because youdon't have any authority to dismiss.  You must stay,because section 3 says must stay.          MR. SELLERS:  Actually, Justice Ginsburg, Idon't think that's a fair reading of the FederalArbitration Act.  Section 3 says you must stay, butthere's nothing inconsistent about section 3, as themajority of the circuit courts have recognized, andultimate dismissal.          Section 3 was designed to ensure that therewould be no further pursuit of the merits of the action,that that would be the end of the litigation of the actionin that court until the arbitration concluded.  There'snothing improper, however, about a dismissal followingthat and, by the way, if I might just add, Green Tree didask to dismiss this case.  They --          QUESTION:  They alternately --          MR. SELLERS:  -- requested --          QUESTION:  Alternately they --          MR. SELLERS:  Alternately, that's correct, andthe district court, if nothing else in responding to GreenTree's request for relief, was properly -- acted properlyin granting that request.          But even if Green Tree had not requested the                            281 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9dismissal, there's nothing impermissible about adismissal.  Again, I must add, I don't think the FederalArbitration Act in any respect divested the districtcourts of a fundamental aspect of the discretion --          QUESTION:  Well, even if there is somethingimproper about a dismissal, it's nonetheless adismissal --          MR. SELLERS:  That's correct, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  -- isn't it?  I don't think we're inthe habit of looking into whether the dismissal wascorrect or not and deciding whether something was101112    appealable.13141516171819202122232425          MR. SELLERS:  That's correct, and the EleventhCircuit permit -- was legitimately entitled to rely on thedismissal as a basis for appeal --          QUESTION:  Well, suppose that you -- this iswhat's bothering me a lot.  You have a plaintiff bringinga claim.  Count 1, nothing to do with arbitration.  CountII, nothing to do with arbitration, III, nothing to dowith it, count IV, arbitration's at issue.          The judge, instead of staying it, dismisses it.          MR. SELLERS:  That --          QUESTION:  Appeal?          MR. SELLERS:  That I think would be reversibleerror, Your Honor, because I think it's clear that that                            291    would not be an interlocutory -- that would be an2    interlocutory --3              QUESTION:  So you'd have to -- the other side4    would have to cross-appeal.  They would say -- what they5    would say is, this should have been stayed and not6 dismissed.7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. SELLERS:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  All right.  Now, what's bothering meabout accepting your position, which is very logical andmay be absolutely the right one, but we're going to createnow a whole spin-off web of law, and the web of law isgoing to be -- because the first thing that's going tohappen every time, you see -- not every time, but whatwill happen is the judge -- the plaintiff brings a case.Judge dismisses it.   Aha, says the plaintiff, now I canappeal, and there will be a cross-appeal, and the claimwill be that in fact this is a case where there shouldhave been a stay, and not a dismissal.          MR. SELLERS:  But --          QUESTION:  And pretty soon rules of law willdevelop as to just when it's the one, and when it's theother, and all that means, delay, delay, delay, the veryopposite of what the Arbitration Act is designed to do.          MR. SELLERS:  Justice Breyer, I think the rulescould be articulated fairly clearly that will avoid the30 1    multiplicity of appeals that concern you.  If there is 2    a -- in the hypothetical you gave, where the referral to 3    arbitration did not refer all claims that were pending 4    before the court -- 5              QUESTION:  Mm-hmm. 6              MR. SELLERS:  -- I think it would be reversible 7    error to dismiss the case, or if it was dismissed it would 8    be treated as an interlocutory and the court of appeals 9    could legitimately direct the court to reinstate the case,10 and --11              QUESTION:  And you don't think you as a lawyer12    will be capable, even in my imaginary case, of arguing13    that, although the judge thought it had nothing to do with14    it, or it really did, or the judge thought it did but it15    really didn't, et cetera?16              MR. SELLERS:  I don't think so, Your Honor.  I17    think that the law is pretty clear, and the choices that18    Congress made in enacting section 16(a)3 are pretty clear,19    and that kind of scenario would not ordinarily give rise20    to an appealable order and I think, as Justice Souter21    observed, once the rules are set out here, I think we will22    all be able to follow them.  Right now there's some23    confusion.24              QUESTION:  I don't understand what you mean by25    saying, if it's dismissed it would be treated as311    interlocutory.2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. SELLERS:  I'm sorry.  What I meant was, itwould be reversible error.          QUESTION:  And the court of appeals would theninstruct the district judges, when there's something leftover, of course you don't enter a final dismissal.          MR. SELLERS:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  And that would be -- and that wouldbe the end of it.          MR. SELLERS:  That would be the end of it.          QUESTION:  The -- so the court of appeals wouldtake it to final judgment and then say, if there areissues left over, you must stay, not dismiss.  If thereare no issues left over, then it was perfectly proper to101112131415    dismiss.16171819202122232425          MR. SELLERS:  Right.  If there are no issuesleft over, the court may have some discretion, but itcertainly is permissible to dismiss, as the district courtdid here, and I would ordinarily think most districtcourts would dismiss under those circumstances, becausethere'd be nothing left for the district court to do.          QUESTION:  What is your take on the argumentthat was made in that amicus brief that under section --is it 3?          MR. SELLERS:  16(a)3, Your Honor.                            32 1              QUESTION:  16(a)3, the words say, must stay.  It 2    doesn't say -- 3              MR. SELLERS:  Oh, I'm sorry, section 3. 4              QUESTION:  Yes.  Section -- 5              MR. SELLERS:  Section 3. 6              QUESTION:  Section 3. 7              MR. SELLERS:  Forgive me. 8              QUESTION:  Yes. 9              MR. SELLERS:  The term, must stay, we read to10    mean that it may not permit.  It is nondiscretionary, but11    the key is what it's nondiscretionary as to.  It may12    not -- the district court must stay any litigation of the13    merits of the underlying claims.  That does not speak to14    the question of whether the district court has discretion,15    if it refers the entirety of the claims to arbitration, to16    ultimately dismiss.17              QUESTION:  Okay.  I didn't want to detain you on18    that.  I just wanted to make sure that you recognized --192021 with.22              QUESTION:  Right.23              MR. SELLERS:  Correct.24              QUESTION:  Period.25              MR. SELLERS:  Correct, and I think that's33MR. SELLERS:  Certainly.  Thank you.QUESTION:  Stay means nothing but not go forward 1    consistent with the way Congress would have viewed it in 2    1925, when it was originally put in place. 3              May I turn to the second issue that I understand 4    is also of central concern to the Court.  I think that 5    Mr. Phillips, in using a hypothetical, or responding to a 6    hypothetical of the Court, illustrates the problem with 7    costs, and the reason why the circuit court was correct in 8    holding the agreement unenforceable because of the risk of 9    the imposition of large costs.10              The example given, well, suppose the plaintiff11    was expected to put up $1 million in costs, or, if we can12    be a little more realistic, suppose the cost of13    arbitration were $5,000, just the initial14    arbitration-specific costs, the costs of filing, the cost15    of the arbitrator, because he or she's setting aside a day16    or two to come out, they want to check in advance, which17    often happens, suppose that they have to rent a room,18    suppose there's a stenographer, and they want all that19    payment up front.20              QUESTION:  Well, but you -- you're necessarily21    requiring -- required to say suppose, Mr. Sellers, because22    your client made no showing below.23              MR. SELLERS:  Well --24              QUESTION:  And it seems to me that unless we're25    to say that, contrary to our other statements about341 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425arbitration agreements, that an arbitration agreement issuspect, and unless the party can come in and defend itsreasonableness -- why didn't your client make any showing?          MR. SELLERS:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, in fact,she tried and she was unsuccessful, but not through anyfault of her own.          I might begin by noting that she -- thatMs. Randolph did request, and did mention costs, wellbefore this time of reconsideration was --          QUESTION:  But the court of appeals doesn't relyon any showing.  The court of appeals just speculated.          MR. SELLERS:  Well, the court of appeals isrelying on the showing that Ms. Randolph made of theaverage cost from a AAA survey because, notwithstandingher request for discovery, and she filed a motion fordiscovery, I might add, which is found -- it's docketnumber 11 in the --          QUESTION:  And this is discovery going to thecosts of the arbitration?          MR. SELLERS:  It was discovery with respect toarbitration procedures.  It was not -- it was procedureswhich I think is fairly -- could be fairly construed toinclude costs.          That motion, pursuant to that motion sheeventually took a deposition pursuant to rule 30(b)(6).35 1    That was taken in December of 1996. It is not in the 2    record, and in that deposition testimony was elicited 3    about whether Green Tree was prepared to -- the question 4    specifically was posed as to the cost of arbitration. 5              QUESTION:  Well now, are you -- if it's not in 6    the record, is it properly before us? 7              MR. SELLERS:  It is not properly before the 8    Court, and I want to explain why it was not put in the9 record.10              QUESTION:  Well, but if it isn't in the record,11    and it's not properly before the Court, I should think12    that would be the end of it.13              MR. SELLERS:  Very well, Mr. Chief Justice.  I14    merely want to note its existence, because I think if the15    Court is not satisfied with the showing that was made on16    costs, I would like it to entertain the request, or the17    question that Justice Stevens put to my colleague, and18    that is that a remand be permitted so that the record may19    be more fully substantiated.20              I might add that Green Tree, during the course21    of this litigation, was asked -- was -- there was22    litigation over the issue of costs both at the district23    court and the court of appeals.  Green Tree was asked at24    oral argument, as is apparent from the appeal -- from the25    opinion from the Eleventh Circuit about the costs, and it36 1    was unprepared to say that there were specific costs, or, 2    as Mr. Phillips has now allowed, that they might very well 3    allow costs in the outset. 4              QUESTION:  The court of appeals, as I understand 5    its opinion, didn't talk about actual costs.  It simply 6    said that because these might -- these things might7 happen. 8              MR. SELLERS:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I9 think --10              QUESTION:  You know, you've put the burden --11              MR. SELLERS:  I understand --12              QUESTION:  -- basically on the parties seeking13    arbitration, rather than on the party challenging the14    arbitration.1516171819202122232425          MR. SELLERS:  I --          QUESTION:  I question the propriety of that.          MR. SELLERS:  I understand, Mr. Chief Justice.I refer now to the section of the opinion that's found atappendix 17(a) and (b) -- I'm sorry, 17(a) and 18(a),where the Eleventh Circuit refers to some questions andanswers given to it by the -- by Green Tree's counsel atargument, and they asked about whether AAA rules arenormally used.  They say, we don't typically do that.          Then it says, the opinion on top of page 18(a)says, Green Tree also asserted at oral argument the371 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425arbitrator may apportion the fees of the arbitration inhis award, but that provides no guarantee that a consumersuccessfully arbitrating under this clause will not besaddled with a prohibitive cost order, and it goes on.          They were asked and given an opportunity,apparently, to indicate what are the costs for --          QUESTION:  Why should the burden be on them?          MR. SELLERS:  Well, I think that the -- therewas --          QUESTION:  They weren't challenging thearbitration agreement.  Your client was.          MR. SELLERS:  I understand, but I think that'spart of the record that we have here as to what those --there was a consistent difficulty in pinning down GreenTree as to what the costs were.          QUESTION:  Why doesn't Alabama law cover that?I mean, maybe it -- I found, or my law clerk found a casehere involving Green Tree where the Alabama supreme courtsays, where a clause in a contract is silent on aparticular question, notions of fairness and settledprinciples of Alabama law prevent us from deciding thequestion by indulging in assumption that the proof wouldsupport a worst-case scenario.  It's a rather --          MR. SELLERS:  I understand.          QUESTION:  So why, following just Alabama law,38 1    wouldn't you say, well, what we're going to do is assume 2    that it will be interpreted in a reasonable way that would 3    support the arbitration -- 4              MR. SELLERS:  Because -- because, Justice 5    Breyer, that would put Ms. Randolph in the untenable 6    position where, in the pursuit of a claim that had 7    economic damages of about $15, she would be forced to go 8    forward with an arbitration on the presumption that the 9    fees and costs would ultimately be allocable in a fair way10    without knowing what that would be --11              QUESTION:  I don't think that --12              MR. SELLERS:  -- and challenge it later.13              QUESTION:  I don't think that's necessarily14    correct, Mr. Sellers.  Conceivably some, you know, proof15    could be offered in the district court, before the16    arbitration, that the fees would be, you know, way, way17    out of proportion, but it just wasn't done here.18              MR. SELLERS:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, what they19    did offer was information that was taken from the AAA20    survey.  There was information in the record.  It is true21    that it was not taken from this case, and I have explained22    the reason for that, but that is evidence in the record23    before the district court as to the average costs of24    arbitration and filing fees.25              QUESTION:  But that's either fair or not.  You391    said, it will make her go forward on an assumption the2    costs would be allocated in a fair way.  Well, what's3    wrong with going forward on an assumption that they'll be4    allocated in a fair way?  How could anybody object to5 that? 678910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. SELLERS:  I'm sorry, if I could just finish.It would cause her to go forward in pursuit of a claim ofvery limited economic value on the possibility at theend -- let's suppose that the fair way in the mind of thearbitrator was to split the costs, regardless of outcome.Each side bears its own -- bears half the cost of thearbitration, and if the arbitration was $5,000, and hershare was $2,500, she might very well not go forward underthose circumstances.          QUESTION:  Then that wouldn't be very fair,would it?          MR. SELLERS:  No, I don't think it would be, butthat might be in the eye of the arbitrator, the resultthat is awarded, and we won't know that unless it'sdetermined or ascertainable at the beginning.          We don't take the position that the costs have                            40          MR. SELLERS:  Because -- because, JusticeBreyer, nobody knows what that means, and the -- it wouldcause her to go for --          QUESTION:  Well -- 1    to be set forth specifically in the arbitration agreement, 2    but that they be ascertainable, and in fact the American 3    Arbitration Association last year adopted new rules 4    pursuant to a consumer protocol which set forth the 5    provision that a maximum of $125 must be borne by the 6    consumer and the rest would be borne by the company for 7    smaller claims. 8              That is a -- had this agreement simply said, we 9    will follow that kind of rule, or refer to it an outside10    source of that kind of rule, that would have been fine.11    But complete silence.  It was even silent as to whether12    there were costs.  There was not even an indication that13    somebody who went forward with an arbitration would have14    to bear costs.15              She'd have to be -- have to know that, and have16    confidence that in going forward there would be a17    reasonable -- there'd be an expectation of an allocation18    that is fair, whatever that means.19              We submit that that kind of uncertainty creates20    a disincentive to go forward and enforce the rights under21    the Truth-in-Lending Act that this Court in Mitsubishi and22    in Gilmer made clear is the basis either to decline to23    enforce the agreement altogether or, as was asked about24    the Cole decision -- if I may address it for a moment.25              We understand there's a split in the circuits as41 1    to whether, under section 4 of the Federal Arbitration 2    Act, there is any authority that the district courts have 3    to insert provisions into an agreement to have it conform 4    with the law as they view it. 5              Whether or not that authority exists, ultimately 6    the outcome ought to be that the district court should 7    tell the parties, I won't permit this to go forward unless 8    you spell out costs or give the party against whom the 9    arbitration agreement is being enforced the opportunity to10    be assured that they're not going to bear costs beyond11    those that would be -- they would ordinarily expect if12    they went forward in court.13              That is the forum that they chose.  If the -- if14    judicial and arbitral forums are to be comparable, you15    can't impose on one party costs well in excess, or create16    the risk that they would bear those costs --17              QUESTION:  Why can't you just ask the arbitrator18    to make that decision at the outset?19              MR. SELLERS:  I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy.20              QUESTION:  Why can't the claimant simply ask the21    arbitrator to please make the determination at the outset22    as to what the fees are going to be?  You'd have a filing23    fee and you'd say, for your first hour, first half-a-day,24    tell me what's involved, I might want to get out of here.25              MR. SELLERS:  And of course if the plaintiff did42 1    that, she -- Ms. Randolph would have already incurred 2    costs going forward -- 3              QUESTION:  I know there'd be a filing fee -- 4              MR. SELLERS:  -- even if she later wanted to5 back out. 6              QUESTION:  -- an initial fee, but -- 7              MR. SELLERS:  Well, and maybe the costs -- you'd 8    have part of the costs of the arbitrator, and again, I 9    must add, the arbitrator said, as again, people who are10    busy and expected to arbitrate cases are often called upon11    to do, I'm going to have to bill you for a day because12    I've set aside all my other work in order to attend to13    this arbitration, so if you take 10 minutes or 10 hours,14    that's the time I'm charging you for.  That is a cost --15    that is a risk that a prudent person I don't think ought16    to be expected to --17              QUESTION:  Well, if the parties agree on18    arbitration, and the arbitrator has to be fair not only in19    the decision but in the allocation of costs and expenses,20    it seems to me that that's for the arbitration.21              MR. SELLERS:  Well, again, I -- we submit22    that -- we understand that that determination may and23    properly should ultimately be made by an arbitration, but24    costs are really unique, and --25              QUESTION:  Could you do this in respect to431 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425costs --MR. SELLERS:  I'm sorry.          QUESTION:  Could you do the following?  I'm notsure you can.          MR. SELLERS:  Okay.          QUESTION:  But I see that Alabama says customerusage is used to interpret the silent contract, and thereare a lot of associations like the American ArbitrationAssociation that have gone to enormous trouble to figureout how to structure costs and procedures so as to be fairto consumers or others who don't have the money, and theymight be frightened of the costs.          MR. SELLERS:  Uh-huh.          QUESTION:  Well, could you read that customs orusage in Alabama as embodying some such system, or thelike, not necessarily the --          MR. SELLERS:  I understand.          QUESTION:  -- arbitration one, but --          MR. SELLERS:  Right.          QUESTION:  -- some such system that would avoidthe problem of later unconscionability, and wouldtherefore make the thing valid, and both valid and fair?          MR. SELLERS:  Justice Breyer, I certainly thinkyou could do that, but I think the key to it is that it beestablished at the outset, and not at the end of the44 1    arbitration. 2              QUESTION:  All right, then couldn't the court in 3    this instance have said, look, we have a silent contract 4    here.  Alabama tells us to use customer usage.  By that, 5    they mean customer usage that will make the provision 6    valid if it exists, and here is a body that does that, and 7    so we assume something like that will be. 8              MR. SELLERS:  Yes, I think the district court 9    had that authority, and could and should have exercised10    some additional authority in telling the parties at that11    juncture, before it sent them off to arbitration, I am12    concerned about the silence on costs.  I believe -- I want13    to give effect to this agreement.  I believe that's the14    intention of the parties.  But I am also concerned about15    the potential imposition of excessive costs.16              In Alabama there's a customer usage provision,17    and I want to establish, before I send this off to18    arbitration, or have a initial conference with the19    arbitrator to determine at no expense to the parties what20    cost is going to be assessed, and how it's going to be21    allocated, and at that point go forward and arbitrate.22    That would satisfy us.23              But it's got to be done at the outset, not at24    the end, because at that point you bear the costs, you're25    stuck with them, or, as in the case of Ms. Randolph,451234567    either.8you're so deterred by the possibility of excessive coststhat you won't go forward, and that's the prospectivewaiver of the TILA claims that this Court has expressedconcern if it were to arise.                QUESTION:  So you're saying if --                MR. SELLERS:  We don't want that to happen10    tossed out this arbitration, which would allow your11    client -- as I understand the posture now, your client can12    go into court with a Truth-in-Lending Act suit and is13    freed from the yoke of arbitration, is that correct?14              MR. SELLERS:  I'm sorry, I misunder -- I didn't15    understand the question.16              QUESTION:  As I understand the Eleventh Circuit17    decision --18              MR. SELLERS:  Oh, yes.19              QUESTION:  -- this contract is no good.20              MR. SELLERS:  Right.21              QUESTION:  Therefore, your client can go to22 court --23              MR. SELLERS:  Correct.24              QUESTION:  -- and bring a Truth-in-Lending25 Act --46               QUESTION:  Mr. Sellers, that if the Eleventh9    Circuit had taken the D.C. Circuit route, that is, not1              MR. SELLERS:  Correct.2              QUESTION:  -- action, class action and the3    works.456789    enforceable.10111213141516171819202122232425          MR. SELLERS:  That's -- either -- either,Justice Ginsburg, either the D.C. Circuit and Cole'sapproach is acceptable, or the approach I was suggestingto Justice Breyer, which is that the Court convene theparties, say to them, you have to pencil in this costrather than the court doing it, and -- because I'm not --I want to enforce this agreement, and I understand youboth agree to it, but we need to spell out these costs.          So it's either the district court does it as theCole court endorsed at the outset, or, instead, theparties are directed to do it.  But it's always at theoutset, before they're compelled to go to arbitration.          QUESTION:  Now, did you argue that to theEleventh Circuit?          MR. SELLERS:  The specific course?          QUESTION:  Yes.47          MR. SELLERS:  Correct.          QUESTION:  You have indicated that you wouldhave found acceptable the D.C. Circuit solution, which isthe arbitration agreement is preserved, we just read inthe provision that we think is necessary to make it1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. SELLERS:  The --          QUESTION:  You can answer yes or no, can't you?          MR. SELLERS:  No, not in those words, but yes,insofar as we are -- forgive me for -- I feel a need toexplain my answer.          Yes, insofar as we argued to the EleventhCircuit that there -- they had an option that was otherthan simply to invalidate the agreement in its entirety,that the cost had to be established up front.          QUESTION:  And no --          MR. SELLERS:  No, I didn't present the optionsin the way I've just presented to the Court today, but Ithink that it's reasonable to infer that if the districtcourt regarded itself as lacking authority to pencil inanything as the Cole court allowed in the D.C. Circuit.          That's clear, and it is also clear that therewas issue about the cost presented to the district court,and about their being excessive, and the record wasdeveloped.  Whether it was sufficient on the costs in thatcase or not to satisfy the court, I think we may have adifference of opinion, but I think it's fair to say thatthe issue of costs was raised early, and it was raisedseveral times.  It was not a last-minute concern, and itwas raised to the court of appeals in the same fashion.          And if I might add, if I can turn for just a                            48 1    moment to the class action issue, which I understand was 2    not decided by the court of appeals, because it apparently 3    didn't feel it needed to reach the issue, but I think at 4    least I want to make clear that much the same kind of 5    approach we advanced here could be taken with respect to 6    the class action issue. 7              Ms. Randolph has taken the position here that, 8    not that class actions under Truth-in-Lending Act are 9    always exempt from arbitration.  Any time a lawyer styles10    a case as a class action it's exempt from arbitration.11    That is not the position that we've taken here.12              The position is likewise, the agreement was13    silent on class actions.  The district court viewed it as14    silence meant it's excluded.  That's the end of the15    discussion, even though the district court expressed some16    sympathy for Ms. Randolph's concerns about aggregating17    small consumer claims in the absence of that, the parties18    being left with no recourse, and I submit that once again19    the district court could have and should have been able to20    say to the parties, I see also that Ms. Randolph has21    styled this case as a class action.22              I believe that the Truth-in-Lending Act, while23    the language of the statute itself contemplates class24    actions, but more importantly, Congress made it clear,25    echoing the views of the Federal Reserve Board, that there49 1    was great importance attached to the enforcement of the 2    statute through class actions. 3              And the district judge could have said and 4    should have said, I think that the view -- I don't know 5    whether you intend to include class actions here, although 6    Green Tree had already made its position clear by opposing 7    class certification, that it presumably didn't want it and 8    may very well have hoped that it would never see another 9    class action again and these kinds of boiler plate10    agreements.11              But that I'm going to send this to arbitration,12    but I want you to understand that I regard -- the district13    court says this, I regard class action to be an option,14    either left to the arbitrator to determine whether to15    certify the class, or for the district court itself to16    determine whether to certify the class, and then, upon17    review at the end, to satisfy itself that the interests of18    absent class members have been adequately protected.19              I think the district court viewed its role in a20    way that was much too passive for the circumstances of the21    Federal Arbitration Act, but we do not take the position,22    and I want to be very clear about it, that we do not take23    the position that all TILA claims should be exempt from24    arbitration, or even all TILA class actions should be25    exempt from arbitration, nor that the district court was50 1    without recourse to have the parties put in place some 2    assurances about cost, or to actually insert a provision 3    about cost, as the Cole court seems to have contemplated. 4              QUESTION:  Well, why should the district court 5    do that?  I mean, if you're right, why not say, we 6    construe the contract against the drafter, the drafter 7    didn't put it in, so the contract is no good? 8              MR. SELLERS:  Well, certainly Mastrobuono allows 9    for that possibility, this Court's decision in10    Mastrobuono.11              We also recognize, however, that there's a12    strong policy favoring the enforcement of appropriate13    arbitration agreements, and all we are saying here is that14    either there has to be, as the Eleventh Circuit did, a15    conclusion that the agreement is not enforceable, or the16    district courts could have some discretion to ensure that17    the parties put in place at the outset, not at the end of18    the arbitration process, but at the outset, mechanisms to19    ensure that these kinds of protections --20              QUESTION:  The class -- I don't -- the class21    action issue seems harder to get a hold of to me at the22    moment because it's -- seems like a pure State law issue.23    They're interpreting the contract, and they simply24    interpret the contract, perhaps wrongly, so that the class25    action in this case, in this contract, is not excluded51 1    from the arbitration. 2              The other questions, of course, are also State 3    law questions, but they basically are questions of State 4    law that are made Federal because of the policy of the 5    arbitration act, contrary to hostility by the State law. 6              MR. SELLERS:  Justice Breyer, it would be -- 7    might be State law, but the district court treated -- 8    interpreted the question in the context of section 4 of 9    the Federal Arbitration Act.10              QUESTION:  The class action --11              MR. SELLERS:  The class action issue.  It never12    got to the question of whether class certification was13    warranted under State law.  It stopped at the issue of,14    it's silent, therefore I have no discretion to consider15    it, and then expressed some sympathy for the plaintiff's16    view that class action might be appropriate here, but I17    have no authority to interpret this silent -- this18    agreement that was silent on this as permitting class19    actions.20              That, I think, is a view of its role, the21    district court's role that is too passive, given this22    statute.23              Unless there are any further questions, I'll --24              QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Sellers.25              Mr. Phillips, you have 4 minutes remaining.52 1 2 3 4 5 6    enforceability. 7              It was only at the very tail end of Mr. Sellers' 8    remarks that he identifies the fact that there is a 9    national policy favoring arbitration, and I don't think we10    should lose sight of the fact that in this context there11    was a voluntarily entered into arbitration clause that12    ought to be enforced under these circumstances, and there13    are no guarantees, when you go down arbitration as opposed14    to litigation.15              We are in a situation now where we have16    litigated this issue in three different jurisdictions and17    levels of this court.  I don't think anybody going in18    anticipated any of those costs, and certainly no one is in19    a position to give a guarantee that any process of dispute20    resolution is going to be cost-free or have cost21    constraints and, indeed, the plaintiff never asked the22    district court for any of the specifics that counsel has23    identified in the context of this particular case.24              What she said is, plaintiff does not have the25    resources to arbitrate, notwithstanding her agreement.53REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.Unless you have further questions on the jurisdictionalissue, I'm going to focus on the question of1    Therefore, plaintiff's only option is to forego any claims2    against this company.  That is the sum and substance of3    her position with respect to costs, not some kind of more4    restrained action, and that's why the district court5    rejected the notion --6              QUESTION:  What about the notion that she wanted7 to have --8              MR. PHILLIPS:  -- that those costs were9    unconscionable.10111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  -- discovery into what thearbitration proceeding would be, and why couldn't oneassume that that discovery would inevitably involve issuesabout the costs of arbitration?          MR. PHILLIPS:  There's no problem with seekingdiscovery.  The question is, did she --          QUESTION:  But I thought that she was told shecouldn't have discovery in the district court.          MR. PHILLIPS:  It's not in the record in thiscase.  She sought some discovery.  She didn't seekadditional discovery.  Those are reasonable choiceslitigants make every day, and the point is, it's certainlynot appropriate for this Court in a case in which theEleventh Circuit quite clearly handled all of this as amatter of law.          The Chief Justice is absolutely right.  You read                            541    17(a) and 18(a) and it says, presume everything adverse to2    the lender in this case, and only then can you come to the3    conclusion that this arbitration clause should be4    enforced.  That's clearly wrong, as an approach to this5    particular case, and that's the judgment that ought to be6 reversed.7 8 9          The rest of these issues I think legitimatelyought to be considered somewhere down the line.          QUESTION:  Including whether --          MR. PHILLIPS:  But Cole and reasonableness andunconscionability are questions that need to be resolvedin a framework that is fundamentally different from alitigant who throws up her hands and says, I'm not goingto participate in this particular process.          QUESTION:  But you are asking us to reject theD.C. Circuit solution.  That is, in contrast to theEleventh Circuit that said, no arbitration, you can haveyour suit in court, the D.C. Circuit said, you must go toarbitration but we're going to relieve the party resistingarbitration, relieve her of the anxiety of thinking she'sgoing to have to pay costs by telling her that's a term oflaw that we -- not asking the district court to do it, thecourt of appeals saying we write that into the contract.          What is -- you said it was premature.  Is it5510111213141516171819202122232425    wrong? 1              MR. PHILLIPS:  It may be wrong, if we have the 2    right facts.  I think it is a mistake to say categorically 3    that the lender will always pay the fees, regardless of 4    the circumstances in a particular case. 5              Now, you know, if the case came up in the right 6    context, I could well imagine the court might adopt a view 7    like that.  I could also imagine it might adopt the 8    dissenting opinion in Cole and say, no, it still requires 9    more of a case-by-case analysis in order to properly10    balance the interests of both sides, but the clear thing11    you shouldn't do is reject sending this case to12    arbitration on a record where the plaintiff had a full and13    fair opportunity and chose simply to say she's not going14    to play in that particular ball park.                If there are no other questions, thank you, Your1516    Honor.171819202122232425          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you,Mr. Phillips.  The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 12:03 p.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)56
