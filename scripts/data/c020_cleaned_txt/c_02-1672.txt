DELLINGER:  Justice Stevens, and may itplease the Court:          Under the decision below, title IX stands aloneas the only major civil rights statute that would permitretaliation against those who complain that the law isbeing violated.  There are at least a half a dozen anti-discrimination laws that do not contain a separateretaliation provision, and every one of them has beenfound to prohibit retaliation as one kind ofdiscrimination.          There's a reason for that.  Anti-discriminationlaws simply can't be effective if threats of retaliationare allowed to chill those who would seek to bring theirinstitutions into compliance.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Of course, the question iswhether -- that -- that may be true, but there would be anadministrative remedy.  The question here is a privatecause of action for damages.31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. DELLINGER: That is true, Justice Kennedy.2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Even -- even assuming the --3 the validity of your premise, you still have another step.4 MR. DELLINGER: I understand that other step,5 and I think that was largely resolved in Cannon v. the6 City of Chicago, a decision which this Court upheld a7 right of action to enforce title IX, even though there was8 also administrative remedies available and which was9 validated by Congress, as this Court -- every member of10 this Court recognized in -- in Sandoval.11 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought -- I thought12 that Cannon -- we've -- we've allowed Cannon to stay on13 the books, but I thought we have sworn off the kind of14 creation of -- of implied remedies that Cannon15 exemplifies.16 MR. DELLINGER: In this case, there is no doubt17 that the two established principles together that are18 settled support this cause of action. The first is that19 there is a cause of action to enforce title IX. That's20 Cannon through Congress, through Sandoval, through -- your21 opinion in Sandoval acknowledges that Cannon is solid law22 and, the second point, that the statute itself is23 violated.24 Title IX is violated by retaliatory action25 against Coach Jackson. He's -- and -- and this is an41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 important part of title IX because, particularly here,2 people like Coach Jackson need to come forward because3 students are often minors. They're not in the best4 position to know the budgets. It is people like Coach5 Jackson who make it work, and indeed, I think what is6 recognized about the -- about the cause of action for7 retaliation is that it is very important to enable people8 to bring their institutions into compliance without9 resorting 10to litigation.JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's very -- it's very useful,but it -- it could be very disruptive also, I amI were -- if I were a coach, one of the firstespecially a coach of a women's team in high11 I'm sure,12 sure. If13 things --14 school, one of the first things I would do would be to15 complain about not -- not getting enough facilities. This16 would make it a lot more difficult to fire me whether --17 whether I'm a lousy coach or not. You -- you would have18 to think twice before you fire me because I would have a19 retaliation claim.20 MR. DELLINGER: Justice Scalia, the burden, of21 course, is on the plaintiff to demonstrate causation.22 And you should take great comfort from the fact,23 the Court can take great comfort from the fact that24 retaliation has been established as a violation of all of25 the major civil rights statutes, going back to 30 years to51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 title VI --2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Some of them specifically3 provide for retaliation, don't they?4 MR. DELLINGER: That is correct.5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do they do that if, as you6 assert, the mere word discrimination embraces it?7 MR. DELLINGER: Well, Congress has taken a8 different approach. In some cases, there would be a9 textual problem. Title VII, for example, speaks of10 discrimination based on such individual's race or national11 origin. Title -- and -- and therefore, it might need a12 specific retaliation provision. Title IX speaks upon --13 about discrimination on the basis of sex.14 And here I think to -- to allay your concern15 about the coach, we have had -- title IX's retaliation16 provision has been the established law. It was the law at17 the time Congress -- it was understood, at the time18 Congress enacted title IX, that the identical wording of19 title VI had been construed by the administrative agency20 to include a cause of action for retaliation. Congress21 enacted title IX against the background of the Sullivan22 decision, which had recognized that discrimination can23 include retaliation.24 So that it comes as no surprise that every court25 of appeals that has addressed this issue has found that61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 there's retaliation under title IX. In over 30 years,2 there -- at most we can find 140 reported cases in the3 Federal system where there is a claim for retaliation4 under title IX, and under title IX and all of the other5 discrimination provisions, courts have found it perfectly6 satisfactory to work out the causation requirements and --7 in -- in dealing with retaliation cases.8 Now, here, what the respondent did is they9 discharged the coach who was seeking equal treatment for10 girls. When it singled Coach Jackson out for adverse11 treatment, it was discriminating, and when it did so,12 because he was seeking equal treatment for girls, it was13 discriminating on the basis of sex.14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think that it -- it is a15 reasonable description of what happened -- he was fired16 for complaining about his girls' team not getting enough17 facilities -- that he was, on the basis of sex, excluded18 from participation in, denied benefits of, or subjected to19 discrimination under an education program?20 MR. DELLINGER: Absolutely.21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think that -- that22 remotely describes what happened to this coach?23 MR. DELLINGER: Absolutely. First of all, the24 -- the court of appeals correctly says -- in the petition25 appendix at 3a, the court of appeals says we assume for71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 the purposes of this appeal that the board retaliated2 against Jackson for complaining about perceived title IX3 violations. But for the discrimination on the basis of4 sex, he would not have complained, and he not -- had he5 not made a complaint about sex discrimination, he wouldn't6 have lost his position. He is denied the benefit of7 coaching in the program. He's denied the ability to8 participate in this federally funded program as a coach,9 and he is discriminated against by being singled out for10 retaliation.11 And this is not a case in which -- that has12 concern -- I mean, Justice Kennedy raised the question13 about this being a funding case, and I understand the14 special sensitivity that the Court has about rules that15 are based upon spending requirements where you want to be16 sure that States understand what they're agreeing to when17 they accept the Federal funds.18 This is not a case in which it could not have19 been anticipated when those funds were accepted. At that20 time, at the time these funds were accepted, which would21 have been about 1999 or 2000, title IX's ban on sex22 discrimination was itself, of course, universally known.23 Retaliation was understood to be part and parcel of that.24 We had had 30 years where both the Department of Education25 and --81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but that's again thequestion of the substantive scope of the provision, andthat's different from whether there was a congressionalintent to create a private cause of action for this sortof violation.  And was it -- Virginia Bankshares and soforth tells us that this is not the heyday of prior causeof actions anymore.  You have to show that there's acongressional intent in the Spending Clause to create aprivate cause of action for damages.          MR. DELLINGER:  I think the Court --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And that's -- that's quiteseparate from --          MR. DELLINGER:  Yes.  I -- I --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- from this -- from thequestion of substantive liability.          MR. DELLINGER:  I understand that.  Here, firstof all, when Congress acted, unlike the earlier time whenit passed title VI, when Congress passed title IX, it wasa background in the law from Sullivan v. Little HuntingPark that -- that retaliation was considered a part ofdiscrimination.  The title VI regulations were themselveswell known based on identical language, virtually verbatimlanguage.  It provided for retaliation.          And moreover, this Court as recently as theDavis case, Franklin and Davis, and in the North Haven91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 case has found that employment discrimination, sexual2 harassment by teachers and peer-on-peer sexual harassment3 all come within title IX and have, therefore, agreed that4 Cannon v. the City of -- v. the University of Chicago5 creates that cause of action.6 Now, this case is actually a lot easier than7 Davis, even taking into account the concerns that -- that8 you and other Justices expressed there, because this is9 not a case where liability is being imposed, you know, for10 the acts of third parties like students over whom you may11 have limited control. This is deliberately undertaken12 actions by the responsible officials acting intentionally.13 It's not a novel concept the way one could argue that14 peer-on-peer sexual harassment was as a part of15 discrimination. But it's been accepted for more than 3016 years by the responsible Federal agency.17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but it's separate enough18 from discrimination that in other statutes, although19 Congress does create a cause of action for discrimination,20 it goes out of its way to create a separate cause of21 action for retaliation. It's sufficiently separate, and22 if it is that sufficiently separate, it doesn't seem to me23 that you could clearly say that -- that when the State24 signed on to receiving Federal funds under title IX, they25 should have known that this door to litigation was being101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425opened to them.  Yes, litigation for -- for discriminationagainst -- against female athletes, but not -- notdiscrimination suits alleging retaliation.  That's awhole, new area.          MR. DELLINGER:  Justice Scalia, with -- with alldue respect, I don't think there's any way, when thedistrict accepted these funds, that they could havereasonably relied on the assumption that they would befree to retaliate against people who tried to comply --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, but there was -- therewas -- let's go back to this for just a moment -- anadministrative remedy available for retaliation expresslyunder the regs?          MR. DELLINGER:  That is correct.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  And did this petitioner seekan administrative remedy at all?          MR. DELLINGER:  He did not seek anadministrative remedy.  He went throughitself at every level.  He went throughlevels, following the chain of command.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  What wouldremedy have allowed here --the school systemfive differentthe administrativeMR. DELLINGER:  Well --JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  -- had it been sought?MR. DELLINGER:  Here, as in Franklin, as in111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 Davis, as in Cannon v. the University of Chicago, as in2 every one of this Court's title IX cases, indeed, as in3 all of its title VI cases involving Federal funds with4 race, you can call this to attention to the office of5 civil rights of the relevant agency and they can begin an6 inquiry.7 draconian89 sanction?Ultimately they have the authority of thesanction of cutting off the funds to the --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do they have any otherBecause the notion of an administrative remedy 10 ordinarily would be a remedy for the individual who's11 complaining. But as I understand it, this administrative12 process, this detailed administrative process, leads only13 to one sanction, the one you have described as draconian.14 MR. DELLINGER: That is correct.15 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So that's it. It would not16 have permitted a restoration of the job to the --17 MR. DELLINGER: That is correct.18 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- petitioner.19 MR. DELLINGER: That is not part of the -- the20 administrative process is only about institutional21 funding, which is why the Court has consistently upheld22 the right to bring these actions for what are violations23 of the statute itself.24 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if we don't accept --25 let's assume, just for the sake of argument, that -- that121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 we're having trouble accepting the -- the analysis that it2 is a violation of the statute in the statute's own terms.3 You then made the argument that, in fact, you should4 recognize retaliation as a claim because in the context of5 -- of school students and so on, if you don't allow6 retaliation, the teachers are not going to blow the7 whistle, and if the teachers blow the whistle, the statute8 is going to be a dead letter.9 MR. DELLINGER: That is --10 JUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so the -- the argument is11 you -- you should recognize this as a necessity.12 That, it seems to me, still goes back to Justice13 O'Connor's question. Why do we have to recognize a14 private cause of action as opposed to the government15 allowing an administrative remedy? And I thought you were16 leading up to saying the administrative remedy simply17 isn't effective because it's so draconian that, in fact,18 they don't impose it, or for some other reason.19 So my question is, is there an argument to say20 that the administrative remedy simply is not good enough21 to preclude -- to -- to deter retaliation and that's why22 you've got to have a private cause of action?2324 right. 25MR. DELLINGER:  That -- that is absolutelyJUSTICE SOUTER: What's -- what are the facts? 131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425What's the empirical evidence for that?          MR. DELLINGER:  Well --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Do you know if administrativesanctions have been imposed under title IX againstschools?          MR. DELLINGER:  Well, I'm sure there have beensome instances in which there have been administrativesanctions under title IX.  And I don't -- I do not havefigures on those, Justice O'Connor.          But let me --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Have funds --          MR. DELLINGER:  -- let me suggest --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- have funds -- Mr.Dellinger, have funds ever been withdrawn from any schoolbecause of a violation of --          MR. DELLINGER:  Not to my knowledge.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- title IX?          MR. DELLINGER:  But I think --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  That could be because --          MR. DELLINGER:  -- I actually have --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- the sanction is so draconianthat nobody in his right mind is not going to rehire thecoach.  Of course, they're going to rehire.  I -- I findit hard to believe why a draconian sanction isineffective.141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. DELLINGER:  Well, if it's never -- I -- I --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  It seems to me it's -- it'soverwhelmingly effective.  You tell the school you eitherrehire the coach or we're cutting off your money.          MR. DELLINGER:  Justice --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is it hard to decide whatthey're going to do?          MR. DELLINGER:  I do have an answer, first, forJustice Ginsburg's question from Ms. Greensberger.  Thesanction has never been imposed under title IX of cuttingoff funds.  And it --who wouldJUSTICE GINSBURG:  And I can't imagine anyonewant such a sanction.  Which doesn't help --MR. DELLINGER:  That is certainly not what --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- the girls on the team.MR. DELLINGER:  -- Coach -- Coach Jackson wouldhave sought, and -- and because that process is not onethat's responsive to the individual case -- if you're downin Birmingham, Alabama, the idea that there is some officethat has control over Federal funds that's never imposed asanction, the fact of the matter is -- and it's thereason --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, you're saying the coachcares more about it than the Government does?MR. DELLINGER: That may well be the case, 151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 absolutely. And Coach Jackson --2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if -- if the Government3 is charged with -- with just spending the funds and4 doesn't think that this is worth its time, why should5 there be a private cause of action --6 MR. DELLINGER: Because --7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- when -- when a private8 cause of action is harder for us to imply than it -- than9 it is to an administrative remedy?10 MR. DELLINGER: Because in this case people like11 Coach Jackson -- it's hard enough for Coach Jackson to12 come forward. If he's not able to -- if he's not13 protected and able to come forward, if retaliation is14 possible, then you can't expect the -- the teenagers15 themselves to carry this burden.16 And in fact, it's the reason this Court17 recognizes a private cause of action in Franklin and in18 Davis and in Cannon itself, that you're not going to19 protect the whistle blower and they're not going to be20 able to come forward.21 And it's not just whistle blowers, Justice22 Kennedy. It's people that want to make their institutions23 comply and when those efforts at compliance result in24 penalties against them. It has not led to an excessive25 amount of litigation, but it has been very effective in161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 giving people comfort to know that they can't be2 retaliated against.3 And -- and I -- I understand the -- going to the4 necessity, but I do think I'm very comfortable with the5 statute because it is a form of discrimination on the6 basis of sex. It is part and parcel. The history of7 discrimination, on which title VI drew, was that firing8 people from their jobs is what you did when they9 complained about discrimination, when they tried to vote,10 when they tried to enroll their students in schools, and11 it is part and parcel of that discrimination. And it is12 discrimination against Coach Jackson for his actions on13 behalf of 14151617 time. 1819 any light20 sanctions21 and the feasibility of going that route?22 ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L.

DELLINGER:  I'll reserve the balance of myJUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Mr. Gornstein, do you haveto shed on the extent to which administrativehave ever been imposed against schools and --￼1 never been imposed under title IX.2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: They have been under title VI?3 MR. GORNSTEIN: There has been one case in which4 an administrative sanction was imposed under title VI,5 Justice Kennedy.6 It -- the agency does have some flexibility to7 attempt to get voluntary resolutions that are short of the8 sanction, the final sanction, but --9 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you take the position that10 what occurred here can amount to a direct violation of the11 statute as discrimination?12 MR. GORNSTEIN: We do, Justice -- Justice13 O'Connor. I'm sorry. Retaliation against a person14 because that person has complained about sex15 discrimination under title IX is itself discrimination16 within the meaning of title IX. And that conclusion flows17 from four considerations, beginning with the Court's18 decision critically in Sullivan because in that case, the19 Court held that a person subjected to retaliation because20 he complained about racial discrimination against his21 lessee could sue under section 1982's prohibition, which22 only prohibits racial discrimination. Against the23 backdrop of that decision in Sullivan, Congress would have24 understood its prohibition against sex discrimination to25 afford comparable protection against retaliation. So a181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 person who is subjected --2 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Why would Congress then in3 some statutes expressly cover retaliation and in others4 not? I mean, that's a little odd, isn't it?5 MR. GORNSTEIN: It is, Justice O'Connor, but the6 explanation for that for -- in title VII, for example, is7 that the core prohibitions in title VII refer to8 discrimination based on such individual's race, sex, or9 national origin, and that such individual's language rules10 out the kind of retaliation claim we are talking about11 here.12 JUSTICE SCALIA: It rules out this one, but13 it doesn't rule out the main -- look it, this is a weird14 kind of retaliation claim. Usually the retaliation claim15 is the person who has been discriminated against complains16 about the discrimination, and for that complaint, the17 person who was discriminated against is demoted or not18 promoted, or whatever. That's -- that's the classic19 retaliation claim. And that classic claim is surely20 covered by -- on the basis of that person's sex. If --21 MR. GORNSTEIN: If it's based on the fact22 that the -- that the person is complaining about sex23 discrimination and not on the sex of the complainer, it's24 exactly the same theory of discrimination that we have25 here, Justice Scalia. And that theory of discrimination191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425was recognized in the Sullivan decision.  Discriminationoccurs when there is retaliation against a person becausehe's complaining about racial discrimination.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  What was the date of theSullivan case?          MR. GORNSTEIN:  It was 3 years before Congressenacted section -- I think it was '68 -- '69.  I'm sorry.'69.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  '69.          MR. GORNSTEIN:  It was '69, Justice Scalia.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And -- and you think that wetake the same approach to implied causes of action todaythat we took in 1969?          MR. GORNSTEIN:  You do not, Justice Scalia, whenyou are starting afresh, but --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And we certainly did not witha Spending Clause case.          MR. GORNSTEIN:  That's true, Justice Kennedy.          But to answer Justice Scalia's question, first,you operate in the legal context in which Congress wasoperating at the time, and Congress would have understood-- and this Court has twice relied on the Sullivandecision in interpreting title IX, once in deciding thatthere was a private right of action and once in decidingthat the private right of action included a claim for201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 damages.2 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what case it is,3 but one of our cases, the argument was precisely made that4 the statute before us had been enacted by Congress before5 we had set our face against implied causes of action, and6 therefore, we should interpret that statute the way we7 used to in 1969, and we rejected that argument. We said8 that our new rule, as to when you find implied causes of9 action, will be applied to all statutes, whether they were10 enacted by a Congress that -- that thought we would go11 skipping along forever as we did in 1969 or -- or not.12 And -- and that's what you're asking us to do here.13 MR. GORNSTEIN: Justice --14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Just because Congress in -- in15 the -- at the time this statute was enacted believed in16 the existence of a Supreme Court that would readily find17 implied causes of action, we -- we have to do that for all18 these old statutes.19 MR. GORNSTEIN: Let -- let me talk about the20 cases that I think the principle that you're talking about21 emerges from. One is the Central Bank case, and what you22 were asked to do there was to add the words, aiders and23 abetters, to the statute. We're not asking you to add24 words to this statute. We're asking you to interpret the25 words that are there --211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But what about Virginia --MR. GORNSTEIN:  -- in light of the relevantcontext.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What about VirginiaBankshares?          MR. GORNSTEIN:  I'm -- I'm not sure aboutVirginia Bankshares, but I don't think it -- it states aprinciple.          The other case that I was thinking about,Justice Kennedy, is the -- is the Sandoval case.  Andagain, there somebody was asking you to afford a privateright of action for something that the statute did notitself prohibit.  And what we are saying here is,interpret this statute in light of the legal context thatCongress had it, which is --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, it -- it's arguableexcept that Mr. Jackson was not discriminated againstbecause of his gender.          MR. GORNSTEIN:  That's correct.  But thisstatute does not require discrimination because of suchindividual's sex.  It require --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  -- exactly like title VII,but --          MR. GORNSTEIN:  It's -- it's written exactly notlike title VII, Justice O'Connor, and it's written far221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 more like section 1982, which was at issue at Sullivan,2 which doesn't have a such individual's limitation. And in3 -- and section 1982 was interpreted to mean discrimination4 on the basis of race in depriving people of interests of5 property violates that statute and affords a private right6 of action to the victim of retaliation.7 And so too here. And a person who is victimized8 by retaliation because that person has been subjected9 before -- because he complained about sex discrimination10 is a victim of discrimination within the meaning of this11 statute.12 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's where you hang. You13 -- you really think Congress, when it enacted title IX,14 paid close attention and said -- instead of saying no15 person in the United States shall on the basis of that16 person's sex be excluded from participation, you think17 somebody had -- had suggested that language, and they18 said, oh, no, no, no, that would make it too narrow. We19 have to take out that person's. I -- I don't -- it20 doesn't strike me as a -- as an obvious import of not21 including the word that person's sex. It's a very natural22 way to write it: no person in the United States shall on23 the basis of sex.24 MR. GORNSTEIN: But this is -- it opens it up to25 this interpretation, and then you have to look at all the231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 relevant considerations. Inserting the words, such2 individual's, would foreclose that kind of retaliation3 claim, and it's not here. And so it's -- then you have to4 look at all the other relevant considerations, including5 Sullivan, including the fact that this is of vital6 importance to promoting the purposes of the act, including7 the fact that the agencies responsible for enforcing this8 provision have both interpreted -- the key agencies have9 interpreted it to encompass protection against10 retaliation, and including the fact that there's11 absolutely no legitimate interest that a -- a recipient12 has in retaliating against somebody simply because he's13 filed a title IX sex discrimination complaint.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Gornstein, what15 implication would there be, if we took the view of the16 circuit here, for Federal employment? Title VII does have17 a discrete retaliation provision, but it doesn't with18 respect to Federal employees, if I understand.19 MR. GORNSTEIN: That's correct. In -- it -- we20 -- we have taken the position that there is, based on a21 textual argument within the Federal sector provision, a22 basis for finding a retaliation prohibition over and above23 the use of discrimination. We have not taken that24 position with respect to the -- to some other statutes.25 So we do think this is a statute-by-statute analysis and241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that you just can't adopt an automatic principle that2 because there's an anti-discrimination provision, it3 automatically always picks up retaliation protection. You4 have to look at it on a statute-by-statute basis.5 And here, though, all the relevant6 considerations, including Sullivan, including the need for7 this kind of protection to further the purposes of the8 statute, including the agencies' interpretation of this9 statute which, by the way, does provide fair notice that10 this was prohibited, included in -- I think I wanted to11 get back to Justice Kennedy's question about the Spending12 Clause.13 What the Spending Clause does not require is14 that it specifically refer to retaliation any more than it15 required that it specifically refer to peer-on-peer16 harassment. What it does require, though, is fair notice,17 and that fair notice is supplied by the Sullivan decision,18 this Court's cases saying that Sullivan is an important19 backdrop principle against which title IX was enacted, and20 finally the regulations themselves, which specifically21 forbid retaliation.22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are punitive damages available23 under title IX?24 MR. GORNSTEIN: I'm sorry. Punitive damages25 would not be available against a municipality or against a251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 -- but it could be available against some other private2 recipients.3 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Gornstein.4 Mr. Thomas.5 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH L. THOMAS6 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT7 MR. THOMAS: Justice Stevens, may it please the8 Court:9 Justice O'Connor, I would like to respond to the10 question that you raised immediately. I can't think of11 any school board lawyer who is called by his12 superintendent and told that I had a letter from OCR and13 they want to know why you aren't doing this and that who14 would not be in that superintendent's office that moment15 because when OCR comes in, they canvas everything. I16 mean, and as a part of negotiating and their investigative17 teams, they're lay people. They're not lawyers. They18 come in demanding, and what they prepare for compliance, I19 can't even begin to articulate how overreaching it is.20 And so I say I wanted you to --21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How often has OCR come to the22 school district in question under title IX? There are23 many statutes that --24 MR. THOMAS: And I would want to suggest --25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- OCR administers.261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. THOMAS: In 1996, we had a conclusion of an2 OCR title IX investigation because it dealt with boys'3 football as it related to related sports offered for4 girls. So we -- we know about OCR, and they're in5 Atlanta. They are about 167 miles away and when -- and6 when they come, they come, Your Honors.7 If I may, I'd like to get right now to what I8 had raised as the issue here, and that's whether or not an9 implied private right of action under title IX for10 retaliation for petitioner who himself says that he's not11 a victim of discrimination, but merely an advocate. He's12 an advocate of gender equity, and we say no.13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How does he differ -- how14 does he differ from the renter in Sullivan who was15 complaining about the refusal to sell or lease property to16 African Americans? He wanted to lease his property, and17 as a result, he was thrown out of the club. And this18 Court said he could maintain that suit.19 MR. THOMAS: Justice Ginsburg, I offer this one20 observation. Under 1982, there is not a corollary21 administrative remedy. So in the Sullivan situation, the22 only advocate available at that time was the owner of the23 home. And -- but I would comment that as he continued in24 his litigation, he continued to advocate.25 Under title IX, as we have discussed, for the 271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 advocate is the phone call, the toll-free call to OCR and2 express your concerns and your issues about what's3 happening. And we find significance in that because the4 ultimate benefit is for the designated class, which would5 be the basketball team. In a private lawsuit filed by Mr.6 Jackson, the damage award goes directly to him. If he's7 successful in getting injunctive relief, it goes only to8 him. In other words, school board, you can't retaliate or9 you're enjoined from retaliating against him in the10 future, but nothing from that Federal court would go to11 benefit the girls' basketball team.12 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what -- what do you make13 of the -- the point that Mr. Dellinger stressed and others14 have stressed that, in fact, there is no administrative15 remedy in the real world? It's -- it's -- there -- there16 have never -- there has never been an instance in which17 funds have been withheld.18 MR. THOMAS: Well, again, Justice Souter, no,19 the funds have not been terminated. But I can only share20 with you my experiences with dealing with these people.21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you with respect to22 that, is OCR so different from other agencies that have to23 pick and choose because they simply don't have the24 resources to enforce? Now, how often does OCR, in fact,25 go in and investigate? How many times do they say, well,281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that's low priority for us, girls' soccer or girls'2 basketball, and we have bigger fish to fry?3 MR. THOMAS: Justice Ginsburg, the only thing4 that I can say is that on my watch, the number one5 priority is to keep OCR out. So -- so therefore --6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that wasn't my question.7 My question is of the universe of complaints that are made8 under title IX, how many does OCR actually follow up, or9 isn't it strapped for resources so that it can't, however10 much it may want to, come in the way you described?11 MR. THOMAS: Well, Your Honor, that was12 something that was recognized in Cannon. I -- I think13 that was cited in several of the footnotes.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that was the very reason15 for recognizing a private right of action because the --16 the requirement, the anti-discrimination requirement,17 would be a dead letter if you didn't have people who could18 enforce it.19 MR. THOMAS: But -- but again, stay mindful.20 Geraldine Cannon, though, she said, I did not get21 admission to the -- the med school because of my sex, and22 she is clearly within the proviso of no discrimination on23 the basis of sex. So --24 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the -- the argument25 that's being raised is whether we're talking about the291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 person who is listed in the statute as the primary2 beneficiary of the anti-discrimination statute or whether3 we're talking about the teacher who blows the whistle and4 so on -- the -- the argument is unless you allow this5 teacher or this whistle blower to -- to bring the private6 action, your statute is a dead letter, that the -- that if7 -- if -- once you recognize a private action, you've8 either got to recognize this kind of private action or you9 can forget the whole thing. That's the argument, and --10 and so simply to say, well, they're not within the -- the11 primary ambit of benefit of the statute is -- is not to12 the point of the argument.13 MR. THOMAS: Justice Souter, let me offer this14 in two ways. One, it's not realistic. In -- in other15 words, when -- when you have a scenario about the private16 cause of action, teachers aren't -- I mean, these parents17 and -- and the -- and especially in Birmingham, we have an18 athletic director at the school. We have a director of19 athletics for the whole school system. And so that --20 that's not realistic, I mean, because at the end of the21 day, the administration is very conscientious about all of22 its programs.23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's -- to say trust24 me is -- is not an answer. Cannon is one thing, a woman25 in her 30's. A sixth-grader who is told she can't play on301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 a team because there's none for girls is hardly similarly2 situated and the law won't be enforced as to her unless3 you have someone who is best positioned to know what is4 going on, who is the coach.5 MR. THOMAS: But, Justice Ginsburg, we get back6 to the point who really benefits because -- and especially7 in this scenario, if the advocate sues and receives the8 monetary damages, that goes to the advocate.9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the point is if you10 say to the school, you cannot retaliate against someone11 because a12 incentive13 and to do14complaint has been made, that's a powerfulfor the school not to retaliate against someonesomething about the discrimination.MR. THOMAS:  Well, but again, though, Justicethe other side of that would be when under the15 Ginsburg,16 spending legislation, the school board had a right to know17 what the terms and conditions of the financial assistance18 would be, and I respectfully submit to you that there was19 nowhere on the landscape that --20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why wasn't it in the21 regulations of the agency spelled out rather clearly --22 the -- the agency that says, Congress has told us to23 implement this statute, here are our regulations and our24 regulations are you don't retaliate?25 MR. THOMAS: But that's a part of the complaint311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425and investigatory process.          Now, Justice Ginsburg --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  The regulations didn't sayanything about a private cause of action, did it?          MR. THOMAS:  No, it did not.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And the statute didn't sayanything about a private cause of action.          MR. THOMAS:  It's not on the face.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  But the regulation did tellthe school not to retaliate in effect.          Tell me, does the record disclose what happenedto the petitioner, Jackson?  What -- what has been theresult of all this?  Does the record tell us that?          MR. THOMAS:  No, it does not, Justice O'Connor.          And -- and again, it's on a motion to dismiss,and obviously, once it was --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Does it tell us that he wasremoved as coach?          MR. THOMAS:  Yes.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Does the record tell us that?          MR. THOMAS:  It -- it does say that he wasrelieved.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Can I ask you a legal question,nothing to do          MR.with, you know, practicalities?THOMAS:  Yes.32 Washington, DC 20005 1-1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: But suppose you go back to the2 very old, bad days of the 1950's in the South, the '60's.3 They pass some civil rights legislation. A lot of4 legislation was passed in the '60's. Now, under that5 civil rights legislation, imagine an individual had been6 kept out of a restaurant or he'd been treated physically7 badly, not because of his race. He was white, but he was8 associating with people who were black. And they both go9 into the restaurant and they both are refused service.10 Maybe they're beaten up. I mean, both of them.11 Now, can the white individual bring a lawsuit12 under the -- the civil rights statute? I've always13 thought the answer to that question is, of course, he can.14 Would you 151617-- do you think it's the contrary answer?MR. THOMAS:  Justice Breyer, in that context --JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.MR. THOMAS:  -- I -- I would sayJUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, of course.MR. THOMAS:  But again --JUSTICE BREYER:  So therefore --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is this a civil18 19 20 2122 that provides for a private cause of action? I -- I want23 to know what the hypothetical is.24 JUSTICE BREYER: I'd -- I'd like to -- I'm25 thinking of various civil rights statutes which make it331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-yes.rights statute￼1 unlawful to describe -- to -- to discriminate. And now, I2 agree with you on that answer. The white person could3 bring a lawsuit on the basis of someone else's race4 because he's being discriminated against not because of5 his own race, but because he's being -- he's associated6 with people who are being discriminated against. I agree7 with your answer.8 And so my question is if that's so and if we9 have a long history here of the words, on the basis of10 sex, including retaliation not on the basis of my sex, but11 retaliation on the basis of someone else's sex -- that's12 what I've complained of -- why isn't this the same thing13 And to get out my whole question -- there are14 two parts -- why isn't this the same thing? And the15 second part is, because I think it is the same thing --16 the second part is once it is included in 1981 -- in -- is17 it 1681(a)?18 MR. THOMAS: Yes.19 JUSTICE BREYER: Once we include this in20 1681(a), that's the end of this case because Sandoval then21 supports the other side. It doesn't support you. All22 right. That's my question.23 MR. THOMAS: Justice Breyer, don't we have to24 consider at some point in time what the congressional25 intent was?341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, yes.2 MR. THOMAS: And again -- and I submit to you --3 JUSTICE BREYER: So you -- you go ahead. I'm4 doing it purely as a matter of logic. I'm saying the old5 civil rights cases make clear it doesn't have to be on the6 basis of your own race. History makes clear that7 retaliation on the basis of someone else's race does fit8 within -- or gender does fit within 1681, and then that's9 the end of the case. So I would like your response to10 that logic.11 MR. THOMAS: And I would want to submit to you12 interveningly you have had the passing of the Voting13 Rights Act of 1965. So everybody now has access to14 Congress.15 Congress.16 it passes17 different18 The whole spectrum of American society is in So if Congress is being well represented, whenthe law in 1972, as it did here, it had aperspective on it.Going back to 1969, some things were foreclosed19 to some of the citizens of the United States. So,20 obviously, the scenario of someone advocating, like in21 Sullivan, would make sense. But I submit to you22 respectfully, that's not the case now. Over there in23 Congress is where this debate needs to be, and on the face24 of this statute, it's not there. Retaliation is not25 there.351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          If I may, though, Justice Breyer, let me alsoadd as a practical consideration --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Of course, you say it's notthere, but the agencies interpreting the statute thoughtit was there.  Isn't that correct?          MR. THOMAS:  But -- but that's an -- aninvestigatory -- the administrative enforcement scenario.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it's the --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  No, but their reading of thestatute was that the word discrimination included aretaliation claim.  That's the kind of regulations theydrafted on the basis of their understanding of whatCongress intended by using the word -- the words in thisstatute.          MR. THOMAS:  But don't we go -- Justice Stevens,don't we go back to Sandoval?  Can you in a regulation domore than what the statute requires?          JUSTICE STEVENS:  You cannot use the regulationthat goes beyond the meaning of the statute.  That's whatthat holds.  But a regulation interpreting what thestatute itself provides is in a different ball park.  Andthat's what I understand these regulations to have done,to say what the agencies thought the statute itself meant.          MR. THOMAS:  But -- but again, that'sretaliation after someone has filed a complaint with the361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 appropriate office.2 JUSTICE BREYER: Well -- I mean, Sandoval is3 very clear. It's a very clear opinion in my view. Very4 clear. And the key language I thought is, the language5 statutes that focus on the person regulated rather than6 individuals protected create no implication of an intent7 to confer the private right. So they're looking at8 disparate impact and disparate impact, according to the9 majority -- I was in the dissent -- did not intend to10 protect the person discriminated against, but was a way of11 regulating people so they wouldn't intentionally12 discriminate. I can understand that. But I apply the13 same -- I didn't agree with it, but I can understand it.14 The -- the -- I apply the same reasoning here.15 The reasoning here is that this retaliation thing is not16 trying to protect university behavior one whit more than17 the whole underlying thing is trying to protect university18 behavior. This is about victims. Retaliation and being19 fired is about victims. And so given Sandoval, then we20 have the history, we have the language, and we have that21 sentence from Sandoval. And all that suggests -- it goes22 into 1681(a), in which case Sandoval says, a private right23 of action, given Cannon, would be inferred.24 Now, what's -- what's -- that's how -- I'm25 tracing out the logic of the thing. So I want to see what371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425you say.          MR. THOMAS:  Well, Justice Breyer, on the faceof the statute, I just can't get there.  I apologize forthat, respectfully, but -- but I can't.          And Justice O'Connor, as a follow-up,interestingly enough, in a case on all fours in 1995, Holtv. Lewis, the United States District Dourt for theNorthern District of Birmingham -- for the NorthernDistrict of Alabama made very clear that an impliedprivate right of action was not cognizable under title IX,and that the regulation was not a basis to follow it.  And-- and I submit to you on that basis, that in Birmingham,at very least, because the case was affirmed by theEleventh Circuit and this Court denied cert in 1997, soanyone who would go --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  We -- we can't -- you don'tbase your argument on giving some legal effect to denialof certiorari --          MR. THOMAS:  No, no, I don't, Justice O'Connor.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Thank you.          MR. THOMAS:  But -- but to say -- I was tryingto emphasize was the notice and the mind set of the boardwhen it accepted these Federal funds.  It had no way ofanticipating that retaliation --JUSTICE STEVENS: It had never anticipated a 381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425private right of action, even though it read the Cannonopinion, which was written some 20 years ago?  Maybe morethan that.  I don't remember.          MR. THOMAS:  Justice Cannon, your opinion thereis going to be around for a long time.  The scholars aregoing to have to debate it for years.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  There were some later casesthat cast a good deal of doubt on whether we would applyCannon anymore.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But Congress itself hasadopted the rule set forth in Cannon.          MR. THOMAS:  But -- but if I may, but thenJustice Rehnquist cautioned very clearly that the Court --in his concurring opinion, that the Court in the futureshould be extremely reluctant to imply a cause of actionabsent such specificity on the part of the legislativebranch.  And that just speaks volumes to me.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It said in this statute wedo, having in mind that title VI would be interpreted inthe identical way --          MR. THOMAS:  Yes, ma'am.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- title VII -- VIproscribing race discrimination in all Federal programs.So it said these statutes aimed at race discrimination,sex discrimination do have a -- a private right of action,391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425and that was the holding of          MR. THOMAS:  Yes,again, it goes -- goes backretaliation?  And -- and --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:this Court.ma'am.  Well, but -- butto -- but would that include                             Well, it seems to me that ifyou're talking about the sixth grade soccer team,realistically the only one who is going to know anything-- enough and be brave enough to complain will be theteacher.  And if you cut the teacher out, then forget it.You have nice words on paper and they'll never beenforced.          MR. THOMAS:  But, Justice Ginsburg, that teachercould easily, if they don't get a positive response fromthe administration, they can call OCR.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And OCR says, as it usuallydoes, we're too busy.

NEWSOM                   ON BEHALF OF ALABAMA,          AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT          MR. NEWSOM:  Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may          the Court:          I'd like to address, if I may, several concerns          been raised during the -- the preceding          One is to clarify some things about the scope ofthe administrative remedy.  The other side, with respect,wants you to think that without the implied right ofaction for damages and fees, whistle blowers are left outin the cold.  That is not true.  The administrative remedy-- it's not just about funding termination.  34 C.F.R.106.3 says that the OCR may use any remedy that it deemsnecessary.  The OCR, as we say in our brief, has itself42it pleasethat havearguments.1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 touted its flexible approach to enforcement which2 includes, among other things, as this Court noted in3 Gebser, citing back to its earlier -- pardon me --4 decision in North Haven, individualized relief in5 appropriate circumstances. So the point, as Senator Bayh6 himself noted on the floor of the Senate, is that it is7 the threat of -- of funding termination. So while the OCR8 is wielding the club of funding termination, they can9 extract or leverage individualized relief in appropriate10 cases.11 JUSTICE SOUTER: Do we -- do we have any -- any12 empirical evidence as to -- as to what they have thus13 leveraged?14 MR. NEWSOM: None that I am aware of, Your --15 Your Honor, but --16 JUSTICE SOUTER: The -- the other side says,17 look, dead letter. What do18 there may be in the letter?19 MR. NEWSOM: Well20 perhaps foolishly, defer to21 to tell you what -- what the DOJ has and hasn't done.22 What I can tell you is that -- that the DOJ manual that23 the other side cites throughout its briefs expressly24 encourages agencies, when enforcing these -- these things,25 to leverage even damage awards on behalf of individual431111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-we know about such life as-- well, I will, I assume,the Solicitor General's office￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425claimants.  So I can tell you that, as a matter of policy,this is far from a dead letter.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- you don't concede thepoint that it is the role of this Court to determinewhether agencies are inefficient or not --          MR. NEWSOM:  Of course not.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- and if they are inefficientto -- to raise up private attorneys general to -- to fillthe void?          MR. NEWSOM:  Of course not, Justice Scalia, and-- and the Court knows very well from my brief that ourposition is that when you're talking about implied rightsof action, this Court has made clear, in the cases leadingup to Sandoval, culminating in Sandoval, that these sortsof policyrelevant,-- do youconsiderations really are not relevant.JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  If they're notdo you think that the regulation which providesthink it's unlawful?MR. NEWSOM:  We do not contest the validity ofthe regulation.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  If you don't contest thevalidity of it and you think it's lawful, do you thinkit's doing something other than interpreting 1681(a)?          MR. NEWSOM:  Absolutely, Your Honor.          JUSTICE BREYER:  What -- what is it doing?441111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. NEWSOM: It -- section 100.7(e), the2 regulation upon which Jackson chiefly relies, we readily3 concede is a valid, effectuating 902 regulation, but all4 -- all it does by its text -- and its structure makes5 clear all it does -- is to govern the internal processes6 of official OCR investigations. It does not go further7 than that.8 This Court in Sandoval was very clear that it9 was -- that it was only authoritative interpretations of a10 statute's11 statute's1213 administrative remedy. Justice Ginsburg asked whether14 funds had ever been withdrawn, and even there, again, if15 the answer is no, the point is not whether funds have been16 withdrawn, but that as Senator Bayh himself noted, that17 the threat of funds is where the heavy lifting is done in18 administrative enforcement.19 Another point about administrative enforcement20 is whether or not there are sufficient resources. That,21 obviously, was a valid concern in Cannon, given presumably22 the inordinate number of complaints about core,23 traditional discrimination. But as the other side has24 made clear in its briefing in this case, at page 26 of the25 petitioner's brief -- and then there's a brief filed on451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-terms that can be enforced pursuant to thatimplied right of action.Another point I want to make about the￼1 behalf of the Southern Poverty Law Center that spins this2 out in some detail -- there just aren't many of these3 retaliation claims out there, either in the -- either --4 either in 567the judicial system or at OCR.JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Why is that, do you think?MR. NEWSOM:  Well, my -- I'm sorry.JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Is it because no remedy is8 available, or is it because there are just very few9 instances giving rise to such?10 MR. NEWSOM: Well, I think in all likelihood, it11 is the latter. Certainly I would think that the Court12 would presume -- would not presume ill of local school13 districts and -- and even State universities, but would14 presume that they are complying with, if not clearly15 articulated law, certainly good public policy.16 The second point is that what the -- the absence17 of private actions for retaliation shows is that title18 IX's remedial apparatus is kicking along just fine without19 the implied right of action.20 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do we decide this case on the21 assumption that there was retaliation here by virtue of a22 complaint of violation of title IX?23 MR. NEWSOM: Certainly, Your Honor --24 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: We should decide it on that25 assumption?461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. NEWSOM: You have to take as true, of2 course, the facts as pledged in the -- as pleaded in the3 complaint.4 Another point I'd like to make briefly is about5 the comparison to title VII. The other side wants you to6 look very closely at title VII when you're -- whether it's7 on the basis of sex or on the basis of such individual's8 sex, but they want you to ignore title VII and the fact9 that it very clearly and expressly deals with retaliation10 in a separate subsection, a separate provision. And I11 didn't -- I'll have to confess I didn't hear much during12 the first argument. I had my head in my own book, but13 what I did hear is Justice Souter referring to the -- the14 -- an instance in which Congress has a choice of two15 models for -- for constructing a statute, and it chooses16 one over the other, and isn't it a reasonable inference to17 allow Congress to make that choice. That's what happened18 here.19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Like the choice it made in20 1982, very spare statute. When Congress got to title IX,21 it knew about Sullivan and so it -- this -- this statute22 in its breadth and its simplicity bears a striking23 resemblance to the old pattern in 1981 and 1982 and 1983.24 So if you say to me, look at the closest model, it would25 be that and not the more detailed civil rights legislation471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that came in '64 and '65.2 MR. NEWSOM: Well, if -- if I could answer in3 two parts. First, to say that I think what was going on4 in 1964 in the Civil Rights Act, obviously, you have5 Congress in title VII addressing itself both to6 discrimination and to retaliation separately; in title VI,7 passed as part of the same piece of legislation,8 addressing itself solely to discrimination. And to use9 Justice Souter's analogy, in '72 Congress takes the title10 VI model and not the title VII model.11 Now, to get to your question specifically, I12 think, about Sullivan is at the heart of your question,13 Sullivan -- I think there are a number of problems with14 the other side's reliance on Sullivan. First, with all15 due respect to this Court, Sullivan itself is pretty16 opaque. It certainly does not announce with flashing17 lights a principle that every anti-discrimination18 provision necessarily entails a subsidiary or corollary --19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It says if you're thrown out20 of the club because you champion the rights of a black21 man, you have a right to sue under this statute.22 MR. NEWSOM: Even if I were to grant your23 assumption of clarity in Sullivan, which Justice Harlan, I24 presume, would not agree with -- he was left sort of25 scratching his head trying to figure out what the Court481111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 was trying to do. But even granting your assumption, if2 1982 can be construed that way, that -- that construction3 does not necessarily carry over to every anti-4 discrimination provision. 1982, of course, uses different5 language to begin with and, more importantly, is -- is6 passed under Congress's power under the Thirteenth7 Amendment, which is the broadest conceivable --8 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but it did construe the9 word discrimination, didn't it?10 MR. NEWSOM: No, sir. Discrimination is not11 even in -- is not even in title -- rather, in 1982. So12 the language is very different --13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: On account of race is in it.14 Right?15 MR. NEWSOM: I'll have to confess I don't -- it16 does say something like every person shall have the same17 right as -- dot, dot, dot, as white persons. But so the18 -- the language frankly is pretty different, and the more19 fundamental point I'm trying to make is that even if20 that's true for -- for that statute passed under that21 constitutional power, here we are talking, as Justice22 Kennedy made clear at the very outset of the argument23 about a Spending Clause statute, where it is required that24 conditions on25 and it is not1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400the acceptance of Federal funds be express,clear to me where the Birmingham Board would49 Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 have gotten its clear notice in this case. If you can2 imagine --3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It seems to me they would get4 it when Congress says, and here's the statute, very spare,5 and agency, you get up guidelines, that any responsible6 school board would say, well, we've got only one sentence7 in the statute. We better look at the regulations to find8 out what's required.9 MR. NEWSOM: I agree, and -- and if -- and if10 the Birmingham Board, which I trust it did, looked to the11 regulation here, what it would have found is a regulation12 not that clarifies the substantive scope of title IX, but13 instead that -- that manages the internal operating14 procedures for official agency investigations. So to be15 sure, the Birmingham Board was on notice that it could not16 retaliate in -- in the business of an official OCR17 investigation, and if it did, it would be subject to18 administrative enforcement, but it was -- it was not on19 notice either of the fact that there was a generic anti-20 retaliation prohibition, much less the fact that if it21 violated any such nonexistent --22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's -- we're not talking23 about the procedure, I mean, what procedural moves. What24 must you do to comply? And it has in there you don't25 retaliate. So you mean that a board could responsibly501111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425take the position, well, the -- the regulations tell us wedon't retaliate, but when we're not faced with any agencybreathing down our neck, all we have is a teacher in frontof us, then we can retaliate?  I mean, they must haveknown the statute meant don't retaliate.          MR. NEWSOM:  And -- and with respect, I thinkthere is a difference, particularly given the clear noticerequirements that this Court has -- has used in SpendingClause cases between retaliation in the context of an OCRinvestigation and retaliation generally, but -- I'm sorry.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I -- I really don't get that.If the rule is don't retaliate and if we investigate,that's one of the things we're going -- that's going to beon our checklist.  But the substantive rule is don'tretaliate.          MR. NEWSOM:  Justice Stevens, may I respond?          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes.          MR. NEWSOM:  Even granting your assumption,Justice Ginsburg, what is painfully not clear is that the-- is that the Birmingham Board would be subject to -- toa private right of action for damages and fees even in --in the event that there were some generally applicableanti-retaliation provision.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Mr. Newsom.          MR. NEWSOM:  Thank you, Justice Stevens.511111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Dellinger, you have about3 and a half minutes.           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. DELLINGER:  I should make it clear thatwe're not asking this Court to create or infer a new causeof action.  We're asking the Court to interpret the causeof action that the Court itself recognized in Cannon v.the University of Chicago, that was validated by Congress.It was reaffirmed in the Court's opinion in Sandoval.  Andwhen you look at the scope of that -- of that prohibition,that cause of action, why would it not extend toretaliation?  The idea that you --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Other statutes do itseparately.          MR. DELLINGER:  I understand.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Other statutes don't view theone as -- as being incorporated in the other.          MR. DELLINGER:  The practice of Congress has notbeen consistent on incorporating express provisionssometimes because of language differences, but there arehalf a dozen major statutes that the courts of appeal haveconsistently assumed included retaliation as part ofdiscrimination.  Section 1981, section 1982, title VI,1982 as determined by this Court, parts of the521111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 Rehabilitation Act have all been construed that way.2 And why would they not? The notion that you3 have to admit Geraldine Cannon to the University of4 Chicago Medical School, you can't discriminate against her5 on the basis of sex, but then you could turn around and6 expel her for complaining about your admissions policy7 makes no sense.8 In this case, relying upon the vagaries of what9 any administration might do about enforcement is not10 necessarily what Congress wanted, and that was this11 Court's decision in Cannon. And it's reaffirmed it12 frankly --13 JUSTICE SCALIA: There are no vagaries in14 private enforcement. Private attorneys general always act15 in the interest of the whole polity. There are no16 vagaries there.17 MR. DELLINGER: Well, in this case, it has been18 known to effectuate anti-discrimination laws in order to19 bring them about by allowing people to step forward. The20 last point they make is that even if there's a cause of21 action, and even if the cause of action covers22 retaliation, it cannot be brought by Coach Jackson because23 he's not also the victim of the underlying discrimination.24 That makes no sense in law or in logic.25 If the captain of the boys' basketball team531111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 joins with the captain of the girls' basketball team in a2 supportive way to say, they're just not treating girls'3 basketball equally and fairly, and they're both suspended4 from their teams or dropped from the honor society in5 retaliation, it makes no sense. Either they both have --6 they've both been discriminated against on the basis of7 sex because they're trying to rectify sex discrimination8 or neither is.9 And in this case, it's going to be critically10 important that this valuable statute, which has meant so11 much for athletic and academic opportunities for women, to12 have people like Coach Jackson able to be confident that13 they've got a right that they can enforce that will allow14 them to come forward within the school itself and try to15 rectify these anomalies in and under title IX.16 Thank you.17 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Dellinger.18 The case is submitted.19 (Whereupon, at 11:51 a.m., the case in the20 above-entitled matter was submitted.)21 22 23 24 251111 14th Street, NW Suite 40054 1-Washington, DC 20005
