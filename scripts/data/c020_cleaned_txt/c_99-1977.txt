Saucier against Katz.          Mr. Clement.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          Qualified immunity has an important role to playin Fourth Amendment unreasonable force cases just as itdoes in Fourth Amendment unreasonable search cases and inother constitutional contexts.  The decision beloweffectively merged the qualified immunity and FourthAmendment tests in the case of unreasonable force cases.The court reasoned that because both tests are framed interms of objective reasonableness, the qualified immunitytest had nothing to add to the underlying Fourth Amendmenttest.  This Court rejected a virtually indistinguishableline of reasoning in Anderson against Creighton and withgood reason.          The Fourth Amendment and qualified immunitytests are distinct and serve different purposes.  TheFourth Amendment test governs primary conduct.  It looksat the force used and asks whether that force was3                                                                                             1    reasonable.  The qualified immunity test by contrast looks 2    at the preexisting law and asks whether that preexisting 3    law would have put a reasonable officer on notice that his 4    or her conduct was unlawful.  Qualified immunity thus 5    recognizes that even competent officers will make 6    reasonable mistakes and government officials should not be 7    held personally liable when they make reasonable judgment 8    calls just because their judgment turns out to be9 mistaken.10              QUESTION:  Could you tell me how the test works?11    I take it qualified immunity is presented initially to the12    trial judge as a basis for dismissing and then if he13    rules, is the jury also instructed about qualified14 immunity?15              MR. CLEMENT:  Well in many cases, once the case16    is -- the issue of qualified immunity is brought before17    the judge, the judge can rule on whether there's a18    qualified immunity protection in the case and there'll be19    no issue that needs to go to the jury in that case.20              QUESTION:  Now suppose he overrules the21    qualified immunity defense, does the jury then determine22    both qualified immunity and, in this case, whether or not23    the force was reasonable?24              MR. CLEMENT:  It would depend on the25    circumstances of the case.  In some cases, the judge may4                                                                                                                                 1    want to try to isolate the factual issues that are at 2    stake in the qualified immunity context and just have the 3    jury focusing on those factual situations. 4              QUESTION:  In other words, a bifurcated trial. 5              MR. CLEMENT:  Well that may actually end up 6    being the only issue that jury really needs to focus on. 7    If I could give you an example, in a recent Tenth Circuit 8    case called Cruz against City of Laramie, the Tenth 9    Circuit decided that the use of a hog-tie restraint was10    unreasonable when used with an individual who exhibited11    signs of diminished capacity.  In that same opinion, they12    reserved the question about whether that restraint was13    unreasonable when used on an individual who did not14    exhibit signs of diminished capacity.15              QUESTION:  I mean the reason I'm asking is that,16    if the jury hears both questions, I want to know what the17    instructions sound like, and whether or not the jury can18    make this distinction.19              MR. CLEMENT:  In many cases, I think the jury20    will not really, if there's no liability -- I'm sorry, if21    there's no issue about injunctive relief, it may just be a22    situation where the court can simply decide what the23    clearly-established law is and instruct the jury on that24    clearly-established law and then the jury can make its25    determination.5                                                                                                                                 1              To pick up the example from the Tenth Circuit 2    case, if in a subsequent decision, the Tenth Circuit 3    extended its rule and applied the rule to all individuals, 4    saying the hog-tie restraint is never reasonable, I think 5    because the court had previously expressly reserved the 6    question of whether the hog-tie restraint was reasonable 7    when applied to an individual who did not exhibit signs of 8    diminished capacity.  In that case, the issue for the jury 9    would be whether or not the individual who was arrested10    exhibited signs of diminished capacity and that would11    really be the only issue the jury needed to decide because12    if the individual had exhibited signs of diminished13    capacity, under the court's prior decision in Cruz, that14    -- that conduct would be not only unlawful but clearly15    established.16              On the other hand, if the jury decided that the17    individual had not exhibited signs of diminished capacity,18    then in that instance, although the conduct was unlawful,19    by virtue of this hypothetical second decision, the20    conduct would not be clearly established and there'd be no21    liability in that situation.22              QUESTION:  So you're saying the only situation23    in which the two increase in effect will be exactly the24    same, is the situation in which the general standard has,25    by course of judicial decision, been reduced down to a6                                                                                                                                 1    kind of pinpoint specific rule for certain cases, e.g., 2    hog-tie cases.  And in the case in which immunity is 3    claimed, the facts in that case are precisely duplicative 4    of the facts, which have been found to result in this 5    pinpoint rule.  That's the only I case, I take it on your 6    view, in which the two increase will, in effect, reach 7    precisely the same result necessarily. 8              MR. CLEMENT:  I disagree.  I think that in 9    Anderson against Creighton itself, this Court noted that10    there's not a requirement that the previous case law be on11 all four --12              QUESTION:  Oh, I'm not saying that there is a13    requirement, but I'm saying that, if in fact the previous14    case law has got to the pinpoint stage and the facts15    claimed by way of defense precisely fall within that16    pinpoint, then the two increase will not be different, but17    that's the only case I take in which that will be true on18 your view.19              MR. CLEMENT:  I'm not sure if that's the only20    case where that's going to be true.  I think there other21    cases where the preexisting law, although not showing the22    way with pinpoint accuracy, it still provides the officers23    with sufficiently clear notice that there's no real rule24    for qualified immunity in those particular cases.25              QUESTION:  Mr. Clement, it might help if you7                                                                                                                                 1    gave us, what would be the -- suppose the judge thinks, I 2    don't want to decide the qualified immunity myself because 3    I think there's some fact questions involved about what 4    happened here.  So let's take this very case and the judge 5    wants to charge the jury so they'll understand the 6    difference between excessive force that violates the 7    Fourth Amendment and qualified immunity.  How would the 8    judge charge in this very case? 9              MR. CLEMENT:  I think the judge in this case10    would charge by using the language from this Court's11    previous qualified immunity opinions, language from cases12    like Malley and Hunter against Bryant and would charge the13    jury with finding -- in order to find liability in this14    case, the jury would have to find that the individual15    officer exhibited -- either was plainly incompetent or16    exercised judgment that was outside the range of17    professional judgment.  I'm not sure it would really be18    necessary in a case where the only issue is liability to19    really direct the court's attention a great deal to the20    liability standard because that issue's going to21    effectively drop out of the case.22              To be sure, the jury may need to be instructed23    on what the relevant law of excessive force is, but once24    that instruction is put in place as sort a background25    instruction then the real question that the jury needs to8                                                                                                                                 1    focus on is the question of whether or not the officer's 2    conduct was so unreasonable that it put it outside the 3    range of professional -- 4              QUESTION:  But the whole thing is going to be 5    submitted to the jury at one time I take it in a series of 6    instruction.  Now you say, ordinarily the -- something 7    will drop out of the liability phase, but I didn't quite 8    follow that. 9              MR. CLEMENT:  All I meant by that is that since10    there will be no liability imposed in the ordinary case11    without a finding that the officer's not entitled to12    qualified immunity, it'll be the qualified immunity13    question that will really be the ultimate focus of the14    jury's attention because that'll determine whether or not15    they find sufficient cause to award damages.16              QUESTION:  But if -- then the jury, if a jury17    decides that there is not qualified immunity then they18    have to go further, do they not?19              MR. CLEMENT:  I don't believe so.  No, I'm sorry20    you're right.  If they do find that there's not qualified21    immunity because the conduct was clearly established.  I22    don't know that they really need to go further because23    that perforce will already incorporate the underlying24    Fourth Amendment test.25              QUESTION:  But that is what Justice Ginsburg was9                                                                                                                                 1    asking and what I was asking.  I'm not sure how the jury 2    distinguishes between these two tests and you seem to be 3    telling us they don't have to and that seems to be 4    inconsistent with your position that there are two tests. 5              MR. CLEMENT:  No, all I'm saying is that in the 6    ordinary case -- 7              QUESTION:  That's the trouble I'm having and I 8    think was at the root of Justice Ginsburg's question as9 well.10              MR. CLEMENT:  I'm sorry.  I think -- perhaps my11    focusing on the cases that go to the jury, we're obscuring12    the fact that the real virtue of qualified immunity is in13    many of these cases, even under the plaintiff's versions14    of events, the conduct will not be so clearly15    unconstitutional by virtue of higher precedent that the16    court can just end there.17              And after all, as this Court emphasized in18    Harlow against Fitzgerald and subsequent cases, the19    qualified immunity is not just an immunity from liability,20    but it protects the officers from the chilling effect of21    the inconvenience of having to stand trial in those22    situations where prior decisions have not clearly marked23    the individual's conduct as being unlawful.24              QUESTION:  Mr. Clement, in those situations25    where there are factual controversies, both questions will10                                                                                                                                 1    have to be submitted to the jury, won't they?  I mean 2    let's say in the present case, if there's a dispute as to 3    whether more force was used than was necessary, the jury 4    would have to determine whether more force was used than 5    was necessary.  And then the jury would also be asked, if 6    that is the case, was that use of excessive force so 7    obvious?  Would it have been so obvious to a reasonable 8    officer that this officer does not enjoy the qualified 9    immunity that our cases provide?  Wouldn't both questions10    have to go the jury?11              MR. CLEMENT:  I think both questions certainly12    could go to the jury.  It just seems to me that the second13    question actually entails the answer to the first.  So if14    the jury's instructed and finds that the officer's conduct15    was so excessive as to put it outside the range of the16    conduct of a reasonable officer under the circumstances it17    would necessarily entail a finding in liability.18              And because by hypothesis I'm talking about a19    case where all the individual plaintiff seeks is monetary20    damages, the court may well have a forum that asks the21    court -- the jury to find the liability -- I'm sorry, the22    constitutional issue.23              QUESTION:  I see what you mean.  You really24    don't have to determine the question of whether it25    violated the Fourth Amendment so long as you determine11                                                                                                                                 1    that, even it did, this didn't go beyond what a reasonable 2    officer might have thought was okay. 3              MR. CLEMENT:  That's right.  Nothing will turn 4    on the underlying constitutional issue because it's -- 5              QUESTION:  Justice Scalia may see what you mean, 6    but I'm not sure I do.  Tell me how the judge charges the 7    jury with respect -- does he tell the jury, first go to 8    qualified immunity or first go to constitutional9 violation?10              MR. CLEMENT:  I guess what I'm envisioning is11    that the jury would first be instructed on what the law is12    of excessive force based largely on this Court's decision13    in Graham against Connor.  Then at the end of the14    instructions, the Court would focus in on what it is the15    jury needs to find in order to find liability and impose16    liability on the officer.17              QUESTION:  Can you give my just a quick sample18    instruction rather than this kind of theoretical19    description?20              MR. CLEMENT:  Sure.  I think the instruction, I21    mean the instruction that the Government typically uses in22    these cases or typically offers in these cases, is based23    on this Court's decision in Malley and Hunter against24    Bryant and it asks the jury whether or not the officer's25    conduct was such that it was plainly incompetent under the12                                                                                                                                1    circumstances and the use of force was outside the range2    of professional and competent judgment.  And then the jury3    -- that's the question that jury ultimately focuses on. 4 5    question? 6 7    question because that's what makes the difference between 8    whether the jury in a specific case imposes damages or 9    doesn't impose damages.10              QUESTION:  Tell me then, what is the difference11    between the Fourth Amendment question and the qualified12    immunity question?13              MR. CLEMENT:  The difference is -- well there's14    a couple of ways of expressing it, one way to express it15    is that the Fourth Amendment test looks only at the16    conduct and asks whether the force used was unreasonable.17    The qualified immunity test takes a broader look at what18    the preexisting law was and asks whether the officer was19    on notice that his or conduct violated clearly-established20 law.21 22 23 24 25          Another way of looking at is that the questionin the first case is simply, looking at what the officerdid, was what the officer did reasonable?          QUESTION:  Let me ask, in the context of thisvery case, the officer sought summary judgment on the13                                                                                            QUESTION:  And that's the Fourth AmendmentMR. CLEMENT:  No, that's the qualified immunity 1    qualified immunity issue.  Right? 2              MR. CLEMENT:  That's correct. 3              QUESTION:  Before it had ever gone to trial, to4 a jury? 5              MR. CLEMENT:  That's correct. 6              QUESTION:  And the Court denied it. 7              MR. CLEMENT:  That's also correct. 8              QUESTION:  So in this case, then did that 9    question go to the jury, the qualified immunity issue?10              MR. CLEMENT:  No, I mean -- and I think that11    raises two important points.  First of all, this issue of12    what issue goes to the jury and how does the underlying13    Fourth Amendment issue interact with the qualified14    immunity instruction is not unique to the context of15    excessive force claims.  The same issues are raised by the16    probable cause and exigent circumstances issues --                QUESTION:  But, just tell me, what went to the                MR. CLEMENT:  Nothing.                QUESTION:  In this case?                MR. CLEMENT:  Nothing went to the jury, which is1718    jury?19202122232425the second point, which is this would be a particularlypoor vehicle --          QUESTION:  All right.  Your point is -- excuseme, your point I take it is that in your view the trial14                                       1    judge should have granted summary judgment to the officer,2 is that it? 3              MR. CLEMENT:  That's exactly right. 4              QUESTION:  And so we don't get beyond all these 5    other things.  In your view the error was in denying 6    summary judgment on qualified immunity? 7              MR. CLEMENT:  That's exactly right. 8              QUESTION:  Now was there a factual component to 9    that issue that makes it impossible for the trial judge to10    determine or could there be?11              MR. CLEMENT:  Certainly not in our view.  I12    mean, our view you can take every fact in this case in the13    light most favorable to the plaintiff and the proper14    analysis should still be that the Petitioner was entitled15    to qualified immunity.  And the Court of Appeals below16    simply refused to undertake that analysis because they17    thought the two standards were effectively merged.18              QUESTION:  It's that last bit.  Sorry, that last19    bit that I'm confused on, why isn't it the same standard?20    I was just listening to the answer and I agree that in21    Anderson v. Creighton it isn't, but in Anderson v.22    Creighton the underlying constitutional standard is what23    society thinks is reasonable, basically.  Here the24    underlying constitutional standard is what an officer25    thinks is reasonable and since it's what a reasonable15                                                                                                                                 1    officer thinks is excessive, they become the same 2    standard.  That's just a coincidence, but it happens to be3 so. 4              That is, I don't see how -- think of an example. 5    Can you think of a single example in which you're prepared 6    to say it is excessive force.  It is excessive force, 7    i.e., an officer, a reasonable officer would have known it 8    is excessive because otherwise it isn't excessive force. 9    And you're prepared to say it is excessive force, but10    you'd also say he has qualified immunity, i.e., a11    reasonable officer couldn't have been expected to know it12    was excessive.  That's logically impossible.13              MR. CLEMENT:  With all respect, I --14              QUESTION:  Now so give me an example as a test,15 as a test.16              MR. CLEMENT:  First of all, an example would be17    in the Tenth Circuit situation where the court finds in18    the same case that the hog-tie restraint when applied to19    someone who's exhibited signs of diminished capacity is20    unreasonable.21 22 23 24 25          QUESTION:  It is unreasonable, i.e., an officer,an officer they are saying, a police officer, should haveknow that that force was excessive.          MR. CLEMENT:  No, the should have known aspectof the test is precisely what qualified immunity adds.16                                                                                             1              QUESTION:  Oh, I didn't understand the 2    substantive test.  I thought the substantive test for 3    excessive was it is excessive only if a reasonable officer 4    would have known it was too much force.  I thought that 5    was the substantive test.  So what is the substantive 6    test, if that isn't it? 7              MR. CLEMENT:  The substantive test is whether or 8    not the use of force under the circumstances was 9    unreasonable.  The should have known aspect --10              QUESTION:  And if a reasonable officer, if a11    reasonable officer, looking at the situation would have12    thought it was not unreasonable, then is it excessive?13              MR. CLEMENT:  The reasonableness test is taken14    from the perspective of the reasonable officer and it15    grants the officer deference and allows for reasonable16    mistakes of fact.  What it doesn't allow for is reasonable17    mistakes of law.  If the officer's in a position where18    he's confronted with a situation and he makes a factual19    mistake.  He thinks the suspect is resisting arrest, but20    he's really not.  The Graham against Connor standard takes21    the perspective of the reasonable officer and grants22    deference to the officer.23              But in a situation where there's no question.24    The person wasn't resisting and the court announces a rule25    that says that, absent that kind of resistance, the use of17                                                                                                                                 1    force in this case is unreasonable.  The officer may still 2    be entitled to qualified immunity, if the prior law did 3    not put the individual officer on notice that that use of 4    force under the circumstances, was unreasonable. 5              QUESTION:  That simply means I think that, if 6    you have a very general -- if your Fourth Amendment 7    standard has never been rendered anything but general in 8    formulation, then there is a greater possibility, there is 9    a possibility for disagreement about the application of10    that standard to specific fact circumstances.  And so11    isn't the relationship between the two inquiries this, if12    the first standard, the Fourth Amendment standard has13    never been stated by the courts, except in general terms,14    then probably there will be room for some reasonable15    disagreement about its application.16              You're saying in this case the Graham and Connor17    standard is at a pretty high level of generality and18    therefore you can charge a jury on the Graham and Connor19    standard and they'll decide whether in their judgment the20    officer's conduct was or was not reasonable.  But they21    will also have a second question and that is to say, was22    the Graham and Connor standard so clear in its application23    that a reasonable officer might have come out differently24    from the way you did.  Is that the relationship between25 the two?18                                                                                                                                 1              MR. CLEMENT:  That is the relationship, but I 2    would hesitate to add that it's not limited to the jury 3    situation and I think that same difference allows the4 Court -- 5              QUESTION:  I'm sure, I'm sure.  Yes, yes. 6              MR. CLEMENT:  And we submit this is an 7    appropriate case to resolve even before the jury that the 8    facts and circumstances of this case, even if they 9    constitute a Fourth Amendment violation, which I think is10    a reasonable question under the facts of this case, they11    nonetheless were not so clearly established that the12    officer was on notice and qualified immunity is13    appropriate.14              QUESTION:  You'd have to say that you think15    there's a reasonable question whether they constitute a16    Fourth Amendment violation in this case.  If there weren't17    a reasonable question whether they constituted a Fourth18    Amendment violation, you wouldn't have any immunity claim,19 would you?20              MR. CLEMENT:  I think that's right.  I mean21    there may be situations where the claim is fairly well-22    decided, but there's some reason why a reasonable officer23    would be entitled to rely on the prior law.  I mean, the24    example of a case where the court previously expressly25    reserves the question, even if in a subsequent case, the19                                                                                                                                1    Government doesn't have a great argument why the court2    shouldn't extend the rule, I think it would still be3    appropriate to give the officer qualified immunity under4 that --5              QUESTION:  May I ask you a yes or no question,6    to make sure I understand your response to the Chief7    Justice earlier.  Assume there's a question of fact that8    made it improper to resolve -- for the judge to resolve9    the qualified immunity issue.  He thought he would have to10    submit that to the jury.  When the case is tried at the11    jury, would the judge instruct on both the liability issue12    and the qualified immunity issue or only on one, in your13    view?14              MR. CLEMENT:  It would depend on the15    circumstances.16              QUESTION:  In this case.17              MR. CLEMENT:  I wish I could give you a clean18    answer.1920212223242520                                                                                                                                QUESTION:  This very case.          MR. CLEMENT:  In this very case, it's a littlehard to apply those principles.  If I could back away tothe -- in the Tenth Circuit example, if the only issue iswhether the individual has exhibited diminished city --          QUESTION:  I don't want to talk about the TenthCircuit case.  I'm interested in this case. 1              MR. CLEMENT:  Well in this case, it's a little 2    hard to understand what the Ninth Circuit's reasoning was 3    why there was a violation here. 4              QUESTION:  My question is, assuming there's a 5    question of fact that would decide the qualified immunity 6    issue in this very case, which officer pushed him in the 7    truck or something like and you have to have jury trial on 8    the qualified immunity issue.  My question is, would the 9    jury be instructed on both qualified immunity and10    liability or on just one of the two?11              MR. CLEMENT:  I think they would be instructed12    on both, but I think they would ultimately only be asked13    to decide the ultimate qualified immunity test because14    there's really --15              QUESTION:  They're given an instruction on an16    issue they're not asked to decide?17              MR. CLEMENT:  I think that's right.  I think18    that the instruction on the given law of the Fourth19    Amendment would be necessary background information for20    the jury to make its decision, but I'm not sure there21    would be any real purpose served by having the jury say,22    yes there was a Fourth Amendment violation.  Certainly a23    judge could ask that question, but where the rubber meets24    the road in these cases is whether or not there's25    qualified immunity because that will determine whether the21                                                                                                                                 1    plaintiff has -- 2              QUESTION:  Mr. Clement, your -- you raise -- the 3    Government raises two questions in its petition for 4    certiorari and the second one is did the Court of Appeals 5    err in concluding on the basis facts noted that the 6    defendant's use of force in arresting this particular 7    plaintiff, are you going to get to that? 8              MR. CLEMENT:  I'll get to that right now.  I 9    think one way to focus on this case is, if the Court of10    Appeals had done the proper analysis, how would they have11    defined the Fourth Amendment violation in this case?  It12    seems to us that one of the things they would have focused13    on is the failure of these officers to announce their14    intention to take Mr. Katz out before they actually15    grabbed him and took him out of the area.  Now that kind16    of speak first or warning requirement, at least in a17    nondeadly-force context, seems to us to be a new rule or18    something that's certainly not clearly established on19    which a reasonable officer would be on notice of.20              If the Court of Appeals had approached it that21    way, focused in on that as being the key factor that made22    the actions of the officers here unreasonable then we23    could very legitimately ask the question, was that clearly24    established?  And our position would be of course not. But25    other people could take a different view.22                                                                                                                                 1              QUESTION:  Would you mind walking us through how 2    you think this Court should resolve this case?  I just 3    still don't understand.  We have these issues here, would 4    you walk us through what you think we should do in light 5    of this record and this case? 6              MR. CLEMENT:  Absolutely.  I think the first 7    thing to recognize is the Ninth Circuit took an extreme 8    view, that qualified immunity is never appropriate in 9    excessive force cases.  The first and most important thing10    this Court can do is to disabuse the Ninth Circuit of that11    notion.  Then applying the principles to this case, it12    could usefully decide whether or not there's qualified13    immunity in this case.14              In doing so, it could very well follow the15    reasoning that I just outlined which is to say what would16    make this case an example of excessive force, if anything,17    must be this failure to warn first.  Now, the Ninth18    Circuit -- this Court can either decide that issue if it's19    liked or just kind of, for purposes of the annunciation of20    the rule, assume it, but then it could say that principle21    is not clearly established.  If possible, I'd to reserve22    the remaining to time for follow-up.23              QUESTION:  I'd like to go back to Justice24    O'Connor's question because I'm trying slowly to write25    down what you think the steps are and what I have written23                                                                                                                                 1    down is I have three basic steps for a judge in an 2    appellate court hearing this, say as it was or before the 3    trial or a trial judge.  Step one is, judge take the facts 4    as the plaintiff asserts them insofar as they survive 5    summary judgment.  Step two is, ask the following 6    question, should -- in light of preexisting rule, should a 7    reasonable officer have believed there was too much force, 8    in light of preexisting law? 9              MR. CLEMENT:  I would stop you there.  No, I10    would stop you there.  The first question is simply to ask11    whether on those facts the use of force from the12    perspective of a reasonable officer was reasonable. Now if13    the court thinks not --14              QUESTION:  Now is there a difference between15    what you just said and what I just said?  Now listen to16    what I'm saying because I want to understand the17    difference.  I'm saying that the qualified immunity18    question in this context is, in light of present law,19    should a reasonable officer have thought there was too20    much force?  Now is that right?21              MR. CLEMENT:  That's a fine statement of the22    qualified immunity standard.23              QUESTION:  Good.24              MR. CLEMENT:  What I was focusing on though is25    that I think if you really want to address the order that24                                                                                                                                1    the judge should address the issue.  First they should2    address the issue of liability because that's what this3    Court has said on a number of occasions, including Siegert4    against Gilley and --5              QUESTION:  No, but I'm trying to write down.  I6    only have one more step.  So we have the right, we know7    what to do with the facts, we know what the qualified8    immunity question is, at least my statement of that was9    all right.  And then I go on to say, by the way, if the10    answer to that question is yes, a reasonable officer11    should have believed there was too much force, then the12    third step is direct a verdict for the plaintiff unless13    the underlying facts are in dispute.  And if the answer to14    that question is no, then direct the verdict for the15    defendant.16              MR. CLEMENT:  Unless the underlying facts are in17    dispute.181920212223242525                                                                                                                                          QUESTION:  No, no.  He wins even if the factsare in dispute if the answer's no, because we've assumedthe plaintiff's facts.          MR. CLEMENT:  Yeah, that's right.  I'm sorry.Now one thing I want to add though --          QUESTION:  So now I've proposed the right threesteps.  Now that's -- I'm asking -- I'm just trying towalk it through and maybe you don't want to answer because1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9I understand it's very complicated and you may have had adifferent way of looking at it.          MR. CLEMENT:  Yeah, and all I want to emphasizeis I think that misses the Fourth Amendment step that thisCourt has said has to proceed the qualified immunity testand it's helpful to establish what the qualified immunityviolation is because that's helpful in identifying whetheror not the officers had fair notice that that FourthAmendment principle actually applied.                QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Clement.  Mr. Boyd      we'll hear from you.                     ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN K. BOYD                     ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                MR. BOYD:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the                I would like to walk this Court through the17    process and the steps so that there's an understanding of18    how Anderson and Graham are being used effectively now in19    the trial courts in order to weed out insubstantial cases20    and to have the jurors decide these issues in a way that21    both the individual's right to a remedy and provides the22    insulation that the officers need.23              Now the starting point is with a motion to24    dismiss or a motion for summary judgment and at that point25    and I know this both from representing police officers and26                                                                                                                                101112131415    Court:16 1    from representing plaintiffs at trial in the federal trial 2    courts.  The first step is, you move to dismiss on the 3    defense side and you take out Anderson and you say could 4    the officer have -- whether the officer could have 5    reasonably believed that they could use the amount of 6    force that they did.  Anderson sets that straight out. 7              And then the next thing you do is you take 8    Graham to inform the decision, which is why the opinion is 9    such a brilliant one, because it provides the specifics.10    It provides a three-step test.  How severe was the crime?11    Was the person armed and dangerous, dangerous to the12    police and to the other members of the public and was13    there resistance?  And so if you take this case for14    instance, they claim that Dr. Katz had resisted arrest.15    Now if Dr. Katz resisted arrest in this case, Judge16    Jensen, a seasoned trial lawyer himself, would have thrown17    this case out in an instant using Anderson and using18    Graham.  He would have said the reasonable officer could19    believe that because there was resistance, you can use20    additional force.21              QUESTION:  Well, wait, additional -- I mean22    you're describing Graham as though it's just a matrix.23    You just put it down and it gives you the answer.  It just24    mentions those three things as factors.  Simply because25    there's resistance you can't whack the guy over the head27                                                                                                                                1    with a sledgehammer.  There's still a question of how much2    force you can apply and there will always be an issue no3    matter how much he was resisting, no matter how violent4    the crime was whether you applied too much force.  So it5    just doesn't give you a straight out answer like that.6              MR. BOYD:  What it does do, Justice Scalia, is7    it gives a buffer for the trial court judge to get rid of8    an insubstantial case.  If someone's engaged in a severe9 --10111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Gives you factors, that's all itgives you.  It doesn't tell you what cases can be gottenrid of.  It tells you what factors are relevant, which isvery useful, but I don't see how you can say it gives youan answer automatically.          MR. BOYD:  I can tell you that in practice itgives the trial court judges the language that they needto be able to eliminate these insubstantial claims, theclaims that are made by someone who's engaged in a seriouscrime like a rape or an armed robbery who then comesaround and says, oh, you shouldn't have shot me and thenthose cases can easily be moved by the client --          QUESTION:  Well, what should we do here?  Youwere going to walk us through.          MR. BOYD:  Right.          QUESTION:  There's a videotape here of what28                                                                                             1    happened, is there not? 2              MR. BOYD:  Right, so let's -- 3              QUESTION:  You want us to look at the videotape? 4              MR. BOYD:  Yes, Your Honor. 5              QUESTION:  What if we look at the videotape and 6    think that is not excessive force? 7              MR. BOYD:  I would be shocked. 8              QUESTION:  Would you? That's what I thought. 9              QUESTION:  That's what I thought too.10              QUESTION:  I looked at it as well and I think11    we're only talking about the person on the left, Mr.12    Saucier, who didn't even push him.  It was the one on the13    right, I think Officer Parker, who gave him a little push.14    So, is that right?  Have I looked at the right person?  I15    mean, we all I guess have the same question.16              MR. BOYD:  The testimony that was given by both17    Parker and Saucier was they both put Dr. Katz into the18    back of that van and it's the -- the part of it is that if19    indeed that Dr. Katz was resisting then, yes, that was a20    fair amount of force to use, but that's the question that21    has to go back to the trial court here too, is that Dr.22    Katz said that he was not resisting and when you do look23    at that video you can see that he was not.24              QUESTION:  Yes I agree, but I didn't see any25    force at all used by Mr. Saucier.  Saucier -- it was the29                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425one on the right who seemed to give him a little push, butthe one on the left didn't seem to do anything.  He juststood here.          MR. BOYD:  Your Honor, according to thetestimony of Mr. Saucier there was resistance and so theyhad to put their heads up to figure out what to do.          QUESTION:  Yeah, he probably was talking aboutParker giving him a little push, but is there anythingelse you want to say?  I mean, if I were to look at therecord and just the picture of the police officer on theleft, did I not see something?  Maybe I missed somethingor what is it I missed that he did?          MR. BOYD:  I think that what I would ask you tolook for is what was seen by Judge Jensen and also JudgeThompson writing for a unanimous court, affirming --          QUESTION:  Did they look at a different video?          MR. BOYD:  No, Your Honor.  They looked --          QUESTION:  No, it really didn't show that theperson on the left did anything.  I just looked at itrepeatedly and I came away thinking, why are we here?          MR. BOYD:  Your Honor, because the reason we'rehere is that you can tell that there is a gratuitous useof force by both of them.  There was force that was --          QUESTION:  But I saw no force by the man on theleft insofar as the van was concerned.30                                                                                             1              MR. BOYD:  But they both engaged in the conduct 2    together and that is their own testimony in their 3    depositions. 4              QUESTION:  Well, I did not look at the videotape 5    because I thought we were talking about the standards we 6    have to use and the videotape was just irrelevant. 7              QUESTION:  Me too.  I thought that's why we were 8    here.  I didn't know we were going to resolve it, the9 facts here.10              MR. BOYD:  Yeah, and I -- I actually think the11    most important thing -- I don't think that the facts can12    be resolved here.  I think that the facts need to be13    resolved at trial and the most important thing here is to14    adopt a standard.  And as you asked about the -- and the15    Chief Justice as well, asked about what is the standard16    and what are the instructions that are supposed to be17 given?18              The problem here is that what they are asking19    for by way of the standard is that not only is the jury to20    make the first decision based upon whether or not the21    Fourth Amendment was violated and qualified immunity to be22    built into that, but thereafter then they're asking for a23    second application on the jury instructions.24              QUESTION:  Well, just at the pretrial stage, it25    does seem to me that there's a role for the court that's31                                                                                                                                 1    special in the context of qualified immunity.  The court 2    knows what the law is and has some handle on what a 3    reasonable police officer should know.  That seems to be 4    more of a legal question than a factual question.  I 5    suppose we could play with it and you could it back to me. 6    And so it does seem to me at that point at least, the 7    tests have a different thrust and a different importance 8    and a different significance. 9              MR. BOYD:  At the summary judgment level, yes,10    there are two inquiries that are being made both on the11    qualified immunity and on the Fourth Amendment and they12    are intertwined and they're being made by the trial judge13    at that point.  The important thing is that the qualified14    immunity is not providing for a higher degree of15    protection in that, whatever you adopt as your standard at16    the summary judgment level is then going to carryover to17    the directed verdict level.18              QUESTION:  What do you do about the hog-tie19    example that the Government came forward with?  You have a20    Court of Appeals decision that says you cannot hog-tie a21    person with diminished capacity.  If the person didn't22    have diminished capacity it's another question, we don't23    have to get into that.  And then this is a police officer24    who does use the hog tie but for a person who has no25    diminished capacity.  Now I would read it to be, you know,                                  32                                                                                                                                1    an open question whether that is excessive force or not.2              And suppose that it is finally decided that that3    is excessive force.  Is that police officer, despite the4    fact that the last time around the Court of Appeals5    thought it was close enough, it was unwilling to speak to6    the question, is that police officer going to be held7 liable? 89          MR. BOYD:  No, he is not, Your Honor.  And thereason for that is that there will be qualified immunitybecause there's no established precedent.1011121314151617181920    margin?21          QUESTION:  Well, I don't think there's anydispute here then.  I don't know why -- you're proposingthe same test that the Government is.          MR. BOYD:  Well, except that where we depart is,and when you look at pages 5 and 15 of their reply brief,you see that they're asking for an additional margin ofprotection and that's why -- what's surprising is thatwhen the Government --                QUESTION:  Would you -- what's the additional                MR. BOYD:  The additional margin is that22    typically as in the McNair case what they attempt to do is23    that after the jury has returned a verdict, and I've seen24    this happen in the Northern District as well in a case25    that we won just a year ago, after the verdict comes back33                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425then the --          QUESTION:  What does the verdict say?  Does theverdict pass on qualified immunity?          MR. BOYD:  The verdict is in favor of theplaintiffs after the instructions have been given.          QUESTION:  Including qualified immunity?          MR. BOYD:  Yes -- no during --          QUESTION:  So the jury has made a qualifiedimmunity finding.          MR. BOYD:  No, the jury typically under Hunterin this Court, it's been directed that the court makes thequalified immunity.          QUESTION:  Okay, so the jury has simplydetermined whether there is or is not, yes or no, a FourthAmendment violation?          MR. BOYD:  Correct, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Comes back and says, yes there is.          MR. BOYD:  Correct.          QUESTION:  Now, what happens next?          MR. BOYD:   The Government lawyer jumps up andsays, thank you, ladies and gentlemen for coming in, butnow, Your Honor, I want you to second guess, I want you toreassess this case.  This is exactly what happens.  It'sexactly what happened in McNair without even moving underRule 50 and that's the problematic thing that this Court34                                                                                            1 -- 2              QUESTION:  I thought that what he was asking the 3    judge to do is to determine, based on prior precedent, 4    whether the jury's verdict in this case was sufficiently 5    obvious that the officer should have known that the jury 6    would come to the conclusion it came to.  And if the 7    answer is, yes, it was sufficiently obviously, this is 8    right within the zone of unreasonableness, if you will, 9    that prior cases have established then there's no10    qualified immunity.11              QUESTION:  But -- excuse me, I didn't think this12    went to a jury.13              QUESTION:  No, he's giving us an example of the14 jury case.15              QUESTION:  Oh, I thought we were talking about16 this case.17              MR. BOYD:  No, Your Honor.  This has not gone to18    the jury yet.  And then the key question here is, when it19    goes back to Judge Jensen and he has to decide and then it20    goes to the jury on the issues of fact that are present.21    There are issues of fact.  That's what the trial court22    judge said and the appellate court.  And when it goes back23    is Judge Jensen then going to second guess the jury?  If24    they were to return a verdict in this case --25              QUESTION:  And I am suggesting to you that what35                                                                                                                                 1    I think the defense is asking for is not second guessing 2    on whether the jury was right or wrong about whether in 3    its judgment there was a Fourth Amendment violation, but 4    whether the officers should have anticipated, on the basis 5    of prior precedent, that the jury would come out the way 6    it did and if the officer should reasonably have 7    anticipated that, then there's no qualified immunity.  If 8    the officer need not reasonably have anticipated that, 9    then there is.  Isn't that what the defense is asking for?10              MR. BOYD:  It's unclear what they're asking for,11    Your Honor, and what they've said before is that it should12    be the court that makes the decision.  Now, today they're13    talking about jury instructions.  And if what they're14    asking for is that the jurors are going to be given some15    additional instructions on qualified immunity then the16    problem is, and this goes back to Justice Kennedy's early17    questions, it's totally unworkable at that point.18              QUESTION:  All right.  Can we just forget for a19    minute, ignore the question whether the jury's going to20    find it or the court's going to find it and just get down21    to what the standard is, whoever is going to find it must22    follow.  And forgetting the court/jury dichotomy, what is23    the, in your judgment, the Government asking for that it's24    not entitled?25              MR. BOYD:  It's asking for -- that -- it really                                  36                                                                                                                                 1    is a procedural secondary review of the decision to be 2    made by the jury or they're asking for a second set of 3    jury instructions. 4              QUESTION:  See, I don't understand that at all. 5    I thought it was here on summary judgment and they take 6    the view, summary judgment should have been given for the 7    officer.  I thought that's where we were.  I don't see why 8    the jury gets into this at all.  If you agree with them, 9    then summary judgment was wrongfully denied to the police10    officer, is their view, I think.11              MR. BOYD:  Your Honor, I think this may answer12    Justice Souter's question as well, but what we heard from13    my brother was that the instruction on the issue of Graham14    is not even necessary for them to decide.  That was a15    response to one of the questions.  They may not even reach16    that because qualified immunity now is going to provide17    for the higher standard.  That's what they're looking for18    and I think that is contrary to Graham.  It would supplant19    Graham, it's unnecessary, and it would make it unworkable20    in that he jury instructions that would be given would be21    -- the way that this works in practice is that the22    instructions that they've asked for, and I've seen them,23    they ask, after the jury has decided that the officer24    acted in objectively unreasonable manner then they ask25    whether the officer could have reasonably believed that he37                                                                                                                                 1    could act unreasonably and they expect the jurors to do 2    this. 3              QUESTION:  Whether he could reasonably believe 4    that he could act in a fashion, which has later been found 5    to be unreasonable.  I mean, you speak as though the line 6    between reasonable and unreasonable is so clear that 7    nobody runs the risk of making a foot fault.  I mean, 8    indeed, sometimes they go over the line unintentionally 9    and to a slight enough degree that the doctrine of10    qualified immunity ought to afford protection.11              MR. BOYD:  And do you know when they go over the12    line, and I know this from representing them, the13    instructions that you use in closing are the ones that are14    based on Graham saying a mistake's not enough, no 20/2015    hindsight, you don't have to use the least amount of force16    necessary, that this is a severe crime, the guy was armed17    and dangerous.  You give the officer a break and you're18    out of there.19              QUESTION:  Well, there have been a lot of20    questions from the bench about jury instructions.21    Certainly I asked, but this case itself did not go to the22    jury.  We're talking about the Ninth Circuit's decision23    that says you cannot grant summary judgment to the officer24    on the record as we saw it and I take it you defend that25 decision.38                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. BOYD:  Yes.          QUESTION::  Therefore, if you're -- if we'resimply talking about this particular decision, we don'tget to any jury instructions at all.          MR. BOYD:  No, the only -- the concern though,is that whatever you establish as the summary judgmentstandard gets carried over to the directed verdict andthat's why the decisions that have been made by the Sixth,Seventh, Ninth and D.C. Circuits are so solid is becausethey take Anderson and Graham and apply them together andthat the big mess arises when you try to then put anadditional boost on qualified immunity.          QUESTION:  Okay, but on this particular record,the Vice President is speaking, this guy gets up to thefront, raises a banner and he's taken out and put in avan.  What's unreasonable about that?          MR. BOYD:  The part that's unreasonable is theway that he was put into that van if he was not resistingarrest.  Certainly there's a question of fact.          QUESTION:  He was simply pushed?  That makes it101112131415161718192021    unreasonable?22 23 24 25          MR. BOYD:  The way that he was pushed by thoseofficers, I think if you were to show it to the people inthis room --          QUESTION:  Excuse me, one officer.                            39                                                                                             1 2 3 4 5    together. 6              QUESTION:  Well, I thought you told us we could 7    look at the videotape, that that was correct.  That that 8    was an actual depiction of what happened. 9              MR. BOYD:  Well, this is why you have a disputed10    issue of fact.  The video shows that Dr. Katz was not11    resisting and yet you wouldn't assume that as a fact.12    That's a fact for the jury to decide.  They will decide13 whether --14              QUESTION:  Why don't we assume that, as a fact.15              MR. BOYD:  Because that would be for the jury.16    There are things -- for instance, Saucier says that --17              QUESTION:  But in deciding summary judgment on18    the qualified immunity issue I would assume we would19    assume he wasn't resisting and then go ahead and resolve20 the issue.21              MR. BOYD:  Well, both Judge Jensen, who made his22    career as a prosecutor and Judge Thompson, who's also a23    conservative, seasoned judge, felt that there is a24    question of fact that needed to go to the jury.25              QUESTION:  Does that mean that we couldn't find40                                                                                                                                QUESTION:  Yeah.QUESTION:  Yeah.MR. BOYD:  Well, Your Honor, the testimony ofboth officers is that they both engaged in that conduct 1    differently? 2              MR. BOYD:  Of course, Your Honor, you are the 3    Supreme Court. 4              QUESTION:  And also I assume they are very good 5    judges.  Oh, there a lot of good judges can disagree about 6    things.  I go back to the standard, if it's all right, for 7    one minute.  I might have thought that the Ninth Circuit 8    used the right standard even though maybe it didn't apply 9    it correctly, but for the one example that's been raised,10    which is the hog-tie case.11              And in thinking about that, I thought, well,12    maybe that's an instance where suddenly the underlying13    substantive rule, which I previously thought turns 10014    percent on whether the policemen in the field would15    reasonably have thought this was too much force or not is16    suddenly changed.  That is, if you're going to have a set17    of practices that define the reasonableness of it, i.e.,18    hog tying, diminished capacity, is by law excessive force,19    then we do have Anderson/Creighton, then we do have the20    Fourth Amendment search and seizure and then the standards21    do diverge.  Now without the hog tie, if we just have22    first standard, they don't diverge.  Now is that right?23              MR. BOYD:  I think that's very close, but in24    practice the point that I really want to have understood25    by this Court that the Ninth Circuit standard is that41                                                                                                                                 1    qualified immunity is alive and well in the Ninth Circuit. 2              QUESTION:  But the Ninth Circuit said that 3    Anderson doesn't apply with respect to excessive force and 4    I would like to know why that is correct?  Just because 5    you have a reasonable test for excessive force, you also 6    have a reasonableness test for probable cause.  Would a 7    reasonable officer have believed that a crime was in 8    progress, for example.  They're both reasonableness tests 9    and in Anderson we say nonetheless you have an antecedent10    question of whether there's qualified immunity even though11    -- even though it may be determined by the jury that this12    was unreasonable, nonetheless an officer would still be13    protected if the law was not that clear about what was14    reasonable and he can be allowed to go a little bit over15    the line.  Why is excessive force any different from16    probable cause in this regard?17              And that's the point of the Ninth Circuit:18    Anderson doesn't apply.19              MR. BOYD:  But Anderson does apply except it20    applies at the same level as the Fourth Amendment.  And21    the difference, Your Honor, is that with an excessive22    force case like this, this is where you're right at the23    juncture where physical force is being used by federal24    officials against individuals.  What you have here are25    federal lawyers asking federal judges to make federal42                                                                                                                                1    officials immune from the Bill of Rights.2              QUESTION:  Mr. Boyd, I think you answered3    Justice Scalia's question a second ago and I wanted to4    come back to it.  You said something a minute ago that5    suggested the following to me.  You were saying, I think,6    that the way the unreasonable or reasonable excessive7    force test has been articulated in Graham is that it gives8    the officer the benefit of the doubt, you know, none of9    the 20/20 hindsight and so on, the guy in the field and10    all of that.11              And I think what you're arguing is that12    qualified immunity gives the officer the benefit of the13    doubt.  It says, if it wasn't clear enough, he gets the14    benefit of the doubt.  And I think what you're saying is,15    in this particular case, in excessive force cases, the16    benefit of the doubt is already part of the substantive17    test.  So it makes no sense to say, after getting the18    benefit of the doubt on the substantive standard, you then19    get the benefit of the doubt again.  Is that your20    position?212223242543                                                                                                                                MR. BOYD:  Exactly.QUESTION:  Okay.QUESTION:  If that's right then you say Anderson-- Anderson doesn't -- it's not so that Anderson doesn'tapply.  Anderson applies double. 1              MR. BOYD:  Exactly. 2              QUESTION:  First thing you ask is the Anderson 3    test and if the answer to that question is the plaintiff 4    flunks, he's not only flunked the qualified immunity test, 5    he's also flunked the substantive test. 6              MR. BOYD:  Exactly. 7              QUESTION:  Well that's fine, but that still 8    leaves me the question of why you don't get the same if 9    you consider that a double benefit?  Why is that double10    benefit not conferred in the Anderson type case, in the11    probable cause type case?  It is either, there in fact was12    no crime in progress, but a reasonable officer could have13    thought that there was a crime in progress.  That's the14    probable cause test, but then we add on top of that a15    qualified immunities test.  Now, why don't you decry the16    benefit on a benefit in that situation?  Maybe Anderson's17    wrong, but then you should be asking us to overrule18    Anderson.  I don't see any difference between the probable19    cause test and the excessive force test.  Would a20    reasonable officer have thought this was excessive force?21     Would a reasonable office have thought that there was a22    crime in progress?  I don't see any double counting in one23    case any more than in the other.24              MR. BOYD:  Your Honor, the difference is, here25    we have Graham subsequent to Anderson and also I think as44                                                                                                                                 1    Justice Souter pointed out that -- that -- here, and I 2    think this also part of the crux of it with the excessive 3    force, is that you're dealing with the actual physical 4    contact the police come into effect with people.  And 5    Graham has set forth some very specific standards that can 6    apply where you -- 7              QUESTION:  They haven't.  Graham is a 8    reasonableness test.  That's all it is and it mentions 9    certain factors that ought to be taken into account and10    determining reasonableness.  Is it a violent felon?  Is he11    resisting and so forth?  But it's a reasonableness test12    just as the probable cause test is.13              MR. BOYD:  And the two together, Graham and14    Anderson, are being used in order to provide the police15    officers the insulation that they need to be able to carry16    on their duties without being unduly timid in the process.17              QUESTION:  Mr. Boyd, may I ask you to tell me18    your view on something that Mr. Clement brought up and I19    thought in bringing it up he was trying to make this case20    a little bit like the hog-tie case.  He said the crux of21    the excessive force case here was that they didn't give22    him notice, some kind of notice, and I didn't understand23    that to be your position.  I thought that your position24    was they didn't need to give him the bum's rush.  They25    didn't need to push him in.  He was elderly, frail and45                                                                                                                                1    they could have treated him gently.  Now there this2    -- they didn't notify him to stop or something part of3 your case?4              MR. BOYD:  No, it is not, Your Honor.  You're5    correct.  That is not part of our case that they should6    have given him particularly notice.  It is how they7    treated him that raises the question of fact.  And the8    important thing here, and this gets to the crux of the9    qualified immunity and the interactions with the Fourth10    Amendment, is that they are providing the means for the11    trial court judges to take care of the insubstantial cases12    now and to provide the officers with the insulation they13    need while still preserving a remedy.14              QUESTION:  But that doesn't really answer the15    legal point that Justice Souter and Justice Scalia have16    asked you about.  Since there's -- in Anderson we say that17    the probable cause standard does not answer the question18    of qualified immunity, why shouldn't the -- we say the19    same thing about unreasonable force.20              MR. BOYD:  I think primarily, Your Honor,21    because with unreasonable force you're dealing with an22    area where they're in direct physical contact with the23    people.242546                                                                                                                                          QUESTION:  But why should that make a differencefor Fourth Amendment purposes? 1              MR. BOYD:  Because of the nature of it.  This 2    cuts right to the heart of the intent of the Fourth 3    Amendment to serve as a check on federal officials and 4    there's nothing in the Fourth Amendment making a textural 5    analysis of it that provides for an immunity.  And so 6    there should be one, but it should not be untethered and 7    so in the excessive force case we have the benefit of 8    Graham.  Graham has left a wonderful legacy.  It's been 9    cited 2,685 times and the reason for that is because it's10    working and it's working along with Anderson.  And what11    they're talking about now is an expansion of the qualified12    immunity that would just supplant Graham, unnecessarily13    so, and raise Seventh Amendment issues.14              QUESTION:  But, you know, without Graham we have15    the legacy of several centuries of probable cause law,16    which gives the policeman the benefit of the doubt.  He17    doesn't have to be correct about whether there are exigent18    circumstances so long as it was a reasonable judgment on19    his part and yet on top of that giving him the benefit of20    doubt, we also have a separate immunity doctrine.  I don't21    see why it's any different for excessive force even though22    he thought -- even though the force was in fact excessive,23    we're going to give the policeman the benefit of the doubt24    if a reasonable policeman would not have thought it was25    excessive.  That already gives him one benefit of the47                                                                                                                                 1    doubt and the Government is arguing just as in Anderson 2    you give a second benefit of the doubt for immunity so 3    also in the case.  I don't see any difference between the 4    two.  Now maybe Anderson is wrong, but that's a different5 issue. 6              MR. BOYD:  No, it's not that Anderson is wrong 7    it's that Anderson has been incorporated into the Ninth 8    Circuit standard and Anderson is alive and well.  And the 9    fact is that now, and I see that my five-minute light is10    on, and I don't feel that there's a need to try to make11    every single point but what's essential here is that12    there's no better way to preserve rights than to put them13    in writing.  And there's no better guardians of written14    rights than judges and here in this context, well ought to15    remember the words of Justice Marshall saying that if16    we're to be a government of laws and not of men that there17    must be a remedy for the violation of a constitutional18    right.  And at the same time we have balance that against19    the need to insulate the officers, I recognize that, but20    this is a case where judges --21              QUESTION:  May I ask you a question based on22    your experience of these cases, how often does the issue23    of qualified immunity actually go to the jury, in your24 view? 25MR. BOYD:  Almost every time, based upon the                  48                                       1    uncertainty now that exists in this area and this is where 2    the Court in its opinion really needs to come out and -- 3              QUESTION:  You say in almost every case it goes4 to the jury? 5              MR. BOYD:  Well, it depends.  Some of the time 6    it's going to the jury on two sets of jury instructions. 7    This is where there's confusion in the Circuits and some 8    of the time it's going to the jury on Graham and then they 9    give it to the judge, as in McNair, to apply qualified10    immunity after the jury.  And that's when you run into11    direct conflict with the Seventh Amendment.  And that's12    why the most important thing for this Court to make clear13    and why to adopt the Ninth Circuit standard is because it14    sets forth a clear workable test so that after the jury15    has decided based on jury instructions incorporating both16    Anderson and Graham, that then there's no second guessing17    by the judge.18              Because, Your Honors, it's in the -- there are19    moments when it's up to the judges to decide to make sure20    that the rights are not deteriorating and that's exactly21    what's happened here both with Judge Jensen and with Judge22    Thompson in the unanimous decision of the Ninth Circuit.23    And so we would urge this Court to follow the decisions of24    the Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, Tenth and D.C. Circuits that25    strike the proper balance between preserving the remedy49                                                                                                                                 1    for the individual and insulating the police officers in 2    the performance of their duties. 3              With that I have nothing further and I thank 4    you, Mr. Chief Justice. 5              QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Boyd.  Mr. Clement, 6    you have three minutes -- or four minutes. 7               REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 8                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 9              MR. CLEMENT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.10    Like to make three points.  First for those of you who11    have reviewed the videotape, the very fact that this Court12    could disagree with Ninth Circuit about whether there was13    excessive force used in this case underscores the need for14    qualified immunity for officers in the field because15    clearly Graham against Connor did not answer every case16    and did not provide officers on crystal clear notice of17    where the lines were in the excessive-force context.18              The second point I'd like to make is simply that19    jury instruction issues and the question of what goes to20    the jury and what the judge should decide, those issues21    are not unique to the excessive-force context.  Those same22    issues arise under probable cause and exigent circumstance23    in Anderson against Creighton.  And Mr. Boyd's actually24    correct that some of the Circuits have taken divergent25    views on that.  It may be appropriate for the Court50                                                                                                                                 1    eventually to take up that issue, but as Justice O'Connor 2    has pointed out, this case would be an incredibly poor 3    vehicle to do so since we're here on summary judgment and 4    the Ninth Circuit's denial of summary judgment and the 5    Government's position continues to be that that grant of 6    -- that denial of summary judgment was inappropriate and 7    this Court should reverse that. 8              Finally, I want to clarify that despite what may 9    have been said here it is not accurate to say that the10    Ninth Circuit, or at least Graham itself, incorporates the11    test of Anderson against Creighton.  Graham itself does12    allow officers the benefit of the doubt when it comes to13    reasonable mistakes of fact.  It doesn't grant them the14    benefit of the doubt when it comes to reasonable mistakes15    of law.  And it doesn't incorporate into its16    reasonableness test the notion of what the preexisting law17    was and it's a good thing that it doesn't because if that18    were the case, then the Fourth Amendment law would be19    frozen in place.20              QUESTION:  It seems to me that what you're21    asking is to say that the police officer is entitled to22    know in every case precisely what he must do and I'm not23    sure either under qualified immunity and then certainly24    under general Fourth Amendment principles we can do that.25              MR. CLEMENT:  I don't think that's what we're51                                                                                                                                 1    asking, with all due respect Justice Kennedy.  I think 2    what we're asking is that the officers be put on fair 3    warning that their conduct is unlawful.  Justice Souter in 4    an opinion for the Court in United States against Lanier 5    addressed this issue in the context of 18 U.S.C. 242 and 6    made clear that what's required in that context, and he 7    noted that the same rule applies in qualified immunity, is 8    the officers have fair warning because the principles, the 9    general principles, have been made specific is the term he10    used, by application through prior cases.  The Eleventh11    Circuit in a case called Lassiter against Alabama A&M12    expressed the same concept by saying that what you need is13    the prior case law that's materially similar.14              QUESTION:  All right.  Well, if the standards15    are the same, sometimes by coincidence it could turn out16    that the qualified immunity standard and the underlying17    substantive standard are the same.  And if so, there's18    only one question to ask and if not there are obviously19    two questions to ask.  All right, I thought all they're20    arguing is that this and the Ninth Circuit says by21    coincidence they happen to be the same.                MR. CLEMENT:  And that's why I want to insist52                                                                                                                                2223 -- 2425          QUESTION:  Is that the part you're disagreeingwith?  You're saying they're not the same.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. CLEMENT:  Absolutely.  Absolutely, becauseGraham against Connor itself does not build in reasonablemistakes of law or take into account what the preexistinglaw was.          QUESTION:  Only reasonable mistakes of fact, isthat your point?          MR. CLEMENT:  That's exactly right, because ifit were otherwise then the very fact that prior law didn'tput an officer on notice and there was unclarity woulditself mean that the conduct was lawful and then there'dbe no mechanism for the law to provide clarity in theFourth Amendment context.  It's the same idea as to whythis Court asked lower courts to deal with the liability-- the constitutional issue first and only the immunityquestion second.          The last point I'd like to make is in responseto Justice Ginsburg's question about what the rationale ofthe Ninth Circuit below was in a subsequent case decidedlast week.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you.  Thank you,Mr. Clement.  The case is submitted.          (Whereupon at 11:14 a.m., the case in the above-entitled case was submitted.)53
