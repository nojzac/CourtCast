HOWE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it - Subject to Final Reviewplease the Court:            For over 200 years, this Court has held,10111213141516   finality.17               In 1984, Congress enacted the Sentencing18   Reform Act against the backdrop of this well settled19   rule.  In 18 U.S.C. section 3742, Congress provided for20   limited appellate review of sentencing errors.  Nothing21   in the text, structure, or history of section 374222   reflects any intent by Congress to deviate from the23   inveterate and certain cross-appeal rule, nor is there24   any reason why sentencing appeals should be treated any25   differently from other appeals.  Instead, section 37423without exception, that an appellate court may notmodify a judgment in a party's favor unless that partyhas filed a notice of appeal.  Such a rule, this Courthas explained, serves important interests in notice and￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   reflects traditional principles of appellate 2   jurisdiction.  In -- 3               JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask you this 4   question?  I've been thinking about this case. 5   Supposing your client prevailed on appeal and they held 6   a resentencing.  Could the district judge have increased 7   the sentence? 8               MS. HOWE:  No.  It could not have because 9   the government --10               JUSTICE STEVENS:  The district judge could11   not have increased it?  If they sent it back for a new12   sentencing, a fresh hearing on what the sentencing13   should be, would the district judge have been foreclosed14   from giving a higher sentence than he gave the first15 time? 16                 MS. HOWE:  If -- he would have been     foreclosed, yes, Your Honor.                 MS. HOWE:  Simply that the -- the district24   sentence the second time around, which is a little more25   serious sentence.41718192021   --22            JUSTICE STEVENS:  What's the authority forthat proposition?                 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Say, if it was a capital23   case and he won on appeal, he could get the death￼ - Subject to Final Review1               Why couldn't he have gotten a higher2   sentence.3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            MS. HOWE:  This is a -- the case actually inUnited States versus Harvey, which was a case out of theThird Circuit, and, although the district court couldorder the same sentence, it can't increase the sentence.Yes.  It would be circumventing the cross-appeal rule.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is that based on any --any precedent of this Court's?            MS. HOWE:  No.  It's based on thecross-appeal rule.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So just on thecross-appeal rule?            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I would have thoughtit would depend on what the mandate from the court ofappeals said.  If the mandate said the sentence isvacated and the case is remanded for resentencing, itseems to me that leaves open the full range oflegitimate sentencing.            MS. HOWE:  Certainly.  I mean, our argumentwould be that the -- you know, if the court of appealscan't order the sentence increased, that on remand thedistrict court couldn't circumvent the cross-appeal ruleby increasing the sentence as well.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but the court5￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314   --1516171819202122232425 - Subject to Final Reviewof appeals -- if your argument is correct, the court ofappeals is limited solely by virtue of the failure tofile a notice of cross-appeal.  That -- that's alimitation that wouldn't apply in the district court.            MS. HOWE:  No, that's certainly true, thatit would be circumventing the cross-appeal rule to allowthe district court to do something that --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And it would also, I takeit, be circumventing what could happen in the districtcourt.  You have to move very -- seven days in thedistrict court for mathematical error, and that's it.            MS. HOWE:  Yes, under this rule.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Other than for assistance            MS. HOWE:  Yes, the district court has, Ibelieve, seven days to correct the sentence.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This would not be amathematical error?            MS. HOWE:  No.  This would not be amathematical error, but --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I could have sworn thatI've seen more than one petition for certiorari in whichthe claim is that the sentence was increased on remandvindictively.  I'm sure I've seen cert petitions likethat.  And you're telling me that the assertion of6￼ - Subject to Final Review1   vindictiveness is unnecessary, and it just can't be2   increased on remand?34   for that.567   trial.89But all you have is a court of appeals caseMS. HOWE:  Yes, we --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Perhaps that's after a newMS. HOWE:  Perhaps.                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What happens if it's --10   what happens if the sentence is five years, reversed on11   appeal, error in evidence, same -- same offense, same12   indictment?  Then you have to comply with the13   vindictiveness rules before he can give a higher14 sentence?15               MS. HOWE:  I think it might be different if16   it were -- if there were a new trial on the same17   indictment.  But -- you know, going back to the18   cross-appeal rule, I mean, the court of appeals could --19   the district court could certainly impose the same22 23 24 2520   sentence.21            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What do you think is therule if there's a new trial and the judge says, youknow, what about this, I heard the evidence again; Ithink I'm going to increase the sentence?            MS. HOWE:  Well, our argument would be that7￼123456 -- 7 - Subject to Final Reviewthe government had forfeited the right to make thatargument and that the district court would not be -- youknow, that would essentially be sua sponte ordering --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But what's sua sponte --MS. HOWE:  You know, if the government had                JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's a resentence.8   There's a new judgment, a new conviction.  What happens9 then?10               MS. HOWE:  New judgment and conviction -- it11   -- the rule may be different.  Unless double jeopardy12   may apply as well.13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Double jeopardy if it's a14   new judge?  Is that what you said?15               MS. HOWE:  I -- I'm not sure.16               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Who asked this question?17   We're going to get a totally different case here.18               (Laughter.)19               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Let's go back to where20   you started, and that was with the statute, 37 -- what21   is it?  42?222324258MS. HOWE: 42.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- (f).  And the -- thathas two subparts, and the first part just says the courtof appeals can decide whether a sentence was imposed in￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   violation of law, period. 2               And (2) has two subparts that refer to the 3   party appealing.  So why doesn't the first one cover 4   both sides when the second one is distinctly divided 5   into (a) and (b) parts? 6               MS. HOWE:  Certainly, Justice Ginsburg.  And 7   that -- this is reprinted on page 5a of the government's 8   brief.  And the inference that I think, 9   Justice Ginsburg, you're drawing and that the amicus10   would have you draw is that the fact that the subsection11   (f)(2), which is on page 6a, subsection (f)(2)(A) and12   (b) refer to whether the appeal has been filed; whereas,13   subsection (f)(1) says not, which means that, in some14   circumstances, the cross-appeal rule does not apply in15   circumstances such as that.16               But our interpretation, which we think is17   the correct one, is that the only reason that subsection18   (f)(1) does not refer to whether an appeal has been19   filed is that subsection (f)(1)  refers to the kind of20   claims that both defendants and the government can21   bring; whereas, subsection (f)(2) parallels22   subsections(a)(3) and (b)(3), but (c), only the23   defendant can appeal an upward departure; only the24   government can appeal a downward departure.25               And our interpretation, again, which we9￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   think is the correct one, is that subsection (f)(1) 2   doesn't need to refer to whether an appeal has been 3   filed, because -- because both the defendant and the 4   government can bring those kinds of appeals. 5               And even if you don't agree with that 6   interpretation, I think it's worth noting that the 7   amicus -- that the amicus's construction is further 8   flawed for three reasons.  And the first is that that 9   would cause subsection (f)(2) to operate illogically.10   There's no reason why the -- for example, if you had a11   case in which the defendant had appealed and the12   government had not appealed, under this interpretation13   the court of appeals could increase a sentence if it14   found there had been a misapplication of the Guidelines15   that would result in an increase in the defendant's16   sentence; but the court of appeals would not be allowed17   to increase the defendant's sentence if it found that18   there was an unwarranted downward departure, because the19   government had filed a notice of appeal.  We don't think20   -- that doesn't make any sense.  We don't think there's21   any reason why Congress would have intended for it to22   operate this way.23               The second reason is that this is a very24   thin reed to rest this construction of the statute on,25   given that Congress must have been aware of the10￼ - Subject to Final Review1   cross-appeal rule.  There's no reason to think that it2   would have departed from two centuries of appellate3   practice in this way, based on this -- this very thin4   reed, and in fact we know from the Organized Crime5   Control Act of 1970 that Congress was aware of the6   cross-appeal rule because in that case it expressly7   carved out that exception --8               JUSTICE BREYER:  What happens if it's just9   the converse case?  The same thing, I take it.10               MS. HOWE:  I'm sorry?11               JUSTICE BREYER:  We have a government12   appeal.  The sentence was 10 years.  The government13   thinks it should be 20.14               On appeal, the appellate court thinks the15   government is wrong, and moreover, the appellate court16   discovers an error:  It should have been one year.  And17   you're saying, well, according to you, not only is the18   court of appeals helpless, but the district court is19   helpless.  So this person is in jail for nine years20   where he shouldn't have been.  That's your position21   here?2223242511MS. HOWE:  That's correct, Justice Breyer.            JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, that's a pretty toughposition.  It -- it seems to me there could be errors --and I guess if he's sentenced to death, it's the same.￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   I mean, the -- the -- it's a pretty tough position, 2   isn't it?  That there is no authority in the courts of 3   appeals, or in the district court, or anywhere in the 4   system to create -- to correct a serious error where a 5   person could, in fact, be in prison for a long time 6   contrary to the law. 7               MS. HOWE:  Well -- 8               JUSTICE BREYER:  How is it supposed to work 9   in your system that we get those errors corrected?10               MS. HOWE:  I have three points,11   Justice Breyer.12               The first is that Congress must have been13   aware of this scenario in particular because in the14   Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, when the government15   appeals, that -- in those provisions, that brought up16   the defendant's sentence and his conviction for review.17   And Congress decided, for whatever reason, not to18   continue that -- that exception to the cross-appeal rule19   when it enacted the Sentencing Reform Act.20               The second point, Justice Breyer, is that21   we're not aware that there's actually any body of case22   law in which this happened.  No one has pointed to any23   cases in which this has actually happened.  The --24               JUSTICE STEVENS:  I believe you say it has25   decided not to make an exception to the cross-appeal12￼ - Subject to Final Review1234567   rule.8               MS. HOWE:  It is indeed, Justice Stevens,9   but --rule.  Of course, the cross-appeal rule itself is notstatutory, is it?            MS. HOWE:  The cross-appeal rule itself isnot statutory, but --            JUSTICE STEVENS:  It's an arguable ruleamong the courts of appeal as to whether there is such a            JUSTICE STEVENS:  So it's not surprisingthat Congress didn't make exception to a rule that isn'tthat firmly established.101112131415161718192021222324   manner.25               JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought it was sort of an13            MS. HOWE:  It is not surprising, but we knowfrom the Organized Crime Control Act that Congresscertainly was aware of the cross-appeal rule, because inthat case it did carve out a limited exception.            And my third point, Justice Breyer,returning to your question, is that the defendant inthat case may well have an argument, may be able to seekpost-conviction relief under section 2255, as theGovernment acknowledges in its brief.            So he may be able to go back to the districtcourt under section 2255 and obtain relief in that￼ - Subject to Final Review12345678   well-established.9               MS. HOWE:  We believe it is bothimportant part of your case that the cross-appeal rulewas an established rule.  You now knowledge that it'snot an established rule?            MS. HOWE:  Well, we do believe it isjurisdictional, Justice Scalia.  In the Morley case,which we think --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not just jurisdictional but10   well-established and jurisdictional.  And we believe, in11   particular, when you're talking about sentencing, even12   if you don't agree with us that the cross-appeal rule13   generally is jurisdiction, we believe that section 374214   is jurisdictional.  Because it sets out in subsections A15   and B, the kinds of errors that defendants and the16   government can bring.17               But we also believe that it ultimately18   doesn't matter in this case, Justice Scalia, because19   even if, as amicus concedes, it is merely a rule of20   practice, it is a rule of practice that is not subject21   to exception, and Mr. Greenlaw timely invoked it at his22   earliest opportunity.23               JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you say it is a24   well-established at least rule of practice.25               MS. HOWE:  Absolutely.14￼ - Subject to Final Review 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:  And what's to be said 2   against that?  How many courts of appeals do not apply 3   that? 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            MS. HOWE:  The Eighth Circuit in this casecertainly does not apply it.  The Tenth Circuit --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, they --MS. HOWE:  They acknowledge.JUSTICE SCALIA:  They didn't apply it underthis statute.  I am saying, apart from this statute,what courts of appeals in other cases deny the existenceof a cross-appeal rule?            MS. HOWE:  The District of Columbia Circuitand the Ninth Circuit both regard it is a rule ofpractice that may be subject to exceptions andexceptional circumstances.  But, even if it is a rule ofpractice, Justice Scalia, we still prevail becauseMr. Greenlaw has timely invoked it at his earliestopportunity and because in a sentencing context it isnot subject to any exception.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What difference does itmake?  Now, you said this is a jurisdictional rulebecause its no rule.  What difference does it make if itis labeled "jurisdictional," or if it is just regardedas a tight procedural requirement?            MS. HOWE:  It makes a difference,15￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Justice Ginsburg, in the sense that it cannot be waivedif it is jurisdictional.  The Court can raise it at anytime.  If it is a rule of practice, it is subject toexception below.  In this -- as in this case with thisrule, the Court has not found an exception in over 200years.  The -- in the sentencing context in particular,it is not subject to exception.            And Mr. Greenlaw timely invoked it.  If thisCourt has no further questions, I'd like to reserve theremainder of my time.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Ms. Howe.            Ms. Maynard.               ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT            MS. MAYNARD:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:            The Court of Appeals erred in increasingPetitioner's sentence for two reasons:            First, it lacked jurisdiction to do so inthe absence of a notice of appeal by the Governmentunder 18 USC 3742(b).            Second, even assuming it did not strictlylack jurisdiction, it nevertheless violated themandatory claim- processing rule that a judgment may notbe increased in favor of an appellee in the absence of a16 - Subject to Final Review￼ - Subject to Final Review1 timely -- 2               JUSTICE ALITO:  Now, if the cross-appeal 3   rule is jurisdictional, how do you account for the 4   sentencing-package cases?  The court makes a mistake on 5   count 1, and the district court makes a mistake on count 6   1, the court of appeals vacates the entire sentence for 7   the development of a new sentencing package. 8               MS. MAYNARD:  Those cases are not 9   inconsistent with the finding of jurisdictional, Justice10   Alito, because in those cases the court of appeals has11   granted the defendant's requested relief, and it has12   vacated the judgment at the request of the defendant.13               And then, once it goes back to the district14   court, what the district court may lawfully do would15   turn on the scope of the mandate, not on principles of16   the cross-appeal rule.17               JUSTICE STEVENS:  But in this very case18   could the court of appeals said:  We will grant the19   appellant a new sentencing hearing and send the case20   back to the district for resentencing; and, by the way,21   district judge, when you do the resentencing, take a22   look at the section that imposes a mandatory minimum?23   Could they have done that?24               MS. MAYNARD:  If the court of appeals had25   found an error at the defendant's request, yes,17￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   Justice Stevens, and remanded it, depending on the scope 2   of the mandate and under the scope of the mandate -- 3               JUSTICE STEVENS:  And you could have ended 4   up with precisely the same result that they ended up 5   with in this case. 6               MS. MAYNARD:  But it would have been a key 7   difference in the sense that they would have found some 8   of the defendant's claims on appeal correct.  Here the 9   court of appeals rejected all of the defendant's claims;10   and, nevertheless, in the absence of a government11   appeal, increased the Petitioner's sentence.12               JUSTICE ALITO:  So if the Court of Appeals13   had said that the sentence that was imposed by the14   district court was unreasonable by two months and15   accepted the defendant's argument to that extent and16   then remanded, on remand the district court could have17   corrected the sentence on the gun counts.18               MS. MAYNARD:  It would have depended on how19   the mandate was worded.  But if they vacated the20   sentence in its entirety and remanded it, the district21   court could have imposed a lawful sentence at that time.22 Yes.23               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Even though the24   prosecution didn't ask for it?  I thought that you were25   relying on the division of authority between the18￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   executive, the prosecutor, and the court.  And that is 2   that a court reacts to the charges that the prosecutor 3   brings, and if the prosecutor isn't asking for a higher 4   sentence, the court has no authority to grant it. 5               MS. MAYNARD:  Yes, Your Honor.  In the court 6   of appeals that is true.  But I understood 7   Justice Alito's hypothetical to posit a situation where 8   at the defendant's request his sentence was vacated. 9   And then what the district court could do on remand10   would depend on the scope of the mandate .11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why not?  Why wouldn't12   the prosecutor still have control and say:  Judge, the13   government is asking for ten years, no more?14               MS. MAYNARD:  Before the district court,15   Justice Ginsburg, the government would be required to16   press the law.  And, as it did here, the law is that17   under 924(c) this is a second, or subsequent, conviction18   in count 10; and it is error.  Petitioner should have19   been sentenced to a second, or subsequent, sentence of20   25 years on count 10.21               So if it were back in the district court and22   the district court were free under the scope of the23   court of appeals mandate to impose sentence, then the24   government would be obligated to argue the law before25   the district court.  What --19￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, usually themandate in these cases simply says, you know, the caseis remanded to the district court.            If that's all the mandate says, does thatauthorize the district court to do the right thing underthe law?            MS. MAYNARD:  The courts of appeals havedifferent rules, Your Honor, about whether or not ageneral mandate of the type that you posit should beassumed to open up all issues for sentencing or not.            And there's actually some disagreement inthe circuit on what one assumes from a general mandate.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, actually rule 35 waschanged because it used to be based on the mandate.  Butnow rule 35 says you can reopen within seven days afterthe verdict or finding of guilty.  So that wouldindicate under the rules that the mandate is irrelevant.            MS. MAYNARD:  Well, no, Your Honor.  I thinkrule 35 speaks to what the district can do within sevendays of renouncing the sentence.  Once the sentence istimely appealed, if the defendant were to prevail or ifthe government were to prevail in a case in which thegovernment had actually appealed and it were to beremanded, then the defendant --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Within the scope of the20 - Subject to Final Review￼ - Subject to Final Review1   appeal, which brings us right back to this case.23 mandate. 4 5   mandate rule as being consistent with your general 6   theory of the case.  Because if the court of appeals 7   cannot order this kind of relief, how could it be that 8   the court of appeals' mandate would authorize the9 relief?10               It would seem to me that you've either got11   to take the position that the mandate is, in effect, a12   kind of neutral order.  The district courts may or may13   not have authority to do something after the mandate14   comes down.  But I don't see how you can take the15   position that the mandate, itself, by the court of16   appeals will, itself, determine what the district court17 can do.18               MS. MAYNARD:  Well --19               JUSTICE SOUTER:  Because, in effect, I think20   you are saying, by structuring the mandate in a certain21   way, the court of appeals can open the door to something22   that the court of appeals, itself, could not do.  But by23   structuring the mandate in a different way, the court of24   appeals can cut off the possibility of district court25   orders of a sort that the court of appeals couldn't do.21MS. MAYNARD:  Within the scope of theJUSTICE SOUTER:  I don't understand your￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   And that seems -- that is what seems to me inconsistent 2   with your theory of the limited court of appeals 3   jurisdiction. 4               MS. MAYNARD:  I don't think it is anomalous, 5   Your Honor, in a case in which the court of appeals has 6   jurisdiction over a claim, grants the requested relief, 7   and vacates the sentence.  For then, what the district 8   court can do can turn on the scope of the court of 9   appeals mandate.10               JUSTICE SOUTER:  All right.  Now, let's11   consider -- assuming that the mandate leaves open -- the12   question open entirely for the district court.13               You said ultimately what the district court14   can do depends on the mandate.  Can the court of appeals15   also by mandate say:  And by the way, district court,16   because we couldn't increase the sentence here, you17   can't do it either?  Is that open to the court of18   appeals?1920212223242522            MS. MAYNARD:  I don't know there's any courtof appeals that has held that it could do that.  It --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Then what is the play inthe mandate that you are assuming when you say itdepends on the mandate?  What the district court can dowould depend on the mandate.MS. MAYNARD:  Well, I'm not sure I￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9understand the --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Where is the -- what optiondoes the court of appeals -- given the limits on whatthe court of appeals itself can order, what are theoptions that the court of appeals has in writing themandate that will determine what the district court cando?  What are you getting at.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yeah. - Subject to Final Review            MS. MAYNARD:  I'm not sure that that's -- Idon't know the precise contours of that, Justice Souter,but if the court of appeals grants the Petitioner'srequest to vacate the sentence --10111213141516171819202122   here.23               JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yeah.24               MS. MAYNARD:  By the government?25               JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yeah.            MS. MAYNARD:  -- and then remands forresentencing, in a general way, that could leave open tothe district court the ability to resentence.JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.MS. MAYNARD:  But one --JUSTICE SOUTER:  Now you say that couldleave open -- if a mandate is general, that could leaveopen.  Can the mandate be specific in precluding?MS. MAYNARD:  Given the lack of an appeal23￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9            MS. MAYNARD:  I -- I suppose it -- it mightdo that.  I suppose it -- it might be able to do that.Here --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I don't know about yourinitial premise.  I -- I take it the policy here is thatthe defendant who appeals ought to know what's at stakein the appeal.  He shouldn't be surprised.            MS. MAYNARD:  That's right. - Subject to Final Review            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If he cross-appeals, fine;if he doesn't cross-appeal, he knows what the stakes1011 are.12               MS. MAYNARD:  That's right.13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But now you're saying that14   if the sentence is -- is vacated, they can start all15   over?  That the district court can't start all over if16   it's still in the district court.  Why should the court17   of appeals have any more authority than the district18   court does?19               MS. MAYNARD:  Well, because it -- once20   the court -- if the Petitioner -- I mean -- at any risk21   in any appeal, and this is true in civil cases, too, you22   know, if you seek a new trial on damages, for example,23   in a civil case, because of instructional error, and you24   go back, I think, you know, the jury who decides the25   damages a second time isn't bound by the first jury's24￼12345678   seek?91516171819202122232425 - Subject to Final Reviewdecision.  Any time --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the -- thedefendant who is appealing has to be very careful aboutthe relief he requests?  He says I don't want thesentence vacated; I want the sentence reduced to fiveyears instead of 10.And nothing else?  That's the only relief I                 MS. MAYNARD:  I think if the court of10   appeals finds error in the sentence it vacates under the11   -- the remedial provisions in 3742 for the -- for the12   court -- for the district court to resentence the13   Petitioner.14                 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well -- if that's the case,     if the -- if the -- if it cannot be structured by the     request for relief as the Chief Justice is suggesting,     then on the Government's theory, in a case like this, if     the defendant wins on appeal, he is in serious trouble     when that case goes back to the district court; whereas     if he loses, he can't be any worse off than he is now.                 That's a strange -- that's a strange rule.                 MS. MAYNARD:  Well, if the defendant wins in     the sentencing appeal, there -- there's always a chance     that on -- on remand, the -- the district court will25For example --￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   reconfigure the sentence. 2               JUSTICE SOUTER:  But in effect that means 3   then -- and this -- I didn't understand this to be your 4   position -- but that means, in effect, that the 5   cross-appeal rule is essentially, as you're arguing for 6   it, a formality.  It limits what the district court can 7   do, but it is not a rule that embodies the notion that 8   when a defendant appeals the defendant ought to know, in 9   effect, what he can gain and what he can lose; because10   if, on your theory, if the defendant wins and there's a11   mandate back to the district court, it is wide open.12               MS. MAYNARD:  Well, I think, you know, if13   you look at cases -- recent -- I think post-Booker for14 example --15               JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, I want to look at16   them but I want to know what your position is first.17   And I take it your position is that if the defendant18   wins, and he cannot by his request for leave limit the19   relief, as the Chief Justice suggested, then when the20   case goes back to the district court, in effect, the21   slate is totally blank and he's starting all over again22   and he is subject to -- to whatever outer limits he23   would have been subject to in the first instance.24               MS. MAYNARD:  Right.  I was going to use the25   Booker case as an example.  Post-Booker, you know,26￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9defendants have appeals, saying I was innocent, ormandatory Guidelines regime, and I want to be sentencedunder the advisory Guidelines regime.  And when those iscans have gone back, this -- courts of appeals have --most of the courts of appeals have held that thedistrict court is not bound by original sentence -- it'snot free from the mandatory Guidelines.  It can considerall the factors as instructed by the Court, and isn'tsimply decrease the sentence.  And I think --1011121314151617181920   that?21 - Subject to Final Review            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Then the cross-appeals ruleis essentially a rule of appellate court procedure andnothing more.            MS. MAYNARD:  Well, I think in thissituation, actually -- it definitely is a rule ofappellate court procedure.                 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yeah.  But --                 MS. MAYNARD:  And it's definitely a                 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But it doesn't go beyond23   district court worse off than when you began.  But the24   issue before this Court is what can a court of appeals25   do in the absence of a party pressing a claim before it.27mandatory --                 MS. MAYNARD:  I think that's correct.  If22   you succeed on your appeal you may end up in the￼ - Subject to Final Review1 And -- 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In that context, 3   aren't -- aren't you concerned about enlisting the court 4   of appeals in doing something illegal?  I mean, they 5   know that what they're authorizing, or imposing really, 6   as a sentence is illegal. 7               MS. MAYNARD:  No.  All they -- all they're 8   doing, Your Honor, as we requested, is rejecting the 9   Petitioner's claims on appeal.10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm reminded of what11   we do in statutory cases.  If one party says this is, it12   should be read A, and the other party says it should be13   read B, we've had cases where we say, well, they're both14   wrong, and we're going to read the statute as C because15   we the Court want to do the right thing.16               MS. MAYNARD:  Well, the Government is not17   agreeing that there was -- with the Petitioner there was18   no deal error.  What the Government is saying -- the19   question is -- so this is not a situation like you're20   positing, where the parties are trying to agree to the21   governing law.  This is a question of which issues are22   properly in the court of appeals to start with.23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, in my24   hypothetical they weren't agreeing.  One side was saying25   B, the other side was saying A.28￼ - Subject to Final Review 1               MS. MAYNARD:  Fair enough. 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And the right answer3 was C. 4 5   there's no disagreement about what the merits of the 6   governing law is; the question is, is that question 7   properly before the court of appeals. 8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why didn't the Government 9   cross-appeal in this case?10               MS. MAYNARD:  There's nothing in the record11   to indicate why the government didn't cross-appeal,12   Justice Ginsburg.  But there are good reasons why the13   government wouldn't cross-appeal in any given case.14   There are 8,000 plus adverse decisions against the15   government in 2007, and reasons why the government might16   not cross-appeal or appeal in a given case include the17   length of the sentence the person has already received,18   whether there's a need for clarification of a particular19   question of law, whether this is a recurring error --20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is there problem of21   getting the Solicitor General's office to authorize the22 appeal?23               (Laughter.)24               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ms. Maynard --25               MS.

I don't know that anybody says that if there is 4   not a firm rule requiring the -- a cross-appeal, I don't 5   know that anybody says that the court of appeals must 6   search the record and correct any errors below. 7               MS. MAYNARD:  Well, the amicus is 8   arguing that's the meaning of 3742 -- 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:  The statute talks about the10 general --11               MS. MAYNARD:  In general --12               JUSTICE SCALIA:  The general cross-appeal13 rule --14               MS. MAYNARD:  But there --15               JUSTICE SCALIA:  It happens all the time,16   that there's an error in the judgment which the court of17   appeals does not -- does not reach because there's no18   court -- no cross-appeal.  It's totally unexceptionable.19               MS. MAYNARD:  Exactly, Your Honor.  And that20   -- the danger to parties, in particular to the21   government in having courts reach out and arrogate to22   themselves the decision -- thank you -- the decision to23   appeal is -- is illustrated by this particular case.  In24   footnote 6 of the court of appeals opinion it recognizes25   a second error that aggrieves the government, deciding30￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   it was plain -- 2               JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I just ask this one 3   question?  This problem has been around for a long, long 4   time; and sometimes cross-appeals -- courts of appeals 5   have corrected what they thought was plain error, and 6   without a cross-appeal there. 7               Has that generated a whole lot of problems 8   over the years?  I mean there are isolated cases that 9   you've all been able to find searching 30 or 40 years of10   jurisprudence, but I don't see any widespread problem11   being generated by the courts of appeals who have12   disagreed with your view.13               MS. MAYNARD:  Well, if I could make two14   points.  The court of appeals actually found two errors15   that aggrieved the government here, Justice Stevens, and16   ruled for us only on one.  So in a case where we didn't17   notice an appeal, on an issue we did not brief, the18   court of appeals ruled against us.19               And second, I'm aware of no case in this20   Court where this Court has reached out to find plain21   error on behalf of a nonpetitioning respondent or a22   non-appealing appellate.2324   Ms. Maynard.25CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,Mr. Jorgensen.31￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425           ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY T. JORGENSEN,                    AS AMICUS CURIAE,            IN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW            MR. JORGENSEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and mayit please the Court:            There are three questions really in thiscase, and the Court need not resolve all of themdepending upon how it resolves the others, but some ofthem get lost sometimes, so I would like to state whatthe three are.            The three are first, does section 3742provide an answer?  Is it an affirmative grant of powerto the court of appeals to the Eighth Circuit to givethe right answer when the Petitioner asked them is mysentence imposed in violation of law?  Or is it a limiton the court's power telling them they cannot providehim with relief?  That's the first question.            If the Court concludes that it's neither --if a Court a court concludes either that it is a grantof jurisdiction, or rather a power -- or that it's not,that it's an affirmative limit, then the -- if the Courtconcludes that 3742 is more like 1291, just a generalappellate statute that does not give the answer here,then the Court has to go on to decide is this case -- isthis rule, this cross-appeal rule, in the criminal32 - Subject to Final Review￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   context not the civil context that is -- that is subject 2   of this 200 years of discussion, but in the criminal 3   context is it a jurisdictional limit on what the courts 4   can do or is it a rule of practice. 5               And then finally, if the Court concludes -- 6   if the Court concludes it is a jurisdictional limit, 7   then that's the end.  If the Court concludes that it is 8   a rule of practice, the final third question is:  Is it 9   a waivable rule of practice or is it a firm and10   inflexible rule of practice?  I think what often gets11   assumed.  But, of course, in Kontrick, in Bowles, the12   Court addresses the issue in that case -- in those cases13   and decides whether the rule of practice at issue in14   that case --15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Jorgensen, suppose I16   think there's a larger anterior question to all of this?17   And that is what I suggested in the colloquy with18   Ms. Howe, we have a system in which the prosecutor can19   bring charges.  The judge may think, my goodness,20   looking at this set of facts, you could have charged21 much more.22               The judge can't do that, he can't tell the23   prosecutor you have to charge "Y" in addition to "X".24   The government chooses not to appeal.  Now, what right25   does the court say, I know you didn't appeal,33￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   Government, but should have so we're going to take care 2   of it for you? 3               It seems to me that our system rests on a 4   principle of party presentation as many systems do not. 5   In many systems, the court does shape the controversy 6   and can intrude issues on its own.  But in our 7   adversarial system, we rely on counsel to do that kind 8   of thing.  So, my problem with your whole position, 9   without getting down to particular statutory provisions,10   is what business does the court have to put an issue in11   the case that counsel chose not to raise?12               MR. JORGENSEN:  The answer to that question,13   Justice Ginsburg, is multi-part, and I'll try to move14   through it quickly.  This Court had said -- made the15   very point that you made at the charging stage.  That at16   the charging stage the court -- the district court17   cannot decide what a criminal will be charged with; but18   that once the trial has proceeded to judgment, that19   prosecutorial discretion is at an end.  I wish I could20   remember the name of the case, but Justice Scalia was21   the author.22               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Me, too.23               (Laughter.)24               MR. JORGENSEN:  The point being that once a25   crime has been proven, the law kicks in, and the34￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   defendant must be sentenced in accordance with lawful. 2   The same is true on appeal.  I'm not advocating here 3   for, I think, what your question would assume, which 4   would be a roving court of jurisdiction -- a roving 5   court of appeals that could reach out and take 6   jurisdiction over a case that has not been brought to7 it. 8               Under 3742 no one questions that the court 9   has jurisdiction over the case, over the very sentencing10   issues because somebody has filed a notice of appeal and11   brought it to the court.  The only question is when the12   defendant says to the court under 3742(a)(1) was my13   sentence imposed and the statutory languages in14   violation of law, can the Eighth Circuit provide the15   right answer or is it powerless to provide the right16   answer to only provide an answer that benefits him?17               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Could we discuss -- let's18   leave aside for the moment what the background rule of19   law is and discuss whether -- I guess it was your first20   point -- whether this particular statute proscribes the21   answer, and therefore, we don't have to go any further.22               Why do you say it proscribes the answer?23               MR. JORGENSEN:  I believe that it does,24   Justice, because everybody agrees that the Sentencing25   Reform Act was a clean break with the past and imposed35￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   an entirely new regime.  So, the talk about the regime 2   of the past is somewhat beside the point. 3               So then you get down to the language itself 4   of section 3742.  Under (a), it provides that a 5   defendant may ask the court of appeals was my sentence 6   imposed in violation of law; and under (b)(1), the 7   government can raised same appeal.  Then under (d), the 8   parties certify to the court or bring to the court the 9   record that they think addresses the issue that either10   side raised; and then in (e), the court -- (e) says the11   court shall decide whether it was imposed in violation12   of law; and then (f) (1) says if the court determines13   that it was imposed in violation of law, it shall send14   it back with instructions.15               Now, the main answer to that is well,16   (f)(1) -- you have to get all the way to (f)(1) before17   you have got the answer.  And that's unsurprising.  I18   don't think any member of the court would say that the19   Eighth Circuit lacks the power, is barred from noticing20   the 924(c) error here.21               Certainly the Eighth Circuit could see it;22   certainly the Eighth Circuit could say it.  I see the23   error here.  The only question is, can it provide the24   remedy?  And that's what (f)(1) says.25               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, why would -- why36￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   would Congress want a different disposition for (f)(1) 2   than for (f)(2)?  It's clear under (f)(2) if the 3   sentence is outside the applicable guidelines and the -- 4   or if the departure is based on an impermissible factor 5   or is to an unreasonable degree or the sentence was 6   imposed for an offense for which there is no applicable 7   guideline and its plainly unreasonable, for that, it is 8   clear that if it hasn't been raised by one or the other 9   party, the court doesn't get into it.10               Why would it want a different rule for those11   two?  In other words, I'm saying that far from12   supporting your case, as your brief suggests, (f)(2) (a)13   and (a) seems to me harms your case.14               MR. JORGENSEN:  If I can give a two-part15   answer, Justice.  First, the court is not in the16   practice of overturning what the plain language says on17   a sort of legislative history or surmising what Congress18   may have been motivated by.  But even if it were, there19   is a clear answer.20               (F)(1) subsumes (a)(1) and (a)(2) and (b)(1)21   and (b)(2).  And the questions under those statutes or22   rather those provisions are legal questions.  The kind23   of questions was this sentence imposed under (a)(1),24   (b)(1) in violation of law or (a)(2), (b)(2), was it an25   incorrect application of Sentencing Guidelines?37￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            If the court of appeals gets that wrong,that's the kind of thing that's going to be imposed ineverybody else's case.  Under (3) and (4) it's thisdefendant's case.            JUSTICE BREYER:  Wait, (2)(a) and (b) Ithought -- do I not have this right, (2)(a) and (b) saythe same thing as (1)?  It says if the sentence is toohigh says the defendant's appeal, then what you do isyou vacate it and send it back with such instructions asthe court considers appropriate.            MR. JORGENSEN:  Indeed.            JUSTICE BREYER:  Subject to (g), which hasto do with the district court.            Then the other part says if it is too lowand it was the government that appealed, the court shallset it aside and send it back with such instructions asit considers appropriate, again subject to (g).            So all three say the same thing.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not if it's too high andthe defendant has appealed.            JUSTICE BREYER:  That's what --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not if it's too high andthe government has appealed.            JUSTICE BREYER:  That's right.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  If it's too high and the38 - Subject to Final Review￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   government has appealed, you don't get any relief 2   under -- under -- 3               JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, do you.  If it's too 4   high -- wait.  Wait.  If it is too -- ah. 5               (Laughter.) 6               JUSTICE BREYER:  I see. 7               MR. JORGENSEN:  You're exactly right, 8   Justice Scalia.  So the question is, why would Congress 9   say what is plainly said, which is under (f)(1)10   violations of law and incorrect applications of the11   Sentencing Guidelines, the court gives the right answer12   no matter who appeals.  But under (f)(2) Congress13   specifies it matters under this who appeals.  And the14   reason is, in those instances, it is too high in this15   defendant's case, and this defendant can be entrusted to16   forward his own cause; but under (a)(1) and (a)(2), then17   you get a court of appeals precedent that gives the18   wrong answer, if a question of law or the application of19   the Sentencing Guidelines.20               So there is a difference between (a)(1),21   (a)(2), (b)(1), (b)(2) as --22               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, that difference23   disappears if you say that, in fact, the whole thing24   assumes that the factor complained of has been brought25   to the court's attention by the proper person.  So that39￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   (f)(1) assumes that if it's the government appealing in 2   violation of law because the defendant was given too 3   little, or if it's the defendant appealing because in 4   violation of law that he was given too much, it makes 5   much more sense that way, it seems to me. 6               MR. JORGENSEN:  That -- that -- if the Court 7   were to go there, Justice, I believe that goes back to 8   you previous question of:  Should we assume or should 9   the Court believe that Congress was aware of its10 history --11               JUSTICE BREYER:  The way to do this then is12   -- is -- I see -- this section foresees basically what13   the other side is saying.  It foresees it, because it's14   a very unusual case what happened here.15               MR. JORGENSEN:  It is a very --16               JUSTICE BREYER:  So the way you should17   handle it, given this section, is the court of appeals18   would send -- I'm trying this on -- the court of appeals19   says, well, it's the defendant that appealed, who20   appealed.  He says the sentence is too high.  Given what21   we have in front us in the issues, he's right; now we've22   noticed that there's is other problems here.  So what we23   do is send it back for resentencing.  And, Judge, when24   you resentence, look at it.  And see if maybe we're25   right.  That would be a perfectly fair way to handle it,40￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425and a normal way to handle it.  Is that right?            MR. JORGENSEN:  Well, importantly, Justice,one, two, three, and four, one being:  Is it posed inviolation of law?  Two:  Is it incorrection applicationof Sentencing Guideline (c)(3)?  Or is it too high?There's a body of case law as to what kind of a field --fields fit within what category.  And the parties andthe courts of appeals are united in believing that thePetitioner's question in this case fits within (a)(1):Was his sentence imposed in vital of law.            But, as you know, the Court created thereasonableness question in Booker, and then the courtsof appeals have agreed that that fits in within(a)(1).            JUSTICE BREYER:  But you don't have --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it's not enough to say,well, we've noticed by the way we're -- you know, inlooking at the proper appeal by the proper -- mygoodness, look what we've noticed.            It's not that.  You're saying the court ofappeals has to search the record.  It has to make surethat there were no errors in favor -- or harming theother party who has not cross-appealed.            And that's a considerable burden, as JudgeBoudin's opinion on the court of appeals makes clear.            MR. JORGENSEN:  Indeed.41 - Subject to Final Review￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And it's extraordinary.            MR. JORGENSEN:  Indeed, although it is what3742 says, and I believe it's actually not thatdifferent than what happens with jurisdictional issues.The court must resolve those that are brought to it.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Precisely so.            MR. JORGENSEN:  And then the court noticesthe ones that are obvious, has a duty to look for thembecause --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which is why we have triedto pare down what is jurisdictional.            MR. JORGENSEN:  And on that question, I --before the time runs out, I want to, Justice Scalia,follow up on your question, which is:  What if the Courtassumes that 3742 does not provide the answer?  Which isI believe where you're going.            Then the Court confronts the question of, isthe cross-appeal rule jurisdictional or a rule ofpractice?  Now, the Court has provided the answer tothat once in, I believe it said, Langnes, and said thatit is a rule of practice.  And then since, there's beenobviously a long period of time.  And then the Court hashad its series of cases contra Bowles, Arbaugh.  Andunder those cases, there is no good argument that it'sjurisdictional.  The teachings of those cases is that42 - Subject to Final Review￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   the Court has used the phrases "power" and 2   "jurisdiction" too broadly, too loosely, and is now, as 3   you say, trying to cut back on those jurisdictional 4   limits.  And a rule like this can only be jurisdictional 5   if it's based on a statute, and I believe all the 6   parties agree this rule is not based on a statute. 7               So then that gets us finally to the question 8   of, if 3742 does not provide the answer and it is a rule 9   of practice, is it a mandatory rule of practice, an10   inflexible rule of practice?  Or one where the Court can11   use discretion as to whether or not to apply it when12   it's invoked?13               And the -- there can be no question that14   there are discretionary rules of practice.  Indeed, in15   Bowles, the one issue on which all nine Justices agreed16   is just that:  Justice Souter, writing for the dissent,17   would have found that that rule or practice was18   discretionary.  Justice Thomas, writing for --19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if it's20   discretionary, how would you -- I assume it's reviewable21   for abuse of discretion.22               MR. JORGENSEN:  Indeed.23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How would you know24   whether it's an abuse of discretion or not?  I mean, the25   issue is going to be the same in every case.  There was43￼10111213141516171819202122232425            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought you mightsay that.  But I mean -- - Subject to Final Review1   no cross-appeal.  If there had been, we would have2   increased the sentence, and one court of appeals says,3   well, we're not going to do it; and the other court of4   appeals says, yes, we're going to do it.                Which one is reversed for abuse of56   discretion?789            MR. JORGENSEN:  I believe the one thatrefused to correct such a plain error, obviously.(Laughter.)            MR. JORGENSEN:  But your question was, whatis the standard?  If I may, I believe that's thequestion.  And the Court has, I think, provided the --several formulations of what the standard is.  InLangnes, the Court said good cause was the standard.  InReynolds, which contrary to what Petitioner said was acase where this Court afforded relief on a sentence to acriminal Petitioner who had not brought that issue tothis --            JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, could do you this?Because this is quite helpful to me.  Reading, I startedout where Justice Scalia was at the beginning of thisargument.  I thought the district court normally has itopen, to the judge, to resentence.  Resentence is44￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425resentence.  You can't be vindictive, but that's thelimit.  That's how it works normally, I thought.            And given -- if that's so, then you look atthe three sections we just saw, try to read themtogether, and say they certainly are written with thenotion that the noticing of a plain error on the otherside is going to be few and far between if ever.            So the normal way to handle it is just whatwe said:  The judge decides on the record and the appeal-- I decide this for the defendant here.  But I'venoticed something, says the writing judge.  And ofcourse it's open on resentencing to go into that.            MR. JORGENSEN:  I --            JUSTICE BREYER:  So if you were going to dosomething other than that, in the court of appeals,you'd have to have a reason, and it would have to be afairly good reason.  So you don't close off the escapehatch because we can't all foresee the future perfectly,but you say it's going to be few and far between.            Now does that work?            MR. JORGENSEN:  I believe it does work,Justice Breyer.            JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.            MR. JORGENSEN:  And I believe it --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  This argument is not an45 - Subject to Final Review￼18 -- 19202122 23 24 25 - Subject to Final Review 1   argument under the statute?  This is an argument giving 2   your interpretation of what the background rule is? 3               MR. JORGENSEN:  I believe that's right. 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you would limit the 5   background rule to plain error? 6               MR. JORGENSEN:  Yes -- yes, Your Honor, I 7   would.  And that does not really contradict what the 8   Eighth Circuit did here.  Rule 52(b) is really another 9   formulation of the very same thing that the court said10   in Langnes; that's good cause.  In Neztsosie, it -- the11   Court phrased it "countervailing considerations" which12   outweigh the institutional interests in fair notice and13   repose.  And, of course, rule 52(b) talks about14   "fairness, integrity, and public reputation of judicial15   proceedings."  They're all different formulations of the16 same --17                 MR. JORGENSEN:  -- of the same --                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If it's such a plain     error, it's fair to to ask why the Government didn't     cross-appeal.  If you --                 MR. JORGENSEN:  There is nothing in the     record here, Justice, on that.  The Government has been     very careful not to say or urge you on reply -- to ask.46CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But if it's such a￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425I believe it was a blunder, and so to adopt --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  A blunder?            MR. JORGENSEN:  A blunder.  So, to adopt theGovernment's rule is to adopt a new -- a newexclusionary rule that the defendant goes free when theconstable blunders.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, if this were to be amore frequent occurrence, i.e., plain errors, then wewere to rule for you and court of appeals generallywould do this, then a defendant might think twiceabout appealing in a complex case.            MR. JORGENSEN:  That's true, Justice.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Because there's nothingthat could happen -- once the district court rules andthe seven days for error goes by, there's nothing thatanybody can do to raise it.            MR. JORGENSEN:  Well, the first part of yourquestion was true, Justice Kennedy, but respectfully thesecond part was not.            In the -- the way it currently works, underthe rules, a defendant must file his notice of appealbefore the Government files it.  And so, as it currentlystands, he makes his choice before he ever knows.  Thereis no extra burden that would be placed on him.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, he doesn't have to47 - Subject to Final Review￼20 appeal. 21 - Subject to Final Review 1   pursue it if the Government appeals. 2               MR. JORGENSEN:  That's exactly right.  And 3   the Government makes that point that at some point, if 4   the Government raises its appeal, he could strike a deal 5   with them.  Now, it's not correct to assume that he 6   could then unilaterally walk away because there is a 7   notice of appeal, the Government's notice of appeal.  So 8   he has to strike a deal with the Government at that 9   point.  That's no different than in this case.  At oral10   argument, the Eighth Circuit asked both parties about11   this error.  He could have struck a deal then.12               If this case turns on notice, there isn't a13   notice problem here.  It's all over the record.  It's14   raised at sentencing.  It's raised on appeal.  It's15   discussed in the briefs.  It's discussed at oral16   argument.  This error was known to all.17 Now --18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I didn't understand that19   a party couldn't voluntarily withdraw a notice of22 23 24 25            I mean, suppose the only way that the courtof appeals can get into this is because the defendanthas pursued an appeal.            Suppose this comes up and the defendantsays, oh, my goodness, I stand to get 15 more years in48￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   prison; I'm withdrawing my notice of appeal.  There's 2   nothing before the court of appeals then.  Nothing. 3               MR. JORGENSEN:  That's a critical 4   difference, Justice Ginsburg.  You're exactly right that 5   the court of appeals must have, under 3742, a notice of 6   appeal, or it has no jurisdiction. 7               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes. 8               MR. JORGENSEN:  But under the hypothetical 9   we were discussing, I perhaps assumed incorrectly.  I10   thought we were talking about the defendant files his11   notice of appeal before the Government ever files; then12   subsequently the Government files as well.  Now, if the13   defendant withdraws, there's still a notice of appeal14   before the court.15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Right.16               MR. JORGENSEN:  But if the government had17   never filed, you're exactly right that the defendant18   could take his back.  But the problem is it doesn't19   answer Justice Kennedy's question.  His question was:20   Isn't a defendant entitled to know that he's -- that the21   Government might appeal, that he might be at risk, that22   there might be a problem here?  And my point is he23   doesn't know under the current system anyway.  He has to24   make his choice before the Government ever makes its25   choice.  Now --49￼ - Subject to Final Review 1               JUSTICE SOUTER:  Mr. Jorgensen, may I take 2   you back to something you mentioned earlier in the 3   argument?  And I thought I followed it at the time, and 4   I may not have understood you. 5               As I recall, you were explaining the 6   difference between (f)(1) and (f)(2)(A) and (B) by 7   saying that in (f)(1), which was -- which does not 8   embody any condition on who has appealed -- 9               MR. JORGENSEN:  Right.10               JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- the concern is that, if11   there is an error, it's an error which will in effect12   infect all cases.  It's a circuit error, and it's13   potentially there for any case that comes along for14   sentencing; whereas, in (f)(2), if there's an error, the15   limited damage is simply to the case itself, to the16   particular defendant.17               Where I don't follow that reasoning is in18   the fact that F 1 refers not only to an incorrect -- to19   a violation of law, but incorrect application of20   sentencing guidelines, which would seem to include a --21   the particulars of a given case.  So am I either22   misunderstanding your argument or maybe misunderstanding23   subsection 1.24               MR. JORGENSEN:  Well, Justice Souter, the25   lines between A 1, 2, 3, and 4 are not as bright as they50￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   might be.  But when Congress enacted it, in response to 2   Justice Scalia's question of why might Congress have 3   done this when it wrote it, which was before Booker, 4   which introduced some additional theory as to which of 5   those four does an appeal fit within, one was:  Is it 6   imposed in violation of law? 7               And, using that clear language, you can 8   imagine the Congress would be concerned that violations 9   of law not go unremedied.10               JUSTICE SOUTER:  If that's all it said, I11   would certainly understand your distinction.12               MR. JORGENSEN:  And then 2 is an incorrect13   application of the sentencing guidelines, which, again,14   at the time of the Sentencing Reform Act were intended15   to be, I believe, mandatory.16               JUSTICE SCALIA:  So that it was a violation17 of law?18               MR. JORGENSEN:  Indeed.  There isn't that19   much of a difference between 1 and 2.  But then when you20   get to 3 and 4, then you get into the language that21   addresses the particulars of this case:  Was this22   defendant's -- was the application to this defendant too23   high based on an unreasonable fact or to an unreasonable24   degree, I believe is the --25               JUSTICE SOUTER:  I guess the problem I still51￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   have is some incorrect applications of the sentencing 2   guidelines pre-Booker were, in fact, violations of law. 3   But not all of them were, any more than all of them are 4   now.  But forget the situation now.  Not all of them5 were. 6               And I don't see how you can draw the sort of 7   nonporous distinction that you are drawing.  I mean it 8   is a good try; but even pre-Booker there are some 9   incorrect applications that could have been corrected on10   an abuse standard that were not properly described as11   violations of law per se.12               MR. JORGENSEN:  I think that's right,13   Justice Souter.  And I could only say that what we're14   doing here is we are hypothesizing why would Congress15   have said what they said; and it is a dangerous game to16   play.  But that is my best hypothesis.  But it does say17   what it says.18               Now, if I can return -- and I hope this is19   helpful -- to the questions that began the entire20   argument, which is the sentencing -- the sentence21   packaging rule or the sentencing package rule which22   Justice Breyer addressed, I believe the right answer to23   your question, Justice Stevens, is that under the way24   the sentencing package rule works, which is applied, I25   believe, by all circuits, is that if any part of a --52￼ - Subject to Final Review 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:  What do we mean by the 2   "sentencing packaging rule"? 3               MR. JORGENSEN:  That's a very good question, 4   Justice Scalia.  Under section 3553(a) after the 5   Sentencing Reform Act was imposed, judges were -- 6   district judges were empowered and given the obligation 7   to build a sentence that took into consideration a 8   number of competeding factors such that you might, if 9   you were a judge, a district judge, reduce a sentence10   under one count of an indictment if you were going to11   give more under another; and you put together a12   sentencing package; and then that's the sentence that13   the defendant receives.14               And then when that goes up on appeal, if any15   part of that package is undone, the whole package is16   undone.  This is the rule that the circuits follow.17               To your question, Justice Ginsburg, I don't18   believe they have a precedent of this Court to fall --19   to base that on.  But it is the rule that is nearly20   uniformly followed.  So then when the case goes back to21   the district court, the district court is free to22   construct a new sentence.23               So, as here, if the defendant had prevailed24   in any way, then back on remand the district judge could25   have imposed the same sentence.53￼123456   right?78 910111213141516171819202122232425            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Getting what he deserves,            MR. JORGENSEN:  Exactly.  And that can't bedone.  But, otherwise, with that narrow exception, thesentence can be exactly the same, even though thedefendant prevailed on appeal.            Now, that played out exactly in this case.In this case, when it went back to the district court,the defendant said to the district court:  Don't give memore.  You can fit the new fifteen years within what Ialready have.  Give me what I already have.            And the District Judge said:  No.  I'm goingto give you more.            Now, the answer clearly, I think, cannotturn on the fact that the Seventh -- excuse me -- theEighth Circuit knew the answer.  We had some questionsabout what if the Eighth Circuit said:  Well, I see anerror here, but I don't know how it affects yoursentence, so I am sending you back.  Would that be okay?            But it can't turn on the -- that the SeventhCircuit knew in this instance that he would get an54 - Subject to Final Review            Now, a limit on that, Justice Scalia, is thevindictiveness cases.  That if there is any evidencethat the increased sentence, making the sentence thesame or more is as a -- you know, it's a pay back --￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   increased sentence as versus it would be okay to send it 2   back without saying what the effect would be for the 3   district judge to impose. 4               And, Justice Kennedy, your question was: 5   What happens if there's a new trial?  As my children 6   would say, it is a complete do-over.  When the trial 7   starts all over again, new facts are found or not found, 8   and the sentence is completely constructed all over 9   again based on the facts as found by the jury in the10   second trial.11               If I can end, Justices, I would end by12   saying that I believe section 3742 does provide the13   answer here.  Congress provided a clean break with the14   past.  The idea that Congress was aware of a clear rule15   that they would have followed, I think, is contradicted16   by Reynolds, where this Court did the opposite; Langnes,17   where this Court said that the cross-appeal rule was a18   rule of practice, not a jurisdictional limit; and the19   confusion in the courts of appeals.20               I believe the answer to your question,21   justice Scalia, on whether it is well-established is22   that in the civil context I believe the D.C. Third,23   Fourth, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits say that this is a24   rule of practice while the Senate has debated it back25 and forth.55￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            And in Neztsosie the Court noted thisconfusion and noted, indeed, that some of the circuitsare internally inconsistent as to what the rule is.            It is slightly different in the criminalcontext.  I believe the Eighth and the Tenth Circuitshave not followed -- have not followed the rule, whilethe Second, Third, Fourth and Seventh have; and theFifth is internally inconsistent.  I may -- I may havesome error, honestly, in that recitation.  I did it frommemory when you asked.            But my point, I think, comes through nomatter what, which is:  How could Congress have assumedthis is a clear rule and, when we write these words, thecourts will know that's what we mean, when there's allthis confusion amongst the courts?            Thank you, Your Honors.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.            Ms. Howe, you have two minutes remaining.                REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF AMY HOWE                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER            MS. HOWE:  Mr. Chief Justice, I have twopoints.  The first is that the amicus argues thatsubsection (e) of section 3742 provides the answer inthis case:  That upon a review of the record the Courtof Appeals shall determine.  And so his argument is that56 - Subject to Final Review￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425this authorizes and, in fact, requires the court ofappeals to determine whether any of the errors that areoutlined in subsection (e) have occurred.  But (e) can'tpossibly be this sort empowering, roving, free-standingauthority that the amicus believes it is.            Because if you look at the language ofsubsection (e), all it provides -- and this Court hasrecognized that it merely provides the scope of review-- that, upon review of the record, the court of appealsshall determine.  It doesn't say anything about whethera notice of appeal has been filed, how the record gotthere.  And to figure out those things you have to lookat the structure of the statute.            And when you look at the structure of thestatute, it is clear that subsections (a) and (b) arethe provisions that provide for appellate jurisdictionin sentencing cases.            Amicus also tries to argue that, you know --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  (E) also contradicts (f) --            MR. HOWE:  (F)(2)and then --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- (2)(A) and (B) becausein some of those cases it doesn't determine that if theappeal has been brought by the wrong party.            MS. HOWE:  That's absolutely right.  Thatmerely provides the remedy, Justice Scalia.57 - Subject to Final Review￼ - Subject to Final Review 1               And the amicus tries also to argue that this 2   is not some sort of free-standing, roving appellate 3   authority.  That, you know, for example, if the case is 4   brought under (A)(1), a violation of law, the court of 5   appeals only needs to determine whether it is a 6   violation of law.  But he also argued that the court of 7   appeals is not obligated to scour the record for errors. 8   It is only to notice plain error. 9               But if one should start placing these10   limits, these limits come from subsections (a) and (b)11   and the background of traditional appellate practice.12   And once you start placing these limits which do not13   appear in the text on subsection (e), the entire14   construction falls apart.15               The second point I would make is that the16   amicus argues that, somehow, section 3742 represents as17   a break from the past; that Congress did not have in18   mind the background of this well- established appellate19   procedure.  But in section 3742 Congress made clear --20   may I finish -- it was only providing for limited21   appellate review.22               And if you are going to treat sentencing23   cases differently in light of this court's historic24   practice of construing the availability of government25   appeals narrow rate, you need to treat -- you need to be58￼10111213141516171819202122232425            (Whereupon, at 11:09 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.) - Subject to Final Review1   even more reluctant to deviate --                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Miss23   Howe.456789            Mr. Jorgensen, you have briefed and arguedthis case as an amicus curiae in support of the judgmentbelow on appointment by the Court.
