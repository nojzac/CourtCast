Stuart.          Mr. Gray.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. GRAY               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. GRAY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:In cases involving safety exigencies, anactions should be judged against a singlestandard of reasonableness, that is, whetherand circumstances known to the officers atofficer'sobjectivethe factsthe time of entry would warrant a reasonable person inbelieving that immediate intervention is needed topreserve the peace and protect others from harm.  Whenofficers have reason to believe that violence isimminent or ongoing, they meet that standard.In this case, the Brigham City officersto a complaint at 3:00 a.m. and, uponwitnessed a violent and tumultuous strugglerespondedarriving,between four adults and a teenager.  The officers --when the juvenile threw a punch is when the officersacted and thereby prevented injury.  This is exactlywhat we would expect officers to do.31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SCALIA:  What were they doing in theyard anyway?  This sort of occurred to me.  Theycouldn't have seen that until they went into the fencedbackyard violating the curtilage of the property.  How-- was that justified?          MR. GRAY:  Yes, it was justified.  At thattime what they heard from the curb side and then fromthe front was the same kind of violence going on.  Theyheard that from -- from the time they arrived all theway.  They -- they heard the thumping, the shouting,someone saying, get off me, stop, stop.  And so whatthese officers were doing, in the course of that, isinvestigating that -- that, and it led them to thebackyard.Now --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is any less required to --to go into the curtilage than is required to go intothe house?          MR. GRAY:  No.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  No.  It's the same test?          MR. GRAY:  Yes.  And again, that was --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you say that even if hedidn't see him throw the punch and -- and draw blood,they could have gone in just because they heardsomebody say, stop, stop, get off me?41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. GRAY:  It's our position that they couldhave, though that's a much closer case.  In this case,the officers acted in a very guarded manner.  I mean,they -- they proceeded and they investigated step bystep and, in fact, did not enter until a punch wasthrown and there was --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  So what -- what you'resaying is they've got to have a reasonable ground totake the first step.  That may not be a reasonableground to have taken the second step right then andthere, but it's the same reasonableness standard.          MR. GRAY:  Yes, it is.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  That's -- that's --          MR. GRAY:  Yes.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  One thing that was leftout of the succession of acts -- Utah provides fortelephone warrants, and there was no attempt to dothat.  Once they checked to -- to determine that therewas probable cause to enter, they could have called fora warrant, but they didn't.  Is there a reason why theydidn't?          MR. GRAY:  Yes.  The reason is where there'sa violent situation, things can change in seconds.  Imean, it can turn deadly in seconds.  They don't havetime.  Even though a telephonic warrant would certainly51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425be a more speedy process of getting a warrant, it's notspeedy enough where punches are being thrown.  I mean,it can turn deadly, one blow could give someone aconcussion or even rupture a spleen.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you don't -- youreally mean that if they saw somebody inside with                                        don't                                        a gun                                        in 2MR. GRAY:  No, not at all.JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, you -- you don'tand theyminutes,warrant,warrant?want theup the ante on -- on what it takes to -- for theto go in without a warrant, do you?heard him saying, I'm going to shoot yousince they could have gotten a telephonethey would have to had to get a telephone-- the telephone warrant requirement to-- to police          MR. GRAY:  No.  In fact, precisely forreason, the officers would not need a telephonicwarrant in that situation no more than they would needa telephonic warrant in this situation.  Time is of theessence.  Violence --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it wouldn't be of theessence if you know you have 2 minutes. You know I'm goingto kill you in 2 minutes.          MR. GRAY:  Well, that -- that's --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you really want the61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-that￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425policeman to say I got 2 minutes, you know, dial in andget a warrant?  That's ridiculous.(Laughter.)          MR. GRAY:  That -- that would be assuming --that would be assuming that you could take someone whois threatening in that manner at his word.  I don'tthink that's something the officers could -- couldafford to do.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Are the police instructed-- the city police instructed about when the telephonewarrant procedure is appropriate?          MR. GRAY:  That I -- I do not know.  I assumeso.  They have procedures in place, but that I do notknow.          JUSTICE ALITO:  When you speak about aviolent situation, would that be limited -- would thatapply here just because a punch was thrown, or would itbe enough that the officers saw some men restrainingthe young man, or would it be enough if there wereviolent words being exchanged?          MR. GRAY:  With -- with violent words,generally not, though if it's accompanied with a showof immediate force or violence, then yes, in thatsituation.In this situation, I believe that officers 71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425could have entered prior to the punch being thrown.What they witnessed is -- is this violent strugglebetween four adults and a teenager.  They had no ideawhether or not they were trying to molest the -- theteenager or whether the teenager was an intruder orwhat happened.  But they could tell that it wasviolent.  They knew that alcohol was involved based onthe circumstances as they approached.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Did they know that minorswere involved?  The record doesn't show that, at leastin the preliminary direct exam of the officer.          MR. GRAY:  That minors were involved?          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.  I mean, they knewthat once they got into the backyard.  Did they knowbefore they got into the backyard?          MR. GRAY:  They knew that minors --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Or did they just know thatminors stay up late at night?          MR. GRAY:  They knew that minors were in thebackyard.  They -- they witnessed the two juveniles.They did not know that --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that's after they wentinto the backyard.          MR. GRAY:  No.  They saw that from thedriveway, through the -- the slit -- slit -- slats in81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 the fence.2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: They could see that they3 were minors.4 MR. GRAY: Yes, yes.5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How much -- you've6 been focusing on the violence because of the punch7 being thrown, but I gather they were called originally8 because of concern about the noise and disturbance of9 the peace101112 basis for13 proceed from there?14 1516 shouting.17 It's 3:0018 that enough?1920 the State21 proffered22 That would be a different justification for their23 actions. Certainly where they're disturbing the24 neighbors, we would argue that the expectation of25 privacy had diminished in that home because of that91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-and all that.MR. GRAY:  Yes.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is that a sufficientthem to have gone into the backyard andMR. GRAY:  Well --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  They're just There are five people in the house shouting.in the morning or whatever.  Is that -- isMR. GRAY:  Probably not, certainly not whereis -- where the State offers as -- as thejustification safety, it would not be enough.￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425disturbance.  But again, where the State -- or wherethe city is offering as a justification safety, thatwould not be sufficient to go in.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but if -- if the -- ifthe complaint were -- were simply a complaint of noise,and they got to the -- the gate, the back fence, andthey could hear all the racket inside and there didn'tseem to be any practical way to get people to come tothe fence to talk to them, wouldn't they have had theright to go through the gate and at least go up to thedoor and bang on the door?          MR. GRAY:  Yes.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  So they could have gottenthrough the curtilage.  They could at least have gottento the back door based entirely on noise.          MR. GRAY:  Yes.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.          MR. GRAY:  Yes.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Except that there was afront door, which they approached first.  As I recall,they leftthe frontone of the officers in the front.MR. GRAY:  Yes.JUSTICE SCALIA:  So they could have banged ondoor.MR. GRAY:  They -- they could have, though101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 the evidence was that -- and the trial court found that2 it was so loud and tumultuous that nobody would have3 heard it or probably would not have heard it.4 JUSTICE STEVENS: But I'm a little puzzled.5 If the noise is the cause of their being there and if6 the noise is so loud at 3:00 in the morning that it's7 still continuing and nobody can hear the knock on the8 door -- they knock on the door several times and shout9 -- would they not have the right to go in then to quell10 the noise?11 MR. GRAY: Absolutely. All that I am12 maintaining is that they would not be justified under a13 safety exigency to go in. Certainly to -- as far as14 disturbing the peace, then yes, but not where the15 proffered justification is safety.16 JUSTICE STEVENS: So if you're going to rely17 on the safety and the -- safety and the danger of harm,18 how serious does the harm have to be? And I use the19 word harm as defining the -- the threshold for this20 kind of entry. What if a father was spanking his child,21 for example?22 MR. GRAY: No. Spanking of a child would23 not. There's no indication under most circumstances of24 an intent to injure or abuse. Now, of course, if there25 are circumstances that would suggest abuse, then111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 officers could go in.2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Doesn't yelling so3 loudly you can't hear police knock at the door at 3:004 in the morning suggest that violence is at least5 imminent or may well be associated with what they're6 hearing?7 MR. GRAY: It certainly approaches that, but8 again, what we would maintain is there probably has to9 be more than simple shouting. If -- if it's10 accompanied by threats or a show of force or violence,11 then certainly they could go in.12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there, in addition to the13 safety rationale which you're -- justification, which14 you're arguing here -- is there a justification to go15 in to stop an ongoing felony whether safety is involved16 or not?17 MR. GRAY: Yes.18 JUSTICE SCALIA:19 MR. GRAY: Yes.20 JUSTICE SCALIA:21 turning out counterfeit dollar bills, $100 bills, and22 can you go in right away if you see him doing that?23 MR. GRAY: Well, it's a crime ongoing, in24 progress. So there certainly could be made an25 argument. Now, whether or not there's an exigency, I 121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-Is -- is that a separate --That --I mean, you see a guy￼1 think that's doubtful because police could secure the2 scene and secure a warrant and then execute that3 warrant.4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean, but if that's5 the case, you have a much easier argument. Wasn't6 there an assault here? There was clearly an assault.7 MR. GRAY: Yes, and certainly where officers8 have reason to believe that there's an ongoing assault,9 officers can enter.10 Now, one of the problems with the Utah11 Supreme Court's holding in this case --12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In connection with the13 answer you just gave, it doesn't matter then? If it's14 an ongoing crime, they can go in? It doesn't matter15 whether it would be a misdemeanor or a felony? It16 doesn't matter how grave the crime is?17 MR. GRAY: Well, this Court in Welsh18 indicated that minor offenses -- you couldn't rely on19 the exigent circumstances exception, or at least it is20 what it suggested. But certainly an assault, under21 Utah law, is a class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to22 6 months in jail, and that's certainly of sufficient23 gravity to justify officers entering.24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Any kind of assault.25 I gather it's an assault if you're just sort of a131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 couple of guys pushing each other back and forth.2 MR. GRAY: Well, under Utah law, an assault3 is defined as unlawful force or violence so as to --4 with an intent to do bodily injury. Now, pushing --5 there's not that there.6 Now, one of the chief problems or primary7 problems with the Utah court's decision in this case is8 it creates a complicated and confusing bifurcated9 standard that forces officers unrealistically to choose10 between roles, to choose whether or not they are going11 to enter and act as caretakers or enter and act as law12 enforcement officials.13 Well, the reality -- first of all, it's --14 it's very difficult for officers to try to make those15 kind of judgments in the heat of the moment, and this16 is precisely the kind of a -- the kind of case where17 that would be impossible to achieve because officers in18 this case are acting clearly under both roles. They're19 stopping crime and they are also protecting others from20 harm. We want officers to rescue people from harm when21 they have a reasonable basis to do it, not wait until22 you have to call an EMT. That's what Mincey provides.23 And if there are no further questions, I24 would reserve the remainder of my time.25 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just ask this one141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425question, if I may, if you have -- did the other sidepreserve the right to challenge this entry under theUtah constitution?          MR. GRAY:  No, they did not, and -- and theUtah Supreme Court recognized that.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.          General McNulty.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. MCNULTY             ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,       AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER          MR. MCNULTY:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,may it please the Court:          The Fourth Amendment does not require policeofficers to stand by and be a spectator to escalatingviolence in the home when such an officer has anobjectively reasonable basis to believe, given thetotality of the circumstances, that prompt action isnecessary to prevent imminent harm.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if there were nopunch in this case, would they have had a sufficientbasis?  3:00 in the morning, loud shouting.  Can theyconclude, based on their experience, that's likely toescalate into violence and enter on that basis?          MR. MCNULTY:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.  Inthese facts, the Government suggests they would.151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          The -- under the Fourth Amendment, a policeofficer may enter a residence --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, that's just becauseit's loud?  Suppose they were just singing andlaughing?          MR. MCNULTY:  Well, it would depend on -- if-- if words are going to be the key --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  One thing leads to another.Right?          MR. MCNULTY:  Well, that's correct.  Itdepends upon, of course, what those words are.  It'sreally a combination of the words and the context ofthe words.  Here you have --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So there has to be someindication of the likelihood of escalation intoviolence?          MR. MCNULTY:  Correct, Your Honor.  That's --that's --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, why?  What if they'rejust so loud that it's perfectly obvious they'rekeeping -- getting -- the neighbors are awake anddisturbed by it.  Does it have to be a threat ofviolence?          MR. MCNULTY:  Well, Your Honor, if there's aloud noise alone, certainly the neighborhood shouldn't161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425have to be a hostage to that noise, and the policeofficers may be acting reasonably to do what isnecessary to end that noise.  But it's going to --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  So then it doesn't matterwhat's being said.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So then it does matter.          MR. MCNULTY:  But the -- what's being saidmay determine -- may determine -- whether or not entryis necessary to respond to an imminent threat where aprompt response is critical.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  It may determine what isnecessary to prevent harm, but what if it's notnecessary to prevent harm, just necessary to preventnoise?          MR. MCNULTY:  Then it may still bereasonable.  It may still be reasonable, Your Honor.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  It seems to me the harminquiry in this case is, you know, sort of superfluous.We don't even have to look at that.          MR. MCNULTY:  I agree, Your Honor.  It may bethat the -- the noise alone could justify thecircumstance.  Certainly we wouldn't want a test thatexcluded words only --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, no.  You -- you don'twant to say that.  The noise alone wouldn't justify171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425going in without knocking as would the -- a scene of aviolent event occurring.  Certainly you'd have to knockon the door.  Now, if they didn't hear you and the onlyway to get their attention to stop the noise isin, fine, but wouldn't you have to knock on thereal hard before you went in to stop the noise?          MR. MCNULTY:  Justice Scalia, in mostknock on the door would -- would be appropriateto do.to go doorcases a thing          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not appropriate.  Necessary.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Necessary.          MR. MCNULTY:  Well, it may very well benecessary depending upon the totality of thecircumstances.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I hope so.  I mean -- people--          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes, but we've got a casein which knocking on the -- the noise is so loud nobodycan hear the knock.          MR. MCNULTY:  That's why a knock on the doormay not always be the right thing to do.  In some casesit could be a futile gesture.  In this case, the policeannounced themselves and were not heard because of thattumultuous --JUSTICE STEVENS: And they did knock on the 181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 door, yes.2 MR. MCNULTY: They entered and announced3 their presence, and they were not heard when they did4 that. So the knock is -- is normally the appropriate5 course, but in certain circumstances, the knock may6 either be futile, it could be dangerous, depending upon7 what was happening, and it certainly could waste some8 time if it was a dire emergency.9 The -- under the Fourth Amendment, a police10 officer may enter a residence without a warrant when a11 reasonable officer could conclude, given again all the12 circumstances, that an impending threat to life or13 safety justifies immediate intervention and the scope14 of the intrusion is reasonable in relation to the15 nature of 1617 motivated18 relevance19 situations involving violence in the home can escalate20 in -- in seconds, and the on-the-scene, split-second21 judgment about exactly when the police officers should22 intervene is precisely what the totality of thethe emergency.Whether the officer was subjectivelyto enforce the law or render aid has noin a constitutional inquiry.  Volatile23 circumstances test has long addressed and resolves the24 balance of the Fourth Amendment values.25 And this Court's recent decision in Georgia191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 v. Randolph contains a clear expression of concern for2 the need for the police to take prompt action to3 prevent harm in domestic violence cases.4 In this case --5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This wasn't -- this wasn't6 a domestic violence case. It wasn't anybody inside7 calling the police and crying, danger, rescue me. It8 was an outsider who complained about the noise. So I9 am wondering why you are emphasizing the prevent10 somebody from being hurt instead of they're disturbing11 the peace and the police have a right to protect the12 neighborhood. It seems to me that that's an easier13 argument to make.14 MR. MCNULTY: It is, Justice Ginsburg, to15 look at the -- the threat to the quiet of the community16 as one aspect of this. But the case contains even17 more. The case contains a punch that did some harm to18 another person in a kitchen setting where there is a19 strong possibility of escalating violence. It's the20 additional facts of that violence that was a potential21 there, added to the noise and the evidence of underage22 drinking, that made the totality of the circumstances23 objectively reasonable for the officers to --24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, counsel, let's25 suppose you have a police officer who knows there's201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 evidence in this house, but he doesn't have probable2 cause to get a warrant. And he also knows that the3 family is going to be reenacting the murder scene from4 some movie as part of the family reunion. And so he's5 there just at the time where the -- in the scene the6 one guy says, and now I'm going to kill you with this7 knife, and he says, ah, and he goes in.8 Now, subjectively we know that he has no9 basis for fearing violence, but a reasonable officer on10 the scene, hearing somebody say I'm going to kill you11 with this 1213 or not? 14knife, would have a basis for entering.So under your test, is that entry permissibleMR. MCNULTY:  Permissible, Mr. Chief Justice.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Really.MR. MCNULTY:  Because there the officer is151617 unaware of the fact based upon the -- as I understood18 the facts19 not --2021 He knows.22 reunion.23presented, unaware of the fact that that isCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, no.  He knows. He heard this is what they do at the familyThey always reenact this.(Laughter.)CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So he knows that2425 there's no -- well, but that's the difference here211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 between looking at the subjective motivation or what an2 objective, you know, officer would understand.3 MR. MCNULTY: If the officer has specific4 information --5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.6 MR. MCNULTY: -- a fact knowing that this is7 not truly an imminent threat or necessary to prompt a8 quick response, then that would be a fact in the9 totality of the circumstances that wouldn't justify.10 But, on the other hand --11 JUSTICE SOUTER: So you're saying the12 objective -- the -- the objective officer always knows13 at least as much as the officers actually know.14 JUSTICE SCALIA: A good way to put it.15 MR. MCNULTY: The -- the officer knows --16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't -- isn't that your17 standard?18 MR. MCNULTY: Well, if -- I'm not sure if I19 understand the question. Would you please repeat it?20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. I -- I thought you21 were getting to the point of saying that on the22 objective test that you urge, the officer -- the23 objective police officer who sets the standard is24 deemed to know at least as much as the officer on the25 scene actually knows. In other words, we don't exclude221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425information --          MR. MCNULTY:  Right.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- from our objective testwhen the officer actually has that information.          MR. MCNULTY:  That's correct.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.          MR. MCNULTY:  What makes it difficult attimes is that you often have two officers.  One mayknow something, another may not know it.  And that'swhy objective information is --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Except I -- I don't think welook to whether he knew that this was a familyreenactment.  I think we look to the facts that he had-- that had come to his attention which caused him tobelieve that this was a family reenactment.  I mean,you know, if he had read it in a newspaper or somethingelse.  The facts are -- are what matter and not --          MR. MCNULTY:  Thank you, Justice Scalia.That's -- I agree that that is going to -- even whatthe officer believes he knows may be subject to error,and therefore, the objective test pulls us out of thisquestion of knowing the officer's mind and allows us tolook at the totality of the circumstances, what reallywas occurring and determine whether or not thereasonable officer would be able to enter231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 constitutionally under those circumstances.23 there was4 wanted to5 significant factor in determining whether or not the6 officer could enter. Specifically, the court looked to7 the motive or intent of the officer to render aid as8 one way to analyze the situation. And the government9 argued that those distinctions -- or the distinction10 between rendering aid or entering for a law enforcement11 purpose is really a -- an unnecessary distinction12 because the officer, as the counsel for the State has13 argued, is acting in a split-second situation, seeking14 -- thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice.151617181920 it please 21CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, General.Mr. Studebaker, we'll hear now from you.ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL P. STUDEBAKER     ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSMR. STUDEBAKER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and maythe Court:There's two bases or two exceptions whichAnd here again is the -- a situation wheremounting evidence, and the court in Utahmake the motivation of the officer a22 would allow somebody to enter into somebody's home,23 which are before the Court today, one being the24 emergency aid exception to the warrant requirement, the25 other one being exigent circumstances requirements for241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 the warrant.2 Under the facts of this case, neither one of3 those situations apply. Under exigent circumstances,4 there has to be probable cause to enter, and there has5 to be a warrant to enter. And if neither one of those6 -- actually under exigent circumstances, there has to7 be probable cause and there has to be the requirement8 that there be imminent danger basically to evidence or9 to the person. And if there's not exigent circumstances,10 and the officers have an obligation to obtain a warrant11 based upon probable cause to enter the home.12 JUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what --13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that probable14 cause was conceded, and I thought that the Utah courts15 didn't question that there was probable cause.16 MR. STUDEBAKER: Your Honor, the -- what17 happened was that the Utah courts found that the18 probable cause was there for the emergency aid19 exception, but I believe under the exigent20 circumstances requirement -- or the exception, that21 probable cause was not there to get out -- or actually22 to get into the home on the situations.23 But even if probable cause is conceded, the24 fact is that the facts of the case don't rise to the25 level of requiring such as immediate entry into a home251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 to bypass the warrant requirement.2 JUSTICE SOUTER: May -- may I just get back3 to your general statement? Do I understand you to say4 that if they arrived on the scene and, you know, a5 really wild party was going on at 3:00 a.m., they knock6 at the door, nobody answers the door, they can't hear7 it for all the screaming and the music and so on, that8 under those circumstances, the police could not go in9 to -- to quiet things down?10 MR. STUDEBAKER: Correct, Your Honor. They11 would actually have to go out and get a warrant to12 enter the home. There's not an exigent circumstance13 under the facts that you presented which would require14 them to enter the home and bypass the warrant15 requirement. It's not severe enough under those facts.16 JUSTICE ALITO: Let's say they -- they see a17 fight going on. What kind of calculation do you think18 has to go on in the mind of the officer? They have to19 think, well, let me look at these people. Do they look20 like they're -- they're strong enough to really hurt21 each other? How likely is it that they're going to22 grab some object that's lying around, a knife, a23 baseball bat, or something, and -- and escalate the24 violence? What -- what sort of thought process do you25 think a reasonable officer is supposed to go through in261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that situation?2 MR. STUDEBAKER: Justice Alito, what the3 officer is required to do is to weigh the totality of4 the circumstances and make a decision based upon the5 totality of what they see. And unfortunately, these6 situations are always fact-intensive based upon what's7 seen on the scene. And in the case presented here8 before the Court, none of those facts are presented9 that -- that would actually weigh and that was going to10 escalate into that type of situation.11 The officers actually had personal, firsthand12 knowledge of the events that were happening. They13 stood outside the home. They watched the event14 transpire through the window. The exigency was over15 when the officer entered the home.16 JUSTICE BREYER: Why can't you? Is there any17 case or anything that says you don't look at the whole18 circumstance to decide if it was reasonable to enter?19 I mean, suppose I just wrote an opinion, for a20 hypothetical's sake, that says, look, there was so much21 noise at 3:00 in the morning nobody could even hear a22 knock and he looks in the window, sees one of the -- a23 kid there being held, who's obviously been drinking24 under age. He takes a swing at somebody else and pokes25 him in the nose and blood starts to run or -- and under271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 those circumstances, of course, it was reasonable to go2 in. End of the matter.3 MR. STUDEBAKER: Except for the fact, Your4 Honor, I mean, the -- the situation we have is that is5 -- it would depend on whether it's an ongoing situation6 or not. And in the facts presented here, it was not an7 ongoing situation. It ended and then the officer --8 JUSTICE BREYER: You mean -- you mean the9 noise stopped?10 MR. STUDEBAKER: It -- shortly after the11 smack in the face by the juvenile, Your Honor, the12 officer entered the home, and by his testimony, it13 abated right after he entered the home.14 JUSTICE BREYER: No. The question is whether15 he could go into the house, and are you saying that16 before he went into the house, all the noise stopped?17 MR. STUDEBAKER: It had not stopped. No, it18 had not, Your Honor.19 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So my question is I'm20 interested in the law of it. Why can't I -- what's --21 what -- the -- the Constitution says reasonable or22 unreasonable, forbids an unreasonable entry, search.23 So this doesn't seem unreasonable. A policeman isn't a24 lawyer. He just has to do what's reasonable in the25 circumstance. It's a huge -- well, I would be281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425repeating myself.  But what I want to know is what inthe law makes that opinion wrong?          MR. STUDEBAKER:  Your Honor, what makes thatopinion wrong, based upon the facts that werepresented, is the fact that the -- there was no warrantachieved in the situation.  Ifunder exigent circumstances --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Andwhy he didn't want to go get athe officer is enteringthere are two reasons                               warrant.  It would takeabout half an hour, at which time all the neighbors areawake, and they have to lose an hour of sleep.  And inaddition to that, the underage drinking will continuefor another half an hour or an hour.  And in additionto that, somebody else might get poked in the nose.  Sothose are the reasons why -- or worse.  So those arethe reasons why he thought it was reasonable to go in.          MR. STUDEBAKER:  That may be what he thought,not the officer --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Those are the reasons why itwas reasonable to go in.opinion?          MR.opinion, YourSTUDEBAKER:  What's wrong with theHonor, is it still requires a warrant29 Washington, DC 20005 1-1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400MR. STUDEBAKER:  Yes, Your Honor.JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, what's wrong with that￼1 under the situation.2 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, suppose I were to say3 at the end of that it doesn't require a warrant because4 it was not unreasonable objectively to go in under5 those circumstances. What I'm looking for you to do is6 to tell me why.7 MR. STUDEBAKER: Your Honor, the -- if8 they're going to enter the home, there has to be,9 obviously, a serious situation that's going to arise.10 And so with the -- the presentation which you11 presented, it's not serious enough to require the12 sidestepping of a warrant in the situation.13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Studebaker, I'm not sure14 that even the noise wasn't enough to justify what the15 police did here. As -- as I recall, they -- before16 they went in, they -- they heard all this noise and17 they saw the punch. They pushed open the screen door18 and announced that they were the police. Okay?19 MR. STUDEBAKER: Yes.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: And then only went in when21 nobody heard them. Then they shouted even louder,22 police. I'm not sure that -- that just the noise23 wouldn't be enough to allow that. If you can't hear24 the policeman from the door, who's coming to check25 about a 3:00 a.m. noisy party, you don't hear his knock301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 on the door, can the policeman not open the door and2 shout, police? Is that an unreasonable search and3 seizure.4And then if you don't hear that, can he takeinto the house?  He's -- he's not lookingcarpets.  He's not looking in the deskHe's just shouting police so that he can5 two steps6 under the7 drawers.8 bring to the attention of the people there the fact9 that there's been a complaint from the neighbors and10 you have to knock off the noise. I -- I would think11 that's perfectly reasonable. Never mind the punch in12 the nose.13 MR. STUDEBAKER: Justice Scalia, and you14 asked whether I thought it was reasonable or not, and I15 would say it's not. The -- the -- to bypass that16 warrant requirement, to enter the home under an exigent17 circumstances, which is what they were there for, it's18 got to be more serious than a -- a loud party, the19 situation.20 And ironically, the -- the testimony of the21 officer, which I guess there was a dispute about22 whether that was there or not because it's not23 specifically in the findings that the trial judge made24 or the two appellate courts ruled on -- but if the25 officer entered the home and shortly after that, I 311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 mean, he opened the door, according to his testimony,2 and announced, basically raised his voice, and they3 heard him, why cannot he have done that outside the4 home? And that's the situation. This wasn't a serious5 enough situation that he couldn't have made the effort6 to make his presence known outside.7 JUSTICE SCALIA: They didn't hear him when he8 -- when he just opened the screen door. He had to step9 in a few more -- a few more steps. Then they finally10 heard him. That's his -- the way I understand these11 facts.12 MR. STUDEBAKER: And, Justice Scalia, he also13 had to raise his voice, and our contention --14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, he had to raise15 his voice. I mean, there was a lot of noise going.16 It just seems to me so unreasonable, when a17 policeman comes to tell people they're making too much18 noise and the neighbors have complained, that he can't19 do the minimum that's necessary to get their attention20 so he can tell them that. He has to go get a warrant21 to tell them that the neighbors are complaining about22 too much noise? That just seems absurd.23 MR. STUDEBAKER: Yes, Your Honor, he would24 have to get a warrant. And -- and the requirement --25 JUSTICE BREYER: Does it say that in a case321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425somewhere, or is that just your opinion?          MR. STUDEBAKER:  It's my opinion, Your Honor.          JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now, what Iwould like to know is what does it say in a casebecause I -- I agree, at 3:00 in the morning, it mightnot appear to many people to be unreasonable when theparty is so loud that no one can sleep, that they haveto take an extra hour or half an hour or 40 minutes tojust tell the people inside the house, knock it off.Now, is there a case somewhere that says -- I guess, wecould take a poll or something, but isthat casts some light on this?          MR. STUDEBAKER:  Your Honor,itself requires the -- the seriousnessthere a caseI believe Minceyof the offensebe evaluated, and further          JUSTICE BREYER:          MR. STUDEBAKER:          JUSTICE BREYER:that in this Court?  Yes?          MR. STUDEBAKER:          JUSTICE BREYER:-- Which case? Mincey v. Arizona. Was that involving a -- isYes.                           And was that involving aparty or noise, or what was it involving?          MR. STUDEBAKER:  No, it was not involving aparty or noise.JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. It involved -- it 331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425involved a homicide, but there, the search in questiontook place after the premises -- after the entry, afterthe premises were secured.  The entry was never inquestion in Mincey.          MR. STUDEBAKER:  Correct.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What was in question wasthe search after the premises had been secured.          MR. STUDEBAKER:  Correct, and --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And I don't see how thathelps you because here, in the course of securing the-- the premises, they had all -- all the evidence theyneeded.          MR. STUDEBAKER:  And -- and to answer theCourt's question, there is nothing that I'm aware ofwhere this Court has come out and said that a party is--          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So Mincey doesn't help.          MR. STUDEBAKER:  Correct.  And so we --          JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, I wouldn't want thisto be the party case.  This also involves violence andit also involves underage drinking and all three arethere together.          But I guess a policeman, where he sees orhears or knows a crime is going on, can take steps totry to stop it so that it doesn't have to continue.341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 And is there any case that says it depends on how2 serious a crime? Is there a case that says if it's a3 sort of minor crime, like a disturbance of the peace,4 you have to permit it to continue, but if it's a major5 crime like homicide, you don't have to?6 MR. STUDEBAKER: I don't believe there's7 anything that specifically says that, Your Honor. No.8 But there are cases out there that say that9 under the exigent circumstances, it's got to be a10 serious situation, and the question then becomes is --11 is the situation -- is the party -- is the loud noise12 complaint serious enough to warrant entering into the13 home. And no, we would say it's not, Your Honor. It14 doesn't rise to that level, especially considering the15 fact that the exigency that the officers relied upon,16 the smack -- and it was over. The situation was17 already under control.18 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it was -- it was over19 until somebody threw the next punch. They don't know20 what's going to happen the next. The kid broke away21 from the four people who were trying to restrain him22 once. Presumably he might be able to do it again.23 Maybe one of the four who were restraining him might24 come up with the idea that the best way to stop him25 from throwing another punch was to throw one at him.351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 The -- the police cannot make -- it seems to me on the2 facts in -- in this record, could -- could not3 reasonably draw the assumption that there was no risk4 of further violence. Am I going wrong somewhere?5 MR. STUDEBAKER: Not completely, Justice6 Souter. But we do have a situation where only he broke7 free from one of the adults, not three of the adults.8 He was still under control in this situation. And he9 had gotten his hand free and smacked one of the other10 adults, the one who was the victim in this situation.11 So the officers -- unlike some situations12 where they're called out and they wander on a13 situation, the officers in this case had personal14 knowledge of what was going on. They stood outside the15 home and watched the event transpire. And so they16 really need to wait and observe what's going to happen17 and wait till the last second before they need to go18 in. In this situation, there was nothing that would19 demonstrate in the facts that it was going to escalate20 at all.21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You don't -- you can't22 attribute what you just said to the trial court, and23 you emphasize the trial court's findings. The trial24 court said about what went wrong what the police should25 have done, as required under the Fourth Amendment, was361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 knock on the door. The evidence is there was a loud,2 tumultuous thing going on and that the occupants3 probably would not have heard him. But under the4 Fourth Amendment, he has an obligation to at least5 attempt before entering. Now, that's a statement that6 what went wrong was they didn't knock even though it7 was likely a futile act.8Do you -- do you agree that that's a correctof the law, that what the police didn't doshould have done was knock?MR. STUDEBAKER:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, they9 statement10 that they1112 should have knocked. They should have made that effort13 first.14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't screaming, police,15 enough? I mean, as I understand the facts, he first16 opened the screen door. Now, is -- is that an entry?17 He didn't go in. I assume the screen door opens out.18 Most screen doors open out. He opened the screen door19 and shouted, police. Now, that -- that doesn't count?20 he has to knock on the screen door instead, even21 though they're more likely to hear him if he opens the22 screen door and yells, police? Why doesn't that meet23 the requirement? I -- this -- why is the trial court24 obsessed with knocking?25 (Laughter.)371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand that.          MR. STUDEBAKER:  Your Honor, and I think thereason the -- the trial court and -- is concerned aboutthe knocking issue is it's, if you will, the baselinerequirement under the Fourth Amendment, under the factsof this case, was to make their presence known byknocking.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but the -- as Iunderstand the -- the trial court, he accepted theprobability that the knock would be futile, and yet hethought as a formality it was nonetheless required.  A,do you understand the trial court to have taken thatposition?  And B, if it did, do you believe that iscorrect as a statement of Fourth Amendment law?          MR. STUDEBAKER:  I'm sorry, Justice Souter.I didn't catch the first A part.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, did -- do youunderstand the trial court to have taken the positionthat even though the knock would probably have beenfutile, the police were required to -- to make itanyway, to knock anyway?          MR. STUDEBAKER:  That is what the trial court--          JUSTICE SOUTER:  And -- and do you understandthat to be a Fourth Amendment requirement, i.e., no381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 futility exception?2 MR. STUDEBAKER: I do, Your Honor, and I know3 that that's a -- a complicated issue, but it's still a4 requirement. But further, the court -- the trial court5 --6 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why should there be no7 futility exception?8 MR. STUDEBAKER: Well, even if there is, Your9 Honor, the trial court did not just say that -- there10 -- he -- the evidence was gone because of the failure11 to knock. The trial court found that the exigencies,12 as well as the appellate courts, didn't rise to the13 level which would require entry into the home.14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that -- that may be on15 your argument that noise is never sufficient to16 dispense with a warrant requirement. But it seems to17 me that in -- in the reasonableness analysis that the18 trial court was going through, the trial court was19 saying even if it would probably be futile, it is not a20 reasonable entry without a knock. And -- and I take it21 you -- you accept that and you think the trial court22 was correct, that there is no futility exception.23 MR. STUDEBAKER: I -- I agree, Your Honor,24 and this is why. Under, I believe, Wilson v. --25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why -- why should we require391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425a -- a futile act in the name of reasonableness?          MR. STUDEBAKER:  Your Honor, first, itwouldn't have taken any effort at all to follow throughon this, and even though this Court has ruled that, youknow, there is mandatory knock and announce -- orrequirement, with some exceptions, I don't believe thatthis is one of those exceptions.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  No one is denying that.  Imean, we've had a knock and announcement requirementfor 900 years.          MR. STUDEBAKER:  Correct.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  But the question is do youhave to knock and announce when, on the facts beforeyou, it is apparent that nobody will hear the knock andit will just be a wasted gesture.          MR. STUDEBAKER:  Yes.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why?          MR. STUDEBAKER:  Because, Your Honor, it'sour position that it's one of the -- the thresholdrequirements to protect somebody when they're insidetheir home is to make that effort.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  But isn't the standard ofthe Fourth Amendment a reasonableness standard, andisn't there something bizarre about sayingreasonableness requires a totally futile gesture?401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. STUDEBAKER: That was the finding of the2 court, Your Honor, the trial court, that it was futile.3 But, again, when an officer is placed in that4 situation to say that if an officer can decide whether5 something is futile or not, that could actually -- then6 that exception, if we're not careful, absorb that rule.7 So I --8 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, yes, that's why courts9 review these things.10 MR. STUDEBAKER: Correct, and that is --11 JUSTICE SOUTER: And if the court says, yes,12 based on the evidence before me, it would have been13 futile, do you think Fourth Amendment reasonableness14 requires the court and ultimately the officer to demand15 the knock 1617 No.181920 try -- but, again, this Court -- the -- the courts21 below did say that that exigent circumstances didn't22 rise to the level --23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where did the -- where did24 the trial court say that in the findings of fact?25 MR. STUDEBAKER: I'm sorry, Your Honor?411111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-anyway?MR. STUDEBAKER:  Personally?  Yes.  Legally?JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.MR. STUDEBAKER:  I mean, I am not going to￼1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm looking at the2 findings of fact. They're in the petition appendix at3 page 46 and 47. I don't see anything that has been4 specifically identified by the finder of fact as5 inadequate, other than the failure to knock. Where --6 where did the -- where does the court say it doesn't7 rise to the level of exigent circumstances?8 MR. STUDEBAKER: Your Honor, if I9 paragraph 5 of the joint appendix -- or I'm10 the -- of the order, it says, at that point11 court finds no exigent --12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where is it? Where is it?13 MR. STUDEBAKER: I'm sorry, Your Honor. In14 the petition for cert filed by the State of Utah, and15 it would be appendix page 47.16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but what it says17 right after that to explain is it would have been18 sufficient. What he -- what he should have done was19 knock, and that would have supplied all that was20 necessary.21 MR. STUDEBAKER: Your Honor, and again, this22 isn't the, maybe, best worded order that the city had23 prepared in this case when they -- when the -- it was24 actually the city that prepared this, Petitioners.25 When I look at it, I look at two different sentences421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-look atsorry -- ofin time the￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425there.  There was no exigent circumstances, andfurther, what he should have done was knock.          But further, the two appellate courts thatheard this matter before, did rule on the exigentcircumstances because that's what the Petitioners inthis Court had brought before the appellate courts, andthey found that in both the Utah Court of Appeals andthe Utah Supreme Court, that the exigent circumstancesweren't sufficient enough.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You know, maybe -- maybeyou're taking our announce and a knock -- knock andannounce requirement too -- too seriously or tooliterally.  I mean, if a police officer comes up andthe door is open, what does he have to do?  Lean overand knock on the side of the door?  Can't he shout,hello, police?  Don't you think that satisfies a knockand announce requirement?          MR. STUDEBAKER:  Your Honor --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You really think you got toknock even when the door is open.          MR. STUDEBAKER:  Your Honor, under thesituation, he's got to make his presence known.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  And he did that here.          MR. STUDEBAKER:  And --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  He stood at the door.  He431111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425opened the screen door and said, police --          MR. STUDEBAKER:  And --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- which he thought would bemore effective than knocking on -- on the -- you know,the -- the edge of a screen door, which doesn't make avery good knock.(Laughter.)          MR. STUDEBAKER:  And once he raised hisvoice, though, Your Honor, and -- and made himself alittle bit more vocal, then they noticed him there.And the --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But they still didn'tstop.  I -- I read somewhere in the facts that onlygradually, as each participant in the melee becameaware of his presence, did they sort of stop.  Itwasn't that as soon as he entered, everything quieteddown immediately.          MR. STUDEBAKER:  Chief Justice, like you say,once they made their presence known, it dissipated.The -- the position would be if they can make theirpresence known inside the home, they can make theirpresence known outside the home and still protect thatsanctity of the home that we're trying to insure thatpeople are protected in within their home.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, there seemed to be 441111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 agreement that they couldn't have made their presence2 known because the noise inside was so loud that they3 would not have been heard.4 MR. STUDEBAKER: That's what the -- the lower5 courts have found to be true. But Justice --6 currently, Justice Ginsburg, they found it to be true7 that the exigent circumstances we're not met under8 these facts. It wasn't serious enough to enter the9 home without the warrant, and I think that's the pivot10 point. Where is that line on the exigent11 circumstances? And our position would be that that12 line -- that it's got to be serious, it's got to be13 imminent, it's got to be an ongoing situation,14 something where somebody is either going to get15 seriously injured, evidence is going to be destroyed,16 somebody is going to flee.17 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, was there anything in18 the facts that a reasonable officer would know from19 looking in the window to suggest that these -- the20 adults were not -- did not have the intention of21 inflicting some sort of serious injury on this young22 man that they were restraining?23 MR. STUDEBAKER: Based upon the officer's24 testimony at the suppression hearing, Your Honor, it25 would be that did they not have a serious intention to451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 harm him is the fact that, one, there was nothing2 showing that they were actually doing anything more3 than restraining them, that juvenile. There's nothing4 in the record that shows that they were beating on him,5 that they 67 reason to 8were molesting him, or you know --JUSTICE ALITO:  They had -- did they have anyknow why they were holding him?MR. STUDEBAKER:  I would say that they would,9 Justice Alito, and this is why. You know, all that10 they were saying was they were trying to get the -- the11 juvenile to calm down. They were trying to get him to12 settle down. This was a situation where the officer13 testified that -- at the suppression hearing, that14 there was alcohol involved, that there was a minor.15 Those types of situations don't demonstrate the fact16 that this was an ongoing violent situation.17 Again -- and then further, the officers were18 called out for a party. They weren't called out for a19 fight in progress or -- or some type of physical20 altercation. They were called out because somebody had21 a loud disturbance going on. And those facts in my22 mind's eye don't rise to the level and would show the23 officer -- especially when the officer is standing24 outside the home watching this event, that there's25 nothing that -- that would rise to the level of461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 entering the home under the exigent circumstances.2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Utah Supreme Court3 seemed to be puzzled by your failure to raise the Utah4 protection against the -- the counterpart to the Fourth5 Amendment. They seemed to suggest that their own6 constitution afforded greater protection to the privacy7 of the home. Was there a reason why you argued only the8 U.S. Constitution and not the State constitution?9 MR. STUDEBAKER: Justice Ginsburg, I was not10 the trial counsel below or at the appellate court, so I11 cannot determine what his matter was or what -- what12 his basis was for that decision. And it -- then it13 would appear that you're correct in the fact that the14 Utah Supreme Court is concerned upon that issue. But15 the fact is that it seems to have been briefed under16 the Fourth Amendment, has come up under the Fourth17 Amendment issues, and so that's what we're -- we're18 looking at.19 And even though a State, obviously, can give20 more protections to its citizens under a State21 constitution, the Fourth Amendment is still a -- if you22 will, a baseline requirement, and it still applies to23 Federal criminal courts.24 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask? I don't think25 the charges are in the record. At least I missed them.471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425They were charged with -- what are the charges and how-- what were the penalty for what the defendants wereexposed to?  There's been no trial.  They -- theysuppressed the evidence.  I suppose the proceedingswere dismissed, were they?          MR. STUDEBAKER:  Your Honor, the proceedingshave been dismissed against my clients.  That iscorrect.          And to answer the Court's question, thecharges that they were facing was intoxication -- no.I'm sorry. Disorderly conduct, intoxication, andcontributing to the delinquency of a minor.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  What are the penalties forthose charges?          MR. STUDEBAKER:  Worst case scenario, YourHonor, they could be charged with up to 6 months in thecounty jail, each one consecutive to each other.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  That's the major matterwe're resolving today.          MR. STUDEBAKER:  Yes, Your Honor.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What is the actualevidence that was suppressed?  And to what extent isthat evidence that wasn't available just from lookingin through the door?MR. STUDEBAKER: Mr. Chief Justice, the 481111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 evidence was -- that was suppressed was everything that2 the officer or officers saw once they entered the home3 and/or heard once they entered the home, basically4 anything that they obtained once they entered the home.5 The answer to Your Honor's --6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Couldn't they have7 gotten all -- wouldn't he have been able to testify to8 all of that without even entering the home?9 MR. STUDEBAKER: They could have, Your Honor.10 However, they -- they did not. The prosecutor at the11 time didn't proceed under that issue. I'm not aware of12 why he did, but what we have, though, is obviously that --13 that may have happened. And as the Court addressed14 previously, there may have been then an issue related15 to the curtilage which would have had to have been16 addressed or discussed.17 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but among the evidence18 they did have were the two -- two teenagers are19 drinking beer in the backyard. So they pretty clearly20 had the alcohol -- they could have gotten that in21 evidence.22 MR. STUDEBAKER: It could have, Your Honor,23 but I don't know why it did not except for the fact24 that it could have been built into the curtilage --25 JUSTICE STEVENS: This wasn't kind of491111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 constructed as a test case, by any chance, was it?2 MR. STUDEBAKER: No, it was not, Your Honor.3 Not at all. But --4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, not by you.5 MR. STUDEBAKER: No, it was not, Your Honor.6 That's correct.7 What we have, Your Honors, is a situation8 where under the exigent circumstances, it did not rise9 to the level which would require the -- the officers to10 enter the home without getting a warrant.11 And in the alternative, if they look at12 emergency aid, to enter the home under the emergency13 aid doctrine, which would be the equivalent in our14 opinion to a special needs assessment, then we have to15 look at probable cause. We have to look at their16 intent to enter because there's no probable cause to17 enter if they're performing that caretaking role to18 protect people.19 Obviously, the ultimate concern in -- in any20 type of situation is somebody's sanctity of their home.21 It becomes a weighing situation where trial courts are22 -- are being charged to weigh the evidence, weigh the23 credibility of the people who testify, and then also24 take into account the constitutional protections which25 the parties are awarded.501111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          And we believe that based upon the facts andthe evidence that were -- was presented, that the threedifferent Utah courts that heard this matter wereappropriate in their -- in their suppression decisions.          Thank you.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.          Mr. Gray, you have 6 minutes remaining.           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. GRAY               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. GRAY:  Just a matter of clarificationinitially.  Disorderly conduct is a class Cmisdemeanor, punishable by up to 90 days in jail underthe -- how it was charged here.  Also intoxication is aclass C misdemeanor, and contributing to thedelinquency of a minor is a class B misdemeanor,punishable by up to 6 months in jail.  So that's --that's what -- but the officers -- and again, this caseisn't about what they were ultimately charged with.It's whether or not they had a reasonable basis tobelieve that immediate intervention was necessary.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Don't you think theevidence that was available without going in the housewould have supported all those charges?          MR. GRAY:  Not the intoxication.  Theintoxication has to be --511111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE STEVENS: But two teenagers in the2 backyard were intoxicated.3 MR. GRAY: The -- the juveniles. But the4 defendants in this case were the adults inside the5 home.6 JUSTICE STEVENS: Oh, they charge that the7 adults were intoxicated.8 MR. GRAY: Yes.9 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, that's a serious10 crime in Utah I guess.11 (Laughter.)12 MR. GRAY: We anticipated that comment13 actually.14 (Laughter.)15 MR. GRAY: And --16 JUSTICE STEVENS: And what's your response?17 (Laughter.)18 MR. GRAY: Normally -- normally intoxication19 -- we think of it as -- as public intoxication, and --20 and that's where it's usually prosecuted and where we21 find it. But intoxication that can become an offense22 where it disturbs others outside of the home, and23 that's what happened here.24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you have --25 you have two questions presented. The second is521111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 whether this was sufficiently -- sufficiently exigent2 to fall under the exigent circumstances. But the first3 was whether the test should turn on the officer's4 subjective motivation. I haven't heard much5 about that this morning. How is that presented on6 these facts?7 MR. GRAY: Well, the court created two8 different tests. The Utah court created two different9 tests. And under the one test, it examined whether or10 not the officers were primarily motivated by a desire11 to arrest or search for evidence. Now, the court, the12 Utah Supreme Court, concluded that they did -- that13 they were -- their motives were primarily law14 enforcement motives because they did not render aid.15 And this Court has repeatedly held that an officer's16 subjective motives play no part in the objective17 reasonableness test, and it should not do so here.18 Justice Ginsburg, you indicated that there19 was no -- no suggestion of domestic violence. The Utah20 Supreme Court actually acknowledged that where violence21 is seen in a home between adults and, for example, a22 younger person, that there would be reason to believe23 that domestic violence is possibly present. And that's24 what -- now, the court refused to look at that because25 there was no finding that the inhabitants or the --531111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425those involved were actually cohabitants.          Of course, this Court has never required thatofficers have a certainty of the situation, only areasonable belief, and they clearly have that.          And in any event, whether or not it'sdomestic violence or some other type of violence, it'ssomething that I believe this Court in Minceyrecognized, that officers can and -- and probablyshould -- maybe they didn't go that far, but it would beour position that officers should intervene in the face ofviolence, and that's what the officers did here.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  My point was simply thatthis was not a 911 call from a distressed spouse.  Thiswas a neighbor saying they're keeping me up at night,so that the -- the police response was to the noise,not to the violence.          MR. GRAY:  The initial response was clearlyto the noise, but once the officers arrived, it becameapparent that there was violence ongoing in the houseand that's how the officers proceeded.          If there are no further questions, we wouldask the Court to reverse the decision of the UtahSupreme Court.  Thank you.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.          The case is submitted.541111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112131415161718192021222324251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400          (Whereupon, at 10:58 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)55 1-Washington, DC 20005
