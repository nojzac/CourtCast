GOLDSTEINON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, may itplease the Court:      Title VII prohibits the EEOC from suing aprivate employer unless it first attempts to resolve theclaim of discrimination through conciliation.  We askthe Court to hold that a court may conduct a modestinquiry into whether the EEOC violated that statute.  Ifit did, then the remedy generally is to requireconciliation, not to dismiss the suit with prejudice.JUSTICE KENNEDY: At ­­ at first, I thought this was an Overton Park case committed by law to agency discretion. But then I couldn't find many cases in the government's brief to support that, so they have a different theory, and that's more their problem than yours.      On the other hand, it seems to me that JudgeHamilton in the Seventh Circuit said it's hard to3￼￼1 imagine more discretionary language than Congress used2 here, "Shall endeavor to eliminate the unemployment3 practice by informal methods of conference conciliation4 and persuasion." That seems to me that those are very5 difficult words for your position.6 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure. So let me,7 Mr. Justice Kennedy, divide that question into two8 parts. What's the analytical framework? Is it Overton9 Park? Is it an APA case? Is it an implied private10 right of action case, which is what Judge Hamilton11 thought, and then turn to the words of the statute and12 what it means, if we were even to concede, that these13 are kind of unusual words for a court to administer.14 So the first is the doctrinal question. The15 government agrees that Judge Hamilton got it wrong in16 putting the burden on us to prove that there was an17 implied private right of action. As a precondition to18 suit under Title VII, everyone agrees that there doesn't19 have to be a special statutory provision. We say that20 this is a case, like St. Cyr, that it's a case in which21 the government has to prove, because there is compelled22 agency action here, the conciliation by the EEOC, that23 there is clear and convincing evidence that Congress24 intended to withdraw the ordinary presumption that there25 is judicial review.4￼1 So then the government's view, just to put2 out the third doctrinal framework, the government says,3 look, we think this is kind of an ordinary statutory4 construction case, and you should see whether it is that5 the three provisions of the statute on which they're6 relying are more consistent or less consistent with7 judicial review.8 We think that this is clearly a case ­­ we9 cite Bowen, for example, in our brief. We cite a series10 of cases about Congress having to give very clear11 evidence of intent to pull the courts out of the job of12 reviewing the agency action.13 Now, to take your point that this ­­ and14 Judge Hamilton's point, that is, this kind of language15 is both deferential in that it's informal, you just have16 to endeavor. And this is arguably something that's a17 little bit unusual for courts to undertake. So first,18 doctrinally, the fact that Congress has given the courts19 an unusual job is not an excuse or reason for the20 Executive Branch to tell you that you cannot do the job.21 That would turn Chevron on its head. Remember, the22 principle of Chevron ­­23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it's kind of an odd24 conciliation, isn't it? This is ­­ EEOC is supposed to25 try to settle the matter. But there is no mutual5￼1 obligation on the other side. There's no obligation at2 all on the part of the employer to cooperate to do3 anything.4 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. And5 I think this has to be a point in our favor, the fact6 that it is unusual. Let me tell you how unusual it is;7 and that is, the EEOC is required to do this with8 respect to four different statutes. The Housing and9 Urban Development Department has to do it and the10 Federal ­­ the Federal Election Commission has to do it.11 So Congress has laid this out in a series of statutes12 where it wanted to impose on the agency this special13 obligation. Even with respect to Title VII, the private14 employee doesn't have to conciliate, the attorney15 general doesn't have to conciliate, the EEOC doesn't16 have to conciliate if it's an urgent problem under the17 statute.18 But Congress thought, and this Court has19 said many times, that it was especially important that20 the EEOC try and resolve these cases through21 conciliation. And it would be passing strange to say22 that the entire design of the statute is that the EEOC23 will work this out through conciliation, if it possible,24 but that's the one provision of the statute that is not25 enforceable.6￼1 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but at the same time,2 Mr. Goldstein, and this really follows up on3 Justice Kennedy's question, the statute makes entirely4 clear that the EEOC has the prerogative to decide what5 kind of offer by the employer is acceptable or not. And6 there's nothing to suggest that the EEOC even has to be7 reasonable in determining what sort of offer by the8 employer is acceptable.9 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Could I agree with the first10 part, but not the second? Let me just take you to the11 statute, if I might. It's in the blue brief at page 2.12 And it's the block quote at the bottom. And it has a13 timing provision that's kind of irrelevant. And then it14 says the following: "The Commission has been" ­­ this15 is, "If the Commission has been unable to secure from16 the respondent a conciliation agreement acceptable to17 the Commission," which is the point you just made, Your18 Honor, "the Commission may bring a civil action against19 any respondent, not a government."20 Now, I think it's a helpful point to us that21 Congress ­­22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's not skip over the23 time provision as irrelevant so quickly. Because it's24 the 30 days ­­ 30 days ­­ EEOC can sue within 30 days of25 the charge; isn't that right?7￼1 MR. GOLDSTEIN: It can if it cannot reach a2 conciliation agreement. This Court has ­­3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So Congress couldn't4 think that this was any kind of an onerous requirement5 if all they have is 30 ­­ within 30 days they can say,6 okay, we told them that ­­ that what ­­ what the7 complaint is, they didn't come up with anything and so8 end of conciliation.9 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, we10 just, I suppose, disagree about the substance of the11 conciliation requirement is in that point. The EEOC12 concedes that it cannot file the suit within 30 days or13 after 30 days unless the ­­ it determines that there has14 been a conciliation process that has failed.15 Now, what I think the helpful point for us16 is that this language acceptable to the Commission is17 there with respect to the substance, but not the18 process. If you'd look at the procedural obligation,19 which is the one we're trying to enforce here, which it20 appears earlier in the page, "If the Commission21 determines after such investigation that there is22 reasonable cause to believe that the charge is true, the23 Commission shall endeavor to eliminate" ­­ which is24 expansive language, Justice Kennedy, to be sure ­­ "any25 such alleged unlawful employment practice by informal8JUSTICE SCALIA:MR. GOLDSTEIN:JUSTICE SCALIA: That was my question.Yes. It can declare when the￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425methods of conference, conciliation and persuasion."      And our point is that Congress knew how towrite into the statute something like a method ofconciliation that is acceptable to the Commission.      Also, to the extent this provision remainsvague, and it has been enforceable ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Goldstein, if I understand your argument, you're saying that there is an obligation to conciliate, but that obligation does not have to be pursued in good faith.MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, Justice Scalia. We think ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: So that the ­­ even if the Commission enters upon a conciliation process, you think that the outcome of that is reviewable?MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, Justice Scalia. This is the difference between substance and process. It is not too fine a point. Let me just explain our provision ­­ our position. That is, as Justice Kagan indicates, the EEOC can declare what the finish line is, but Congress said they're going to have to go through a process. They're going to have to run the race ­­91 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425finish line is, but it can do that in bad faith.      MR. GOLDSTEIN:      JUSTICE SCALIA:can do that in bad faith.      MR. GOLDSTEIN:didn't get to the finish line if it went throughmotions, yes.JUSTICE SCALIA: And it can say that faith.￼MR. GOLDSTEIN: I don't believe that's correct, Justice Scalia. I'll give you an example of what I mean. Can I ­­ can I illustrate the point?      JUSTICE SCALIA:correct?      MR. GOLDSTEIN:      JUSTICE SCALIA:your argument. Well, is it correct or notIt is not correct. Because I don't understand      MR. GOLDSTEIN:illustration of my point.  And that is, let's assumethat the EEOC brings a charge with respect to anindividual's claim.  It says to the employer:  We'llconciliate this if you give us $5 million.  Now, $5million is not an amount of money that they legallycould even get in the case if they litigated it to theteeth.  Now, we think that that would be an ­­ not a10No.  I apologize. Yes.  You're sayingyes, itwe thein badIt can ­­ it can sayLet me give you an￼1 fair application of the statute, for them to say we2 declare conciliation failed. So that's an illustration3 ­­4 JUSTICE SCALIA: So fair application of the5 statute is reviewable, so that the proper ­­ I mean,6 we're just quibbling over, you know, how bad it is,7 that's right.8 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Justice Scalia, here's9 their ­­ their view of judicial review is that it is10 available, but it is limited to one thing, which is to11 say, did we send the employer a letter that said give us12 a call? Now, our point is that that's got to be an13 argument in our favor, because they're conceding that14 Congress did contemplate some form of judicial review.15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it is true that you ­­16 you do not ­­ I think I'm correct in this ­­ reach out17 and try to incorporate the existing law on good faith18 bargaining in the labor context or there are many19 contracts which have good faith clauses and that the20 courts have tremendous difficulty with that. And if you21 had argued that, we would have said, oh, well, this is a22 morass.23 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Right. So ­­24 JUSTICE KENNEDY:25 that's you're safest harbor.11But it seems to me that￼1 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Justice ­­2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you've already ­­ you3 recognized in ­­ in the prior exchange that there ­­4 this is nothing like bargaining. Bargaining is5 reciprocal. Both sides have a duty to bargain in good6 faith.7 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Here there is no duty at9 all on the part of the employer. It just says EEOC10 tried to conciliate.11 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's right. Justice12 Ginsburg, Justice Kennedy, we are not asking you to13 import the good faith bargaining case law and14 regulations from the NLRA. Our point is different; and15 that is, it is commonplace for the courts to review this16 sort of thing. There are five statutes. This statute17 has been enforced by 40 ­­ for 40 years and courts have18 looked into notions like bargaining or whether parties19 complied with the court's order to mediate. So this20 isn't notionally something that is so unusual that21 ­­22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, it's unusual23 enough that there's a huge split among the circuits as24 to how to define what they're reviewing. I can't find25 any consistency among more than about two of them. And12￼1 so I go back to ­­ I know you say you've cited cases2 about the imperative of judicial review, but on the3 administrative level, it's after a final action. This4 is not a final action.5 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Sotomayor, this is6 not an APA case. This is ­­7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Oh, well, I agree with8 you. But I'm trying to find something analogous and9 there isn't. But I don't know how you make something10 that's designated by Congress as informal into a formal11 proceeding.12 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Sotomayor, I think13 when Congress said informal methods of conference,14 conciliation, and persuasion, it was contrasting15 bringing a lawsuit. There's no indication in the16 statutory structure or in the legislative history that17 what Congress was trying to do is say to the EEOC, do18 whatever you like. To the contrary, the EEOC uniquely19 was constrained. Take the Department of Labor, take20 any ­­ almost any other enforce ­­21 JUSTICE GINSBURG:22 this case?23 MR. GOLDSTEIN:24 JUSTICE GINSBURG:25 letter saying ­­13   Well, can we take ­­ takeYes.   The EEOC did send a1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. GOLDSTEIN: Give us a call.JUSTICE GINSBURG: ­­ give us a call. And the charge here is the employer violated Title VII because he outright refused to hire women. And there is lots of evidence of that. There are no women working there. They build a new facility; they don't have a women's bathroom in it. They hire people that are recommended to them by the current employees and the current employees are all male and recommend all men.      Now, what ­­ what was the EEOC to conciliateabout?MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, this ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wouldn't the employer have to come up and say something like, okay, we'll ­­ we'll agree that we'll hire women?MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. Justice Ginsburg, a couple preliminary points. Just factually, we are talking about the difference between ­­ the company does have female employees. We're talking about in the mine, which is a serious concern under Title VII, but just to be clear.      Now, in terms of the conciliation process,here are the basic things that seem ­­ they ought to beuncontroversial and that the EEOC over the course of thepast 40 years should have and could have used its14￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425rulemaking authority to make clear.  So the statuterequires that you're going to conference.  Now, theEEOC's position is we can say, give us a call.ought ­­ there ought to be a rule that says ifemployer contacts you back, you are willing toconference with them.  You are willing to meeta discussion.But what theand havethis?JUSTICE SCALIA:MR. GOLDSTEIN: Can I ask something aboutYes. Conciliation I thought￼      The statute says that you have to attempt topersuade the employer.  And so that ­­ what that shouldmean is simply that you're going to give the basics ofyour demand in conciliation to the employer so it canevaluate it.      Justice Ginsburg, the problem is that ­­      JUSTICE SCALIA:would be conciliation between the complaining partiesand the employer.     MR. GOLDSTEIN:     JUSTICE SCALIA:     MR. GOLDSTEIN:employer.     JUSTICE SCALIA:employer?It's between ­­ sorry. But ­­ and that's wrong?It is the EEOC and the Between the EEOC and the15￼1 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Right. It is an important2 point ­­3 JUSTICE SCALIA: So even if the complaining4 party is willing to accept $500,000 rather than a5 million, if the EEOC says a million, the EEOC is6 conciliated.7 MR. GOLDSTEIN: The EEOC says it's8 conciliating.9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, no. Under the law,10 you tell me it is conciliated.11 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Right. The EEOC's12 position ­­ that is correct, yes, full stop. And this13 is a problem. The EEOC has an enormous incentive,14 because it does bring about 130 cases a year, to pick15 out the cases that it wants to be very high profile. It16 wants to send a message to employers. Justice Ginsburg,17 you articulated they are concerned with this employer.18 The difficulty for them is if they conciliate, Congress19 required that that remain entirely confidential. And so20 the problem is that we have an agency that has an21 enormous incentive in the cases that it picks out to22 bypass the mandatory process that Congress imposed.23 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Goldstein, could we talk24 about that confidentiality provision? Because in25 addition to just the enormous discretion that this16￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425statute gives to the EEOC, the other thing that tends towork against you is this thing:  Nothing said or done aspart of these informal endeavors can be used as evidencein a subsequent proceeding.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.JUSTICE KAGAN: And your entire position would have all the stuff about this conciliation come in as evidence in a subsequent proceeding, which is to say, come in as evidence in the litigation of the lawsuit.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. Just to pause briefly on the premise that there is enormous discretion, that is the premise of Chevron deference, not courts not enforcing a statute.      But to turn to the confidentialityprovision, remember that the EEOC ­­      JUSTICE KAGAN:of fact ­­      MR. GOLDSTEIN:      JUSTICE KAGAN:the sense that the statute clearly gives it to the EEOCto decide what's acceptable in the end.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Absolutely, Justice Kagan. But that is true across a range of statutes that impose a procedural obligation.Now, confidentiality. Let's start from the17I'm just saying as a matterOkay.­­ there is discretion in19 reference to the merits. I20 way. The question we think21 evidence ­­22 JUSTICE KAGAN:concede it can be read theiris that clear and convincingI don't even understand thatit a part of the merits.Because the subsequent23 distinction. You're making24 MR. GOLDSTEIN:25 proceeding is not ­­ is about the merits of the￼1 point that the EEOC didn't read the statute this way2 until four decades after it was enacted. And there's a3 good reason for that. It read it our way. The reason4 is that when Congress enacted the statute, the reference5 to a "subsequent proceeding" in the text unquestionably6 was the merits of the case, because the EEOC ­­ there7 was never this fight because the EEOC didn't have that8 enforcement power.9 JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes. But you yourself are10 making this part of the case. You're essentially saying11 that the EEOC has to come in and prove that it12 conciliated in good faith or whatever term you want. So13 it's become now, by virtue of your own argument, part of14 the case. And how is that to be part of the case and15 how is all this to happen unless the informal ­­ what's16 said and done in the informal endeavors come in.17 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. So "subsequent18 proceeding" can be read their way or it can be read as a18￼1 subsequent ­­ the substantive claim. Let me give you2 three examples where we have to be right that a3 collateral inquiry into the EEOC's burden or our burden4 is not a subsequent proceeding. That's referred to in5 the statute, that would be subject to the6 confidentiality proceeding.7 This Court held in Ford Motor Company that8 if an employer makes an offer of back pay to the9 employee, and that would include in the conciliation10 process, then that cuts off their right to damages. You11 can't do that unless you can say what happened in the12 conciliation process.13 Number two, the statute says that you can14 ask the judge for 60 days more of conciliation. It is15 implausible that a court would make that judgment16 without knowing whether conciliation has been going17 completely worthlessly.18 Number three, what if the employer lies to19 the court and says, look, we never got this conciliation20 letter. And the EEOC knows that it was discussed in the21 conciliation meeting. Could we really say that this22 statute bars the court from enforcing a contempt23 proceeding against the lawyer?24 The point of the statute is to make sure25 that what happens in the conciliation process doesn't19￼1 prejudice the merits of the case. This isn't a secrecy2 provision. Under this provision, the employer can3 publish what happened in conciliation in the New York4 Times.5 JUSTICE KAGAN: I would have thought that6 the point of the provision is very clear. It's the same7 point as anything which says when you're involved in8 settlement negotiations those stay in settlement9 negotiations, and it's to protect the settle ­­ the10 integrity of the negotiations.11 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, I just gave you three12 examples where I think plainly it can't be read that13 broadly. We think it serves ­­14 JUSTICE GINSBURG:15 MR. GOLDSTEIN:16 JUSTICE GINSBURG:17 understand it, to break the confidentiality all the18 participants have to agree. And the employer might19 agree, but the employee hasn't been heard from.20 MR. GOLDSTEIN: This ­­ this, again, I think21 has to be a point in our favor. Let me just take you to22 the statutory text involved. And that says that you23 have to have permission of the persons concerned. Now,24 the commission is not a person. Justice Ginsburg, you25 are right that the persons concerned under this statute20   You left out one person.Yes.The complainant.  As IJUSTICE KENNEDY:MR. GOLDSTEIN:  There are or there aren't?Are not.  Every court ­­ on￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425are the individual complainant and the employer.      Now, the complainant is not involved in thisinquiry at all.  It's about whether the EEOC respondedto our request to meet, whether it gave us anexplanation of what it is that they were demanding.      How does it make any sense that Congresswould have said that the choice whether the evidencecomes in is to the complainant, who wasn't even involvedin this part of the process.  We think that our readingof the statute, which is their reading of the statutefor the first four decades is ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if it is confidential, that is plain in the statute.MR. GOLDSTEIN: But it's not confidential in that sense, Justice Ginsburg. Remember, the employer, as I said, is free to tell CNN, the New York Times, and the Washington Post everything that happened here.JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it's your position that the courts that have held that the proceedings are under seal or they're secret proceedings are just irrelevant; we don't need to be concerned with that?MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Kennedy, there aren't such courts. Every court ­­21￼1 the question of administrability, it's very frequent for2 an agency to come to you and say, look, this would work3 so much better if the courts weren't involved; we would4 do a great job. And for 40 years, courts have enforced5 this provision and have never understood, before a6 decision in 2011, the confidentiality provision to apply7 this way. And the EEOC argued that we were right.8 There's no indication that the statute was9 malfunctioning in some way.10 We think, respectfully, that you cannot have11 agencies come in front of you and say, look, Congress12 gave us a lot of discretion; that doesn't mean we should13 issue regulations. They have the authority to issue14 procedural regulations that would elaborate on what15 conciliation means, what ­­ what persuasion means. But16 they've refused to do it. And then they come to you and17 say, well, look, you know, it's entirely vague.18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because they consider it19 ­­ and I think you can't quarrel with it; this is what20 Congress intended ­­ as a highly informal proceeding.21 They don't want a ­­ a bunch of procedural regulations.22 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's not quite right.23 Remember, that they admit that there are firm24 requirements. They have to send a letter. They can25 only conciliate with respect to the claim that's in the22￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425reasonable cause determination.  We think there areother very simple, modest things that the courts havehad no trouble enforcing ­­JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about that? That's what I ­­ I mean, in my mind, of course, there should be judicial review. There is of everything just about. But the issue is how much.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, what'syour view on that?  Because as Iwhere when an IRS official wantsmaterial, all he has to do is say it's in good faith.Ah.  But there could be an unusual case where we want toget more than that affidavit.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.JUSTICE BREYER: So we wrote an opinion, and probably you've read it, and we said, well, judge, yeah, if it's unusual and you really have some thought here that the IRS is in bad faith, you can go a little further. Well, that seems to me to be the kind of thing that would apply here.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure.JUSTICE BREYER: And then ­­ okay. Soyou're perfectly satisfied. I take it the closest to this is the Fourth, Sixth, and Tenth Circuit, a minimal23­­ we just had a caseto subpoena some2 never 345 maybe 6going to say never.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Now, those courts ­­ JUSTICE BREYER: That's what your ­­ well,there will be agreement on this.MR. GOLDSTEIN: I doubt it.The ­­ Justice ­­ Justice Breyer, that is78 exactly right. We think that the agency here, if it9 claims the expertise and the flexibility and to know￼1 showing of good faith, that's the end of it, but you're10 what's going on, ought to issue further elaborating11 regulations. But we think that minimum good faith does12 have some very easy, simple things to know. If I'm13 going to ­­14 JUSTICE BREYER: Aha. You're going a bit15 further now.16 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I'm doing so to try and be17 helpful. Here's what I had in my mind, Justice Breyer.18 Look, if I'm going to conciliate something with you, if19 we're going to work it out and I get to decide, I've got20 to tell you the minimum of what I'll take.

I think what Justice Breyer's getting to is, youknow whether someone conciliated or not.  You can sayexactly what the EEOC did or didn't do or failed to do.But instead, you want a whole discovery process attachedto this.  And that's my problem here ­­MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ which is it's very simple for you to come in and say, we called, we asked to meet, they wouldn't meet with us.MR.

GOLDSTEIN: Justice ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So if you walked in and said, I'm not going to listen to you until you give me A, B, and C, I might say you weren't acting in good faith.27￼1 Sotomayor, they ­­ they say a court doesn't have that2 power. Now, with respect to what happened in this case,3 we ­­ the government has put us in an unbelievable bind4 here, and that is, we issued these interrogatories and5 then we attempted to explain to the court why we thought6 the interrogatories were necessary in light of the7 conciliation process, and they threatened to sanction8 our counsel personally. So the record is empty for a9 reason that owes entirely to them.10 I will tell you that there are cases in11 which the EEOC attempts to conciliate and says we are12 suing ­­ we're going to sue you on behalf of a class of13 people, and we want some X amount of money, and it may14 be an awful lot of money. And the employer will say15 back, look, how many people are we talking about over16 what period of time? And the EEOC's interpretation of17 this provision is it could say we're not going to tell18 you; we've just got a class of people and we want this19 amount of money. And interrogatories like this would be20 out there conceivably to illustrate to the court that we21 had no way of conciliating this case. If we're ­­ if22 it's going to say we're in an endeavor to work it out,23 you've got to tell me what you want and the basics ­­24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you'd have all of the25 discovery and the conciliation process in 30 days.28      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:what you want to ­­ to have.That ­­ that's basically￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. GOLDSTEIN: Your Honor ­­MR. GOLDSTEIN: No. Congress contemplated that conciliation could conclude within 30 days. It doesn't ­­ remember, this case is very old because they got this charge in 2008 and it was years later, even before they brought the case, and the case has dragged on this long because they have steadfastly infused ­­ refused, in the face of eight courts of appeals' rulings, no court ever indicating that the standard was inadministrable, no court ever finding that an employer acted in good faith ­­ in bad faith in raising this objection.And it has dragged on unnecessarily. We want a modest inquiry that should be administrable, and that the EEOC can elaborate on in its own regulations.If I could reserve the remainder of my time. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Ms. Saharsky.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY       ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMS. SAHARSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      I think the Seventh Circuit was correct when29￼1 it reviewed what has been happening in the courts of2 appeals and concluded that, in fact, what is happening3 is not a modest inquiry and it's just not one that has a4 basis in the text of the statute. And I think it's5 useful to go back to the text of the statute and look ­­6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Ms. Saharsky, let me7 just ask you a simple question. You send a letter, they8 call you, and you say, don't want to talk to you, hang9 up. 30 days later, you send the letter that you send10 routinely that says conciliation failed. How do they11 get a court to review that under your theory of the12 case? Because you say the only thing the court can13 review is whether conciliation was offered and whether14 it ended. So here it was offered, but we're not even15 talking about good faith. You just say I'm not going16 to.17 MS. SAHARSKY: Yes.18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:19 government. So how do you review that if you're a20 court?21 MS. SAHARSKY: You don't review it. We22 think that this is a matter that is entrusted to the23 agency, that is not for court review. And I ­­24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And what ­­ I'm25 sorry. Continue. No, I'm sorry.30"You" meaning the￼1 MS. SAHARSKY: That's okay.2 I think that it helps to look at the3 obligations that the Congress put on the commission in4 the statute in two parts. There's the ­­ and I'll make5 this brief. There's the obligation in part B, which is6 the commission should endeavor to eliminate the7 employment discrimination, everything is supposed to be8 kept confidential. We understand that to put a good9 faith obligation on the commission to try to get this10 resolved. We don't think that it is judicially11 reviewable because of the language that Congress used12 and because by analogy, it is the type of agency action13 that's committed to the agency's discretion. There's no14 standards. But ­­15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what if you16 have ­­ you sent a letter that says a representative of17 this office will be in contact with you to begin the18 conciliation process. What if the employer says, nobody19 contacted me; it never happened. Can you get judicial20 review of that claim?21 MS. SAHARSKY: Well, the obligation of the22 agency is to say that it has been unable to secure a23 conciliation agreement acceptable to the commission. So24 that ­­25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. Is it their311 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425obligation to say that or is it their obligation to dothat?MS. SAHARSKY: Well, if it is challenged, it has to put the document into court that is the notice that it was unable to do that.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And they say here your document is signed by, you know, John Rowe. What if they say, I'm sorry, it's just not true, he's lying? We got nothing, nobody ever called us.MS. SAHARSKY: Well, if the ­­ if the document which says that the commission was unable to ­­ to secure an agreement acceptable to it ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, no. You're making it too easy on yourself, I'm talking about the document that says, we will be in contact with you. Right?MS. SAHARSKY: Yes.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They said nobody contacted me.MS. SAHARSKY: I think the answer is that it is the process by which the ­­ there was an attempt at conciliation is not reviewable. We do not ­­ we think that the agency ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is, in my case, judicial review of that question?32￼￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MS. SAHARSKY: No.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Nobody contacted me; they've got a letter saying they'll contact me, nobody ever contacted me.MS. SAHARSKY: No, but we do not think that there are any situations in which that will arise. There are not situations in which that has arisen and that is not the argument that ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's just assuming you're always right.MS.

SAHARSKY: Right,CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:says it never got off the ground, MS. SAHARSKY: Right.      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:affidavit and he can file an affidavit and ­­JUSTICE BREYER: You know, this is a ­­ this is Hornbook law, I thought, use it till this point. But everything is reviewable. Now, that isn't quite true, but if you want to apply for a visa at a foreign embassy33You say you'reokay.  ­­ consume ­­ and heand you can have ­­­­ Mr. Rowe file an￼ 1   abroad, at our embassy is not reviewable.  Okay, and 2   maybe there's a military thing, but even the ­­ even 3   the ­­ even the things like the Panama Canal toll, where 4   they said it wasn't reviewable, Davis says it should5 have been.6 And the answer to your problem is it's not 7   ­­ it's not reviewable, the three cases or so where we 8   said it wasn't.  The answer is the agency has broad 9   discretion, and because they have such broad discretion,10   the court can review it, but unless it's very unusual,11   they have to decide for the agency.12 Now, eight circuits have roughly followed13   that; three, more detailed than others.  And I haven't14   found anything in your brief that says in the last 4015   years, the EEOC has, as a result, found its functioning16   seriously hampered.  And ­­ and so why ­­ what's ­­17181920   Chief Justice's question.  If there was no attempt at21   conciliation at all, then, you know, these letters would22   not exist and we think that that potentially would be a23   problem, but that ­­24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're saying if the25   agency ­­ the agency couldn't possibly have violated the34that's why I'm ­­ I'm wondering.MS. SAHARSKY: Well, a couple of points. Firstof all, I'm afraid that I may have misunderstood the￼1 law? They wouldn't say we have attempted to ­­ we will2 contact you, and then not contacted you?3 MS. SAHARSKY: I agree that that would be a4 problem, but that is not what5 He has not identified case ­­6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:7 question of what he's arguing8 what you are arguing for. You are arguing that there is9 no judicial review, full stop. And I'm trying to pose a10 question where it seems to me that it would be utterly11 unreasonable for you to say you don't get judicial12 review of that basic question.13 I am very troubled by the idea that the14 government can do something and we can't even look at15 whether they've complied with the law. I'm not terribly16 troubled by the idea that the scope of our judicial17 review is limited. And I just wanted you to tell me18 which it is, is it that there's no authority for a court19 to review government action alleged to be in violation20 of law, or is it that the scope of judicial review for21 various reasons is sharply circumscribed?22 MS. SAHARSKY: It's the second one, and I'm23 sorry if I misunderstood your question earlier. The24 scope of judicial review depends on the condition that25 the court ­­ that Congress put in for the commission to35Petitioner is arguing for.      No, it's not afor, it's a question of￼1 meet, and that is in subsection (f)(1) of this ­­ this2 provision, which is that there has to be ­­ the3 commission unable to obtain an agreement acceptable to4 it.5 What Petitioner seeks judicial review of is6 the process behind it and puts in place these factors7 for reviewing the process behind it. And Justice8 Breyer ­­9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What ­­ what ­­ what can10 you tell us about what the proper function of the court11 is in a case like the Chief Justice put? They said12 there was no attempt to conciliate and when we attempted13 to conciliate, they ­­ they wouldn't answer our calls.14 Now, it ­­ it seems to me as I read your15 brief that you did indicate that there was some very16 bare bones requirements that the agency had ­­ had to17 meet and it could be reviewed. I can't find any ­­ any18 other context where the court has essentially declined19 to review a statutory precondition to ­­ to suit at all.20 MS. SAHARSKY: Well, what we're saying,21 Justice Kennedy, is that if it were controverted, if the22 other side said that there was not conciliation at23 all ­­ which is not what this side is saying, they are24 just saying it wasn't enough effort ­­ but if there was25 none at all, that we would put in place the letters that36JUSTICE SCALIA:Well, let's go back to the￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425showed that we conciliated.  Those would ­­ the agency'sactivities, its day­to­day workings, would be entitledto a presumption of regularity and it would take reallysomething extraordinary to look behind that.JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's the difference ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What'sextraordinary ­­ what's extraordinary is that counsel for the other side files an affidavit saying it never happened, I know you've got this letter, but we normally don't take the government's say­so when it comes to a dispute about whether ­­ whether something happened.MS. SAHARSKY: Right.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So he can say ­­ say, okay, here's the affidavit, we never got it. We checked our mailroom ­­MS. SAHARSKY: Right.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Nothing ever came in. We checked our phone logs, nobody ever called.MS. SAHARSKY: Right. And I'm telling you that if it were a situation of it nothing never happened, that that could be a situation in which the court would put in place a stay to permit conciliation efforts. But that's not the argument that ­­37MS. SAHARSKY:JUSTICE SCALIA:MS. SAHARSKY:Well, I think that ­­  You just say, you know ­­I think that there's a real￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425language you quoted.

SAHARSKY: Acceptable to it, yes.JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. Now, is it possible that you are trying to obtain an agreement acceptable to you when you do not tell the other side what that might be?difference between what the EEOC is doing in itsday­to­day activities and court review of the EEOCactivities.  The EEOC has in place procedures and it hastraining in order to go through all of these steps inconciliation, but what we're talking about is theproblems that have been caused by this after­the­factsecond­guessing by courts,JUSTICE SCALIA: You have to make me an offer. That's not ­­ that's not difficult to find out. Did you make an offer or not.MS. SAHARSKY: Right. But that just leads the courts into questions about how much detail was in the offer and is it sufficient and if the ­­38￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      JUSTICE SCALIA:mean, you could ­­      MS. SAHARSKY:happened in the ­­      JUSTICE SCALIA:but ­­ but if the other side says the EEOC never made mean offer, I had no idea ­­ no notion of what I had toagree to.MS. SAHARSKY: But that is not what's happening and that is not the argument that they're making, is that ­­JUSTICE BREYER: So that's what ­­ that's where we are. I'm trying to ­­ what I'd like you to do, I'm going to get you to focus on just what you want to say, that the framework in which I'm putting it is of course there is review, but of course at the same time, there is very broad discretion given to the EEOC. So courts do not intervene; be careful, it's an unusual case.      Now, that's what you want.Now, I want to know how to say that. And the case that comes to me the closest was the case that we had with the IRS where, in fact, of course the IRS says, we're in good faith. And the court says, that's just fine, unless of course there is an unusual39  No, not necessarily.  IWell, that's what has­­ draw a line somewhere,20 to conciliate, there are a21 do. And one of them is to22 difficult to figure out?23 MS. SAHARSKY:few things that you got tomake an offer.  Is thatThere are several problems 24 with that. The first of all is that the statute says￼1 situation.2 Now, one can write those words. In that3 kind of opinion, I've noticed it works best if you also4 give an example through the use of the case.5 Now, that's where I am. And since I think6 that's what you want ­­ something like that is what you7 want to argue, I'm asking you for help how to write8 that.9 MS. SAHARSKY: Right. And what I'm saying10 is that there is ­­ the way not to write that is by11 relying on a good­faith standard, because I think you12 have a misimpression about the courts of appeals, and13 how it has been working in the courts of appeals, which14 is some of the courts have adopted a good­faith15 standard, but they are putting very onerous requirements16 on the EEOC in terms of looking at ­­17 JUSTICE SCALIA: We don't have adopt a18 good ­­ we don't have to adopt a good­faith standard.19 We ­­ we could simply say that if you are really trying25 that the process is supposed to be informal and this is401 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9adding a level of formality to it.  The second thing isthat ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: We're looking ­­ we're looking for a safety net, we said, please, tell us what the minimum rule is. You don't ­­ you have not articulated a minimum rule. All you say is I can't think of one.MS. SAHARSKY: No, I'm saying that ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that doesn't answer Justice Breyer's question, and our general question, how do you want us to write what you want to hold in this case?10111213141516171819202122 says, no. Okay? 2324 25      Tell me how we ­­ how we write a decisionthat avoid ­­ that addresses that kind of case.MS. SAHARSKY:What I'd like the Court ­­   All I hear is no review,      JUSTICE KENNEDY:period, good­bye.￼      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:hear we sent letters.  I ­­ I'm positing thehypothetical:  You sent letters, but when they calledyou said, we're going to trial.  You didn't make ­­ nodiscussion whatsoever.  You sent the letter, they calledand said, let's sit down, and you ­­ and the governmentMS. SAHARSKY: Well, we do think that the41Now, I don't want to￼1 decision that the Court should write should focus on2 what the obligation is that's on the EEOC, the3 particular text that Congress enacted. And the4 obligation that's on the EEOC is that before it can sue,5 it has to have been unable to secure from the respondent6 a conciliation agreement acceptable to the commission.7 So if that's ­­8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Fine, then what is the9 Court supposed to do to determine whether that10 obligation is met? So far, I think your answer is11 nothing.12 MS. SAHARSKY: I think what the Court is13 supposed to do is if it's controverted, look at the14 letters indicating that there was an effort that was15 made by the EEOC and, as a general matter, not look16 behind those. I mean, there was ­­17 CHIEF JUSTICE18 MS. SAHARSKY:19 CHIEF JUSTICE20 MS. SAHARSKY:21 CHIEF JUSTICE22 challenging with whatever evidence it has. Maybe it's23 voluminous ­­ affidavits, records ­­ and you say, trust24 us. Here's a letter saying we did it. That's the end25 of the case.42ROBERTS: So trust you?­­ a year­long process ­­ROBERTS: Just trust you? Well ­­ROBERTS: The other side is￼1 MS. SAHARSKY: There's significant2 incentives that operate on agencies even when there's3 not judicial review. In this case, for example, the4 EEOC has substantial resource that don't allow it to5 sue ­­6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But there are7 incentives on most people to tell the truth most of the8 time, but that doesn't mean that's the end of it.9 MS. SAHARSKY:10 President and by Congress,11 There are actually reports12 to Congress in the statute13 JUSTICE SCALIA:14 agree with you about the incentives. I think, as the15 other side points out, there is considerable incentive16 on the EEOC to fail in conciliation so that it can bring17 a big­deal lawsuit and get a lot of press and put a lot18 of pressure on this employer and on other employers.19 There are real incentives to have conciliation fail.20 MS. SAHARSKY: I don't think that that's21 true in most cases; and even in high­profile cases where22 the EEOC may believe that there's a very serious,23 substantial claim of employment discrimination, it is24 always easier to come to an agreement then to have to go25 through the burdens of litigation.43There is also review by theCongressional committees.that are required every yearitself.Ms. Saharsky, I don't even      MS. SAHARSKY:      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:you don't want.      MS. SAHARSKY:Right.  And that's ­­     Give us ­­ give us whatRight.  And the reason ­­     Give us a way to write￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      The EEOC finds reasonable cause inapproximately 3500 charges every year.  It only has theresources to litigate in about 130 of them.  That's asof 2013.  So there are ­­      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Alright. I know what yourposition is, but assume ours is just the hypothetical.It doesn't mean you've lost, but ours is that we have togive some teeth to judicial review greater than whatyou're suggesting.Justice Kennedy asked you once. I'm asking you ­­ or I asked you once before, he's asked again, and I'm asking again.      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:it that gives you the least ­­ the less intrusion ­­ theleast intrusion but more than what you want to do.MS. SAHARSKY: Yes. And to be frank, the reason that this is a struggle is because the courts of appeals, even those that have tried to put a minimum good faith standard in place, have seen these standards spiral out of control and lead to significant collateral litigation.44￼1 So I don't mean ­­ I understand the effort2 that you're looking for, Justice Sotomayor, and I will3 do my best to provide that guidance; but I'm telling you4 that even in the three circuits that have tried to use a5 minimal good­faith standard, they have been scrutinizing6 everything that the EEOC has been doing, all of the7 letters back and forth.8 You've gotten into situations where you're9 even deposing EEOC investigators in district courts, and10 that's one thing that ­­ if I could just back up,11 because I think this is a really important point, is12 that there are four various, serious problems that this13 has led to in the district courts and in the courts of14 appeals.15 We're talking about mini trials on a16 collateral issue that's not the merits of the17 discrimination but on this question of whether the EEOC18 tried hard enough, and it is not the case that the EEOC19 is failing to conciliate. The EEOC is attempting20 conciliation in these cases. Petitioner can't identify21 cases in which it has not conciliated at all. What22 they're saying is that we didn't try hard enough, and23 that requires these mini trials.24 The second very serious problem with all the25 standards the courts of appeals have adopted is that45￼1 they have to make up standards that appear nowhere in2 the statute, and they have struggled. These five3 guidelines that Petitioner now proposes appeared for the4 first time in their Supreme Court brief. These are not5 the standards they were urging to the district court.6 And they’re not ­­7 JUSTICE BREYER: What about that analogy8 with that IRS case?9 MS. SAHARSKY: I think that that is a good10 analogy because the Court recognized that it would not11 be appropriate to second­guess ­­12 JUSTICE BREYER: So could we copy that, you13 know, copy that, making appropriate changes, and14 say, look, Judge, you have to see ­­ you have their15 affidavit. As long as you think that affidavit really16 was the bottom line, we did conciliate it unless you17 have good reason to think that isn't so. That's the end18 of it, unless there is evidence of an abuse of process19 that we'll allow you to go further because conciliation,20 mediation is really a matter that Congress intended to21 leave up to the agency.22 And even what sounds minimal, minimal, at23 least the agency has to make an offer. Maybe they24 don't. Maybe the best way to conciliate it is you sit25 there and say, well, you know, that can be in some461 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425circumstance.So you ­­ you ­­ what about some? Is thatnot possible?MS. SAHARSKY: Yes. I take your point,Justice Breyer.  I think there are some modificationsthat I would make to it, but I think ­­JUSTICE BREYER: What?MS. SAHARSKY: ­­ towards the end of your question, you actually raise a really important ancillary point, which is that the process of trying to come to a negotiation and conclusion with someone often requires an element of strategy, that you might wait for them to make the first offer or you might find someone who says, we're never going to come to an agreement on this. And that's happened in some cases; and, yet, those folks still come into court and say, The EEOC didn't try hard enough. Well, you told us you were never going to come to an agreement.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what has been going on, in fact, in these cases now with some courts having just general good faith, others having a three factor test?      You raised a problem here that the EEOC washit with a bunch of interrogatories.      Has that been going on?47￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MS. SAHARSKY: Yes. The EEOC is really faced with ­­ you know, is really between a rock and a hard place. It does its best to conciliate and it never knows whether some court is going to find it to be insufficient later. The EEOC is attempting to maintain the confidentiality of these proceedings. When employers are in conciliation, of course they want it to be confidential, but then when this gets to court, they say, oh, we don't care about confidentiality anymore. Let's all put it before the court, but the problem is that has effects for later cases. Once employers know and the commission knows that this is all going to come out and what Petitioner proposes, it really destroys the ­­ the conciliation process. It's really a bedrock ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you disagree that they can publish it in the New York Times if they want?MS. SAHARSKY: Well, partially, the ­­ the confidentiality provision has two portions to it. The first says that the EEOC can't make public what happened.      JUSTICE SCALIA:     MS. SAHARSKY:employers.     JUSTICE SCALIA:     MS. SAHARSKY:   Right. So that does not apply to   Right. But the second part says that48￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425it can't be used as evidence in a court proceeding ­­was defining, an informal endeavor to settle athe kind of thing that shouldn't be public andshouldn't be the subject of court proceedings.JUSTICE SCALIA: You say that, but say that it shouldn't be public.

I mean, you're ­­ you're worrying abouttheir ­­ their publishing it, and then you say they have no incentive to publish it. But if they want it published, they can publish it in the New York Times. They don't have to bring a lawsuit to do it.MS. SAHARSKY: Right, but what they can't do is use the evidence in court. And we think that when you look at the statute and the text that Congress enacted, it reflects a recognition that what Congress  Because that isn't­­ and that does apply.  That's not publishing it inRight, but I think in most of1 be use in court proceedings. That's quite different2 from saying it shouldn't be public.3 MS. SAHARSKY:4 fact ­­5 JUSTICE SCALIA:6 opposite?7 MS. SAHARSKY:8 shorthand, that it can't be made public by the9 commission; but you're right, it also can't be10 court proceedings. And that's really a bar on11 of far­reaching judicial review that is sought12 case.13 I mean, Petitioner's view essentially￼14 destroys the benefits of informal settlement processes15 because the benefits of them are that they can be16 informal, that they can be cheap, that they can be17 quick, and that they stay confidential.18 Now, nothing's going to stay confidential.19 Employers don't have an incentive to conciliate, and20 that courts have to expend this massive effort on21 something ­­ and I think this is an important point ­­22 that's really ancillary to the main event.23 What this statute is about, Title VII, is24 eliminating employment discrimination; and it has a25 number of steps that the agency goes through in order to50Fine, and I'll focus on theSo why do you saythewith aused inthe typein thisI'm sorry.

SAHARSKY: I think that when employers know that they have a potential defense that would get the lawsuit dismissed on the merits, they start to treat the conciliation as an opportunity ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're kind of assuming bad faith on their part.MS. SAHARSKY: I'm not assuming ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We're supposed to assume complete good faith on the Government's part and bad faith on this employer's part.MS. SAHARSKY: That's not true. I direct the Court to Footnote 13 in our brief, which is where lawyers for these employers are directing them to treat the conciliation effort as one to set up a defense for trial.      So I'm not suggesting that there is justnecessarily bad faith.  What I'm saying to the Court isthat this is happening, the results of what has happenedin the courts of appeals, trying to come up with thesestandards is that there's been a real problem with folksnot using conciliation to try to come to an agreement,51￼￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the manipulation by employers.  That was footnote 13 ofour brief.      There is also a large number of cases thatshow how often this is being raised and the kind of ­­that's in another footnote, the kind of realresources ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All this stuff is in footnotes.MS. SAHARSKY: What?CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All this stuff is in footnotes, that's where all the important stuff is.      JUSTICE KAGAN:writing, right?      MS. SAHARSKY:      JUSTICE KAGAN:here are two preconditions to endeavoring to conciliatea claim, right?  One is we actually told them what wewere objecting to, and the second is we talked.      So could we just have the EEOC come in withan affidavit saying, we told them what we were objectingto and we talked and it didn't work?MS. SAHARSKY: Yes. Although, for your second point, just to ­­ not to be too picky about it, but sometimes these communications happen over letter and email, so it might not be talking.52It's a rule of S.G. briefWell, you would know. Exactly.  It does ­­ I mean,￼1 2 3 45 point6 notice of what ­­7 JUSTICE KAGAN: But you would not object to8 that; is that right?9 MS. SAHARSKY: Well, not that the EEOC would10 have to ­­ couldn't produce that kind of information.11 The problem is really the looking behind it and the12 Court second­guessing ­­JUSTICE KAGAN:MS. SAHARSKY:JUSTICE KAGAN:MS. SAHARSKY: Okay.  Talked or ­­Communicated.out to the Court, though, in terms of the13 JUSTICE KAGAN:14 to the extent ­­15 MS. SAHARSKY:16 information.17 JUSTICE KAGAN:18 to the Chief Justice's first question.19 To the extent that somebody comes in and20 says either they never told me what this case was21 about ­­ that is, they never told me what the claim22 was ­­ or they never communicated with me, that that23 would be a fair thing to review that doesn't get into24 your sort of spiraling out of control, what ­­ you know,25 how hard did you try, and what positions did you take ­­53 ­­ communicated.Right.  I also would want to No, no, no.  But then, yes,There wasn't enough­­ that ­­ so this goes back￼1 MS. SAHARSKY: Right, I mean ­­2 JUSTICE KAGAN: But just we told them what3 the claim is, and we talked about the claim.4 MS. SAHARSKY: Right. And two points to5 make about that. The first is, I think there is a6 concern about the spiralling out of control. You didn't7 tell us enough; that's essentially what Petitioner is8 saying in this case. We want more information, we want9 more information, et cetera. So I put that on the10 table.11 But the second point, and this goes to the12 first thing you suggested, is that the commission is13 required to make a reasonable cause determination, and14 that does provide notice to the employer about what has15 been found through the investigation. So in this case16 it said: We have determined that ­­ that there is17 reasonable cause to support that in your ­­ in your18 mining facilities, you have failed to hire a class of19 women for mining ­­ for mining jobs, and that's what the20 problem was. So I think to some extent what you're21 saying in terms of identifying the problem already22 happens through the reasonable cause determination.23 And one point, if I could, I would just like24 to make sure that the Court gets is in terms of the ­­25 the real problems with trying to come up with a standard54￼1 and the problems that the courts of appeals have seen.2 I mentioned the mini­trials that are collateral to the3 main event, the fact that the Court has to make up4 standards. You know, I can see the difficulties with5 making up standards just from our discussion today. But6 then there's also needing to jury rig the7 confidentiality provisions. They do say not to use in8 court and that's what Petitioner is talking about, is9 really a full court review of everything said and done10 during conciliation. And if the Court has any doubt11 about what that is, I would point the Court to the12 footnotes again and the discussion in our brief that13 talks about, even when a court said it's just good faith14 review, those courts disagreed about what does that mean15 and what do we have to do, et cetera, et cetera.16 And if the Court today announced five17 factors or something like that, the Court would no doubt18 be faced with future cases about, what does this factor19 mean and what does this factor mean, and whatever else.20 That's ­­ I mean, aside from the fact that the standard21 is completely made up.22 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the world. That's23 the world. There's always litigation over ­­ over24 stuff. I mean, you ­­ you want to be exempt from any25 litigation over whether a particular standard has been55￼1 met or not?2 MS. SAHARSKY: I think the problem ­­3 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's extraordinary. That4 does not exist in this world.5 MS. SAHARSKY: What I think is6 extraordinary, Justice Scalia, is reading something into7 a statute that doesn't exist, which is ­­ there are no8 standards in the statute.9JUSTICE SCALIA: That’s fine. And if you like that, if you're worried ­­ number one, this could set forth standards one, two, three, four, you have to do this, this, this, this, and this. I prefer not to do that. And if you leave it to the courts to do it, each lower court is going to have10 don't11 Court12 five;13 would14 lower15 a different ­­ a different set of things.16 But the remedy for that is ­­ is at your17 hands. As the other side said, you could issue rules18 which say, this is an informal process, but what it19 consists of is, number one, we give you notice of what20 the ­­ what the offense is; we sit down with you to21 discuss settlement of that; number three, we make22 apparent to you what our offer is for settling the23 matter, and whatever other rudiments of conciliation the24 agency believes in.25 What's wrong with that?56￼1 MS. SAHARSKY: Well, the ­­ the agency has2 not done that because it needs flexibility in these3 processes and because it doesn't believe that this is4 judicially reviewable. I think the idea about putting5 regulations in place assumes that there is going to be ­­6 JUSTICE SCALIA:7 it's judicially reviewable8 it's judicially reviewable9 issue rules?10 MS. SAHARSKY:11 that. But the agency hasn't done it up to this point12 because what it does instead of setting out regulations,13 because it doesn't believe that this gives a private14 right to ­­ to employers to enforce, is it has its own15 training procedures about good ways to do conciliation16 and the steps to be taken.17 JUSTICE BREYER:18 or a mediator, but those I19 create such rules. On the20 It might be that conciliation is a process that in part21 is intuitive. So to require22 rules of consideration is to23 compliance with those rules.24 MS. SAHARSKY: I think that's ­­25 JUSTICE BREYER: And that is, I think, your57  So if we tell you it's ­­­­ suppose we just decideand remand for the agency toYes, then the agency would do  I ­­ I'm not a conciliatorknow who are might be able toother hand, they might not.the agency to set forthinvite judicial review of1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425point.  And I don't think it's a minor point.  I thinkit's rather important.  If the conciliation process isactually to work, let it go.MS. SAHARSKY: I think you're right, that to a significant extent the conciliation is more an art than a science. It depends on the facts of the case and it depends on the relationship with an employer. If the employer said, we're never going to come to an agreement, that would change how much information the conciliation, the ­­ how far along the conciliation might go or how many offers the commission might make.JUSTICE SCALIA: But I thought Justice Breyer said you have to make the phone call if your letter says it's going to make the phone call. I thought Justice Breyer believed that there are some rudiments.      MS. SAHARSKY:      JUSTICE SCALIA:what the rudiments are.I think that ­­  We're just talking about      JUSTICE BREYER:conciliation ­­ what are theconciliation ­­They're calledthree words?

SAHARSKY: I think ­­ I think it's2 helpful to focus back on that language that Congress put3 in place, because we think that it did not intend and4 did not show any intention to put any kind of specific5 requirements like that on the commission. It said6 endeavor to eliminate the employment discrimination. I7 think ­­8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why does it ­­ in9 terms of additionally saying, yes, we called them, how10 can you conciliate ­­ this question has been asked; I11 don't know that we've gotten an answer ­­ without12 telling them what you want?

What do you think15 about that?16 You don't have to ­­ then that's the end of17 it. You don't have to say, we'll take ten, or anything18 else. 1920 that. 2122 gives23 alleged discrimination is.24 Two, the commission does as a general rule25 provide this information about what it is interested in59They need to know at least what you want. MS. SAHARSKY: Well, two thoughts about Three thoughts.First, the reasonable cause determinationthem notice about what the discrimination ­­￼1 getting.2 Third, though, there are tactics in3 conciliations where one side might wait for the other4 side to make an offer, et cetera, et cetera. And it's5 really that kind of second­guessing that we think is a6 serious problem.7 One thing that I think is useful is to step8 back and look at what would happen under our view of the9 world as opposed to Petitioner's view of the world.10 Under our view of the world, we believe that the EEOC is11 conciliating and has significant incentives to12 conciliate. But if we're wrong about that, the worst13 case is a trial about the employment discrimination on14 the merits, that we actually move on to the main event15 and answer the question, which is ­­ that the EEOC has16 been investigating: Was there discrimination here? And17 we typically see that as a good thing in our American18 society.19 But what is the downside of Petitioner's20 position is really this long ­­ mini­trials that are21 collateral to the merits that happen to have ­­ that22 have to happen and are happening in a majority of cases.23 They take up significant court resources, and they're24 not supposed to happen because of the confidentiality25 requirements.60￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You want to go ­­2 you want to go to ­­ Congress wanted you to try to3 conciliate.4 MS. SAHARSKY: Yes.5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So to say that it's6 a good thing to get to the merits it seems to me is not7 ­­ doesn't take account of what Congress said, which is,8 before you go to the merits, try to conciliate.9 MS. SAHARSKY:10 Chief Justice, is that the11 employment discrimination,12 to do.13 And so getting to the main event, which is,14 has there been employment discrimination, as opposed to15 giving employers this private right that Congress never16 intended, we do think is a good thing. We think that17 this has gone too far in the courts of appeals, it's not18 what Congress intended, it's led to significant19 consequences for the courts and for the agency, and it's20 hurting conciliation.21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we'll just say ­­22 I'm going to say one more time, I think there's23 substantial merit to your position that the courts have24 gone too far. But you have given us no midway, no ­­ no25 alternative.61What I'm trying to say, Mr.point of Title VII is to stopand that's what we're trying1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MS. SAHARSKY: Well ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Other than to say, no judicial review. And I think that's a serious ­­ it's a serious suggestion to make.MS. SAHARSKY: I think that there are some options that Justice Kagan laid out, along with Justice Breyer, in terms of some minimal requirements for the agency. But the point that I would just like to make clear to the Court is that they're nothing like what's happening in the court of appeals. And some of those courts of appeals start at the same place where some members of the Court are today, which just ­­ which is, let's just ask for a minimal level of good faith review, and it is nonetheless the case that it has devolved into really searching review that can't be justified on the statute's text.Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. Saharsky.      Mr. Goldstein, you have 4 minutes remaining.    REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEINON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you.I'm going to work on the assumption that theCourt is going to find that there needs to be some62￼￼1 judicial review. Then the Court is going to face the2 following question: Should it announce the rudiments,3 or should it simply reverse the court of appeals?4 Because all the court of appeals said is that there is5 no judicial review after the letter. The ordinary6 practice of the Court would be decide what the court of7 appeals did, and you've been assured by the agency that8 if you do do that the agency will promulgate the9 rudiments, and so there's a good reason to do that.10 But you have been interested in what the11 rudiments would be. Here's what they are. They're12 taken directly from the cases and from the statute. The13 first obligation is to conference. We think the14 rudiment of conference is you tell the employer: Get in15 touch. If you want to conciliate, the employer says, I16 want to talk. You are willing to talk, if it's by17 letter, if it's by phone, if it's in person. That's the18 rudiment of conferencing.19 Conciliation. If we're going to endeavor to20 resolve this by conciliation, I have to tell you what21 the minimum will be. The reasonable cause determination22 doesn't say that. It says, we're going to sue you; it23 doesn't say what it would take to resolve the case. So24 I've got to tell you what it would be at a minimum, and25 that has to be ­­631 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE KAGAN: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

You're can3 bargain about wages. You can bargain about hours, about4 working conditions. This is quite different.5 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Ginsburg, could I6 just briefly get out the rudiments, because I think7 there's been significant interest in that. The offer8 that they say, what will be acceptable to us, has to be9 something they could legally get. That is to say it's a10 claim that's in the reasonable cause determination and11 it's something that they could get in court.12 And persuasion is just to provide the basics13 of where that comes from. You can't expect the employer14 or the employer's insurer to say, okay, I'll give you a15 million dollars, if the EEOC won't even say where ­­ the16 basics of where the million dollars came from. That is17 to say, we've got about 20 employees; we think that18 their damages are roughly $50,000.19 This is not an intrusive inquiry into the20 details of ­­21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is it satisfactory ­­22 JUSTICE KAGAN: That is intrusive. I mean,23 you're doing your best job of proving Ms. Saharsky's24 point here, because you're saying they have to put all25 the reasons on the table, they have to say why it is65￼1 that they're asking for what it is that they're asking2 for, they have to say, you know, what they would be ­­3 the only ­­ the last thing that they would find4 acceptable.5 MR.

Because you're running out of time.16 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, I don't have any other17 rudiments. Those are all my rudiments.

We never had an opportunity to do14 any of those things.15 We think that there is a presumption of16 regularity, but it's called the presumption of17 regularity because then you can disprove it.
