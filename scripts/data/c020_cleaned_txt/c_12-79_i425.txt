Troice in the consolidated cases.      Mr. Clement.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENTON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      The Stanford Ponzi scheme was a massivefraud, but that fraud clearly included materialmisrepresentations about transactions in coveredsecurities.  The complaints in this case bear that out.      Plaintiffs allege specifically that theirmoney was ­­ there were misrepresentations about howtheir money would be invested in covered securities,that the misrepresentation was material, and that,indeed, the security of the underlying investments wasthe most important factor in securing Plaintiff's owninvestments in the CDs.JUSTICE KENNEDY: , I ­­ I think there's some problem with whether or not this was covered securities, but I also think that's not in the case anymore. Am I correct in the latter assumption?4￼￼1 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I certainly agree with2 you in the latter assumption, Your Honor, which is both3 lower courts decided this on the case that the complaint4 specifically ­­ referred to covered securities5 specifically enough.6 I don't want to belabor the point because I7 don't think it's in the case, but I will say I do think8 there's a reason that that was not a contested issue9 because, if you think about the securities that were10 referred to, strong multinational corporations, major11 international banks, those are companies that are traded12 on U.S. national exchanges.13 Also, if you get into the details of the14 record, I mean, if you want to look at15 something, Joint Appendix page 746 is an attachment to16 the Willis complaint. And there, there's a reference to17 the New York Stock Exchange, and it's a translated18 letter to investors, and you can read it more than one19 way.20 But I sure think the whole point of that21 paragraph is to lead the Plaintiffs to think that their22 stocks ­­ they're buying an interest in stocks that would23 be traded on the New York Stock Exchange particularly.24 So ­­25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if ­­ if I'm5￼1 trying to get a home loan and they ask you what assets2 you have and I list a couple of stocks, and, in fact,3 it's fraudulent, I don't own them, that's a covered4 transaction, that's a 10b­5 violation?5 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I don't know, Mr. Chief6 Justice. That would depend on the answer to a question7 that I don't think the Court has to decide in this case,8 which is whether a reference to your stockholdings would9 be sufficient to ­­ to come with ­­10 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose you say you're11 going to pay off the loan by selling some stock12 holdings, eventually.13 MR. CLEMENT: Yeah, I think that probably14 would be covered, Your Honor, and I don't think that's15 any great surprise. I mean, this Court held in a case16 called Reuben against the United States that, if you17 pledge securities that are ­­ and tell the bank that18 they're valuable and they, in fact, aren't, that that's19 covered by the securities law.20 In that case, it wasn't just in connection21 with, it was actually considered a constructive sale or22 transfer of the securities.23 JUSTICE SCALIA: If they were covered24 securities, right? I mean, you're ­­ you're pledging25 covered securities to the bank and make a6￼1 misrepresentation about them, right?2 MR. CLEMENT: Well, that's right. I'm just3 saying, though, that I don't think the fact that you can4 have a misrepresentation in connection with a loan5 application or something like that is all that6 surprising in the sense that the way that both 10b,7 10b­5, and SLUSA are structured.8 The "in connection with" requirement can9 take something that might otherwise be plain fraud, and10 if there's a misrepresentation in connection with a11 security or a covered security, that makes it securities12 fraud. But that ­­13 JUSTICE BREYER: My goodness. Are there14 cases where they brought such things? I mean, every15 State has laws that forbid fraud. And mortgages are16 probably ­­ and loans are probably made in the billions17 every year. All it takes is someone to say, on his18 sheet of listing assets, to have a covered security and19 say, don't worry, I'll hold these, I'll hold them.20 Or don't worry, I will sell this one and buy21 that one. Don't worry, I'll buy another one. I22 won't ­­ I won't put up the security of my sprinkler23 system. I will sell the sprinkler system and use it to24 buy a ­­ a covered exchange.25 I guess if those fall within the securities7￼1 laws, we would have expected to see billions of actions.2 Why not?3 MR. CLEMENT: Well, with ­­ with respect, I4 don't think, in most of these cases, anything is going5 to particularly turn on that. I also think ­­ I'm happy6 to answer ­­7 JUSTICE BREYER: I know that's what you8 think, but I need to know why you think it. If there9 are billion ­­ if I'm right in my ­­ what I just said.10 MR. CLEMENT: Because there are lots of11 cases where whether you can prosecute a fraud or12 securities fraud is not going to make much difference.13 You can go at it either way. There are circumstances ­­14 there are really two things that are at issue here. One15 is ­­16 JUSTICE BREYER: Tell me a case where the17 SEC has ever ­­ there may be such cases ­­ but what is18 done is somebody simply tried to get a loan and he19 put on that sheet of paper listing assets a covered20 security. And he said, I intend to keep it. Or he21 said ­­ you know, I will buy some more, or I'll sell it22 and buy some more or ­­ you know, or put in your three23 things.24 Just list the case where they've ever25 prosecuted that as a securities fraud or private people8￼1 have. After all, it's beneficial, sometimes, for2 private people. What are the cases?3 MR. CLEMENT: Your Honor, I don't know that4 there are cases directly on point. But let me be clear.5 Our theory here does not, by any means, necessarily have6 to extend to those holder situations. What is at issue7 here is not just a misrepresentation about holdings of8 securities. It is ­­ they are misrepresentations about9 covered securities transactions.10 And more particularly, they are false11 promises to purchase covered securities for Plaintiffs'12 benefit. And there are SEC cases that are brought under13 those circumstances and, as well, there should be14 because, when you sell something, whether it's a15 noncovered security or something else based on a16 misrepresentation about covered securities, you trigger17 the interests of the SEC and18 JUSTICE KAGAN:19 prenuptial agreement, and as20 agreement, they agree that, in a year, one party to the21 marriage is going to sell as many shares of Google stock22 and buy a home with it. Is that covered by the23 securities laws now?24 MR. CLEMENT: I would think probably not, at25 the end of the day, but I also would say that this is so9SLUSA in a distinct way.Suppose two people reach apart of the prenuptial25 JUSTICE KAGAN:Somebody, not necessarily￼1 far removed from that. I mean, first of all ­­2 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how is it removed from3 that? Because it has the same structural features,4 which is it's a misrepresentation about what you're5 going to do with securities, but, in fact, does not6 affect any securities trading.7 decision to do something else,8 my example, to go get married.9 MR. CLEMENT: With respect, Your Honor, I10 think this Court has already crossed the bridge that you11 don't have to effect the specific transaction in which12 you are ­­ the fraud is alleged to be associated with.13 So you have cases like O'Hagan, for example, where the14 actual transaction on the ­­ on the exchange is not15 sullied with the fraud and the victim of the fraud16 doesn't even trade, the holder of the confidential17 information ­­18 JUSTICE KAGAN: In all of our cases, there's19 been something to say when somebody can ask the20 question, how has this affected a potential purchaser or21 seller in the market for the relevant securities? And22 here, there's nothing to say.23 MR. CLEMENT: With respect, I disagree with24 the premise. I don't think ­­10 What it affects is ahere, to buy CDs or, in￼1 the victim of the fraud, but somebody has to have had2 some transaction in the market. It's the kind of3 misrepresentation that would affect someone in making4 transactions in the covered market. How would this do5 that?6 MR. CLEMENT: Well, the only way in which7 there isn't that kind of transaction here is because the8 fraud was bigger. As we point out in the briefs, if you9 imagine that this was a thing where they said, look,10 we're going to purchase multinational corporations; and,11 instead, they purchase domestic corporations.12 Well, then, there would be a transaction13 that would not have otherwise occurred on the market and14 domestic transactions that would have been perfectly15 analogous to the kind of normal transaction that took16 place in Bankers Life or in Zandford on the market.17 And yet, the fraud was sufficiently associated with this.18 And I don't think this Court wants to say19 that the only frauds that are not in connection with are20 the really big ones ­­21 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what is the case?22 What is the specific case, private or SEC, that comes23 the closest ­­ I grant you there is none direct ­­ but24 comes the closest to Justice Kagan's hypothetical, if25 you marry me, I will sell my IBM stock?11JUSTICE BREYER:MR. CLEMENT:JUSTICE BREYER:   Try ­­And I think privately ­­￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. CLEMENT: I don't think there's a particularly close case because, A, I think the SEC has better things to do.                             What is the SEC's closestcase ­­ but they may be better at answering this.  Whatis their closest case to the horribles that they foreseeif you lose?MR. CLEMENT: Well, I ­­ I think, probably, I would start with the Richard Line case, which is cited on page 21 of their brief. And what that case shows is that you can have frauds in connection with covered securities that affect things that are either not covered securities or, in that case, are nothing at all.Mr. Line was very clever. He took people who were interested in having their kids go to college and needed financial aid, and he said, I'll take your assets from you, and they'll be ­­ they'll be mine, I'm not going to give you anything in return, not a covered security, nothing, because the whole point of this is to get your assets off your books.      And what I'll do is I'll invest those in themarket, make a bunch of money, and in four years, whenyou're no longer worried about financial aid, I'll12￼1 return your principal and some of the proceeds. And ­­2 JUSTICE ALITO:3 Kagan's hypothetical and in4 that it's really irrelevant5 question are securities or some other asset. And it's6 also ­­ and, therefore, a fortiori, it's irrelevant7 whether ­­ if it involves securities, whether they're8 covered or they're not covered.9 Now, would you be willing to concede that,10 in that situation, where it really ­­ all you're talking11 about is an asset. It doesn't matter whether it's a12 covered security or a ­­ a Rembrandt or gold, that, in13 that situation, 10(b) doesn't reach the case?14 MR. CLEMENT: I think that ­­ I would agree15 with that, Justice Alito, but for a slightly different16 reason than you may be imagining, which is I think one17 of the mistakes that can be made here is to ask in18 connection with ­­ do all the work. And the statute19 has multiple requirements, including a materiality20 requirement.21 And as your question suggests, if you're22 making a misrepresentation and the whole point of it is23 to just tell somebody that, look, I have wealth, or I24 have sort of assets, I don't know that the specific25 nature of them makes any difference.13Well, in Justice ­­ Justicesome of the others, it seemsin whether the assets in￼1 But in a case like this, the whole point of2 this fraud was to take a noncovered security and to3 imbue it with some of the positive qualities of a4 covered security, the most important of which being5 liquidity. And if you look at sort of the underlying6 brochures here that were used to market this, that's7 really what this fraud was all about.8 These ­­­ these CDs were offered as being9 better than normal CDs because we can get you your money10 whenever you need it.11 JUSTICE ALITO: Does it matter that there ­­12 apparently, there is not an allegation that there13 actually were any purchases or sales of covered14 securities? It says in ­­ the statute says, "in15 connection with the purchase or sale of a covered16 security." And there weren't.17 There ­­ I don't believe there's an18 allegation that they actually were purchased or sold.19 Does that matter?20 MR. CLEMENT: It doesn't matter, Your Honor,21 for the reason I indicated earlier, which is you don't22 want to draw a line that basically says, look, if you23 buy different securities than you were supposed to or24 you sell fewer than you were supposed to, that's25 covered, but if you're a Madoff, and you go all the way14￼1 and simply lie about the whole thing and there never2 were any securities purchases at all, that that's3 somehow better.4 JUSTICE ALITO: What's your best case on5 that?6 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think, again, if ­­ if7 you want to start with SEC adjudications, again, on page8 21, there is the Jett adjudication where, again, there9 was a broker/dealer in that case, and they just made up10 the trades. They told their employer, you know, look11 how I've done, look at these great trades. And there12 just weren't any trades.13 And of course, all of the Madoff cases ­­ or14 a substantial number of Madoff cases fit that ­­ fit15 that ­­ that categorization. It's actually not clear16 whether this case does because, at the end of the day, I17 think what's alleged is either there were no purchases18 or substantially less purchases of covered securities19 than represented.20 Nobody has really thought the difference21 between zero and substantially less made much of a22 difference in this case. And I would certainly, like I23 said, suggest that that's the right result because,24 whatever else is true, you can't somehow have a better25 fraud that's immune from the SEC, just because you15￼1 completely made the whole thing up and there were no2 transactions at all.3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. ­­ Mr. Clement, there4 are ­­ Zandford said that "in connection with" doesn't5 include every common law fraud that happens to involve6 covered securities. So can you give us an example of7 what would not be covered? What fraud involving8 securities would not qualify as in connection with the9 sale or purchase of securities?10 MR. CLEMENT: Sure. Let me start with ­­ I11 mean ­­ with a hypothetical that Zandford used because I12 think it helps illustrate why, even if coincide is the13 test, we satisfied here. What Zandford was really14 distinguishing is two cases, one where a broker/dealer15 gets money from a potential client with the purest of16 intentions and only at a later stage do they say ­­ you17 know, I'm kind of below on own payments, I need some18 money, I'm going to embezzle the funds.19 And Zandford said, in that context, the20 fraud and the security purchases are independent events.21 I don't think anybody would look at this case and say22 that the misrepresentations about covered securities23 purchases and the fraud were independent events, nor24 would anybody say that this isn't a case where, from the25 very beginning, there was intent by Stanford not to make16￼1 good on the promise to purchase covered securities on2 behalf of the plaintiffs.3 So this is like Zandford itself or Wharf ­­4 Wharf Holdings itself, where the fraudulent intent is5 there at the very moment the transaction takes place.6 And, again, Wharf Holdings is another example where this7 Court says, in dictum, that, well ­­ you know, it would8 be one thing if they sold the option and only, later,9 independently decided that they weren't going to perform10 on the option.11 But if they had that intent all along, they12 clearly coincide. Now ­­13 JUSTICE SCALIA:14 purpose of the securities15 purchasers and sellers of16 is no purchaser or cover ­­ or seller of a covered17 security involved here.18 MR. CLEMENT: Well, there ­­19 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's ­­ it's a purchaser of20 not ­­ not­covered securities who is being defrauded, if21 anyone. Why ­­ why would the Federal securities law22 protect that person?23 MR. CLEMENT: A couple things, Your Honor.24 First of all, obviously, the Federal securities laws25 apply to non­covered securities, as well as covered17   I had assumed that thelaws was to protect thethe covered securities.  There1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425securities.  So the real question here is going to beSLUSA's coverage because, as I said, 10b­5 applies tonon­covered securities.      Second of all, this Court is well over thebridge about not requiring that it be the plaintiff'sown purchases or sales that are what the inquiry focuseson.  And that's been true in a whole line of thisCourt's cases.  And in ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't have to be the plaintiff's, but it has to be somebody's.MR. CLEMENT: Well, and here, there are purchases of covered securities. They're the alleged purchases. They're the false promises that I'm going ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Nonexistent purchases, right?MR. CLEMENT: Well, as I said, I don't think anything turns on it, but there actually were some purchases. And they ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The only element of fraud in there was by the bank itself. They're the only ones whose purchases or sales could be said to have been affected by the misrepresentation. And of course, they can't ­­MR. CLEMENT: Right, but ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: ­­ make any claim on18￼89 10 11 12CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But somebody else ­­ somebody else was, right?MR. CLEMENT: Sure, and ­­ and the plaintiffs were clearly affected by this fraud.￼1 that basis.2 MR. CLEMENT: Right, Mr. Chief Justice, and 3 that has been the case in other cases as well. The4   security transactions in Bankers Life, neither the5   seller nor the buyer of those transactions had ­­ was6   affected by ­­ directly by the fraud.  In Zandford,7   there were security sales.  Those security sales ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not by the purchase 13 or sale, right? They were affected, according to your14   theory, by the fact that, oh, they told us there were15   these stocks, but the actual purchases and sales, the16   fraud did not go to the purchase and sales of the17   covered securities; they went to the CDs.18 MR. CLEMENT: And, again, that's true, in so19   many of the cases.  Dabit, the holders didn't purchase or sell20   at all, but that was okay.  O'Hagan, the defrauded party21   was the company with the confidential information.22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Your white light is on,23   but what is the simplest formulation of your test?24   If ­­ if we were to write the opinion your way, what ­­25   the test would be?191 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. CLEMENT: The simplest ­­ the simplest, narrowest way to decide this case is to say that, when there is a misrepresentation and a false promise topurchase covered securities for theplaintiffs, then the "in connectionrequired.      If I may reserve my time.      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:      Ms. Goldenberg.benefit of thewith" standard isThank you, counsel.￼    ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG,     FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERSMS. GOLDENBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, and mayit please the Court:      We agree with the narrow formulation thatMr. Clement just gave, that the issue in this case isthat it involves a false promise to purchase coveredsecurities using the fraud victims' money in a way thatthey are told is going to benefit them and that that isa classic securities fraud.  Their question ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how ­­ how broad is the word "benefit"? Because that's really what this case comes down to.MS. GOLDENBERG:JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:Well, I think ­­   Assuming we accepted20￼1 your narrow test, which wouldn't address every situation2 that the other circuits have talked about, but let's ­­3 let's ­­4 MS. GOLDENBERG: I think it's clear that5 "benefit" isn't restricted merely to ownership of the6 securities themselves, and I would point to ­­7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that was the8 Madoff situation, which was different from this one.9 MS. GOLDENBERG: Well, I don't think the10 Madoff situation is particularly different from this11 one. In Madoff, there were feeder funds that people12 were buying into that were non­covered securities.13 And what they were being told is that the14 money that was being put into the feeder fund was then15 going to go on and be used to purchase covered16 securities that they, themselves, were not going to have17 an ownership interest in, but that the benefit of those18 purchases was going to be passed back to them through19 this intermediate layer.20 JUSTICE BREYER: But ­­ but the ­­ the case21 that he said ­­ I'm quite interested in your reaction to22 which cases that you've ever brought, this would, if you23 lose here, would prevent you from bringing, and Line was24 the one that was mentioned.25 MS.

I'll throw that in.11 MS. GOLDENBERG: Your Honor, the ­­ just to12 return to Line for a moment, and then I'd like to13 address sort of how the purposes of the securities laws14 are implicated in a situation like this, in Line, what15 the victims were told was that they were going to be16 given the money back after four years had passed, with17 interest calculated above market rate.18 So they are not being told that they were19 going to be given whatever profit is made on a20 securities transaction, or, as I read Line, although21 it's slightly sparse on its facts, that they're going to22 be the owners of the securities or have an ownership23 interest in any way. And so I do think it is cases like24 Line that are at the margin ­­23￼1 of ours, is it?2 MS. GOLDENBERG:3 JUSTICE SCALIA:4 court, is it?5 MS. GOLDENBERG:6 JUSTICE SCALIA:7 MS.

GOLDENBERG: Well, but this is much more20 particular, again, to the mechanism by which the21 securities markets operate. And I think another22 look at it is just to imagine the honest version23 Stanford.24 If someone honestly said to CD purchasers,25 give me your money, and I'm going to put it into25way to ofcovered￼1 securities, and people invested in that scheme, then2 that would pump money into the covered securities3 markets.4 But now, people are much less likely to5 invest in a scheme like that.6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well ­­ but nobody7 is suggesting that the SEC can't take action with8 respect to the noncovered securities. So to the extent9 there's diminished confidence in the securities markets,10 the SEC has all the tools available to address that.11 The question is the different one under SLUSA.12 MS. GOLDENBERG: Well, I think it's true13 that the SEC would continue to have tools, but I do14 think ­­15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, in fact,16 I ­­ this ­­ it would inspire confidence to the extent17 that lawyers can bring these actions, as opposed to18 having them precluded, which is what you're arguing for.19 I'm sorry I interrupted you.20 MS. GOLDENBERG: Well ­­ no, that's fine. I21 think that this is a very particular effect on investor22 confidence and the integrity of the markets, which is23 one of the purposes of the securities laws.24 And with respect to SLUSA, the purpose of25 SLUSA is to try to stop people from going around the2624 MS. GOLDENBERG:25 JUSTICE ALITO: Sure.The test that Mr. Clement￼1 requirements of the PSLRA and some of the limitations in2 this Court's decisions, and I think that purpose is ­­3 is at issue here as well.4 I'd also like to talk a little bit, if I5 could, about the issue that was raised earlier about6 whether an actual purchase or sale needed to be made, or7 whether a purported or intended purchase or sale is8 sufficient.9 And I think that, practically, from the10 moment that the '33 and '34 Act went into place, there's11 been a consensus in the lower courts ­­ and the SEC has12 said this as well ­­ that a purported or intended13 purchase or sale is sufficient.14 And it's for the reason that Mr. Clement15 gave that, otherwise, you have these home run, egregious16 frauds, where someone is, instead of saying I'm going to17 buy this less risky thing and then buying a riskier18 thing, someone says, I'm going to buy securities, and19 then doesn't buy them at all and absconds with the20 money, and that that is something ­­ a situation that21 has to be ­­ has to be covered.22 JUSTICE ALITO: Can I take you back to the23 test that you think we should apply here?27￼1 articulated and that you agreed with seems to amount2 to ­­ to saying, when exactly what is alleged here is3 alleged, that that's ­­ that that's within 10b or 10b­5,4 that's not that helpful as a precedent going forward.5 Now, the test that Justice Breyer suggested,6 whether something would affect investors' confidence in7 the securities market, I don't know how we can ­­ and8 you say, yes, this would ­­ that would be met here ­­ I9 don't know how we can determine what ­­ whether10 something, certainly, of this nature or maybe even11 further removed, would, in effect ­­ would affect12 investor confidence.13 Somebody might read about this scheme in the14 paper and say, well ­­ you know, there's a lot of hanky15 panky going on with the sale of any kind of securities16 and CDs, I'm just going to keep cash under my mattress.17 How do we ­­ how would we determine that?18 MS. GOLDENBERG: Well, I ­­ I think it's for19 the reasons that I gave earlier, which is that this goes20 to the purchase/sale mechanism and that we know that21 people have to have confidence in that order ­­ in order22 for the securities markets to work.23 It may well be that people also ­­ you know,24 lack confidence in other things, but that is the thing25 that's the particular problem and the thing that the28￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425securities laws are aimed at. And I know Petitioner ­­ JUSTICE SCALIA: What ­­ what troubles me, Ms. Goldenberg, is not the problem of our figuring outthese economic consequences, but the text of thestatute, which says, "in connection with the purchase orsale of one of the covered securities."      MS. GOLDENBERG:      JUSTICE SCALIA:or sale here.      MS. GOLDENBERG:purported purchase.      JUSTICE SCALIA:with a purchase or sale thatmean, it could be have read in connection with thepurchase or sale or the promised purchase or sale or thecontemplated purchase or sale, but it doesn't.  It says,"in connection with the purchase or sale."I don't know how you can make that stick toa situation where there has been no purchase or sale. MS. GOLDENBERG: That's true, Your Honor,but it also doesn't say the consummated purchase orsale, and so I think the purported, intended,consummated, all those things are swept up in the text.And I think that's consistent with the way that youwould use the phrase in ordinary life.29Yes, Your Honor.There has been no purchaseWell, there's been aIt can't be in connectionhas never occurred.  I1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      If I were going to go to my real estatebrokers to sell my house, I might gather up a bunch ofdocuments, I might show up at the office at a certaintime, in connection with the sale of my house.  And evenif the sale falls through and there is no consummatedcontract, I've still done those things in connectionwith the sale.      And as I say, I think courts and the SEChave consistently taken that position, and if itweren't ­­ if that weren't the case, then egregiousfrauds would go unremedied, and that would be atremendous problem.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.      Mr. Goldstein.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. THOMAS GOLDSTEINON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and mayit please the Court:      I would ask you to write an opinionaffirming and that adopts the following rule ­­ and thatis that a false promise to purchase securities for one'sself in which no other person will have an interest isnot a material misrepresentation in connection with thepurchase or sale of covered securities.      The other side has asked you to adopt a rule30￼￼1 that has never been advocated by the SEC in any other2 proceeding; it's never been advocated, as I understand3 it, in its briefs in this case; it's never been adopted4 by any Court ever. And I think there are good reasons5 for that.6 Their theory is that what happened here is7 that there was a promise to buy covered securities that8 would be for the benefit of someone else. That has two9 textual flaws, it doesn't comport with the purpose of10 the statute, and it would have extraordinary11 consequences.12 It doesn't ­­ it doesn't conform to the text13 of the statute in either of two ways. Covered security,14 which is what the Plaintiffs here purchased, is a15 defined term. It is a security, but only the subset of16 securities that are traded on a national exchange and17 some of the other additions that would involve, for18 example, mutual funds.19 And so Congress didn't say that it was in20 connection with the purchase or sale of a covered21 security, if it was a covered security that someone else22 would get the benefit of.23 It is ­­ what has to be bought here is a24 stock, and instead, what was bought here was a CD. As25 Mr. Clement says, this is a case of a massive fraud. He31JUSTICE ALITO:textual flaw is.I don't understand what theMR. GOLDSTEIN:JUSTICE ALITO:Okay.  So ­­What is the jumping offfor this flaw?MR. GOLDSTEIN:The jumping off point is￼1 could well have said, this is a case of a massive2 securities fraud, but it was not a case of a covered3 securities fraud. The Plaintiffs here bought something4 that Congress specifically excluded from preclusion5 under SLUSA.6 The second textual flaw in their position is7 that ­­89 first101112 point 1314 that there ­­ is the defined term "covered security."15 JUSTICE ALITO: Right.16 MR. GOLDSTEIN: So SLUSA only applies if17 there was a material misrepresentation in the ­­ in the18 purchase or sale of a covered security.19 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, everybody ­­ the case20 proceeds on the assumption that the ­­ that the CDs were21 not covered securities. The question is whether it's ­­22 the "in connection with" requirement is met by the23 allegation, which is interpreted to mean that there24 would be future purchases and sales of covered25 securities.32￼1 So I'm not sure what ­­ what you're getting2 out of the fact that covered securities is a ­­ is a3 defined term.4 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Because Congress asked5 you ­­ or told the courts to focus on the question of6 what the product is, that there was a misrepresentation7 in the course of the transaction, in the course of the8 purchase or sale, and that is only a covered security.9 It is not some other product that has, as a benefit, an10 interest in a covered security.11 JUSTICE ALITO: It doesn't say a12 misrepresentation about the covered security. It says,13 "a misrepresentation in connection with."14 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's actually, I think,15 Your Honor, a really good point for us because the other16 side's argument, up till the brief ­­ excuse me ­­ up17 until the oral argument, is that it was a18 misrepresentation about covered securities that would19 trigger SLUSA.20 The problem with their position is that what21 the Court has always said, when it talked about the22 definition of "in connection with," is really two23 things. It has to be flexible. We have to give the SEC24 the ability to deal with novel frauds. But because,25 metaphysically, everything is connected with everything33MR. GOLDSTEIN:It's in the cert pages, at￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425else, we're going to have to draw a line.  There's goingto have to be some limit.      And you've pointed out that it's not aneasily administered one, but the ­­ the bulwark, the onething that stops 10b­5 from getting completely out ofcontrol, is that all of the frauds involved are onesthat the Court has recognized would have an effect onthe regulated market.  That was true in O'Hagan; it wastrue in Zandford.      Now, I realize that my friend from theSolicitor General's Office said today, at the podium,that they can imagine that this fraud would have aneffect on the regulated market.  They did say theopposite in their briefing in the case.  Their brief atthe cert stage said there was no possibility that therewould be an effect on the regulated market.      And so this, I ­­ I imagine ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can you ­­ can you just give me the page for that?MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, sir. The ­­ it is ­­ I will get it during the ­­ it's quoted multiple times in our brief, but my colleagues will get it, if you don't mind, and ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no. It's okay.34￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425about page 12, I think, but we'll ­­ I will have it foryou in just a moment, please.     And they said there is no ­­ the ­­ to quoteit almost verbatim, there was no prospect that thisfraud would have an effect on the covered securitiesmarket.     The second textual flaw ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait. And ­­ and if that's ­­ if that's wrong, you acknowledge you don't win?     MR. GOLDSTEIN:     JUSTICE SCALIA:difference does it make?     MR. GOLDSTEIN:understood, they're ­­ they seem to recognize, and ifyou were to read, for example, their brief in Zandford, they saythat the sine qua non of their ability to determine asthe enforcement authority here, that something has a ­­is in connection with the purchase or sale of theregulated security is whether it would have an effect onthe regulated market.     They wrote a brief to you saying that and ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: And you really don't agree with that anyway.MR. GOLDSTEIN: I think that that is their35No, I do not. All right.  Okay.  So whatWell, it ­­ it is a ­­ as I￼1 best hope, and I don't think they can satisfy it. We2 think their authority is narrower still.3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What ­­ what is your4 position if the broker says, give me $100,000, and I5 will buy covered securities, and then he just pockets it6 and ­­ and flees?7 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That is securities fraud, in8 our view, according to the SEC's administrative9 position. No court has ever said that ­­ so that's10 Justice Scalia's point from the first half­hour.11 We can ­­ if that is correct, if the SEC is12 correct about that, we still prevail because what's13 happening is the broker is saying, I will purchase for14 you the covered securities. That's what the Line case15 stands for.16 Their brief in ­­17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I don't see how this18 case is that much different. They say, we were going to19 invest in CDs, and the CDs will be backed by purchase of20 the securities that we will purchase for you.21 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. So the ­­ the22 critical difference, I think, is in the definition of23 "purchase." And that was going to be the second textual24 flaw that I was going to point out. And that is we can25 acknowledge that they would have a much stronger case in36￼1 the hypothetical that you've described if the covered2 securities are pledged to back the CDs.3 This happens, for example, on a margin4 account. It happens if ­­ there are lots of times5 someone will say, I intend to use your money to buy6 covered securities, to buy stocks, and I am providing7 those stocks as security for the loan.8 The reason that's securities fraud is the9 definition of a purchase includes pledging the ­­10 pledging the stocks. That's really important. And it11 tracks with the Court's holding that "in connection12 with" reaches as far as frauds that would have an effect13 on the regulated market.14 Imagine if I were allowed to say, look, I am15 going to buy covered securities, and you now hold an16 interest in them ­­ an enforceable interest in the17 stocks. And if that were not securities fraud, the18 market couldn't function very well because things like19 margin accounts, you could never have the confidence20 that you would have the protection of 10b­5.21 The critical difference, Justice Kennedy, is22 between two different cases. If ­­ this case, which is23 SIB, says, look ­­ among all of its many24 misrepresentations ­­ I will take your money, and I25 intend to buy covered securities. That gets the ­­ you37￼1 know, putting all aside the difficulty of liquid assets2 versus covered securities, give them their best version3 of the representation here.4 But it was only buying it for itself. It5 did not pledge to sell the assets. It did not give the6 plaintiffs any interest in them. For example, the7 interest rate on the CDs was completely independent of8 the return on those covered securities.9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Goldstein, I take it,10 from what you said up to now, that you are not defending11 the Fifth Circuit's test. It called for a determination12 whether the misrepresentation is the heart or the crux13 of the complaint.14 MR. GOLDSTEIN: We ­­ we do defend that15 rule. We do not think it's the best ground to decide16 the case, and I will explain what I mean by that.17 The Fifth Circuit undertook to articulate a18 rule that would govern all cases in which someone19 purchased something that was supposedly invested in20 covered securities; so including, for example, the21 Madoff cases, where there was securities fraud. Madoff22 falsely sold interest in a fund. That's core securities23 fraud.24 SIB never sold any securities at all. It25 only sold CDs. So if the Court believed that the Fifth38￼1 Circuit was correct, that it was appropriate to decide2 all of these derivative investments ­­ if I could,3 cases ­­ then we think you need a flexible term like4 "more than tangentially related."5 But we think this case stands on its own, on6 the question of, look, if I promise ­­ if I sell you7 something, and I say I am going to take the money and8 buy CDs for myself, and those CDs have the quality of9 being liquid ­­ now, you don't have an interest in the10 CDs, I am not pledging them to you, so there is no11 purchase by you of a covered security ­­ then that is12 not a securities fraud.13 And I did want ­­ want to get ­­14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but that's the15 Line case where, I am told by the government, you were16 trying to ­­ I know that Justice Scalia doesn't think17 it's important, but I do. Okay?18 If someone tells me, sell your securities,19 give me the money, I will buy securities for myself and20 give you a fixed rate of return later, I think that's in21 connection with the purchase and sale of securities,22 even though it's not legally purchased for my benefit.23 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. Two things about24 that, Justice Sotomayor. I will say that if ­­ what I25 think you were actually told from the podium is that it3925 JUSTICE BREYER:That's true, suppose ­­ I￼1 is unclear from the SEC's administrative opinion whether2 the persons who gave the money to the broker as an3 investment were actually given an interest in the4 securities.5 It's just not clear from that opinion.6 There is certainly no SEC holding. Second ­­7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume they were.8 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. Then the second thing9 I would say is the SEC has always been very clear to you10 that the key part of your hypothetical is that it's a11 broker. And the SEC has said to you repeatedly, and I12 will just give this to you from their Zandford brief at13 page 23.14 "There is a particularly strong connection15 between fraud and securities transactions when16 stockbrokers, like Respondent, misappropriate securities17 and securities proceeds from brokerage accounts."18 The key feature is that you can understand19 why it is that the market can't function if your20 stockbroker is making promises about buying and selling21 securities. This is a bank. This is a bank that22 doesn't issue covered securities in any way because it's23 a foreign bank. It issues only the non­covered24 securities that Congress specifically excluded from ­­40￼1 think what is difficult to define ­­ Jay Fisk gets into2 his horse and carriage, drives up and down Wall Street,3 and says, "I'm going to buy Union Pacific, I'm going to4 buy Union Pacific," knowing that people will, in fact,5 all run out and buy it quickly, and what he really6 intends to do is, when it comes out, he didn't, he's7 going to sell outright.8 Anyway, typical fraud.9 certainly covered.10 MR. GOLDSTEIN:11 manipulation.12 JUSTICE BREYER:13 here, what we have is Mr. Stanford, I guess, saying to14 people, "I'm going to buy securities, I'm going to buy15 securities."

Where neither of is present, it doesn't.                      That's right.                       Okay.10 1112 to the Madoff case ­­13 MR. GOLDSTEIN:14 JUSTICE KAGAN: ­­ because you portrayed it15 as investors joining into funds that directly held16 stock, and I thought that it was more complicated than17 that.18 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. I ­­ I will play it19 out. That was not my intention. The Madoff cases20 involved the following scenario, and there are diverse21 ones, and so I caution the course ­­ the Court about22 trying to lay down a rule that will govern all those.23 So Madoff engages in securities fraud.24 We ­­ in covered securities fraud. He says, I have this25 fund; it is invested in stocks. That turns out to be42And it's not ­­Could ­­ could you go backYes.￼1 completely untrue. So we know that Madoff engaged in2 securities fraud.3 The Madoff cases are about the next4 generation, the indirect purchasers, and that is people5 who bought into a fund, and the fund bought into Madoff.6 Now, those cases have been resolved on two separate7 grounds that may not be entirely consistent, neither one8 of which has any implications for our case.9 Theory number one, and this is by ­­ in an10 opinion by Judge Rakoff, just a few weeks ago for the11 Second Circuit. He says, look, the indirect purchaser12 cases are covered by SLUSA because I look at SLUSA, and13 it says, look at the allegation.14 And the core allegation in those cases is of15 covered securities fraud. It is that I was deceived, I16 lost my money, I should say ­­ because Madoff engaged in17 securities fraud. He was selling air. He wasn't18 selling anything at all. That's not this case. SIB19 sold only non­covered securities.20 The second way they have been resolved is21 that you may be said to have ­­ when you bought into22 what are called the "feeder funds," that ­­ that in turn23 invested in Madoff, you may well have purchased an24 interest in the Madoff fund itself. And, therefore, you25 were engaged effectively in the purchase or sale of43      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:I'm just ­­     MR. GOLDSTEIN:     CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:behind you.Yeah.I'm sorry.­­ about 30 seconds￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425covered securities.      That is clearly on the other side of theline from this case.  Nobody contends that we boughtanything other than noncovered assets.  Now, I havetried to get to the ­­ to the hypotheticals that theCourt put to the ­­ my friends in the first half­hour.And realize that these ­­     Nobody contends that you bought anythingother than non­covered assets?MR. GOLDSTEIN: Correct.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought there was an allegation that you were purchasing and selling covered assets. The ones that were misrepresented to be backing CDs.MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, sir. They have not even made that argument. They say that it's enough to trigger SLUSA, that SIB bought something that was said, in some sense ­­ and I have no idea what the rule is, to be for our benefit or to back our CDs, but the only ­­ it is categorically the case that the only purchase or4425 JUSTICE BREYER:I mean, that's exactly￼1 sale by the Plaintiffs ­­2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: By SIB.3 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, yes, sir. Now, this4 is, of course, a significant step further than the line5 that already concerned some members of the Court,6 Justice Scalia, Justice Thomas and the late Chief7 Justice dissented in O'Hagan, and this is a very8 significant move further than even that case because the9 emphasis of the SEC in O'Hagan was that that kind of10 fraud would have a tremendous effect on the market if ­­11 if people didn't ­­ couldn't be confident that the12 other ­­ the person on the other side of the trade had13 material nonpublic information.14 Now, returning to the hypotheticals that the15 Court put to my friends in the first half­hour, realize16 they're not hypotheticals. They are exactly why the SEC17 is in the case. The SEC doesn't administer SLUSA. It18 is concerned that a narrower reading of "in connection19 with" will affect its ability to administer the20 securities laws.21 But you put to the SEC the question, okay,22 name a case that you've brought in the past 80 years23 that you could not bring if the Plaintiffs prevail here.24 Name a case that you, hypothetically, want to bring.45￼1 what I would like you to think about for a second2 because the last words of Ms. Goldenberg of the SEC,3 well, if you win, it's going to seriously hamper the SEC4 in combatting fraud.5 Of course, it wouldn't in a case like this,6 because they aren't limited by covered securities, they7 can deal with any security, and they did bring a case8 here. But they're worried about what you say, that9 somehow this will narrow their authority, and they quote10 Line, which is debatable.11 But assuming that it's debatable, Mr. ­­12 Mr. Clement will have a chance to answer this exact13 question. And so you are saying there are none. And14 Line is debatable. And, therefore, it would not have15 hampered them in any case in the past, nor any one we're16 likely to think of in the future, but for Line, which is17 somebody's decision over at the SEC, and can be argued18 that it fits within your definition.19 Is that really your answer? Or are we going20 to discover Mr. Clement coming up and saying, you forgot21 about da, da, da, da, da?22 MR. GOLDSTEIN: If he does, it'll be the23 first time. They filed three merits briefs, three reply24 briefs, the SEC filed a cert stage amicus brief. It25 filed a merits amicus brief. It has argued orally in46￼1 front of you. And so far, we haven't found a case.2 Now, can you ­­ can I tell you that I can3 imagine a case that, because of my rule, the SEC can't4 bring? I can and I think that they shouldn't be allowed5 to bring it. I'm not saying that our rule has no effect6 on them. I'm saying it does.7 But it's the lending cases, it's the8 prenuptial cases, it's those things that hang over the9 economy like a loaded gun.10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Aren't those rather11 academic because SLUSA wouldn't be a bar to them anyway,12 because then that's class actions?13 MR. GOLDSTEIN: My point ­­ my point,14 Justice Ginsburg, I apologize, is not that those are15 affected by ­­ that those ­­ that rule affects SLUSA.16 It affects the SEC's ability to bring a felony17 prosecution, despite the rule of lenity on the basis18 that that's securities fraud.19 Really understanding the consequence of this20 case, I'll admit to you, that the effect on SLUSA ­­21 this is kind of a one­off case. They haven't identified22 any other cases like this under SLUSA, so they're23 adopting a very broad reading of "in connection" to kind24 of kill a gnat.25 But the reason that they ­­ the SEC wants to4725 MR. GOLDSTEIN:Well, I do think that this￼1 do it is because it wants an extremely broad reading of2 "in connection with the purchase or sale." They want to3 be able to bring a case in which someone is alleged to4 have purchased a non­security, a house, issued a loan,5 on the basis of some statement about the liquidity of6 the fraudster.7 And that is never a case that's ever been8 brought before. And so it's true that we would prevent9 them from doing that, but that's a good thing, not a bad10 thing. They've had 80 years to say that they need that11 authority, and they never have.12 If there is going to be a way in which we13 lose this case, notwithstanding the foregoing, I think14 it's going to be Justice Alito's concern, can you15 articulate a narrower rule in favor of the Petitioners16 that says it was the feature that they were covered17 securities that was essential to the fraud.18 I think we can say, first, that is not in19 the text of the statute, right? That those words don't20 appear.21 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, all that's in the text22 of the statute is "in connection with," which is23 open­ended, so I don't know what you're going to get24 from the text of the statute.48￼1 was not in connection with the purchase or sale. It2 certainly wasn't material to any purchase or sale. But3 the other thing, Justice Alito, is this notion that ­­4 that the feature of them being stocks was essential to5 the fraud would be true in, for example, a loan.6 If I say to you, I want to get a loan for7 $100,000, I promise to buy for myself stocks that I8 could sell to repay the loan, the only thing that was9 critical about them is that they were liquid. And10 remember, that's actually all that SIB said, is that it11 had liquid assets. That's the only feature of it. And12 so if we're going to focus on that ­­13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're not contesting14 at this point ­­ I think both courts below assumed that15 the assets included stocks that would be traded on the16 exchange. You're not making the argument that it's17 not necessarily ­­ that maybe the portfolio included18 nothing that was traded on the exchange?19 MR. GOLDSTEIN: We are not. I will say,20 however, that the other side has a serious problem of21 administrability of an opinion in its favor in the22 following way: Justice Ginsburg, the $7 billion in23 assets that SIB claimed to own clearly included some24 stocks on the NYSE. I think that's perfectly fair.25 The question is how many? Nobody knows the49￼1 answer to that. And if you are going to rule for them,2 the lower courts are going to face cases where a bank3 says, we have liquid assets as well.4 JUSTICE ALITO: Can I just be clear on5 your ­­ your position on the issue of whether there has6 to be 789 therean actual purchase orMR. GOLDSTEIN:JUSTICE ALITO:must be, or, no, it'sMR. GOLDSTEIN:sale?Yes.What is your answer?  Yes,not essential?It is not essential to our1011 position. If you agree ­­ if you agree with the SEC12 that there doesn't have to be a purchase or a sale, we13 still easily win the case. No court has ­­ I believe14 that's only been resolved administratively. And so you15 would have to decide that, in their favor, in order to16 win the case. In order ­­ we are not giving up on the17 question.18 JUSTICE ALITO:19 the case on that basis?20 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No.21 JUSTICE ALITO:22 an opinion that says there has to be a purchase or sale23 and, therefore, affirm.24 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That is not the ground on25 which we have pressed the case in front of you. I'm not50You don't want us to decideYou don't want us to issue￼1 trying to make it more complicated. I'm ­­ it is2 illustrative of all the rules that they need you to3 adopt that no court has ever adopted.4 Remember, on Page 21 of their brief, which5 is what you're being pointed to as their best cases,6 they point to three administrative proceedings, no court7 decision of a district court, court of appeals, or this8 Court, and it's only on the failure to purchase point.9 They have no cases in which the ­­ the core10 features of this case are present, and that is you have11 a fraud that would not have an effect they had12 previously said on the regulated market whatsoever. And13 it's merely the fact that it's for the benefit of14 someone else.15 There ­­ no court has ever adopted it.16 And ­­ and in picking up what this Court said was so17 important in Zandford and O'Hagan is that it has not18 been the SEC's position in the past. I know they have19 said it when they stood up today, but there, the SEC20 assured you, for decades, we have taken this position,21 it's been essential to our enforcement priorities, under22 Section 10b, this case is completely different.23 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if we decided the case24 on that basis, it really would be a one­off. So the25 SEC, today, has told us this would have an effect on the51￼1 securities market.2 But you ­­ we would hold ­­ we won't listen3 to that because, at an earlier point in the case, as4 interpreted by you, they said it wouldn't. So that5 would be ­­ that would be the holding where ­­ you know,6 because the SEC previously said it wouldn't be an effect7 on the securities market, that's the reason for the8 decision.9 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, sir. My point is not10 that when the SEC says it it becomes true. We11 certainly don't agree with that. My point is that they12 haven't articulated ­­ before, they said the opposite,13 and today, they haven't articulated anything that is14 more than the kind of metaphysical go from here to here15 to here.16 And it asks too much when we start from a17 statute that carved these CDs out. Congress said, we18 have this idea of a security, we have this idea from the19 National Securities Markets Improvements Act that the20 States regulate noncovered securities, and so we are21 going to say that the preclusive effect of SLUSA does22 not reach these things like the CDs that we leave to23 regulation by the State.24 So this case clearly falls very easily25 within the ­­ the text of SLUSA as being not precluded.521 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Then you ask, well, am I going to stretch the languageof the statute to say, well, even though these arenoncovered CDs, because securities were involved, Ithink SLUSA should still apply.      In asking whether you should stretch thelanguage, you would say, well, what's the point of thephrase "in connection with"?  Why did Congress give itthat kind of capacious reading, but didn't say fraudabout securities or fraud involving securities?It did say "in connection with." And what your precedents have said over and over and over and what has been the dividing line that has prevented 10b­5 from swallowing all fraud is that these are misrepresentations that affect the regulated market negatively. These ­­ this fraud did not do that.If there are no further questions.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement, you have four minutes.     REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT      ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Your Honor.A couple of points. First of all,this ­­ it is just simply wrong that courts have not decided that a purported sale is covered. The Grippo case from the Eleventh Circuit, which we cite in both53￼￼1 our opening and reply brief, is one of those cases.2 There are others consistent with the SEC's longstanding3 position.4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Zandford is a case like5 that. That ­­ 67 Court89 the circuit courts, which test would you adopt?10 MR. CLEMENT: I don't know that I would11 adopt any of them, Your Honor, because I think a lot of12 them make the same mistake, which is they get13 materiality, and they sneak it into the "in connection14 with" requirements. So ­­15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Except Judge Sutton in16 the Sixth Circuit.17 MR. CLEMENT: Yes, and I think, if you were18 going to accept one test, I would accept ­­ I would ask19 you to have the Siegel test from Judge Sutton, but I do20 think it's a mistake to have materiality or causation21 slip into the "in connection with" requirement.22 I'd like to start with Justice Kennedy's23 very apt observation that this fraud here is very24 similar to the paradigmatic securities fraud where I25 simply ­­ a broker simply says, give me your money, I54MR. CLEMENT: Zandford is a case from this that, essentially, says that as well.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would you ­­ among all￼1 will buy securities, and never does.2 And from the perspective of the defrauded3 party, it doesn't matter whether what they get in4 is a statement that says they own some securities5 statement in a feeder fund that says they have an6 interest in the Madoff fund or whether they get, here, a7 CD that they are told by the ­­ the brochure that tells8 them what this is all about, that it's backed by the9 investments in the securities. They're all one and the10 same.11 Another thing I have to correct is it's12 simply not true that the returns here were not variable13 on the performance of the portfolio. It's not really14 well developed in the record here, but if you want to,15 we could lodge the brochures that are used to market16 these things that tell these guys that their returns are17 variable and that they could lose all of their principal18 because of the investments in covered securities.19 A second thing is, of course, Mr. Goldstein20 correctly says there are particular problems when broker21 dealers lie about covered securities. Well, so, too,22 there are particular problems when an unregistered23 investment company lies about covered securities. And24 that's what their own complaint says was the reality of25 these ­­ of the Stanford Investment Bank, that it was an55return or a￼1 unregistered investment company.2 That's interesting for two reasons. One, if3 it were a registered investment company, all of its4 securities would be covered securities. That's another5 way you can get within the covered security band. So6 this idea that Mr. Goldstein proclaims, this is not a7 covered securities fraud, is simply wrong. It is.8 It was material to this fraud to make9 misrepresentations about purchases of covered10 securities. Without those representations that we're11 going to take their money and we're going to reinvest12 it ­­ again, words from their complaint ­­ in covered13 securities, nobody's going to give their money to a bank14 in Antigua.15 The reason you give your money to a bank in16 Antigua is because you think it's backed by something17 more than a piece of paper, and the something more was18 purchases of covered securities on the market. So ­­19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even if you're right20 about that, Mr. Clement, they also said there was a21 representation that this is insured by Lloyds, and there22 was another claim that they made. So even ­­ even if23 you are right, wouldn't the answer be, okay, drop24 anything that has to do with "in connection with the25 sale or purchase of securities."561 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      We have ­­ oh, we have a claim about theinsurance, and we also have a claim that both Antiguaand United States were heavily regulated.  Those werefalse.      Why couldn't they have a complaint shorn ofthe incorrect premise and based on the insurance and theregulated aspects?MR. CLEMENT: If I can answer? First of all, I think that Mr. Goldstein was quite prudent to not defend the Fifth Circuit's rationale. So the fact that there are other misrepresentations should not mean that a misrepresentation in connection with the purchase or sale of covered securities is somehow okay. SLUSA makes clear that any misrepresentation is enough.      Now, the other thing I would say, verybriefly, is that they may have an opportunity to try toreplead.  That, in a sense, is the next case.  I assureyou that we would be arguing here, where the essence oftheir claim is to hold the Petitioners secondarilyliable for the underlying misrepresentations, they haveto sort of have to take them all, but that's the nextcase.Thank you, Your Honor.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:The case is submitted.57Thank you, counsel.￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425
