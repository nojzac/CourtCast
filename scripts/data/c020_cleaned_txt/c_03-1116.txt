BOLICK:  Justice Stevens, and may it please10111213   rules, not by two.  New York and Michigan consigned out­14 of-state wine, and only out-of-state wine, to the three­15   tier system for closing the market to thousands of small16 family-run wineries and their customers for the benefit of17   a liquor distributor oligopoly.18             Discrimination is the core concern of the19   Commerce Clause, and it sends a powerful signal that the20   state is engaged, not in legitimate regulation, but in21   economic protectionism.  The states and the liquor22 distributors make a sweeping argument that this Court has23 consistently rejected, that the Twenty-First Amendment24   creates plenary state authority.25             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, under your view, could4          For 124 years, as state power over alcohol hasebbed and flowed, one principle has remained virtuallyconstant, that states may regulate alcohol by one set of1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9the three-tier system, itself, be challenged by a NewJersey wholesaler wanting to sell in New York, or a NewYork wholesaler wanting to sell in New Jersey?          MR. BOLICK:  Yes, Justice Kennedy.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So, under your view, the wholethree-tier system has to go down?MR. BOLICK: No, Justice Kennedy. So long as the state does not discriminate against out-of-state entities, it is free to, as this Court -­          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, under my hypothetical.I don't know exactly how -- the way it works, you have tobe a New York wholesaler to sell to a New York retailer.Under your view, a New Jersey wholesaler could sell to aNew York retailer.MR. BOLICK: That is -- or a challenge, as you ask the question, Justice Kennedy, could be mounted to that, under the same theory that we're advocating here. The state may have a different set of defenses that it10111213141516171819   doesn't have here.  But -­202122232425          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But so far as -- the rationaleis the same.          MR. BOLICK:  The -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that, under your rationale, that that in-state licensing system has to fall if there's a New Jersey wholesaler.51111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1             MR. BOLICK:  It has to pass constitutional2   muster.3 4   precedent -- I mean, I think a much more modest claim than 5   you're making, the claim simply that a state cannot6 discriminate against out-of-state liquor -- i.e., the 7   physical liquid -- which is really more modest and keeps 8   the three-tier effect -- now, your -- that claim, that 9   they couldn't do that, was really what was advanced in10   Young's Market.  I read the briefs in that case.  The11   briefs presented that Court -- you could have written12   those briefs.  And the difficulty for you is, it13 articulated that more modest version very clearly, made a14   tremendously strong case, that was not forbidden by15   Section 2 of the Twenty-First Amendment.  And this Court16   squarely rejected it.17             MR. BOLICK:  Your Honor, Young's Market -- the18   result in Young's Market was correct -­19             JUSTICE BREYER:  The result, I understand, you20   could put on the basis of there being no discrimination.21             MR. BOLICK:  Exactly.22             JUSTICE BREYER:  Reading Justice Brandeis'23   opinion, I can't believe that that was the basis for his24   result.25             MR. BOLICK:  The -- the cases that followed61111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE BREYER:  And when you say there is no￼1 Young's Market and purported to apply its reasoning took a2 very sweeping view of the Twenty-First Amendment. The3 Court began trenching on that very broad view immediately4 in 1939. 5             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But why wasn't that broad 6   view appropriate, given the difference between the 7   language of the Wilson Act, which has had the words "to 8   the same extent and in the same manner," and the Webb­9 Kenyon Act, which became the second section of the Twenty­10   First Amendment, leaves out "to the same extent and the11   same manner."  It just says that "alcoholic beverage so12   that the state can bar importation for delivery of, or use13   therein, in violation of laws thereof."  It doesn't say14151617   of the Wilson Act.  The Wilson Act dealt with the question18   of discrimination.  The Webb-Kenyon Act dealt with"nondiscriminatory laws."          MR. BOLICK:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, the -- therewas no need for the Webb-Kenyon Act to repeat the language19   questions that arose subsequent to the enactment of the20   Wilson Act.  And as this Court has held in Craig versus -­21222324   manner"?25             MR. BOLICK:  I think the reason for that is7          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, maybe that's the Act,but when they put it in the Constitution, why didn't theyadopt the language, "to the same extent and in the same1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   because it was so obvious that the state could not, prior2 to prohibition, discriminate. It was not only embodied in 3   the Wilson Act, but it was embodied in at least three 4   cases of this Court. 5             JUSTICE SOUTER:  But it was not obvious to the 6   person who at least drafted the Webb-Kenyon in the first 7   instance, because as I -- as I understand it, there was an8 anti-discrimination provision, and that was then dropped. 9   And do we know why it was dropped?10             MR. BOLICK:  It was dropped essentially because11   it was redundant.12             JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, but is that a -- is that13   on a legislative history record somewhere?  Do we know14   that?15             MR. BOLICK:  No, Justice Souter, that is not16   expressly on the record.  What is on the record, however,17   is that the Court was aiming -- or, excuse me, the18 Congress was aiming at specific Supreme Court decisions.19 There -- and it -- and the one case that was clearest on20 point on discrimination was Scott versus Donald, applying21   both the Commerce Clause and the Wilson Act to forbid22 discrimination. And there was -- there is nothing in the 23 legislative history to indicate that Congress intended to 24 overturn that decision. And as this Court has held in25 Craig versus Boren, and elsewhere, by enacting the Twenty­81111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 First Amendment, Congress clearly intended to incorporate 2   both the Wilson Act and the Webb-Kenyon Act and to restore 3   to the states the police power that they had before4 prohibition. Emphatically, discrimination was not a part 5   of that police power.  It was a very accepted context. 6             So, too, is it today.  When the -- when the 7   liquor distributors in the states asked this Court to8 overturn the Bacchus decision and to adopt a plenary view 9   of the Twenty-First Amendment, it is not just asking you10   to overturn the Bacchus decision; it is asking you to11 overturn cases starting with the Midcal decision in 1980,12 the more recent Healy decision, and others, that have held13   that the core purposes of the Commerce Clause and the14   Twenty-First Amendment must be harmonized, that the15   Commerce Clause was never intended to be obliterated.16             And when you look at the core values of the two17   clauses, they do not clash.  The core purpose of the18 Commerce Clause is nondiscrimination. The core purpose of19 the Twenty-First Amendment is temperance. And if you have20   a discriminatory statute, it sends a very strong signal21   that, in fact -­22             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it's not only23   temperance, but it's control over revenues.24             Can you tell me, is the -- is there a New York25   State excise tax on alcohol?91111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1             MR. BOLICK:  Yes, Your Honor. 2             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And is it collected by the 3   wholesaler? 4             MR. BOLICK:  Yes, it is. 5             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All right.  What is it, ten 6   dollars a gallon, or what? 7             MR. BOLICK:  It's -- it turns out to -­ 8             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is it on one -­ 9             MR. BOLICK:  -- a few cents a bottle, yes.10             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It is on one -­11             MR. BOLICK:  It's on -- it's -- and all alcohol.12             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Under our cases, can the13   California winery be required to remit the tax to the New14   York State revenue authorities?15             MR. BOLICK:  We believe so, Your Honor.16             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is that consistent with Quill?17             MR. BOLICK:  It is consistent with Quill.  The18   way that the states -- there are 26 states that allow19   direct interstate shipment of wine, and the FTC has20 examined their record to see if they are doing okay. And 21 one of the things that they do -- are able to do is tax 22 collection. New Hampshire, Louisiana, and Nevada do23 collect taxes. The way they do it is by requiring a24 permit in order to ship wine into the state. That takes 25 care of a number of problems, including all sorts of101111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9accountability concerns that the state may raise.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  What -­          MR. BOLICK:  Under -­JUSTICE SOUTER: -- what do you make of the argument that there's no practical way, except at great expense, to audit compliance if they're out of state?MR. BOLICK: Justice Souter, this is one of the most regulated industries in America, of course, and the model legislation that has been adopted by a number of states includes record-keeping provisions, it requires that wineries -­          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, I will grant that'srequired, but the argument, as I understand it, is, tofind out whether they're doing what they are required todo, you've got to drop in unexpectedly and make an audit.And that's one thing in the state; it's another thingacross the country.MR. BOLICK: No, it's important to recognize, Justice Souter, that under the three-tier system, which is -- which is where the states of New York and Michigan are saying that the other state wineries have to go -- the10111213141516171819202122   three-tier system does not do that.  The states already23 24 25rely on the Federal Government and the other states topolice the wineries.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  So you're -­111111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. BOLICK:  Should they -­          JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- saying they are not droppingin to local wineries to do audits, in fact?          MR. BOLICK:  They may, in some instances.  It isprimarily a federal -- a federal activity.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  What do we have in the recordon that?          MR. BOLICK:  There is not -- there is not agreat deal on the record, either way, on that, Your Honor.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know what you mean by"it's primarily a federal activity," that the FederalGovernment polices compliance with the state tax laws?1011121314151617181920212223   paid?24             MR.

BOLICK: -- under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act, any violation of a state law is a federal offense and it is a violation -- so basically, whether it's under-age access, whether it's taxation, whatever -­          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But does the federal authoritymake a routine audit to see that the state tax has been1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 2000512￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011   question.  We are here today because a majority of states12 have chosen to regulate wine distinctively. And a handful13   of them, including Michigan and New York, have chosen to14   do so in a discriminatory manner.  So long as states do1516171819202122232425not discriminate, in terms of direct shipping with regard to other alcohol -- and they don't; there's a flat prohibition across the United States, in terms of beer and other types of spirits -- we will not be here, because there would be no discrimination; there would be a single rule, and that rule would be, no one gets to do it.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Thank you.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Ms. Sullivan?            ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN SULLIVAN     ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS IN 03-1116 AND 03-1120          MS.

What aboutalcoholic beverages other than wine?1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005MR. BOLICK:  Justice Ginsburg, very important￼ 1   please the Court: 2             Nothing in today's case, Justice Kennedy, 3   requires you to take on the three-tier system, for the 4   issue that is presented here is a very narrow one. 5             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it's very narrow, but 6   the rationale is sweeping, and that's why I asked.  I just7 don't know if the in-state licensure system, which is the8 cornerstone of the three-tier distribution system, can9 survive under your rationale, assuming the hypothetical10   where a New Jersey wholesaler has all of the -- you know,11   the physical facilities and so forth that the New York12   wholesaler does.13             MS. SULLIVAN:  All that we ask in this case,14   Justice Kennedy, is that you strike down Michigan and New15 York's decision to apply the three-tier system to everyone16   except their own in-state -­17             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I know, but what -­18             MS. SULLIVAN:  -- producers of wine -­19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- but you're -- all you're20   asking is for a rationale that's sweeping.21             MS. SULLIVAN:  Justice Kennedy, in our case, we22 want to suggest that it is -- just as in Healy and Bacchus23   -- that a law that discriminates in favor of in-state24 producers and against out-of-state producers loses its25   immunity afforded by the Twenty-First Amendment.  As141111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1   Justice Scalia said in concurrence in Healy, a liquor2 law's discriminatory character eliminates the immunity3   afforded by the Twenty-First Amendment.4             It's really the state's position, aided by their5   wholesaler allies, that it is the sweeping one.  Their6   position is that every state law that regulates the7   importation of liquor is, per se, valid if it has any8 conceivable rational connection to a state purpose. So,9   for example, if Michigan wanted to simply bar all10 California wines, facially exclude California wines,11   saying, "There are too many of them, it interferes with" ­12 ­13141516171819 Ginsburg. As you've said in the context of gender20 discrimination, you can cure an equal-protection problem 21 by leveling up or leveling down. In this case, we would22   suggest that the principle of free trade that was the23   reason, the principal reason, for the framing of the24   Constitution and has been reflected in over a century of25 dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence, suggests that youJUSTICE GINSBURG: Your answer to Justice Kennedy, I glean from what you said, that if New York took away the direct-sale privilege that in-state wineries get, then out-of-state wineries wouldn't be any better off, but they'd have nothing to complain about.          MS. SULLIVAN:  That's exactly correct, Justice1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 2000515￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9should -- the remedy should be to open the markets to out­of-state producers -­          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that's a decision for thestate to make.  I mean, the -- what -­          MS. SULLIVAN:  Correct, Your Honor.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Not for this Court.          MS. SULLIVAN:  That's correct, Your Honor.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  You don't deny that a state -­that Michigan could bar all out-of-state wine -- not just -- not just California, but they could bar all out-of- state wines?101112131415   purposes.16MS.

SULLIVAN:  Justice Stevens, a state may notdiscriminate against out-of-staters for the sole purpose of economic protectionism.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I'm trying to think ofwhat Brandeis could have been thinking.          MS. SULLIVAN:  In Young's Market.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, that's right.  And this isa reconstruction, because I have no doubt, and you have nodoubt, that Section 2 was meant to end that part of thedormant Commerce Clause that would come under the name oforiginal package doctrine -­1011121314151617   Now, he's thinking, "Why is that?  What is that package18 doctrine?" And the answer is, the dormant Commerce Clause19   -- it's part of the dormant Commerce Clause -- the dormant20 Commerce Clause is the implication from the existence of21   the commerce power in the Constitution.  So if we have an22 amendment that says "that aspect of the dormant Commerce23 Clause doesn't apply," that means the dormant CommerceMS. SULLIVAN:  Correct.          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- which meant that the foreignliquor has to be treated better than domestic liquor.24 Clause doesn't apply, because you can't divide the dormant25   Commerce Clause into six different parts, or even two.171111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MS.

SULLIVAN:  But -­          JUSTICE BREYER:  And if he is, and even if heisn't, why isn't that right?MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Breyer, the Young's Market language permitting state discrimination is, indeed, broad, but it's been superceded by 40 years of this Court's jurisprudence harmonizing the Twenty-First Amendment with the rest of the Constitution. Remember, Justice Brandeis, in Young's Market, didn't even think the Equal Protection Clause applied to liquor imports, a position that's inconsistent with Craig against Boren. And nobody would suggest today that equal protection permits a state to import only from male-owned wineries or only import wine from white-owned wineries.          So there -- the 40 years of jurisprudence -­          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But Craig against Boren was -­          MS. SULLIVAN:  -- has been -­          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- had nothing to do with theCommerce Clause.          MS. SULLIVAN:  Correct, Your Honor, but if -- ifthere were a law -- the states are claiming that any lawgoverning -­181111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1             JUSTICE STEVENS:  Nothing to do with 2   importation, either. 3             MS. SULLIVAN:  But the dormant Commerce Clause4 reflects a fundamental structural principle that is every 5   bit as much a part of the Constitution as the Equal6 Protection Clause upheld in Craig v. Boren. Indeed this7 Court, in cases from McCulloch to the Eleventh Amendment8 cases and state sovereignty cases, has recognized that a 9   principle of the Constitution is no less fundamental10   because it is a structural implication of the text.  Sothe dormant Commerce Clause stands on the same footing asthe affirmative power of Congress and on -- it's the samefooting as the Equal Protection Clause at issue -­1112131415161718192021222324 insurance. It has not done so here. Webb-Kenyon did not 25 authorize discrimination, and the Wilson Act forbade19JUSTICE STEVENS:  Do you think Congress -­MS. SULLIVAN:  -- in Craig v. Boren -­JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- could enact a statuteauthorizing the states to do just what they've done here?          MS. SULLIVAN:  Absolutely, but it has not.  Andthe Wilson Act -- to go back to Justice Souter's questionand Justice Ginsburg's question -- Congress could authorize it as it has done, for example, in the McCarran­ Ferguson Act, allowing the states to discriminate against out-of-state industry with respect to the industry of1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 discrimination for just -- reasons Justice Ginsburg 2   described.  It said you may regulate imports of liquor in 3   the same manner as local liquor laws.  And, of course, the 4   purpose of Section 2 was to allow to the dry states to5 keep dry by preventing all those original packages from 6   piling up in the railway stations and being open to7 bootleggers throughout the state, undermining the dry8 policies of the state. Wilson forbade discrimination. 9   Web Kenyan didn't authorize it.10             And in Congress' most recent articulation of its11 view of the harmony between the Twenty-First Amendment and12 the rest of the Constitution, the Twenty-First Amendment13 Enforcement Act, passed in 2000, enacted in 2000, Congress14 has a rules-of-construction section that says, "We view15   any state plea to the federal courts to enforce their laws16   as reflecting the jurisprudence of this court."  And, in17 fact, floor debate on that rules-of-construction section18 reflected allusions to Bacchus, Healy, and the other cases19 that said dormant commerce -- the negative implications of20   the Commerce Clause, no less than the Equal Protection21   Clause or the Due Process Clause or the Establishment22   Clause, constrain the states in their regulation of23   importation of liquor.24             So with all respect to Justice Brandeis, Justice25 Breyer, the Young's Market statements about discrimination201111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   have been superceded. 2             What New York and Michigan have done here is say 3   that one set of exceptions apply only to in-state4 producers, just as Connecticut, in Healy, said, "If you 5   just sell beer within our state, you don't have to face 6   price ceilings that you have to face if you do business 7   over in Massachusetts or Rhode Island."  Just as in 8   Bacchus, the -- you struck down a decision -- an excise9 tax exemption that said, "If you're an importer of liquor,10   you have to pay an excise tax, but if you're a local11 producer of locally produced wine and spirits, you get out12   of that restriction."13             JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay, we've got one difference14   from Bacchus, because the claim that's being made here,15   which I gather was not made, or made seriously, in16   Bacchus, is there really is a need for differential17   treatment for purposes of enforcement.  Go back to the1819202122232425enforcement of the tax law.          MS. SULLIVAN:  Justice -­          JUSTICE SOUTER:  How are we supposed -- whatstandard are we supposed to use to judge that argument?And, by that standard, how good is the argument?          MS. SULLIVAN:  Justice Souter, we believe thestandard should be strict scrutiny, though there must be anecessity to serve -­211111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1             JUSTICE SOUTER:  Because -­ 2             MS. SULLIVAN:  -- a legitimate -­ 3             JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- it's facial discrimination. 4             MS. SULLIVAN:  Because it's facial 5   discrimination.  It's absolutely undisputed.  Michigan -­ 6   in fact, Michigan state concedes that they have flatly 7   banned out-of-state wineries from shipping directly to 8   consumers.  There's no question that this is facially 9   discriminatory.  But even if the standard were a more10   deferential one in which all the state needed to show was11   a reasonable need for discrimination, it can't come close12   to doing that here.  Neither Michigan nor New York has13   shown that the facial discrimination here is necessary to14   protect minors or to protect the collection of taxes.15             Let's start with minors.  The Michigan claim16   that it's protecting against under-18 sales is belied by17   the fact that Michigan is allowing 40 Michigan wineries18   and, at last count, 7500 Michigan retailers to deliver19   directly to consumers.  The way to protect my -- so just20   as in Craig v. Boren, the exception for young women to21   drink 3.2 beer, as opposed to young men, belied the22   state's interest in temperance.  So the pattern of23   exceptions here that Michigan has created belies any24   notion that it's protecting under-18-year-olds from25   drinking.  And, of course -­221111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1             JUSTICE SOUTER:  But what about audits for2 revenue -­ 3             MS. SULLIVAN:  On revenue, the nondiscriminatory4 means that's available to the state that Michigan and New 5   York have not shown any reason to reject -- 26 states have 6   adopted some version of this -- is to require an out-of- 7   state winery to get a permit.  And that's a -- Justice 8   Breyer, one thing that's still left of Brandeis.  You can9 require a permit from an out-of-state winery, which would10   be unusual to acquire from widgets or milk.  But you can11   require a permit, and, as a condition of the permit,12   Justice Souter.  The out-of-state winery has to agree to13   submit to the state's jurisdiction, to submit to the14   state's tax jurisdiction.15             And, Justice Kennedy, whether or not Quill would16   permit taxation if you were simply sending by common17   carrier, our clients want to -- want to pay taxes, want to18   sign up for permits, want to play on a -­19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well -­20             MS.

It was just -- the question19   Justice Stevens asked.  It's your position that if20   Michigan allows Michigan wines to be sold and possessed21 and consumed, that it must also allow out-of-state wine to22   be sold, possessed, and consumed.  Would -­23             MS. SULLIVAN:  That's correct.24             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That is your -­25             MS.

The record 5   is clear on that.  What Michigan does is require that 6   wineries in Michigan send samples and records to their 7   offices.  And the Internet actually, if anything -- the8 states say that the Internet increases the danger, but the 9   Internet also increases, in parallel, the power of the10 states to police out-of-state wineries without an in-state11 presence. Just as, Justice Stevens, the Internet may make12   every speaker with a PC a town crier, as you said -­1314151617   --18JUSTICE SOUTER:  Could -­MS.

SULLIVAN:  Yes, Justice Souter, if it were23 part of a -- an agreement to a permit that the -- that the24   out-of-state winery is willing to make, then there's no25 extraterritorial regulation there, that would be just251111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   fine.  So, yes, the state can, through Internet, so to2 speak, -- Internet monitoring, through virtual monitoring3 -- do all the work it needs to do to make sure that the 4   out-of-state winery is paying taxes. 5             And, by the way, Michigan does not collect6 taxes, Justice Kennedy, through the distributors.7 Michigan collects taxes from the wineries, whether they're8 in-state or whether they're out-of-state wine shippers.9 So Michigan can give no justification for why out-of-state10   wineries have to go through the distributors for tax11   purposes.  They're not using the distributors as their12   tax-collection agents now.13             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Commerce Clause, in effect,14 protects consumers in states from entrenched business15 interests that want to have protectionism, and you're -­16   you object to that and invoke the Commerce Clause to do17   it.  Under that rationale, aren't all the California18   reciprocity laws invalid, as well?19             MS. SULLIVAN:  Justice Kennedy, reciprocity laws20   -- yet -- possibly.  They may be a necessary requirement21   now that so many states are closed to states.  They may be22   a necessary mechanism for some states trying to get wines23   to market in the way that the framers envisaged.  It may24   be a necessary, for now, to get into closed states.  In a25   world that we hope that you create, in which261111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 discrimination is not allowed, they would be completely 2   unnecessary and possibly unconstitutional. 3             But to return to the key point here, Michigan 4   and New York may not facially discriminate in favor of5 their own producers unless they can show that reasonable6 nondiscriminatory alternatives are unavailable. And here,7 Justice Souter, on any standard of heightened scrutiny, 8   they have not come close to making that kind of showing, 9   because there are all these other means -- means that have10 been recognized by the 26 states that don't discriminate,11   means that have been proven in states from New Hampshire12   to Virginia, means that are not based on facial13 discrimination. It's the discrimination that has to be14 shown to -­15             JUSTICE STEVENS:  Let me just -­16             MS. SULLIVAN:  -- be necessary here.17             JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- be sure I heard your answer18   to Justice Kennedy correctly.  You'd concede that the19   reciprocity laws are all unconstitutional?20             MS. SULLIVAN:  Not -- they are subject to21 heightened scrutiny because they discriminate against out­22   of-staters in a way that you could not -- for example, in23   New Energy, you said that you can't have a preference for24   -- you can't have a discrimination in Ohio in reciprocity25   for Indiana.

CASEY     ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 03-1116 and 03-1120          Mr. Casey:  Justice Stevens, and may it pleasethe Court:For more than 70 years, the Twenty-First Amendment has permitted states to restrict the importation and delivery of alcohol by out-of-state vendors. There are substantial differences between licensed in-state vendors of alcohol and out-of-state vendors that are not subject to the full extent of state regulatory and taxing powers. Because of those differences, Michigan requires that sales, including direct shipment of alcohol, be performed only by licensed, strictly regulated, in-state vendors. This importation regulation is a power expressly conferred by the text of the Twenty-First Amendment. It's consistent with the entire history of alcohol regulation in this country, and it's consistent with this Court's jurisprudence interpreting the Twenty-First Amendment -­291111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   commerce. 9             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but I think what's10 fairly implied in Justice O'Connor's question, you have to11   look at the language of Bacchus, and the language of12 Bacchus, in effect, restored the anti-discrimination13   component of the Commerce Clause to liquor control.  I14   think that's a fair and necessary reading of the case.15 Now -­          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Now the Bacchus case cutsagainst you, to some extent.          MR. CASEY:  The Bacchus case was a very uniquesituation that we believe is not in any way controlling inthe present case.  It was not an importation case; it wasan exemption from a state excise tax on wholesalers foralcohol that was already within the state's stream of1617   reading -­18192021   all that.

But to focus on9 Bacchus for a moment, the state never asserted the Twenty­10   First amendment, and it was undisputed -­11             JUSTICE STEVENS:  No, but the question was12 before the Court, because the dissent certainly raised the13 question.14151617 was incorrectly decided.

He said, "Hawaii's discriminatory tax 9   cannot stand."  And then he said, "Whatever you can say10 about the Twenty-First Amendment, one thing is certain,11   the central purpose was not to empower the states to favor12   local liquor industries by erecting barriers to13   competition."  That was this Court's explanation for14151617   Court's analysis.

Whether you do or not, I guess20   I'll find out from reading the record, but I'm more21   interested in the first half, which is -- doesn't apply at22   all.23             Now, your opponent said, in response to my24   pointing to Brandeis on this, that to support you, as to25   precedent, Bacchus.  Young's Market isn't any good381111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   anymore.  As to concept, you can divide the dormant 2   Commerce Clause into a -- you have to favor out-of-state3 principle, which was the original package doctrine, which4 has long since disappeared, and the anti-discrimination5 principle, which hasn't disappeared. And her third part,6 implicit, is, historically, this whole Section 2 was aimed 7   at the original package part; there is not a word in any 8   brief I saw that suggests any motive in Section 2 to get9 rid of the anti-discrimination principle. I haven't found10 a word in support on your side on that. So she says, "Put11   those three things together, and we win."  That's her12   point.  Now, what's your response?13             MR.

That's precisely what 4   situation was with -­ 5             JUSTICE BREYER:  I know you do, but the 6   principle of Webb-Kenyon, which was enacted when the 7   Wilson Act was already there -- very clear -- is to stop8 the original package doctrine, stop favoritism of the out­9 of-state liquor shipment, which meant, in a dry state, you10   had to sell less.  I mean, that's what it's there for.  I11   didn't find a word, in other words, contrary to what I've12 just said; and if there are such words, now is the time to13   point them to me -- to point them out.14             MR. CASEY:  The title of the Webb-Kenyon Act is,15   "It is in -- an act divesting intoxicating liquors of16 their interstate character in certain cases. The clear17   intent of the Webb-Kenyon Act was to remove alcohol from18 the Commerce Clause. The Constitution -- the Twenty-First19 Amendment constitutionalized that Commerce Clause20   framework."  That's what this Court said in Craig v.21   Boren.  Craig v. Boren also said, "The Twenty-First22   Amendment creates an exception to the operation of -- the23   normal operation of the dormant Commerce Clause."24             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, then you are asking us,25   I guess, not only to reject Bacchus, but who was the first401111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1234567   beverages.8one that said that the Commerce Clause remains alive andwell?

The Commerce Clauseremains alive and well, but the Commerce Clause -­               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In the context of alcoholic10   that's an exception to the operation -- the normal11 operation of the dormant Commerce Clause.

CASEY: When you read the two in light of21   each other, the purposes of each, it is clear that the22   purpose of the Twenty-First Amendment was to remove23 alcohol from interstate commerce as a constitutional24   matter, to prevent Congress from tampering with it in the25   future, to give the judgement to the states as to -­41MR.

HALLIGAN:  Justice Stevens, and may itplease the Court:In answer to your question first, Justice Breyer, the Twenty-First Amendment does not propose a nondiscriminatory ban. The Court rejected that position, not just in Young's Market and Mahoney in Indianapolis, but also in Clark Distilling, the case in which the Court upheld the constitutionality of the Webb-Kenyon Act,1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9were necessary to protect the integrity -­          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you -- do you take theposition that your colleague on your same side takes, that a state can permit only the sale, consumption, and -- of its own wines, and bar all out-of-state wines?MS. HALLIGAN: The express terms of the Twenty­ First Amendment would allow that if -- particularly if it were necessary to advance the concerns of the Twenty-First Amendment. For example -­JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, no, don't -­JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No -­JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- don't put in the10111213   qualifications.14             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- just for local15   protectionism.16             MS.

HALLIGAN:  That's a difficult question,11 because -­12             JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.  All right.  But I need13   an answer to it.14             [Laughter.]15             JUSTICE BREYER:  Because, you see, what's going16 to come next is, if you say yes, I'm going to say, "Well,17   didn't it pass that law with the Wilson Act?"18             MS. HALLIGAN:  Let me answer both of those19   questions, if I can, Your Honor.   Certainly, this Court20 has held, repeatedly, that the Twenty-First Amendment did21 not, in any substantial way, completely repeal Congress'22 affirmative power under the Commerce Clause. It said that23   in Midcal and Capital Cities.  But we would argue that if24   Congress acted in a way which completely removed state25   authority to determine whether or not alcohol could be451111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   sold and the terms under which it could be sold -- for 2   example, if Congress said all states must be dry -- then3 we would argue that the Twenty-First Amendment wouldn't4 allow that, because that would completely eviscerate any 5   state authority. 6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  How can that be?  I mean, if 7   this is a constitutional elimination of the Commerce 8   Clause, how can Congress bring it back in simply by 9   enacting a statute?10             MS. HALLIGAN:  The legislative history makes11   clear that the Twenty-First Amendment was intended to12 eliminate the impediments posed by the dormant Commerce13   Clause and authorize states to regulate it.14 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you -- you want us to read15   it by its terms.  It doesn't say anything about the16   dormant Commerce Clause.  If we read it absolutely the way17   one of your arguments wants us to do, surely it excludes18   Congress.19             MS. HALLIGAN:  By terms of our -­20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you don't want us to read it21 absolutely.22 MS. HALLIGAN: Your Honor, I don't think that -­ 23 again, I don't think that you need to decide those24 questions in this case. This case goes to what's at the 25 very core of the Twenty-First Amendment, whether states461111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   can decide who can sell liquor to their citizens and 2   whether or not states -­ 3             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it also goes to the very 4   core of the Commerce Clause.  And there are really two5 classifications of dormant Commerce Clause cases. One is 6   -- and I think it's an improper use of the term "dormant 7   clause" -- is where there's discrimination.  Only the8 Congress can allow discrimination against out-of-state9 products. That's one whole classification. And that's10   what's -- and that's what's involved here.11             MS. HALLIGAN:  North Dakota indicates otherwise,12   I believe, Your Honor.  In North Dakota, this Court said13   that, because, when alcohol flows across the border, it14 poses unique risks to the regulatory regime, because the15   state can't bring the alcohol within the full extent of16   its regulatory and supervisory powers, that it may be17   appropriate and necessary for states to impose unique18 rules on out-of-state vendors. In North Dakota, the Court19   did not say -­20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but that's fine.  And the21   other side isn't denying that here, that if, you know,22 they're -- discrimination means treating out-of-state23   people differently without good reason.24             MS. HALLIGAN:  But there is good reason -­25             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Now, if you're willing to -­471111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 okay, if you're willing to acknowledge that, then we're2 halfway there and we're just arguing about whether there 3   is good reason here or not. 4             MS. HALLIGAN:  There is good reason here, Your 5   Honor.  What's critical about New York's law, as well as 6   Michigan's law, is that it requires that any alcohol 7   vendor have a physical presence in the state.  And that's 8   important for a couple of reasons.  The state can't9 meaningfully oversee traffic in alcohol with an out-of-10   state entity.  Petitioner suggested -­11             JUSTICE SOUTER:  What is it doing with the in­12   state entities?  I mean, one of the claims is that nobody13   is posting officers outside the in-state wineries, no14 one's making substantial physical audits of in-state15   wineries.  Is that wrong?16             MS. HALLIGAN:  It is wrong, Your Honor.  It's17   certainly not the case that we have an SLA inspector18   outside every entity that sells liquor.  That would not be19   possible.  But it is true that the state liquor authority20   can, and does, physically inspect the premises.  They do21 22 23 24 25so to determine whether -­          JUSTICE SOUTER:  What do they inspect them for?Their books, I suppose.          MS. HALLIGAN:  Well, more than that, and this iswhy the physical presence is important and why the481111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 Internet hypothetical that Your Honor raised would not -­ 2   would not satisfy the state's concerns.  What the state 3   can do is, it can go onto a premises, and it can count4 whether the bottles on the shelves of that premises match 5   the records.  That's the best way to detect whether or not 6   there is evasion.  Because if you have -­ 7             JUSTICE SOUTER:  And is there a record that the 8   state is doing that? 9             MS. HALLIGAN:  There is not clear evidence in10   the record with respect to that -- to that level of11   detail, but that -­12             JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, isn't that the end of13   that issue, then?  I mean, it is your burden, isn't it?14             MS. HALLIGAN:  Your Honor, there is material in15   the McKeon affidavit, which is in the Joint Appendix -­16   Mr. McKeon is the Chair of the state liquor authority -­17   but it's also the case that to suggest that because there18   is some option out there -- and there's no firm evidence19   that a less prescriptive rule would, in fact, satisfy the20 state's concerns in preventing diversion and tax evasion ­21 -- but the possibility that's there's some rule out there,22   because other states have adopted more lax rules, is to23   treat alcohol like any other product.  And the Twenty­24 First Amendment reflects a consensus by this nation that25   alcohol is unique, that it should not be open to -­491111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011   of local law enforcement.  And this is also -­JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the Twenty-First Amendment at least recognizes that alcohol can be treated as unique, and the issue here is whether you're really doing that in a way that supports your claim of interest.          MS. HALLIGAN:  Yes -­          JUSTICE SOUTER:  And, so far, the one specificthing I've heard from you is that state inspectors do goon winery premises, and they count bottles, and they seeif they match what's on the written record.MS. HALLIGAN:  They also draw on the assistance1213141516171819202122   group of them could open an office.  Now, that office,23 24 25owned by a group of out-of-state vintners is not going tohave bottles on the shelf, is it?          MS. HALLIGAN:  Yes, Your Honor, it would.50JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But if that's -­MS. HALLIGAN:  -- set forth -­JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- if that's really what NewYork's concern is, then why does New York say, "Ah, but out-of-staters, if only you establish an office here -­ not a winery; an office -- you can operate, and you can make the direct sales from that office, and even in" -- I think your brief told us that, well, these small wineries, out-of-state wineries, haven't got all that much to worry about, because, after all, they could join together -- a1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9That's -- the state laws requires that any licensed winery have a government-bonded storehouse or ware-room -­ storehouse -- storeroom or warehouse, pardon me --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, isn't the -­          MS. HALLIGAN:  The reason for that is becausephysical products -­JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you envision this combination of small wineries? You said that in-state establishments might be jointly maintained by out-of-state10 wineries.11             MS. HALLIGAN:  Yes, Your Honor.  The state12 liquor authority has not issued any regulations on this,13   but presumably what they would say is, you could share a14 space, provided that the physical property of each winery,15   the bottles, is segregated so that the states can come in16   and check whether or not each winery's products conform17   with their records.18             There are other reasons why a physical presence19   is important, as well.  First of all, the state draws on20 local law enforcement extensively to identify illegal21 activities, and that would not be possible with any entity22   located out-of-state.  Additionally -­23             JUSTICE SOUTER:  What illegal -- I'm sorry -­24   you've got to be specific.

HALLIGAN:  It could be selling to minors,but it could also simply be sale out of an unlicensedpremises, where you are selling outside the proper hoursof sale, or sale outside of the three-tier system -­          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yeah, but if licensed premisesdon't serve a state interest, then you can't require alicensed premises, so that argument doesn't get too far.          MS.

Justice Scalia was assuming that, if you have the10   license and some in-state warehouse, you can ship from11   outside.  And I -- is that the assumption?  Or is your12131415161718192021222324   assume that.

HALLIGAN:  -- that people won't -­          JUSTICE SCALIA:  It doesn't -- it doesn't enableyou to enforce your law any more rigorously than withouthaving a requirement for a local office.MS. HALLIGAN:  That, I would respectfully          JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- if they break the law, youcan shut down the warehouse; whereas, you can'teffectively do that if the warehouse is in California.Isn't that your point?MS. HALLIGAN: That's one of the points, but also that we're much more likely to be able to identify the illegal activities in the first place. The suggestion that we would send inspectors to California or any other place to look at books and count bottles is completely infeasible. And the Twenty-First Amendment was intended541111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼to allow states to deal with the regulatory challenges that are posed when liquor comes across the border. If we had to demonstrate that there was a hundred-percent compliance, then we couldn't have any regulation at all. That's not, I would submit, a -­          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, to what -­          MS. HALLIGAN:  -- reasonable measure.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- to what extent does New1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91213141516171819   Honor.  What we are suggesting is that relying on other20   states to enforce law violations in New York State is not21 a very feasible alternative. Additionally, there are 3322   states that have agreed with New York, a number of whom23 are states that have either reciprocal or unrestricted24   shipping statutes, and said to this Court, "Please do not25   prohibit the kinds of laws that are at issue in New York55York take account of, say, the rigorous regulation in the 10 states from which this wine is coming? You say we must do 11 this to police for all kinds of things. But don't otherstates -- California, Virginia -- don't they have lawsthat their local wineries must meet?MS. HALLIGAN:  They -­MS. HALLIGAN:  We're not suggesting that, Your          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And is New York just saying,"We're going to treat this thing as though it's totallyunregulated, anyway"?1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9111213141516171819202122232425and Michigan."  So it's obviously important to theregulators in those states, as well.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  What about the states that do aallow shipment from out of state?  They don't care abouttheir --          MS. HALLIGAN:  I can't -­          JUSTICE SCALIA:  How many are there that allowshipment from out-of-state wineries?               MS. HALLIGAN:  I believe that the current number10   is 26 states.  I certainly can't speak to the regulatorymotivations of each of those states, or the reasons whythose laws might have been passed.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  It certainly suggests that what-- that what you're arguing is not essential to thestate's enforcement of its alcohol laws.          MS. HALLIGAN:  Well, a number of those stateshave, in fact, joined New York and Michigan in asking theCourt not to -­          JUSTICE SCALIA:  States don't like federalregulation -­know that.MS. HALLIGAN:  -- restrict that.JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- of any sort, of course.  I[Laughter.]MS. HALLIGAN:  Your Honor, I think that all the561111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 Twenty-First Amendment requires the states to demonstrate 2   is that the regulatory regime that they have chosen has 3   some relationship to their goals of protecting the4 integrity of the state's system. And that's certainly 5   what the Court suggested in North Dakota. 6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I'm not sure.  When you7 have facial discrimination against out-of-state products, 8   I think you're -- the bar is a little higher than that. 9             MS. HALLIGAN:  Well, that was the case in North10   Dakota, as well.  In North Dakota, the state imposed11 regulations on out-of-state vendors that were extremely12 onerous, so onerous that some vendors said they wouldn't13 ship products at all. That was alcohol that was not even 14 destined for consumption within the state; but on a15 federal enclave. And the mere risk of diversion into16 unregulated and unlawful channels was enough to allow the 17 state to impose those discriminatory rules. The same is18192021   that.22             Bacchus is distinguishable in several ways.23   First of all, Bacchus was a tax.  And while we would argue24   that taxes could be used to further states' interest in25 suppressing consumption, for example, it is certainly not57true here.          Justice O'Connor, you also asked about Bacchus,as well, and I would like to take a moment to address1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   at the heart of the -- of the Twenty-First Amendment in 2   the way that the direct regulation of alcohol across the3 border is. 4             JUSTICE STEVENS:  No, but if you can't grant a 5   tax exemption -- and it seems to me, a fortiori -- you 6   can't grant a prohibition about importing at all. 7             MS. HALLIGAN:  I, respectfully, would disagree 8   with that, Your Honor.  If you can't address the alcohol9 that flows across the border, which was precisely why the10   Twenty-First Amendment was enacted, as well as Webb­11   Kenyon, because the -­12             JUSTICE STEVENS:  No, I'm suggesting a tax on13 imports is less restrictive than a prohibition on imports.14             MS. HALLIGAN:  Well, we would certainly, you15 know, welcome the authority to do both, but importation is16   what is at the heart of the Twenty-First Amendment.17 Bacchus is also different, because, there, the state made18 no effort whatsoever to defend the statute with reference19 to any concerns related to the Twenty-First Amendment.20   And Bacchus -­21             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And according to the District22   Court, in this very case, the State Attorney General23 conceded that New York's measure allowing direct sales by24 in-state wineries was designed to benefit local farmers.25             MS. HALLIGAN:  That was an off-the-cuff remark581111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9by a single attorney, Your Honor, and that can't be taken as dispositive, given the state's vigorous defense of this statute. It also was regarding a provision that is not even directly before the Court right now which confers no different shipment privileges than are conferred on any winery, whether in-state or out-of-state, that would obtain a license to sell in New York.JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Ms. Halligan.MS. HALLIGAN:  Thank you, Your Honor.JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Bolick, you have, let's101112131415161718   Federal Trade Commission has recognized.  They can, if19   they issue a permit, revoke that permit.  And New York has20 authority to issue such permits under Section 105-9. The21 Twenty-First Amendment Enforcement Act, for which the22 liquor distributors and states lobbied very hard, gives23 injunction authority in the home federal courts. And, of24   course, the federal agency, the Tax and Trade Bureau, can25   revoke a permit if state law is violated.

Threevery brief points.          There his a panoply of tools available to statesto police out-of-state wineries in direct shipping, as the1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Who's going to count the2   bottles?3 4 5 6 7 8 9[Laughter.]MR. BOLICK: Your Honor, the state -- the Federal Government is able to count those, but the evidence is that they don't. And that goes back to a question, I believe, Justice Souter asked. In the Michigan case, a question was posed in an interrogatory, "What enforcement by -- is done of in-state wineries." In that regard, the answer was, "None."101112131415161718   full bottles.  I guess -­19             [Laughter.]          JUSTICE BREYER:  How do you count bottles?

And, certainly in the directly shipping context in-state, that is emphatically the case.20             MR.

It is very rife in the legislative record 4   in 1970, when the direct shipping was extinguished.  In 5   1995, when Governor Pataki vetoed a bill that would have 6   solved this problem, he said, and I quote -- and this is 7   in the record, the Joint -- the Second Circuit Joint 8   Appendix, at 442 -- he said, and I quote, "Since the vast 9   majority of this country's wines are produced in10 California, I believe that this bill would inevitably lead11   to a significant increase in mail-order wines from that12   state into New York.  This increase could, in turn, lead13   to a decrease in sales for New York liquor stores and14 their distributors, and shrink New York wineries' market15   share.  That is protectionism."16171819202122232425And, finally, the notion that small winemakers could go to all 50 states and open offices in order to do this -- if you could drive out to Middleburg and visit Juanita Swedenburg's winery -- and she invites you to do so--[Laughter.]          MR. BOLICK:  -- you will find Mrs. Swedenburgselling wine, harvesting grapes, and bottling.  This is aban on -- this is market foreclosure, sure and simple -­fewer than 600 wineries are represented on the stores of611111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6   protectionism. 7             MR. BOLICK:  And I would refer you, in my brief8 time remaining, to the brief, the Carter-Phillips brief9 for the Napa Valley Vintners Association, the DKT Liberty10   brief, which go into the history of the Twenty-First11 Amendment, which was intended to restore the police power,12   which did not include the power to discriminate.  Our13 clients cannot compete with the liquor distributors in the14   political marketplace in their -- in their -- in their15   home states.  They can, however, compete in the economic16171819202122232425marketplace. The Commerce Clause protects that right, that level playing field. The Twenty-First Amendment was never intended to take it away.          We ask this Court, respectfully, to honor 124years of precedent in the National Economic Union.          If there are no further questions, thank you.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Mr. Bolick.
