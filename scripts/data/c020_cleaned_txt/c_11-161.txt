City of Indianapolis.Mr. Stancil.ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK T. STANCILON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. STANCIL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:The city chose a method for abandoning itssewer funding mechanism that left Petitioners paying 30 times more than their next-door neighbors to connect to their neighborhood sewer project simply because Petitioners had paid their tax bills in full.Mere timing of payment does not render similarly situated taxpayers into separate groups. And that is particularly true here where the taxpayers are a discretely defined group of homeowners sharing equally in a common specific benefit and State law explicitly defines them as similarly situated.The city's principal contention is that jettisoning the Barrett Law, the way they funded the initial taxation, was itself an end for this justification and itself justified the gross disparity3￼1 imposed on Petitioner -- on Petitioners. That does not.2 The fact that an arbitrary classification may yield a3 desirable result does not render it any less arbitrary.4 The city must have a reason for drawing the distinction,5 but paying one's taxes in good faith does not eliminate6 a taxpayer's right to equal treatment.7 Indeed, State law here makes clear that8 delaying payment by choosing an installment plan does9 not put a taxpayer on special footing. For example, the10 Barrett Law declares that installment payments, quote,11 "shall be collected in the same manner as other taxes."12 And installment payments are automatically secured by a13 lien against the property.14 Taxpayers who select the installment plan,15 which they may do for any reason or no reason16 whatsoever -- and, in fact, if they make no choice, they17 default into the installment plan. They are required,18 if the city asks as it did here, to sign an agreement,19 agreeing to pay the installments in full with interest20 and not to contest the validity of the underlying21 assessment.22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I understand23 your arguments. Your adversary raises a point that24 concerns me, which is what happens to all other amnesty25 programs like parking ticket amnesties? And if you take4￼1 your logic to an extreme, how about something that2 doesn't involve money but immigration status amnesty,3 illegal aliens who can apply for citizenship and be4 forgiven their illegal entry?5 Doesn't the logic of your theory basically6 mean that there are no circumstances in which the7 government could treat people differently?8 MR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor, for several9 reasons. For starters, this Court's equal protection10 and rational basis cases in particular make clear that11 context is key. So, forgiving a penalty imposed on a12 speeder, for example, who has an overdue ticket or a13 parking ticket is a qualitatively different judgment14 than forgiving the underlying tax liability of a broad15 swath of -­16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Every time a police17 officer stops me for a traffic violation, I get angry18 when he lets somebody else go. So, you're suggesting19 that there is a difference between that and this case20 where the government is basically saying you owe me21 something and I'm going to forgive you what you owe me?22 MR. STANCIL: Yes, Your Honor. The Chief23 Justice's opinion in Engquist took that specific example24 on, not with you in mind presumably, but took that25 example on specifically, and it said: This is the kind5￼1 of action itself that is inherently a subjective2 individualized determination. It's not irrational to3 pull over one traffic violator and not another because4 that's the nature of -- of the enforcement action. That5 is qualitatively different from a tax imposed on 1816 homeowners who live next door to each other, and then7 12 months later saying, you know, 31 of you are going to8 pay 30 times as much in reality as the other 150, even9 though -­1011 more than12 different13 view of -- of how the cutoff should work? Do they have14 to refund all the money, everybody who, in fact, ever15 paid a Barrett Law assessment?16 MR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor, and State law17 on this is quite clear.18 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't care what the State19 is; I'm saying a matter of constitutional law.20 MR. STANCIL: Well, constitutional law looks21 to State law. That's what we took out of Allegheny22 Pittsburgh and Nordlinger.23 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. All right. So what?24 MR. STANCIL: But -- but I will back up.25 I'll do it both ways, Your Honor. State law itself says6JUSTICE BREYER: I thought there were a lot -- there are 20 different lots, 20-- there are -- I mean, when -- what's your￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the following taxpayers are similarly situated, your project specific to your neighborhood, because those are the people to whom you're guaranteed -- with whom you're guaranteed equal treatment. It isn't that you're entitled to a certain price for a sewer connection under this law. It's -­JUSTICE BREYER: Why can the State, when they have, let's say, 10,000 people who have already paid their assessments -- well, why doesn't it have to give them back their money, on your theory? That's my simple question.MR. STANCIL: Because they're not similarly situated. Because -­JUSTICE BREYER: Why aren't they?MR. STANCIL: Because your -- the Stateshave flexibility to define at the outset who is similarly situated.JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Fine. They define here who is similarly situated, and the people who aren't are the ones who are on the installment plan.MR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor, but they still have to have a basis for saying that. They don't -­ JUSTICE BREYER: They do. They do. The reason is because they think it's unfair to give thepeople -- they think it's -- they don't want to bother7￼10 11 1213 cases say.14 line somewhere. I'll take the case that Respondents15 rely on heavily, FCC v. Beach -­1 collecting it from these people who haven't paid yet.2 Okay? That's why. And they don't see a way, if you -­3 so, if we're going to free them, we don't want to go4 back into history and then suddenly give back all the5 people who've ever paid their assessment. I mean -- so,6 we draw the 789 it. That'sline somewhere.MR. STANCIL: Your Honor -­JUSTICE BREYER: This is where we're drawing the State law.MR. STANCIL: Well, that -­JUSTICE BREYER: What's wrong with that?MR. STANCIL: That's not what this Court's It's not the fact that you need to draw a￼16 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean -- my point, I'm not17 making it clear. My point is that what's less rational18 about saying, if you paid, too bad; we're having an19 amnesty for the future? What's less rational about20 doing that than saying some of the people who paid in21 full will get their money back, and some will not?22 Which is the line you want to draw.23 MR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor. Let me -­24 I'll back up again. So, we do have a specific25 definition of who is and who is not entitled to equal81 treatment or roughly equal treatment. So -- that's2 under State law. So, they've already committed to who3 is and who is not similarly situated. So, all you need4 to decide in this case -- and this is brought as an5 as-applied challenge by -- by these homeowners -- is:6 Are these people who are promised you will pay the very7 same as your next-door neighbor for this pipe that8 you're going to flush your toilet into -- are they9 allowed to then change their mind and say actually10 you're going to pay 30 times as much?11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Stancil, who are12 "these people"? We have the plaintiffs in this suit,13 and there's a judgment -- there was a judgment in the14 court of first instance and the appellate court for a15 dollar amount, but we're told that there are many more16 of these Barrett Law projects and that they all operate17 the same way.18 So, the result is a lot more money than19 these plaintiffs are claiming; is that not so? If your20 position on the law is right.21 MR. STANCIL: If we're -- if we are correct,22 the city will end up paying a little more than in our23 specific case, but I'd like to explain why and how much24 because it's an important distinction.25 There are about 21 Barrett Law projects that9￼1 still have balances outstanding. Many of them are2 almost paid off. So, it -- in -- there are only three3 that have the 30-year option. The rest have the 10-year4 option. Anything from 2001 prior. So, in fact, I think5 I can give you specific numbers.6 There are seven projects that are less7 than -- that are half paid off or about less than -- or8 less than half paid off. Because the equal protection9 violation is only triggered by gross disparity between10 equally -- similarly situated taxpayers, the city may or11 may not have to refund in each project down the line.12 If you're in year 9 of 10 of repayment, that's not a -­13 JUSTICE KAGAN: That counts as a gross14 disparity?15 MR. STANCIL: If you're in year 9 of 10, I16 don't think that counts as a gross disparity.17 JUSTICE KAGAN: What does, is my question.18 How -- how do you separate a gross disparity from a19 non-gross disparity?20 MR. STANCIL: Well, start with this case,21 which is easy. It's 10 to 1 and 30 to 1. It's the same22 number as in Allegheny Pittsburgh. But even if you drew23 4to1or5to1asaline,astheCourthasdone,say,24 in punitive damages cases where it suggested outer25 limits, that -- I think those are easy lines to draw and10￼1 certainly lines that the lower courts could draw.2 JUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if you win, does -­3 does the city just have to give you enough to bring it4 down to 5 to 1 so that it's no longer a gross disparity?5 MR. STANCIL: I don't think so, Your Honor.6 I think triggering -- the gross disparity triggers the7 violation. And the question is, well, what's the remedy8 for a violation? I think they'd have to have a reason9 for saying we're going to -- it would be the very10 definition of arbitrary to say, well, even though you're11 entitled to equal treatment as a matter of law, you12 know, and even though we're not -- it's not -- liability13 isn't triggered except for gross disparities, I think14 they would have to give us that -- that figure.15 And, Your Honor, if I could, I'd like to get16 back, Justice Ginsburg, to your question about how these17 other projects -- there's a suggestion by Respondents18 that there's a terrible line-drawing problem in how do19 we calculate these benefits. It's simply not the case.20 We have this Federal class action in the Cox case, which21 is every other Barrett Law project that's active except22 ours. We opted out.23 The damages question was before that court,24 because -- because the court ruled in favor of the25 position that this is an equal protection violation.11￼1 The city put together a damages pleading, and it -- and2 it produced3 overpayment45 administrative -- the administrative -- well, maybe6 that's one of them. The administrative problem is, I7 thought, the following: Imagine that you are the city8 mayor. All right? And suppose the mayor does what you9 want. The mayor says I'll give all these people in10 their project back their money.11 The next day in my office, there show up 1512 people who say: Last month, we happened to be in13 project 2, and we paid all our money. Why don't you14 give us back our money? You just gave it to the people15 in project 1. Give it to us.16 And the next day after that, there are 1417 people from project 3 and from project 4. What is your18 answer to those angry taxpayers who have said we don't19 understand why you refunded the money from project 1 but20 not for us?21 What's your answer?22 MR. STANCIL: Two reasons. One, you were23 not promised equal treatment under State law to those24 other projects; you were promised equal treatment with25 the people you live next door. Two, you use a different12to the dollar a calculation of every in every Barrett Law project. JUSTICE BREYER: But that isn't the￼1 pipe. These pipes cost different amounts of money to2 put in different places, and they're done over time.3 Your Honor's hypothetical -- actually, if I4 could tweak it a little bit, it -- the question is not5 who comes in for somebody -- who comes in from a project6 last month. The only question is who comes in from a7 project 11 or more years ago, because those are the only8 ones that'll still be in repayment.9 The Cox -- if we win -- well, there's a10 repayment plan. That's the only thing that creates11 this -- this asymmetry. The only people who are going12 to come in and say, well, you refunded some people on my13 project but not me are people in repayment. So, it's14 only going to be from a project '95 -­15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You see, the problem16 that I have is that you're trying to lop off half of the17 project, which is what was the Barrett project, without18 looking at what the new project is. And that goes to19 what Justice Breyer's point was. Moving forward, every20 old project and every new project is going to pay more21 money than they did under the Barrett Law because I22 think, if I understand correctly, the city is raising23 a -- essentially not a flat fee, but a fee, assessing a24 flat fee across all taxpayers so that these sewer lines25 can be built.13￼1 Am I correct about that?2 MR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor. For future3 sewer projects that they start, each person who connects4 to that new pipe pays a $2,500 flat fee. Every resident5 citywide who uses the municipal sewer -- new, old, or6 whatever -- pays an extra about $10 a month under the7 new system. So, what they did is they decided this8 program, the Barrett Law, is politically very unpopular;9 we would like to get rid of it. Fair enough. But they10 chose a way to do it. They said well, we're going to be11 completely ignorant of -- of the effects.12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it -- but it says13 that new people are going to pay a flat fee. Old people14 are going to pay $10 more a month that they didn't have15 to pay.16 MR. STANCIL: Right.17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so, why can't they18 come in, and why don't they come in, and say exactly19 what Justice Breyer said: You forgave the payments of20 taxes for hooking up to the sewer system of these new21 people coming in. You're treating me differently.22 MR. STANCIL: There's -- there's nobody who23 will pay more under the new system than my clients24 because the new people pay $2,500 and the same monthly25 fees that now every Indiana resident pays.14￼1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, so, everybody else2 says I want to pay $2,500. You're still not dealing3 with the fact that this was one decision tied to others.4 It was a package deal and -- so that the rationality of5 this package deal has to be seen in context. You want6 to lop it off and say all I'm looking at is how much7 these taxpayers paid for this old system, not what the8 new system is creating.9 MR. STANCIL: But that's because, under this10 Court's equal protection cases, they have to have a11 reason for this particular line. They can't say we have12 a general objective, and it doesn't matter if we pursue13 it-­14 JUSTICE BREYER: I might have missed a fact,15 which -- which I'd like to know. Let's call your16 project, project 1, all right? And all the others are 217 through 20. Are there any people in projects 2 through18 20 who still have money outstanding, or are they all19 paid off?20 MR. STANCIL: Yes. They have -- they're in21 various states of repayment.22 JUSTICE BREYER: They're in various states.23 Okay. What happened to the taxpayers who still owe24 money in projects 2 through 20?25 MR. STANCIL: They all got refund -- or15￼1 their balances were completely forgiven.2 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So, it's the same.3 So, now the people for the angry taxpayers in projects 24 through 20 show up at the mayor and say, Mayor, you're5 not only --6 system, you7 if you win,8 through 20,910 20 are -­ 111213 sure I understand that -- that fact. Two through 20 are14 actually older projects -­15 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Older projects.16 MR. STANCIL: Okay. So, they owe less17 money, and they come into the mayor and they say:18 Where's my money? I paid in full. I paid my -­19 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Right.20 MR. STANCIL: -- 9,000, but Joe over here21 got his last $1,000 forgiven.22 Here's what the mayor says -­23 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.24 MR. STANCIL: The mayor says: I talked to25 my lawyers. If it's a grossly disproportionate16you only -- you're not only -- under your not only gave the all-paid-up people back, but you also forgave the future people in 2 and you're not giving us our money back. MR. STANCIL: Let me make clear, 2 throughJUSTICE BREYER: Am I right on the facts? MR. STANCIL: I'm not sure. I want to make￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425burden -- so, if you end up paying grossly disproportionately to your next-door neighbor, because that's what Allegheny Pittsburgh and Nordlinger and all the Court's cases say, then I'm entitled -- I have to give you a refund. But, if you end up paying 10 percent more than the other person to connect to this pipe, that's just not an equal protection problem.JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I see the -­JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Stancil -­JUSTICE SCALIA: I think -- I think thatJustice Breyer is suggesting that if you treat unconstitutionally a whole lot of people, you can get away with it.(Laughter.)MR. STANCIL: Well -­JUSTICE BREYER: Oddly enough, I was notsuggesting that. (Laughter.)CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, some -­ some time ago, I thought you were just about to tell us how much money the city says will be at stake if you prevail.MR. STANCIL: In my case, there's $273,391.63. In the Cox case, $2,783,702.59, on the assumption that all of those people are grossly17￼1 disproportionately burdened.23 says that's4 prevail, if56 said in Cox. Yes, Your Honor.7 JUSTICE ALITO: Could the city cure the8 problem by rescinding the forgiveness for those who paid9 under the installment plan -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the -- the city the total amount that's at issue if youthe taxpayers prevail on this claim.MR. STANCIL: That's -- that's what they10 MR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor.11 JUSTICE ALITO: Why not?12 MR. STANCIL: This was specifically13 addressed in Allegheny Pittsburgh. That's exactly what14 the West Virginia Supreme Court said. They said, well,15 if you have any remedy, it's only to raise the taxes on16 other people. And this Court specifically rejected17 that.18 JUSTICE SCALIA: You wouldn't have any19 incentive to bring a lawsuit if that were the remedy,20 would you?21222324 as it is. 2518￼MR. STANCIL: Right. I'm already unpopular. JUSTICE SCALIA: So, effectively -­MR. STANCIL: I'm unpopular in Indianapolis(Laughter.)1 MR. STANCIL: If I went back and just raised2 everybody's taxes, I'll -- I'll never get to go.3 (Laughter.)4 MR. STANCIL: But, again, this -- and that's5 just the practical reality.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why isn't that a choice7 for the legislature? Because everybody could be treated8 equally by getting their money back, or nobody gets out9 from under the old system. So, why shouldn't that be -­10 the decision is you11 people differently.12 number of cases you13 legislative choice.14 MR. STANCIL: It was a legislative choice,15 Justice Ginsburg, but having now made a choice that16 inflicts a constitutional violation, this Court's cases17 are clear, that the correct and the default rule is18 refunds, because -- for exactly the reason19 Justice Scalia raised. Even if it's possible to go back20 and do that, which -- it isn't always the case, but even21 if it's possible, that just means the equal protection22 cases and tax cases don't get brought because the most23 you can hope to get is -­24 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Stancil, if that's25 right, and let's take a case which is different from the19can't treat these two groups ofSo, I think the Court has said in acan equalize up or down.

Let's take a case where there are many, many, many more open projects, involving much, much more cost than you're saying is true here.And the mayor looks at Unless I can just draw be able to change this can draw the line here nobody gets any money.this and says: You know what? the line here, I'm not going to financing system, either unless I or unless I can say, you know,What's a mayor to do?MR. STANCIL: Well, again, I agree with Justice Scalia that making a big mess isn't ajustification for arbitrarily ending it.JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but I -- I guess whatI'm asking is we have this terrible program; everybody hates it; it's not fulfilling its intended purposes; the mayor and everybody else wants to change it: How is the mayor going to change this program now?MR. STANCIL: There are two ways he could have changed this program. One, he could have offered us refunds. Two -­JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm suggesting -­MR. STANCIL: I know -­JUSTICE KAGAN: -- that that is financially￼prohibitive.MR. STANCIL: I will pay for it then because204 city-county5 monthly fee6 these sewer7council. But he could have increased that under the new program. There actually -­ projects still cost the same.JUSTICE SCALIA: Have we ever decided an1 he can go and he could -- he could have done two things2 here. They could have -- and I'm using "the mayor"3 loosely; it's actually the board of public works and the8 equal protection case on the basis that the -- the State9 who had violated the -- the Constitution can't afford to10 pay for it? 1112131415 deny equal protection?16 MR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor. And I -­17 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, isn't that what you're18 saying, Mr. Stancil? Is what you're saying that when19 cities create tax policy, they can't think about the20 budget implications of that tax policy?21 MR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor. What I'm22 saying is when they want to change tax policy, having23 already said these taxpayers are the same and entitled24 under law to equal treatment, they can't just say, well,25 it would be too expensive on us to treat them equally21Is there any case that supports that? MR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor.JUSTICE SCALIA: It's just too expensive? MR. STANCIL: No.￼JUSTICE SCALIA: And, therefore, we have to1 when unwinding that program. This2 said resources are not sufficient.3 And any tax case could4 the -- if the city says, well, you5 have -- we want to refund X dollars to our taxpayers,6 but we only have enough to refund to the blonde people7 and not to brunettes, that's arbitrary, even if they8 couldn't afford to do it other ways -- another way.9 So, they can't just pick a method that sort10 of where the math works out or is convenient, and just11 say, well, that's the way we could have done it.12 I would, if I could, just return to the13 practical ways they could have done this, And I think14 that highlights just how arbitrary this line was. They15 could have increased those monthly fees under STEP, the16 new program. I mean, that's how they paid for the rest17 of these projects. They're paying off the bonds of the18 old projects by charging everybody in Indianapolis $1019 more a month.20 They could have just collected -- in our21 project, they could have collected for 2 more years.22 They could have said you'll be forgiven -- I think it's23 about 27 months. You will -- we're going to forgive24 your balances as of, you know, whatever that would be --25 June of 2010, whatever it would be, 2007 -- collected22Court in Plyler hasbe justified. If know, we want to￼1 that money, and then they would have had the cash to2 refund to the people who had paid in an equal amount3 that they were forgiving to the others. So, I think --4 I think that's sort of -- it's a red herring to say,5 gosh, we had no other way, or we only had these options6 A,B,andC.7 I'd like to -- I really want just to drill8 down on the illustration of just how crazy I think this9 is. Suppose that the United States decides tomorrow to10 go to a national sales tax instead of the Federal income11 tax. It's February 29th; millions of people have paid12 their taxes for 2011; many, many -- most of us have not13 yet paid. Could the IRS come in and say: Well, if14 you've already filed and paid your taxes for 2011, too15 bad. But lucky you, if you're a late filer; you're16 going to get your entire tax bill forgiven.17 I don't think that's remotely close. I18 think that is arbitrary, and I'll give you a couple of19 reasons. One, absolutely no notice. So, the timing of20 payment, the method of payment that was selected, gives21 those taxpayers absolutely no notice as to some22 constitutional significance that attaches to it.23 And I don't think -- and I can tell you from24 talking to my clients, they don't -- they didn't think25 that by paying up front in full that they had -- they23￼1 were somehow sacrificing their chance to equal treatment2 or that the city might some day wipe out 97 percent of3 their neighbors' tax obligations.4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That is the parking5 amnesty example that you have said wasn't the same.6 Because if an individual taxpayer has filed late, it's7 like the parking guy who didn't file his ticket, either.8910 saying that11 the risk is1213 parking ticket example, forgiving a penalty for late14 payment is a qualitatively different -- to borrow from15 Engquist again, a subjectively individualized16 determination designed to achieve another goal, a17 legitimate goal in itself. Pay your parking ticket, and18 we'll let the penalty go. That is different.19 So, if my clients were here saying, well,20 you're not charging me -­21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, but you're saying if22 you forgive the parking ticket, that's an equal23 protection violation.24 MR. STANCIL: No, Your -- I mean, I would25 not, Your Honor. Again, it's context-driven. The24MR. STANCIL: Well -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, you really are amnesty programs are out of the question if imposed equally on everyone.MR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor. In the￼14 it? What's 1516 I'll say it 17wrong with it?MR. STANCIL: It's not, Your Honor. And rests on the faulty -­JUSTICE BREYER: It's not their rationale, perfect?MR. STANCIL: It's not reasonable, Your1 parking -­2 JUSTICE BREYER: The goal here is very3 simple. They say we have hundreds or dozens or 204 different programs anyway, and once we start getting5 into the business of distinguishing among people who are6 already paid up, it's going to be a nightmare. And so,7 the only clear line we draw is between the people who8 are already paid up and the people who haven't paid.9 And we don't want those people who haven't paid to have10 to pay because that's going to be another 20 years of11 administrating $33 a month.12 Okay. That's their rationale. Now, that13 may not be perfect, but it sounds reasonable, doesn't￼18 or it's not 1920 Honor. It rests on the faulty premise that this is some21 administratively -­22 JUSTICE BREYER: It's not impossible. They23 don't say it's impossible. Say, try looking through the24 U.S. tax code. It has thousands of pages. There is not25 one human being alive who understands every provision.251 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425All we have to do is start comparing the provision on page 1 with page 3 with page 7 and page 9, and we will discover irrationality forever.So, I don't -- I mean, you may have this fairly simple case, but I foresee, if you win, the -­ don't ask me what will happen, but I have a suspicion it's not going to be too good.MR. STANCIL: Your Honor, I mean -- there's one -- there's somebody not here in this case that I think belies this notion -­JUSTICE BREYER: What?MR. STANCIL: -- that this is going against the tax code broadly or amnesty programs or forgiveness decisions generally. If -- if -- I think if people really thought that this case was going to foul up the tax code or forgiveness, I think the IRS would be here or the United States would be here saying this is very similar to what we do on a daily basis in compromising debt on an individual basis.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there an easier thing to administer than the system that was struck down in Allegheny Pittsburgh?MR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Whatever you paid, that's what your assessment was. And they argued, well,26￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425this is easy; that's enough. And this Court said, no, it's an equal protection violation.MR. STANCIL: Correct, Your Honor, and, again, the administrative burden there was actually quite significant.JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't believe in the administrative nightmare exception to the EqualProtection Clause? (Laughter.)MR. STANCIL: Not when it takes only threepages and -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me -- I'm curious to know, if other States have provisions like the Barrett Law and they're concerned about this, can they provide in the initial documents a -- a promise that there will be no forgiveness, so that there would be a contract clause sort of argument against what happened here? In other words -- and if we could explore that for just a minute, I'm going to ask what it is that you thought constituted a promise in this case.MR. STANCIL: Well, there are four -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: And maybe not a promise in the contract sense.MR. STANCIL: Yes. Four separate provisions of the Barrett Law -- just -- I'll rattle them off for27￼1 you. First, it says installment payments shall be2 collected in the same manner as other taxes. It3 actually says "shall collect" two other times. Requires4 a lien. It says that municipal officials who don't5 collect installment payments can actually be held6 personally liable and removed from office for failing to7 discharge their duties. That's on pages 2a to 3a of the8 appendix to the blue brief.9 So, I don't think there's any sensible way10 to read the Barrett Law as saying it doesn't require11 payment. And none of the State court judges who've12 looked at this have suggested that. And -­13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: On the other aspect of my14 case, do you think other States could provide protection15 against this, in the event you do not prevail here, and16 -- and put in the documents that it is understood that a17 condition for your approving of this, these sewers, will18 be that there will be no forgiveness?19 MR. STANCIL: I suppose they could, Your20 Honor. I -- again I'd argue that -­21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would that then be22 enforceable under the contract clause, do you think?23 MR. STANCIL: I'm not sure it would be24 under the contract clause. But could I flip it and25 suggest that if a State wanted to preserve its right to28￼1 forgive willy-nilly, they could include a provision in2 their law that says, by the way, if you choose an3 installment plan and we change our policy, there shall4 be -- you're not entitled to equal treatment with people5 who pay up front?678 who pays up 91011 can, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,13 Mr. Stancil.14 Mr. Clement.15 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT16 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS17 MR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,18 and may it please the Court:19 In 2005, the City of -- the City of20 Indianapolis decided that it wanted to abandon its21 reliance on the Barrett Law, a program that had proved22 unpopular for financing public improvements. In doing23 so, they decided to make a clean break and forgive the24 outstanding balances that were due under the Barrett Law25 program. The alternative of maintaining those accounts29JUSTICE KENNEDY: Give you a warning?MR. STANCIL: Right. And let's -- we'll see front under that system.(Laughter.)MR. STANCIL: If I can, Your Honor -- if I￼1 and maintaining the tax liens associated with those2 accounts for nearly three decades was particularly3 unattractive. Now, the -­4 JUSTICE ALITO: I think you've put your5 finger on the reason for this, which is that the city6 calculated that what it did would be more politically7 acceptable than treating the people who paid up front8 equally on an economic basis with the people who paid in9 installment plans. Now, if that's the reason for this,10 is that rational?11 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Alito, it -- it12 might well be rational. I mean, sometimes things that13 make policy sense that the public likes also make good14 government sense. And in this context, what they wanted15 to do is they wanted to get out of the Barrett Law16 business. That's the exact words -­17 JUSTICE ALITO: But what does that mean,18 they wanted to get out of the Barrett Law business?19 MR. CLEMENT: Can I put it very concretely?20 I mean, before this -- you know, when they used to have21 the Barrett Law and used it on an ongoing basis, within22 the controller's office, they had a Barrett Law office.23 They wanted to get rid of the Barrett Law office.24 How do you get rid of the Barrett Law25 office? You get of the obligation to continue to30￼1 collect these payments for 30 years; you get rid of the2 obligations to keep all these files together and see3 whether you're in a position to enforce a tax lien.4 JUSTICE ALITO: That really doesn't seem5 very complicated, to collect payments that people have6 agreed to pay. And if they didn't want to do it7 anymore, I bet they could have contracted that out for a8 very modest fee to any number of private entities that9 would have done it for them.10 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Alito, of11 course, they could have continued to collect. I think12 that's common ground here, which I think ultimately13 shows why this is a very curious equal protection14 theory, because if the city would have continued to15 collect these, you know, for 30 years, then they agree,16 there's no Equal Protection Clause problem at all.17 Now, I think as Justice Kagan was18 suggesting, if you now create a rule that says when they19 do forgive, they actually have to provide refunds and20 face Equal Protection Clause violations, then in the21 future, nobody is going to ever forgive. What they're22 going to do in the future is, even though they're trying23 to move away from this policy, even though they're24 trying to get out of the Barrett Law business, they're25 going to be stuck.31￼1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, I think maybe if you2 prevail in this opinion, we should say the principle we3 are adopting in this case is: Don't trust the4 government.5 MR. CLEMENT: No, Justice Kennedy, I don't6 think that's right. But the fact that that's your7 reaction I think shows that this is not really an equal8 protection claim, and it's not really like Allegheny9 Pittsburgh because, as your colloquy with Mr. Stancil10 suggested, they would admit that if the government said,11 as part of the Barrett Law, look, you know, we reserve12 the right to abandon the Barrett Law, and if we do so,13 we -- you know, we may forgive installment payments -­14 if they said that, the equal protection claim would go15 away in their view.16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's simply17 because, as we said in Allegheny Pittsburgh, the basis18 for considering the equal protection claim is the rights19 that you're given under State law. In Allegheny20 Pittsburgh, it says you have the right to be treated21 equally with respect to assessments. And you weren't.22 Here the law says you have the right to be23 treated equally, or whatever it is, the apportionment,24 and they weren't. All that you're saying there is that25 State law gets to set the base. And if the State law32￼1 says we don't treat people the same in extending sewer2 hook-ups, then that takes away your Equal Protection3 Clause. But it just sets the base.4 MR. CLEMENT: Two differences,5 Mr. Chief Justice. First of all, you know, there's6 no -- there's no real analogue to Allegheny Pittsburgh7 because Allegheny Pittsburgh is a one time in time case.8 There the problem was that statute was very different.9 It was facially neutral, and it was being applied in an10 unequal way.11 Nothing, not one word, in Allegheny12 Pittsburgh suggests that if the State of West Virginia13 wanted to change its policy and adopt proposition 13 as14 the law of West Virginia, that it couldn't do so. And15 that's the anomaly here. This equal -- this equal16 treatment requirement they get, they get it from the17 Barrett Law.18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The change in19 policy -­20 MR. CLEMENT: That's the exact law that -­21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The change in22 policy is from treating people equally to treating23 people unequally. I don't see how the fact that they're24 changing that policy addresses the issue at all.25 They're going from a system where everybody was subject33￼1 to the same assessment to a system where some pay2 something and other people pay 30 times that. Yes, it's3 a change, but it's the change that presents the problem.4 MR. CLEMENT: No, I -- with respect, I think5 it's the change that makes this case different from6 Allegheny Pittsburgh. It's the change that makes this7 government action rational.8 This would be a different case if they9 didn't change the Barrett Law program, and they just10 stuck by it and said, you know, we're going to forgive11 some people. But here they decide they're going to -­12 they're going to abandon the very law that imposes,13 supposedly -- I want to talk about what State law really14 does. But it supposedly imposes this equal protection15 requirement. That's the very law they want to move away16 from.17 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I still don't -­18 MR. CLEMENT: And this idea that -­19 JUSTICE ALITO: Other than political20 expediency and administrative convenience, I still don't￼21 understand what rational22 the distinction that was23 is sufficient, but other24 I don't see another one.25 MR. CLEMENT:basis you claim there was for drawn. Now, maybe one of those than those two possible bases,Well, you know, I count five,341 Justice Alito. If you want to hear -- I mean, I'll go2 through them. One is what I call making a clean break,3 having not to deal with the vestiges of the old program.4 You may call it political expedience. I don't think it5 is. I think that's, you know, a good government6 concern.7 The second is avoiding the administrative8 burdens of particularly the refund process. And I think9 it's worth recognizing that -- you know, they say, well,10 what could be simpler; just cut a check. But to whom11 and for what amount? I mean, you know, if you're going12 to go back to close accounts, the first thing you're13 going to have to confront is what do we do with the14 people that have sold their house?15 Well, I mean, you know, we've got to figure16 out where they are now. We've got to figure out, I17 mean, do we -­18 JUSTICE ALITO: Those are reasons for not19 giving refunds, but what are the reasons for forgiving20 the debt that people agreed to?21 MR. CLEMENT: Well -- okay. But, if I22 could, they don't challenge the forgiveness. So, the23 reason that I'm trying to explain that there are24 rational bases for not giving refunds is because the25 challenge that's really brought here is to Resolution35￼1 101, and it's -­2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you don't -- you3 don't -­4 MR. CLEMENT: -- it's forgiveness without5 refunds.6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You don't dispute that the7 city would have that option if we rule against you.8 MR. CLEMENT: Would have the option what,9 Mr. Justice Kennedy?10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just not to forgive the11 unpaid balances. The city has the option, I assume.12 MR. CLEMENT: They certainly have the option13 in the future. I think it's a dispute between the14 parties whether they have the option as a part of the15 remedy. I would say, not to get ahead of myself, but to16 address the remedy, this is very different from17 Allegheny Pittsburgh. And it has to be that one option18 is to simply invalidate Resolution 101.19 I'm not -- I don't -- I'm not aware of any20 other area of the law where you can have a statute or an21 ordinance that draws an invalid distinction, and one22 remedial option is not to invalidate the statute or the23 ordinance. And that's the position.24 Their position is, you know, if you would25 have put something in there that said we're not going to36￼56 difference.7 other case,89 because theJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's a -- that's a big In one case, there's an expectation; in thethere isn't.MR. CLEMENT: No, Mr. Justice Kennedy, expectation here is at the time of1 do anything, you'd be fine. But having given2 forgiveness and said we're not going to give refunds,3 you're stuck not only with the forgiveness but also with4 giving refunds.10 Resolution 101. At the time of Resolution 101, I think11 it's common ground. The city was under no obligation to12 provide forgiveness.13 So, if in101, by providing forgiveness violated the Equal Protection logical remedy for that to simply 101? No forgiveness; everybody￼14 without refunds, they15 Clause, why isn't the16 invalidate Resolution17 gets equal treatment.18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Because you would -- you19 would eliminate all litigation on Equal Protection20 Clause grounds if all that the plaintiff is going to21 achieve is not any benefit to him but harming somebody22 else.23 That's -- the classic case is -- is the sex24 discrimination case, where a State had a drinking law25 which said that -- that men could drink at the age of 18371 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425but women at the age of 21. And what happened in the lawsuit? Did the court say, well, I guess -- I guess men will be able to drink at 18. No, that's -­MR. CLEMENT: No, I think what they said -­JUSTICE SCALIA: They said men would have to drink at 18, not that women will have to wait to 21 because -­MR. CLEMENT: No, I think they said that was, with respect -­either way.JUSTICE GINSBURG: They said it could goMR. CLEMENT: Exactly.JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was up to the Oklahoma legislature. They could make it 21 for everyone or 18 for everyone.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the city retains that option in this case going forward. The problem with -­MR. CLEMENT: No, but -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- your analogy is you're dealing with a situation -- you're saying, well, here's a violation and the law can -- and what does the law do? But this -- this is exactly 180 degrees away. There's no violation, and the law creates the violation. In that situation -­38￼1 MR. CLEMENT: Right. So, then you -­2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- I think you're3 dealing with an entirely different case.4 MR. CLEMENT: If the law that created the5 violation is Resolution 101, than the remedy in every6 other area of constitutional law, including sex7 discrimination, is clearly that the State has the8 option. They can level up or they can level down. The9 only case that's different is Allegheny Pittsburgh and10 the assessment cases it relies on. But there's an11 important difference.12 JUSTICE BREYER: Then you're saying that the13 difference between the two classes is that if you14 continue to have the tax apply to the people who haven't15 paid it yet, there is a large administrative expense.16 And if you -- as an expense that does not exist in17 respect to the class that has already paid it.18 So, the question, I would have thought, in19 our Court is whether that's a rational distinction. And20 I think contrary to what was suggested, administrative21 expenses, of course, make a difference where the Equal22 Protection Clause is concerned because they23 differentiate between the two classes. And trying to24 avoid an administrative expense is a rational reason,25 normally, for making the distinction.39￼1 Now, I mention that because I know -- what2 -- it can -- does that bring to mind any authority which3 would be helpful? Because there was a question that4 there is no such authority. It makes sense to me, but5 is there some authority for that?6 MR. CLEMENT: Sure, there is, Your Honor. I7 mean, you look to a number of places. I would look to8 Carmichael v. Southern Coal where, you know, this Court9 is confronting a case where the State says, you know,10 we're not going to tax employers -- employers who are11 smaller than eight, because, you know, the game is not12 worth the candle. And in a similar way here, they say13 we want to get out of the Barrett Law business. We want14 to make a clean break. And they say, you know, we don't15 want to keep this office in the controller's office.16 JUSTICE SCALIA: But here -- here the State17 has defined the class. That's the difference. I mean,18 to say employers with less than eight is a separate19 class, that's fine. But -- but here, the State said20 we're creating this class of -- of people who have to21 pay for sewer assessments, and we're going to treat them22 equally. That's what the law required.23 MR. CLEMENT: I would have thought, Justice24 Scalia, if this was an equal protection case, not a25 contracts case, not a Winstar case, not an estoppel40￼1 case, if this was an equal protection case, the relevant2 time period would be the time period of the ordinance3 that's challenged, Resolution 101. At that time, there4 is a difference already in real-world fact between those5 who've paid in full and those who have outstanding6 balance, and are going to keep the city in the Barrett7 Law business for three decades.8 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, you're saying that any9 future law which -- which disregards an equal10 classification that a prior law established is okay? So11 long as it's a future law that does it.12 MR. CLEMENT: It -­13 JUSTICE SCALIA: There will always be a14 future law that does it.15 MR. CLEMENT: No, it -- it could be. There16 still has to be a rational basis for it.￼17181920 questioning. 2122 -- boy, you23 these accounts are going to be a nightmare to maintain.24 We have an estimate from our controller -- this is in25 the Cox litigation, but it's cited in one of the amicus41JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.MR. CLEMENT: And -- and -­ JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what we'reMR. CLEMENT: Right, but a rational basis isknow, we have two sets of accounts. Half of1 briefs. We've got an estimate from our controller2 that's going to cost us $200,000 to upgrade and maintain3 this system. We really don't want to spend that.4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I think I5 don't see the answer -­6 MR. CLEMENT: Now, is that $200,0007 associated -­8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Excuse me. I don't9 see the answer to Justice Scalia's question. You're10 saying this would be a rational system going forward,11 but you also promised the people that they would be12 treated equally over a certain period.13 When you start out it's not equal because14 somebody pays $400 and somebody else pays 10,000, and -­15 but over the 30-year period, it's the same. That's why16 it's equal in the beginning, even though somebody pays17 400 and somebody pays 10,000 because they're going to18 pay the same over the period.19 Then you lop off the period. So, you're not20 treating them equally. Go -- when you started. You can21 no longer say don't worry about the inequality; it will22 sort out in 30 years. Now you can't -- you have no way23 of telling them why it's not unequal.24 MR. CLEMENT: With all due respect,25 Mr. Chief Justice, you're making this sound like it's an42￼1 estoppel case, like it's a Winstar case. It's not a2 broken promise case. This is an equal protection case.3 And the reason there's a rational difference at the time4 Resolution 101 is, is because that point in time has5 passed and they're in an different position.6 But I also do want to make clear that you7 will look in vain in the Barrett Law for this stern8 promise that no matter what happens, we will eventually9 collect the same amount from everybody. What there is,10 is there is a requirement for equal assessment in the11 first instance -- nobody says that was violated -- and12 then, if you elect four installments, there's a13 provision that says you shall collect.14 The irony of their position is they say it's15 perfectly okay for the city to break that promise. It's16 perfectly okay to give forgiveness. They don't have a17 quorum -- a quarrel with forgiveness. They want18 forgiveness. They just want to get some refunds, too,19 as a result.20 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, they want forgiveness,21 but you outline correctly in your brief the fact that22 the city had three options. One of the options was to23 hold everybody to what they understood when they signed24 up under the Barrett Law.25 And I -- I do not understand how your43￼1 administrative convenience argument fits in with the2 decision to forgive the debt of the people who agreed to3 pay on the installment plan. When the city was4 collecting those payments was that a net loss? Were the5 administrative costs of making those collections more6 than the amount of money that was brought in?7 If not, then I don't see how administrative8 convenience justifies a rejection of that option.9 MR. CLEMENT: Justice Alito, as I hear you,10 you've switched from rational basis to it has to be, you11 know, a net -- unless we can show a net loss, we lose.12 Why can't we make a rational judgment that there's a13 unique $200,000 cost associated with maintaining this14 program? We don't want to maintain the program. It's15 tremendously politically unpopular. We've moved away16 from it. We don't want to -- I mean, can you imagine17 the city -­18 JUSTICE ALITO: It's rational for a city to19 say that it costs us $100,000 to collect this money, and20 if we do collect it, we're going to bring in $500,000;21 so, we don't want to pay the $100,000; so, we're going22 to get rid of the program? That's rational?23 MR. CLEMENT: It is rational, Justice Alito,24 because they have to maintain an office to do it. You25 know, think about the city. Do you really think -­44￼12 they walked13 laughed at.1415 another way16 okay, they've collected everything from the 10-year17 payers.

CLEMENT: The costs of the project when7 they are doing the appraisal. When they're coming up8 with the cost for how much it's going to cost to stick9 the pipes in the ground, they have a law that says it10 has to be divided equally among11 assessment. There's a specific12 challenge the assessment if you13 don't challenge it, it's final.14 There's actually two provisions in the15 Barrett Law that you won't search in vain for that talk16 about the interest of finality, which is yet another17 reason that justifies the differential treatment here18 between people who have paid in full, their accounts are19 closed, and people who have ongoing outstanding20 balances.21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where -- where doI22 look to find that when they say the costs shall be23 apportioned equally, they are not referring to the24 costs, but they were referring to the assessments?25 MR. CLEMENT: They're referring to the costs47the lots. That's an provision that you can don't like it. Once you￼1 of the project, the improvement, that will then be2 reflected -­3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The costs of the4 project are funded by the -- the sewer hook-ups, and5 some people pay 400 and some people paY 10,000.6 MR. CLEMENT: No, but it's the costs that7 are then reflected in the assessment on each lot. And8 there's then a process for challenging that assessment9 on the assumption that the costs are allocated equally10 to each lot, and then when that's done, the finality11 provisions kick in.12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that just -­13 MR. CLEMENT: And nobody says there was14 anything wrong.15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That just underscores the16 promise of the State -- or the city that all owners will17 be treated equally. That just underscores the point18 that that was the understanding and the commitment.19 MR. CLEMENT: With respect, that's not.20 The original idea is, sure, you know, we're going to21 assess the costs of the project equally among everybody22 whose benefiting from the project. And then we're going23 to have an assessment, and if the Barrett Law doesn't24 change, the assumption is everybody's going to pay the25 same amount.48￼1 I'm not here to tell you otherwise, but the2 point is the Barrett Law, like most laws, doesn't have a3 clause that plans for its own demise. It doesn't say,4 well, you know, if -- if we get rid of this law, we5 either will or will not enforce the installments.6 And I think the question here is at a7 different point in time when they've made a different8 judgment -- we don't like the Barrett Law. It's proven9 unpopular. It's proven unwieldy. It's not just10 popularity or political. It's that, you know, they're11 facing lots of low-income subdivisions with septic12 tanks, and, you know, they're forcing the prospect of13 trying to get people to pay $10,000 to improve a -- the14 sewer on a house that's worth $50,000. They realize15 that's a non-starter. We've got to get out of this16 business.17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You just said it's18 not popularity. In page 1 of your brief, you say, "The￼19 Barrett Law20 unpopular."2122 know, every23 And it's not just that they24 their right to not like it.25 to not like a law that saysmethod eventually proved to be politically Sounds like it's popularity to me.MR. CLEMENT: It's not just popularity. Youonce in a whilethe people have a point. don't like something; it'sAnd they're very much right you got a $50,000 house and491 we're going to make you pay for a $10,000 sewer hook-up.2 They were right to get out of the business.3 Having done that, I don't understand why they're saddled4 with a provision of law that exists in the old law that5 they're trying to get away from.6 And just to be clear -- I mean, if you want7 to look at a case that I think shows you why the State8 law is not as equality über alles as they're presenting,9 take a look at an old Indiana case called Allendorf, 17610 N.E. 240. That's a case where some people in the11 project challenged the -- the assessment, said, you12 know, that's unfair; it's too much. Other people paid13 in full.14 The people who challenged it went to court.15 They eventually settled with the city for a reduced16 amount. Then later on the people who had paid in full17 went into court and said we're entitled to pay no more18 than those guys. You know what the Indiana appellate19 court said? No dice. That doesn't work. You20 basically -- you either waived your right in express21 waiver or if you paid in full, it's -- you know, it's22 too late. It's too late.23 So, the -- and this is, with respect, I24 think part of the problem with the Allegheny Pittsburgh,25 and particularly this extension of it. You're putting50￼6 supposed to7 seems to be8 law.9be looking at Federal law, and the violation tied to potentially a violation of StateIf I could focus on that for a minute, 10 because this is another really important difference1 so much weight on the State law, and it gets you in thisflyspecking the Barrett Law.I mean, you know, this -- I mean, Justice this point very well in the Nordlinger case,2 business of 34 Thomas made5 that there's an anomaly here, which is you're looking -­11 between Allegheny Pittsburgh and this case, which speaks12 right to the remedy. In Allegheny Pittsburgh, it's a13 facially neutral statute. And so, it would be an14 anomaly there to say that when there's a facially15 neutral statute, you're going to invalidate the -- the16 statute. The statute's fine. The problem is you've17 been assessed at 100 percent; everybody else has been18 assessed at 50 percent. The Court in that unique19 context says, you know, there's no obligation to go and20 sort of mandamus the assessor, to bring everybody else21 up. You get to sort of go back to that level.22 This is very different. The challenge here,23 like in Nordlinger, is a challenge to a distinction24 drawn in a law. Resolution 101, unlike the law in25 Allegheny Pittsburgh, is not facially neutral. It draws51￼1 a distinction. So, the relevant question is the2 rationality of that distinction. Is it rational?3 We submit there are multiple reasons why it4 is rational. But if you disagree with me, the obvious5 remedy is to strike down the statute or at least remand6 to the State court with express instructions that they7 have the option, which is exactly what happened in the8 sex discrimination cases.9 And, Justice Scalia, if you're worried about10 incentives and standing, look at Heckler v. Mathews,11 another sex discrimination case. This exact issue came12 up. And what the Court said is standing is based on13 your right to guaranteed equal treatment. Whether or14 not it's a pocketbook injury, you have standing if15 you're denied equal treatment.16 Now, these guys may have been denied equal17 treatment on the assumption they're right. But they can18 get equal treatment restored just as easily by19 Resolution 101 being invalidated in full as they can by20 getting an additional windfall by getting a refund. And21 as Justice Alito -­22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why is that -- why23 is that a big deal for us? I mean, that's the law. You24 get your -- your choice.25 MR. CLEMENT: Okay. But, I mean, that's a52￼1 big difference because that's different from what2 they're saying. They're saying there's no remedial3 option. They're saying we are stuck now. We -- we have4 to give refunds. That's the only permissible5 constitutional remedy. And, obviously, the city would6 prefer to get out of the Barrett Law business and to7 provide these forgiveness, but it would certainly be a8 lot better for the city if they would at least -- this9 Court made clear, they have the option of leveling up or10 leveling down. I do think, though, that gets to Justice11 Kagan's -­12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that -- if I13 could -- you mentioned Heckler v. Mathews. In Heckler14 v. Mathews, the Court said, quote: "Ordinarily,15 extension" -- of the withheld benefit -- "rather than16 nullification is the proper course."17 MR. CLEMENT: Yes.18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, while it is true19 that you can cure a violation by leveling up or leveling20 down, ordinarily, extension of the benefit is the proper21 course. And that's for the reason Justice Scalia gave,22 because, otherwise, there would be no equal protection23 case brought.24 MR. CLEMENT: If that were the rule, Heckler25 v. Mathews would have come out the other way. The Court53￼1 was -- you know, the Court -­2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what -- what3 did the Court mean when they said, ordinarily, extension4 is the proper course?5 MR. CLEMENT: Well, they were talking about6 a specific situation (a) under Federal law. So, I don't7 know why the rule would be the same. And the sex8 discrimination cases are much more on point for purposes9 of this. But they're also talking about a very specific10 context where you have a limitation on a benefit. And11 the idea is, if you strike down the limitation, the12 default option is everybody gets the benefit.13 This is different. I mean, you know, really14 what Heckler is talking about is severability concerns.15 There's no severability that works here. Resolution16 101 -- if you look at it, it doesn't say anything about17 refunds. It simply says we're going to forgive the18 balances on the outstanding accounts.19 If that's somehow impermissible, then the20 law goes. There's nothing to sever. There's nothing -­21 there's not one word in the statute about refunds. And22 that's different from the context where you have a23 general extension of benefits and you have some24 limitations on the benefits.25 JUSTICE BREYER: What do you think would54￼1 happen if the city says -- if it came out that way -- we2 really want to give refunds or cut off -- we want to3 stop collecting the money, period? Then to make it fair4 on this hypothesis, the city would have to go back and5 refund money. To whom? And how many?6 MR. CLEMENT: And -- and in what amount?7 JUSTICE BREYER: And you heard your -- your8 friend try to make a distinction between this project,9 and you wouldn't have to give the money, he said, to10 every other person, whoever back in 1850 or 1890 or11 whenever it was began to make Barrett Law payments. But12 you would with this one.13 Now, what -- I'd like a little comment on14 that.15 MR. CLEMENT: Well, you're absolutely right.16 And, you know -- and, you know, I talked about the17 question -­1819 question. 2021 is it would22 understand the question -­23 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that.24 Why? I mean, people paid the lump sum.25 MR. CLEMENT: With respect to -­55￼JUSTICE BREYER: Right, because it's aMR. CLEMENT: Well -- okay. Then the answer be an administrative nightmare.

If someone does -­5 JUSTICE BREYER: That's right -­6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Surely, the city has7 records.8 JUSTICE BREYER: Let me try to get my9 question, which is, I'm not -- I'm thinking this is10 project 1. So, certainly, on the hypothesis, you have11 to pay back the people who already paid up for project12 1. But in your brief, you say there's project 2 through13 20. And is there, in your opinion, a basis for14 distinguishing all those people who have paid up in15 those projects, or would you have to give them theirJUSTICE SCALIA: If people come forward andof the ones who paid the lump sum, I if somebody doesn't come and presentwant a such a￼16 money back, 1718 explanation19 money back,20too?Now, you heard your friend's statement -­ of why you wouldn't have to give them the and I want to get your response to that. MR. CLEMENT: Well, with respect, what I21 heard him say is we probably would. And I think we22 certainly would as to most of the projects. There might23 be a couple of the projects where the differences are so24 small that he would say there's no gross inequality25 there. But as to most of the other projects, there are561 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425still substantial differences -­JUSTICE BREYER: How many people does thatinvolve, about?MR. CLEMENT: It involves -- you know, Idon't -- I know the number of projects. It's like 20 projects. So, I'm guessing it's at least 1,000 people. And then, of course, somebody's going to come in if we do that, as you suggested, and say wait a second -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Was his figure of2 million accurate? As the stake -- in the other case.MR. CLEMENT: The stakes in the other case without interest I think are $2.7 million. So, you know, I think the -- the ballpark figures are right.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you say "the other case," you mean every other project? Because that's -- that's, what, a class action; right?MR. CLEMENT: It's -- it's a class action, the Cox -- the Federal litigation. But still, that's not a -- that's not an insubstantial amount.Of course, the relevant question is not, you know, are the damages a set figure after you've had litigation in Federal court? The question is what is the city administrator, at the time he's trying to decide whether he has a refund obligation, to do?And, Justice Scalia, you said, well, it's57￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425clear as mud. I mean, did you listen to the answer about gross inequality? What, are they supposed to run it through the gross inequality calculator that tells them, well, you know, it's close, but it's not really -­ there's not a discrete obligation? I don't know how -- I would not know how to advise them as to which of the other 21 projects they owed a refund to and which they didn't. I would be at a complete loss.And the reason -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if everybody -- if everybody entitled to a refund came forward, it would cost you $2.7 million. And it -­MR. CLEMENT: No, actually it would -- plus this one. So, it would be a little over 3.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Three -­$3 million. And you say the real problem is the huge administrative cost in trying to figure out who you owe it to. If it's that huge, all they do is somebody who comes forward, asks for a refund, verify that they're -­ you know, were a homeowner on the project, give them the refund.MR. CLEMENT: Well, I mean -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The most it's going to cost is $3 million.MR. CLEMENT: Yes, in this case. And the -­58￼1 and the law that you develop here is not going to be2 limited to this case; it's going to apply in other3 contexts as well. Heaven knows where it stops. As I4 said, Allegheny Pittsburgh -- it was at least limited to5 a particular context. Now, I mean, I don't know why any6 city ever -- I mean, maybe this is the limiting7 principle that no city ever again will provide amnesty8 or forgiveness under any circumstances.9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Amnesty -- I don't10 get -- amnesty is entirely different. Amnesty is for11 people who did something wrong. Nobody did something12 wrong here; 1314 it's the -­ 1516 don't apply. 1718 mean, I could certainly see some -- you know, suppose19 the city elects a laissez-faire mayor and says you know20 what? Parking tickets -- it's not worth the hassle;21 we're going to getting out of the parking ticket22 enforcement business, and we're going to forgive23 everybody their parking tickets.24 If I had just paid my parking tickets, I'd25 be hacked off, but I wouldn't feel like I had a Federal59it wasn't wrong to pay with installments. MR. CLEMENT: But, Mr. Chief Justice,CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the amnesty cases￼MR. CLEMENT: It's the same principle. I1 constitutional right to get my money back. And that's2 the difference -­3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What do you do with the4 hypothetical about the income tax and the sales tax?5 So, you don't pay any income tax if the sales tax had6 gone into effect.7 MR. CLEMENT: I think if they really got rid8 of the -- the Federal tax forever, I don't think there9 would be an equal protection violation. I think there10 might be a different constitutional violation. If you11 listen to him, the first thing he ticked off about why12 that would be so horrible is there was no notice. Well,13 that sounds like a due process concern to me, not an14 equal protection concern.15 And that's really what's happening here.16 When they transport Allegheny Pittsburgh from the17 context it arose in to this very different context,18 they're converting it from an equal protection case to19 something more like a contract clause case or to a20 Winstar case or something like that. And not one word￼21 in that opinion suggests that once22 certain policy, that it's trapped.23 reasonable and rational transition24 to a policy that better serves the25 JUSTICE ALITO: Is -­60a State adopts a It can't make aaway from that policy citizenry.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. CLEMENT: And if it doesn't -­JUSTICE ALITO: Is there some identified or identifiable demographic difference between the twogroups that justify theeither justifies or could on -- on a remand different treatment?MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think the one -- I there's a demographic difference. I thinkdon't thinkthe one concrete difference that really is a difference is, from the city's perspective, they're looking at two groups, all of whom are going to have to pay a new higher monthly fee.And I think they can make a rational decision that says, look, you know, one of these groups has to make two monthly payments to the city for sewer and water. That seems a little crazy. So, why arewe -- what we'll do is we'll just make everybody in the city in terms of their ongoing payments to the city for sewer and water -- we will treat them all exactly the same. One fee.Thank you, Your Honor.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stancil, you have 4 minutes remaining.REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK T. STANCIL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. STANCIL: Justice Alito, I want to just61￼1 pick up right there. What they're actually saying on2 these two monthly payments idea is that it's rational3 for somebody who's just paid $300, and now everybody4 pays an extra $10 a month -- we don't want them to have5 to make their $30 a month Barrett Law payment having6 paid $300 and the extra 10.7 My clients still have to pay the extra $10 a8 month, but we're out of pocket $9,300. I think that is9 -- I think that's patently irrational, to say that we're10 trying to help people who are out 300 bucks from having11 to pay an extra $30 a month going forward.12 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Stancil, here's what13 worries me about this case: To me, this is a case about14 transition rules. All legislation creates classes of15 citizens, and some are -- and -- and puts them all in a16 group and says you're going to be treated in the same17 way as long as this legislation exists. And then a18 legislature comes along and changes that piece of19 legislation, and different people are affected20 differently by it.21 And to me what you are suggesting is that￼22 when that break is made and23 the -- I don't know how you24 you're suggesting, which is25 class has to be treated the62when that transition occurs, would apply the rule that that everybody in the former same as a matter of1 transition policy.2 MR. STANCIL: If you've promised equal3 treatment -- and we're talking about a -- this is a -- a4 specific case. A specific commonly shared benefit among5 people who are indistinguishable on any rational basis.6 They live next door to each other; they flush into the7 same pipe; and they paid and were promised equal8 payment. In that instance, you -- then there has to be9 a rational method. You have to treat them equally when10 you transition.11 So, there may be times where the city has12 promised and committed, and there is no independent13 rational basis for distinguishing.14 It's not that -- if we15 and we want to tax blondes instead16 the fact that we're going to start17 prospectively doesn't make that okay. And, moreover,18 this isn't prospective. We're talking about an19 assessment historically imposed on the very same day for20 the very same.21 JUSTICE ALITO: But time is usually a22 rational reason for doing it. If -- suppose everybody23 paid on the installment plan. The city could say as of24 a certain date we're -- no more installment payments.25 And the people who paid up previously, would -- would63￼want to go forward of brunettes, well, doing that1 they be -- would they have an equal protection claim?2 MR. STANCIL: If we -- I'm sorry. I3 thought -­4 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose that there had never5 been the option of making the lump-sum payment.6 Everybody paid on installment plans over a 10-year7 period, and then the city decided January 1, 2012, no8 more installment plans; everything that's still due is9 forgiven. That would be rational, wouldn't it?10 MR. STANCIL: Right. Because we'd all be11 treated equally.12 Could I quickly get to the administrative13 nightmare? In -- if you go to the Cox litigation and go14 on Pacer and you pull up document number 98, you'll find15 the city's filing in the Cox case, in which they give16 the name and address and amount of -- owed to every17 taxpayer under any of these 20 other Barrett Law18 projects. This is -- I think it's -- I think it's19 ludicrous to say there's some Gordian knot that would20 have to be cut to issue refunds.21 But, more generally, I think this is part of22 the city's argument. They say, well, perfection may be23 difficult to achieve. Well, so be it. It always is;24 but that does not justify gross disparities and25 "anything goes." You may want to make a clean break and64￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425gotoanewsystem,fine.Butyouhavetodoitina way that treats the same people the same.JUSTICE BREYER: The argument isn't that it's expensive to administer as much as it is there are 1,000 people in all these projects who are already paid up. We don't have enough money to pay them all back. That's why we don't want to pay them back. At the same time, we don't want to collect the money for 30 years from these other people who aren't fully paid yet.MR. STANCIL: Well, if that's the case -­JUSTICE BREYER: The question, I guess, is, is that rational?MR. STANCIL: No, Your sending in your tax bill -- again, taxes yesterday, are you "too bad,think that's rational.And I want to get backbecause -- I can't.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:The case is submitted.Honor.
