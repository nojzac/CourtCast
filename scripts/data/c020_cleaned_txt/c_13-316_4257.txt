United States.      Mr. Russell.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELLON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. RUSSELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      This case presents the question whether tocommit Federal bank fraud, the defendant must intend todefraud a bank, or whether, as the Tenth Circuit held,it's enough that the defendant intended to defraudsomeone in order to obtain money the victim keeps in abank account.  Applying the Tenth Circuit'sinterpretation, the government has prosecuted peoplewhose only relationship to a bank is that they tricked athird party into issuing them a perfectly valid check,which the defendant then cashed at a bank.      Such a broad interpretation of the Federalbank fraud statute threatens to sweep in a gardenvariety State law crime ­­ a broad sweep of the sortthat this Court has refused to give to Federal criminalstatutes absent a clear statement of congressionalintent.  And that ­­3￼￼1 JUSTICE GINSBURG:2 words Congress used, "obtained funds owned or controlled3 by financial ­­ a financial institution by means of4 false representation."5 MR. RUSSELL: Well, the problem is there is6 an ambiguity in Subsection 2 about to whom the false7 representation must be directed. Now, I acknowledge8 that ordinarily, you would construe that silence in9 favor of breadth that ­­ in favor breadth that a false10 statement to anyone would do. But there are compelling11 reasons not to give that ambiguity, that interpretation12 in this case.13 And one is the breadth that I mentioned. It14 enabled the government to bring cases like United States15 v. Rodriguez where the government prosecuted a16 bookkeeper who filed false invoices with her employer17 that led the employer then to issue perfectly valid18 checks to people who didn't do the work.19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the20 breadth is confined ­­ given the development of the21 banking system, it may not seem as significant a22 limitation today as in years past. But, nonetheless,23 the definition of a financial institution is ­­ in24 18 U.S.C. 20 is limited to institutions with a25 particular Federal nexus. Federal Deposit Insurance,4But it fits – it fits the￼1 Federal Home Loan Bank, Small Business Investment Act.2 It isn't any financial institution, but institutions in3 which the Federal Government has a particular interest.4 MR. RUSSELL: That's true. But nonetheless,5 for precisely the reason you identified, it ­­ it covers6 an awful lot of banks. And if you read the statute ­­7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But not in this case,8 and that's where I'm having difficulty. Why is it9 illogical to think that a falsehood rendered through a10 third party that might affect a bank, a false check, as11 your client was charged with, that that would be the12 very case Congress would have wanted covered?13 MR. RUSSELL: So that's a question about, I14 think, whether intent to defraud a bank could be15 satisfied in a case like this. And I think that the16 answer to that is possibly it could. So the government,17 I think, tries to put you to a false choice between18 saying you either have to accept the Tenth Circuit's19 interpretation that sweeps in cases like United States20 v. Rodriguez, perfectly valid checks that don't21 implicate either of the core interests in a bank fraud22 case, which is protecting the bank from financial harm23 or protecting the bank from being lied to. You either24 have to accept that or you have to leave unprosecutable25 cases like this one. But that's not true.5JUSTICE SCALIA:I think on anybody's￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE ALITO: How would that ­­ how would that work? Would the jury have to be instructed about the U.C.C. and be asked to determine whether the bank or Target, in this case, would be liable for the funds if the bank had honored a forged check?MR. RUSSELL: So that gets the ­­ we have two theories. We have the theory that intent to defraud a bank is required and under that theory, the U.C.C. doesn't matter. We also argue, though, if you don't require intent to defraud a bank ­­JUSTICE ALITO: Why would it not matter?MR. RUSSELL: Because under thegovernment ­­ it doesn't matter under the government's view or ours, so ­­JUSTICE ALITO: No, under your view. Under your view that there has to be an intent to defraud a bank. Why would it not matter from ­­ who would ultimately be liable for the ­­ for the money ­­ for the amount of the check?MR. RUSSELL: Under our view, all the government has to show is that the defendant intended to deceive a bank in order to obtain property that is owned by or in the custody of a bank. So in a bank account. So a traditional altered check case ­­6￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425theory, you ­­ you have to show that ­­ that the monies,funds, credits, assets, securities or other property wasowned by or under the custody or control of thefinancial institution.MR. RUSSELL:      JUSTICE SCALIA:prove that?      MR. RUSSELL:of departure is to whom the false statement has to bedirected.JUSTICE SCALIA: But ­­ but the jury has to be instructed that the money's coming out of the bank.MR. RUSSELL: That's correct. That's correct. And so that's ­­ to the extent you think the U.C.C. is implicated in that inquiry, that ­­ that is true under either one. I don't think that it is. I think it's just going to be a question of, you know, whose money are you trying to get and is it in a bank account.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Two of the ­­ two of the six checks involved were paid by the drawing bank. Isn't that so?MR. RUSSELL: That is correct. And so ­­ but under our principal view that the problem here is that the government ­­ that the jury wasn't instructed7That's right.   Doesn't either side have toThat's correct.  So the point￼1 that Petitioner had to intend to defraud a bank as2 opposed to Target. And so it doesn't matter whether the3 checks were cashed or not. And it doesn't even matter4 under the risk of loss theory because it only has to be5 a risk of loss, not an actual loss.6 JUSTICE ALITO: I think you have a ­­ you7 have a credible textual argument, but you run into the8 problem that your interpretation makes Section ­­9 Subsection 1 surplusage. How do you get around that?10 MR. RUSSELL: I don't know that we do, but11 the Tenth Circuit's interpretation doesn't either,12 because under the Tenth Circuit's interpretation, one is13 rendered surplusage because any prosecution that could14 be brought under (1) could also be brought under (2).15 If it's enough under (2) that you intend to defraud16 someone, it's surely enough17 a bank.18 JUSTICE ALITO:19 there is certainly overlap,20 broader category or it reaches a broader category. So21 it's not useless.22 MR. RUSSELL: No, that's true. And ­­23 JUSTICE ALITO: Representation doesn't have24 to be made to the bank under (2). (2) covers those25 instances where the representation is made to somebody8that you intended to defraudWell, under the alternative,but (2) reaches a much￼1 else. (1) would be limited to those, perhaps, in which2 the representation is made to the bank. But under your3 interpretation where (2) requires that the4 representation be made to the bank, there is no point in5 having two subsections. You might as well just have6 one.7 MR. RUSSELL: Well, I have two things to say8 to that. One is Congress may have thought that what9 they were doing in (2) is making clear that the statute10 encompasses the broad range of particular kinds of11 property interests that are unique or ­­ or at least12 common in the banking context. And in that way it13 serves the same function as the second clause in the14 mail fraud statute upon which this statute is premised.15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It doesn't have the two16 subparts. But here you are essentially asking us to17 read the word "or," "(1) or (2)" to mean (1) including18 (2).19 MR. RUSSELL: Well, that's the same way that20 this Court has repeatedly read the two parallel clauses21 of the bank fraud statute. The only difference being,22 you know, the difference in hardware terms and numerals.23 But I don't think ­­24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What this Court did25 after the ­­ after ­­ or before this statute ­­ this9￼1 statute was passed before the Court's interpretation of2 the mail fraud statute.3 MR. RUSSELL: That's right.4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Every court that had5 looked at it at the time the statute was passed had6 determined there were two separate provisions. So why7 would Congress have any reason to believe they were8 passing a singular case, a singular charge?9 MR. RUSSELL: I think what Congress would10 have intended is simply that when it uses the11 identical ­­ materially identical language and structure12 in two statutes, that they would have the same meaning13 as determined by this Court.14 The interpretive principle that the15 government relies on that identically­worded statutes16 can mean very different things depending on the state of17 the circuit law at the time Congress copies the language18 is really untenable. And it requires a criminal19 defendant, for example, to know what that circuit20 precedent was and not be able to simply rely on this21 Court's decisions interpreting the identical language in22 another statute.23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's not identical24 because in the bank fraud statute, Congress broke out25 and separately numbered (1) and (2) and they didn't do10￼1 that in the mail fraud.2 MR. RUSSELL: Now, I understand that. But I3 don't think that if Congress intended this statute to4 operate dramatically different from the mail fraud5 statute, the only change it would have made was as those6 sort of typographical changes. I don't think that's the7 way Congress conveys that kind of intent.8 But again, even if you think that Subsection9 (2) creates an independent offense, it's susceptible of10 the interpretation that we give you, which avoids having11 to federalize the kinds of cases that are at issue in12 United States v. Rodriguez.13 JUSTICE KAGAN:14 led to this statute is this15 which actually seems on all16 Use of a fraudulent credit card to a merchant who then17 asks for money from the bank. Essentially the same case18 as this with a fraudulent credit card as opposed to a19 fraudulent check. So if we understand this statute as20 arising from Congress's desire to make that bank fraud,21 why should we rule for you here?22 MR. RUSSELL: Well, I guess I have to just23 dispute the premise. I think Congress was reacting to24 the rule, the principle of law that Maze adopted, which25 made it impossible to use the wire fraud statute and11One understanding of whatCourt's decision in Maze,fours with this case, right?￼1 mail fraud statute to prosecute a case even when2 somebody goes into a bank and cashes a counterfeit check3 because the then use of the mail to settle the account4 afterwards wasn't good enough. And that's what Congress5 was concerned of.6 In this Court's own decision in Maze, the7 Court noted that Congress had dealt with the specific8 factual problem in Maze through an amendment, then9 recent amendment to the Truth­in­Lending Act, which10 prohibited credit card fraud. Congress added to those11 remedies in another section of the same statute that12 enacted the bank fraud statute and then dealt with the13 parallel problem with respect to altered checks in14 Section 513, which is also part of that same statute, which15 criminalizes any use of an altered check to deceive16 anyone without regard to whose property the defendant is17 intending to obtain.18 So when you're worried about altered check19 cases here, and we need to not just be worried about20 these cases because this decision will implicate a whole host21 of other cases. But if you're thinking just about22 altered check cases, Congress dealt with altered check23 cases in Section 513. And that's important because the24 penalties under 513 and 31 ­­ and the bank fraud25 provision are very different. It's a 30­year sentence1225 JUSTICE KENNEDY:I agree with you that the￼1 for bank fraud and a 10­year sentence for a Section 513.2 And more importantly, the bank fraud statute is a3 predicate for aggravated identity theft, which imposes a4 mandatory 2­year minimum sentence that must be served5 consecutive to any other sentence.6 And so in a petty case like this, the7 difference between somebody being charged for the bank fraud8 and being charged under 513 for a first­time offender9 can be the difference between zero to 6 months and 2 to10 2 and a half years. And that gives the government11 enormous plea bargaining leverage. So you can12 understand why the government wants a broad13 interpretation here.14 But it's also equally understandable that15 Congress would have thought that cases in which16 somebody's using an altered check in a way that17 negligently or knowingly poses some risk to a bank is ­­18 warrants less punishment than when somebody directly19 targets the bank itself for deception in order to obtain20 bank property.21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why ­­ why is that? Why22 would Congress have wanted to make that difference?23 MR. RUSSELL: Well, because I think24 Congress ­­13￼1 disparity in ­­ in punishment is quite substantial.2 MR. RUSSELL: Yeah. I think that Congress3 would have thought it's more serious for somebody to4 target a bank than it is for somebody to use an altered5 check that has a risk to a bank. Because as this case6 illustrates, using an altered check doesn't necessarily7 impose a financial cost on the bank. Here Target8 intercepted most ­­ most ­­ we have a disagreement with9 the government whether it was three or four of the10 checks, but ­­ and the bank itself made ­­ discovered11 the alteration and refused to honor the check. But when12 you are intending to defraud the bank, that's ­­ the13 Congress could think that's a14 And I do think that, you know15 JUSTICE KENNEDY:16 me that this case can be distinguished from the example17 you gave in your yellow brief of the person that sells a18 magazine subscription and he gets the check and he never19 intends to deliver the magazines. In that case, the20 bank will ­­ will honor the check, I assume.21 MR. RUSSELL:22 JUSTICE KENNEY:23 MR. RUSSELL:24 JUSTICE KENNEDY:25 than this case.Yes.   And must.  And must do so.That's correct.  And so ­­    And that's quite different14much more serious thing.­­It does ­­ it does seem to￼1 MR. RUSSELL: So the question is how to get2 rid of those cases while preserving the government's3 ability to prosecute.4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you can do so, I5 suppose, through the government's proposed fallback6 position.7 MR. RUSSELL: Yes.8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: ­­ at page 40 of its brief9 which talks about a risk of loss.10 MR. RUSSELL: So there are ­­ there are11 several things wrong with the government's fallback12 position and it leads in most cases to the same result13 as intent to defraud. So in paradigmatic bank fraud14 cases, both our rule and their fallback rule permits15 prosecution.1617 is ­­18 check19 check20 shows21 about22 presented to a third party and the government's rule23 permits them to continue to prosecute those cases.24 Now, even if you agree with them that those25 kinds of cases fall within the scope of the statute,The only real difference is that their ruleis designed to permit prosecution in third­partyfraud cases like ours.  Because if it's an alteredthat's presented to the bank, we acknowledge thatintent to defraud the bank.  So we're only talkingcases like ours where an altered check is15￼1 that ­­ all you need to do then is to say, look, those2 cases aren't materially different than when you submit3 the check to the bank in the first place, that the4 altered check shows intent to defraud the bank in5 third­party cases just like it does in a first­party6 case. Now, we think that they're wrong about whether or7 not these kinds of cases are covered. And if we're8 right about that, then there's obviously no reason to9 adopt, you know, a rule that they made up just to deal10 with those kinds of cases.11 And maybe I could turn to that argument just12 for a second.13 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, could I ask you this14 question? Suppose the defendant testifies and suppose15 the jury believes the defendant. The defendant16 testifies as follows: I never intended to defraud the17 bank. I knew that the cashiers at this particular18 retail establishment were incredibly careful ­­ careless19 and so I got these checks and they were made out to my20 neighbor John Doe. I stole them from his mailbox. I21 crossed out his name and I wrote in the name of the22 retail establishment and I knew these cashiers were so23 careless that they would honor the check. However, I24 never thought any bank would do that. So I didn't25 intend to defraud the bank. I intended to defraud the16￼1 retail establishment.2 Now, under your theory that ­­ that if the3 jury believed that, the person would not be guilty of4 the offense.5 MR. RUSSELL: That's right. And I don't6 think that those cases are covered for an additional7 reason as well. And that is, the fraud there is not8 intended to obtain bank property. Under Subsection (2),9 it's not any fraud that implicates bank property. The10 object of the fraud must be to obtain the property that11 is owned by or in the custody or control of the ­­ of12 the bank.13 And in a case like this, what my client14 obtained was DVD players and groceries and a printer,15 and those were not property owned by or in the custody16 or control of the bank.17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why doesn't that18 principle cover most of the cases you're worried about?19 MR. RUSSELL: Well, it doesn't cover the20 cases like Rodriguez, because the government can argue21 there that ­­ so, I don't know if I've finished the22 description of Rodriguez, but in that case, a bookkeeper23 submitted false invoices to her employer. The employer24 issued valid checks to a third party, who then cashed25 it. And the government can say in a case like that,17￼1 cashing the check results in you obtaining money in the2 custody or control of the bank. That's what you get in3 exchange for the check. And you obtained it by means of4 a false statement to someone, i.e., the false invoice5 submitted to the employer. And so it doesn't ­­6 adopting our view of what bank property is doesn't7 completely eliminate the8 case. But it doesn't ­­9 JUSTICE SCALIA:problem.  We would win the    Why ­­ why wouldn't yourwin this case?10 view have enabled you to11 MR. RUSSELL:12 mean, we've brought a sufficiency of the evidence13 challenge with respect to14 is. And the jury ­­15 JUSTICE SCALIA:16 wrong, there's a lot less17 eye.18 MR. RUSSELL:19 end of this case. It doesn't resolve the circuit20 conflict, which there is still a circuit conflict about21 whether intent to defraud a bank is required in cases22 not involving this circumstance of a third party.23 But we do think that you shouldn't believe24 that just because ­­ if you agree with the government25 that third­party altered check cases fall within the18It would ­­ it should have.  Iwhether ­­ whose property this   So if we think that wasto this case than meets theThere is ­­ that could be the￼1 scope of the statute, that's not a reason to forego2 requiring the government to prove intent to defraud the3 bank. It's just a reason to say that, as a number of4 circuits have, that use of that altered check shows5 intent to defraud a bank.6 The government has been able to prosecute7 altered check cases, including altered third­party8 check ­­ altered check cases to third parties, in9 circuits that require intent to defraud the bank.10 The other thing that's wrong ­­11 JUSTICE KAGAN:12 that? Why would presenting13 party constitute sufficient14 defraud a bank?15 MR. RUSSELL: Well, I think the theory is16 that the use of an altered check shows intent to deceive17 the bank. And then these courts simply view obtaining18 the property of a third party using that check as19 materially identical to obtaining that property directly20 from a bank, I think is the theory.21 JUSTICE ALITO: Usually there won't be22 evidence, direct evidence of the defendant's intent. So23 the defendant's intent will be inferred from objective24 evidence ­­ will be inferred from other evidence, and25 then you will get into the question of whether the19What's the theory behindan altered check to a thirdevidence of intent to￼1 retailer who initially accepts the check or the bank is2 ultimately going to be liable for the amount of that3 check. If you're ­­ if you're in a situation in which4 the ­­ the retailer is going to be liable, that ­­ maybe5 that supports the ­­ the inference that the defendant6 never intended to defraud the bank. If you're in a7 situation where the bank is going to be liable, it8 supports the inference that the defendant intended to9 defraud the bank.10 So won't you get into this somewhat11 complicated UCC question about who is ultimately going12 to be liable for the amount? I think that's a problem13 with your argument, but maybe there's an answer to it.14 MR. RUSSELL: Well, I think that there is15 and maybe I'm not explaining it very well. So there's16 two pieces of intent to defraud the bank. There's17 intent to deceive the bank and intent thereby to obtain18 bank property. With respect to intent to deceive the19 bank, I think the courts have uniformly found in ­­ in20 cases, at least first party cases, that use of an21 altered check is sufficient evidence to show that you22 intend to deceive the bank. And when you intend ­­23 whether you intend to deceive the bank, it doesn't24 matter who's going to end up bearing the cost at the25 end. It's just a question ­­201 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      JUSTICE SCALIA:U.C.C. question arise anyway under the requirement thatyou have to ­­ you have to obtain bank property?MR.

RUSSELL: It ­­ it potentially could if you're willing to say that somebody who obtains property from Target potentially is obtaining bank property because of reasons relating to the U.C.C. We don't think you even need to go that far. We think it's sufficient to say that in these third­party cases, what you're obtaining is the property of somebody else. And that doesn't mean that it's not a crime, and it doesn't even mean that it's not a Federal crime. It simply means it's a Section 513 crime.JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that. But ­­ but if you accept the government's view ­­MR. RUSSELL: Yes.JUSTICE SCALIA: ­­ of how these third­party cases ought to ­­ ought to be resolved, you have to get into the U.C.C., don't you.MR. RUSSELL: I don't know. I mean, maybe21￼Doesn't ­­ doesn't that￼1 they can ­­ they're the better people to answer that2 question for you. But I think that, at least to finish3 the answer to Justice Alito, use of an altered check4 which says ­­ when you've written, you know, your name5 on the check rather than the person who authored it, is6 an attempt to deceive a bank. We don't disagree with7 that.8 And so then the question in these9 third­party cases is: Are you attempting to obtain10 property of the bank? And we don't think that the11 U.C.C. comes into that. It's just a simple common sense12 thing that a DVD player on Target's shelves is not13 property owned by or in the custody or control of a14 bank. And so ­­15 JUSTICE BREYER: How does it work ­­ how16 does it work if you have Mr. Crook, Mr. Crook has a bank17 account at Bank of America, he has $32 in it. He writes18 a check for 5,000. He sees somebody on the street whom19 he vaguely knows and says, here, take my check; go to20 the bank; give me $200 or give me 1,000. Now, he's got21 the money from Mr. Smith. He didn't obtain money from22 the bank. It was Mr. Smith who did or did not go into23 the bank to get the money. Does that fall within the24 statute?25 MR. RUSSELL: No. I mean, what that is is a22￼1 typical bad check case. It's the equivalent ­­2 JUSTICE BREYER: So this doesn’t fall within the3 statute at all. In fact ­­ in other words, have we got4 some cases on that?5 MR. RUSSELL: We don't have this Court's6 cases. I mean ­­7 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. This is not good,8 but I mean, you know, what you tried ­­ you didn't get9 the money from the bank. What you did was just write a10 false check, knowing that in all likelihood the guy you11 give the check to is going to go right to the bank and12 get the money. Now, I just wonder is there some13 authority as to whether that falls within these statutes14 or not.15 MR. RUSSELL: So the government has brought16 those kinds of not­sufficient­funds cases. Ordinarily,17 it goes down somewhat differently, that you've presented18 the check that you know is going to bounce to a19 merchant, not to some guy in the street. And the20 government's theory is that thereby you're obtaining21 bank property. But most of the cases say that that's22 not actually bank fraud because you're not intending to23 deceive a bank. And that's perfectly fine.24 JUSTICE BREYER: It wouldn't matter. Look,25 I don't think you have to ­­ when you say "intend,"23￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425"intend" can encompass a known but undesired consequenceof an intentional act.  And so you may not care ­­ youcouldn't care less when the money comes from the bank ornot, but you know that the bank is likely to pay it.MR. RUSSELL: But ­­JUSTICE BREYER: So therefore, you have the requisite intent. But what I'm trying to figure out here is what's the case law on what should be a very common situation. If you give it to a third party, your fake check, insufficient funds. You just want the money from the third party. But you know the bank is likely to honor it.MR. RUSSELL: Well, if ­­ if I can quibble with that last piece of the sentence. Ordinarily, if you give a check that goes to a bank and there's not sufficient funds, they bounce the check.

But in United States v.13 Williams, this Court said we should go to great lengths14 to avoid interpreting a Federal criminal statute to15 criminalize Federally every insufficient funds check16 case.17 JUSTICE BREYER: You come back to those18 general statements, you do have the language of the19 statutes which favors you this question. But I guess20 the theory would simply be where Mr. Crook gives him a21 bad check, to Mr. Smith, he couldn't care less whether22 Smith presents it to the bank, and he, as far as he's23 fairly sophisticated, thinks probably Smith won't24 present it to the bank. He may to an insurance company25 or something and, therefore, he did not either obtain or26￼1 try to obtain or believe he would obtain money from the2 bank.3 MR. RUSSELL: That's right.4 JUSTICE BREYER: Whether it's money that the5 bank itself owns or whether it's money of which the bank6 has custody. That would seem to me the simplest theory.7 And I wonder, is that what courts have said?8 MR. RUSSELL: I think what courts have said9 is that those kinds of schemes are directed at10 victimizing the third party, not a bank, and that leaves11 to the States their traditional authority to prosecute12 bad check cases, which I don't think should be13 troublesome.14 If I could reserve the remainder of my15 time.16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.17 Mr. Yang.18 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG19 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT20 MR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it21 please the Court:22 Congress drafted Section 1344 with two23 separate clauses, each of which serves a distinct24 function. The first clause targets schemes to defraud a25 bank. That requires intent that the scheme have the27￼1 purpose of defrauding a bank.2 Clause (2) ­­ and this is at page 5a of the3 government's brief, you can see the structural4 difference quite plainly. Clause (2) targets schemes to5 obtain property that's either owned by or under the6 custody or control of a bank. And Congress enacted7 these broad disjunctive clauses in response to this8 Court's decision in Maze as well as in Williams, which9 had curtailed the Government's ability to prosecute10 precisely these types of fraud.11 JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Yang, your12 interpretation of the statute goes far beyond Maze.13 Maze was something with a fraudulent credit card or14 forged check or something like that, but if I understand15 your interpretation of the statute, you know, if I sell16 a painting to somebody and I represent it to be by a17 famous artist and in fact I've just made it in my18 kitchen, and that person pays me with a check and it's a19 perfectly valid check, it's a good check, the fraud is20 obviously as to the person who's just bought the21 painting. It has nothing to do with the bank. But your22 interpretation would cover that case as well.23 MR. YANG: That is correct. Our24 understanding of the text, and the reason why that is25 the case is because Congress specified in clause (2)28￼1 that the scheme to obtain money or property from the2 bank has to be by means of a false or fraudulent3 pretense, but it doesn't specify to whom that false or4 fraudulent pretense must be made.5 Now, we understand that that sweeps in6 broader than what Maze ­­7 JUSTICE KAGAN: And it's just a little bit8 peculiar, right? I mean, if somebody pays me in cash,9 the government can't prosecute the person. If somebody10 pulls out a check, the government can, but that doesn't11 seem to make a whole lot of sense in terms of what the12 statute is about.13 MR. YANG: Well, we think that the text14 suggests that what Congress was doing was enacting a15 broad prophylactic, because what Congress was16 addressing, remember, were situations where this Court17 had construed narrowly statutes which addressed18 situations like this where banks were the inherent19 second­line victims, and so what Congress wanted to20 avoid is ­­21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But here the bank is not22 the victim. That's the whole point. In these con23 ­artist cases, the bank is incidental and ­­24 MR. YANG: That's exactly right. That's why25 Congress was not intending specifically to get those,29￼1 but enacted a broader statute so we wouldn't have2 debates about this. Look at the debate that we're3 having in this case. I think everyone can agree that4 the banks are, just like the banks in Maze, they're5 second­line victims. There's an order to the bank.6 It's a check. A check is simply an order to the bank to7 pay a specified sum ­­8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in Justice Kagan's9 hypothetical, the bank didn't have to refund the money.10 And we could sit around here all day with examples, but11 suppose you have a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee12 and he inflates the cost. This would be ­­ to the13 owner. This would be a violation of the statute. This14 is a sweeping interpretation you're offering us.15 MR. YANG: We think that that is the16 interpretation reflected in the text, for the following17 reason. Although it doesn't fall within the core of18 what Congress was trying to protect, it avoids the19 problems, the kind of debate that we're having here20 about situations that do fall within the core, because21 remember, now we're talking about, Petitioner says,22 well, you know, it wasn't sufficiently targeted, He23 didn't really victimize or harm the bank. Congress was24 trying to get away from that type of inquiry. And they25 said, look, if the scheme has the intent of obtaining30￼1 property either owned by or in the custody or control of2 the bank, so that means it can either be controlled by3 the bank, its own property or custody, property it's4 holding, or it's in the custody or control of others,5 but it's owned by the bank, a very broad coverage. And6 if you try to obtain that property by means of false or7 fraudulent pretenses, we avoid this kind of discussion8 about were you sufficiently targeting, do you really9 intend to ­­10 JUSTICE SCALIA: You do indeed, but you11 extend Federal law enormously into the kind of stuff12 that we've usually left to the States.13 MR. YANG: I'm not sure that that's actually14 true. It's a very strange federalism argument the15 Petitioner is making. The Petitioner is saying, my16 conduct is a Federal crime. It's a Federal crime under17 this. It could be a Federal crime under that. It's18 just not a FEDERAL crime under the bank fraud statute.19 That is a very strange federalism argument because20 Congress has already put its hands all over the subject.21 And what Congress is trying to do here was to respond to22 cases like Maze by enacting a broad statute. Congress23 couldn't ­­24 JUSTICE BREYER: If I have it right, I just25 want to be sure, in my Crook case, which you may or may31￼1 not remember, you're reading the word "obtained" to mean2 whoever knowingly executes a scheme or artifice to3 obtain. It doesn't mean for him to obtain. It means4 for anybody to obtain. That's how you read it.5 MR.

First, as the Court explained inNeder, the gravamen of this statute, just like the33￼1 gravamen of the mail fraud or the wire fraud is not the2 particular acts or that the particular acts are done3 well or have any likelihood of success. It is the4 scheme. And so therefore questions about reliance ­­5 the bank doesn't have to believe it or rely on it;6 damages that result don't have to rely. This is a7 scheme. It is criminalizing the scheme to obtain ­­8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what do you do with9 the case, the second part of the hypothetical that10 Justice Breyer didn't repeat where the person knows the11 bank is not going to pay a cent because there's no money12 in this account.13 MR. YANG: I think that ­­14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so there is no part15 of the scheme to obtain funds from the bank because they16 know that the bank won't pay it.17 MR. YANG: Well, they may ­­ they may18 suspect that the bank may not pay it. Banks sometimes19 in fact do pay checks on insufficient funds. Banks have20 only 24 hours after receipt of a check to dishonor it or21 not and if they don't then they are stuck in the UCC and22 have to bring lawsuits. I mean the practical impact of23 this type of situation is significant.

So he does not care about banks.  He doesn'tknow how they work.  He has no idea if they pay or don'tpay.  What's the result?MR. YANG: I think it would be very hard for the government to prove that your inept bank ­­thief had a scheme to obtain money or property from the bank, but the government might be able to prove it circumstantially because, just as Justice Alito explained, you rarely have insight into the heart of hearts of criminals. You need to have circumstantial evidence.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In what case, what Federal statute criminalizes a con game?JUSTICE SCALIA: Criminalizes what? I didn't ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: A con game. What Federal statute ­­ 513 criminalizes altering checks, but what other Federal statute makes it a Federal crime to engage in a con game without a check?MR.

YANG: Well, the answer is that Congress7 has addressed false statements, schemes to defraud,8 schemes to obtain money or property through all kinds of9 various statutes, mail fraud, wire fraud, false10 statements, bank fraud. It just is done so in11 particular areas where there is a Federal interest12 implicated. And it ­­ actually, those areas are quite13 sweeping and bank fraud ­­14 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that would be one of15 them, if you ­­ if you accept a check, right? If ­­ if16 you promise to paint the house, you have no intention of17 doing it, so it's fraud, and ­­ and you accept the18 check. That's it. You're under the statute, right?19 MR. YANG: The government would have to20 prove that the scheme was intended to obtain money or21 property from the bank. If that was shown, and it was22 shown that that was ­­23 JUSTICE KAGAN: And what does that mean,24 Mr. Yang? I mean, it could mean that the ­­ that the25 defendant intends that the money come from the bank, or36￼1 you could mean that the defendant intends to obtain2 money which he knows may or is reasonably likely to or3 is foreseeable to come from the bank. Which do you4 mean?5 MR. YANG: I think we kind of mean both.6 And let me explain why. As Justice Alito, I think, kind7 of alluded to, as a practical matter, the way you prove8 these cases is you prove that a defendant generally9 intends the natural consequences of his or her acts.10 And so if, for instance, you have a case like this where11 you have a fraudulent check which is directed to a bank,12 it says, bank, pay the payee this sum of money, that the13 defendant is going to intend, when they tendered that to14 the ­­ to the merchant, that that check is going to be15 sent to the bank and that the bank is going to ­­ you16 know, has a reasonable chance of paying it.17 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I think this does go18 back to Justice Alito's question, because the person can19 say ­­ the defendant here could have said, I really20 don't care whether the bank ends up paying Target. I21 don't know whether the bank will end up paying Target.22 I don't know how these things work and how often the23 bank honors it and how often the bank doesn't honor it.24 And I really could not care less as long as I get my25 money from Target.37￼1 MR. YANG: Right. But in our legal system,2 I don't think it's ­­ let me give you another example.3 Let's say you want to kill somebody and you put a car ­­4 a bomb in their car. All right? And there are two5 people in the car. You see the target go in and you see6 someone else go in, and you detonate the bomb. You7 can't say I was really indifferent about the second8 person being there.9 JUSTICE KAGAN: No, but ­­ so you're saying10 that my person ­­ forget the other examples. I mean,11 you're saying that this person who could not care less12 if the money comes from the bank and actually thinks13 that the money may not come from the bank because it's14 quite likely that the bank is not going to honor this,15 you think, nonetheless, that that person has intended to16 obtain bank property?17 MR. YANG: Has ­­ yes, by the virtue of the18 scheme. The scheme used ­­19 JUSTICE SCALIA: But wait. I thought ­­ I20 thought you said earlier, and ­­ and I was going to ask21 you about that, that he does not have to personally22 receive bank property.23 MR.

YANG: Not whenever a check is involved.￼1 where the money doesn't come from a bank.2 MR. YANG: Well, in the check context, I3 think there is none. I mean, what you have, if you're4 obtaining that check in order to get the money from ­­5 or property from the bank, I think it would fall within.6 And again, we understand this is a broad reading. We ­­7 we own ­­ own up with ­­ for that.8 JUSTICE KAGAN: Can I just make sure I ­­ I9 understand your ­­ your answer to my question. Suppose10 that this defendant did not return the merchandise for11 cash. In other words, suppose he just wanted an Xbox12 and he did the exact same thing. So he never himself13 wanted cash and, again, could not have cared at all14 whether the bank was going to give the vendor cash.15 Still, you would say that person intended to obtain bank16 property?17 MR. YANG: By virtue ­­ yes, we would say18 that by virtue of the scheme ­­ remember, he's not just19 walking in and saying, you know, I'll pay you tomorrow20 if you give me a hamburger today. The ­­ he's going in21 with a check. A check is ­­ everyone knows what a check22 is. It is an order to a bank to pay money. He's giving23 it to the ­­ to the bank or to the merchant ­­24 JUSTICE SCALIA: But he's ­­ he's not25 obtaining the bank's money. You ­­ you read to40￼1 obtain ­­ a scheme or artifice to obtain, you read that2 for anybody to obtain. I would read it to mean for him3 to obtain. But that's not how you read it. And you say4 that's ­­ everybody reads it the way you do?5 MR. YANG: Well, this ­­ this Court has long6 recognized that the word "obtain" not only means that7 you obtain it for yourself, but you can obtain something8 by directing the transfer of ­­ of property to someone9 else. And that's exactly what a check does. You are10 directing the ­­11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Yang, before you12 finish, Mr. Russell pointed out ­­ and I think Justice13 Sotomayor ­­ that there is Section 513. It deals14 with ­­ expressly with altered checks, but the penalty15 is much, much less. Is everything that is covered by16 513 covered by 1344, too?17 MR. YANG: Well, I think the answer is that18 has not been decided. And let me just explain in ­­ in19 a few ways. One, Section 513 deals with securities,20 which includes checks of States or organizations, and21 then it defines organizations. There is a substantial22 question whether that applies to personal checks. One23 court of appeals has said it has. The Department of24 Justice's Criminal Resource Manual says it does not25 apply to personal checks.41￼1 So there is a real question about whether2 this Section 513 would apply. But even if it were to3 apply, it applies to protect the integrity of certain4 writings. It is a different provision than a5 scheme­based provision like Section 1344, which more6 broadly prohibits types of schemes to obtain money or7 property from banks.8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And is it ­­ is it true9 that there's a 2­year mandatory minimum?10 MR. YANG: Not for bank fraud. There is11 aggravated identity theft for which ­­12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under this statute, is13 there ­­ is there a mandatory minimum?14 MR. YANG: No. Well, this ­­ this statute,15 the bank fraud statute has a punishment of up to 3016 years to reflect that frauds come in various sizes.17 It's not a mandatory minimum. It's just a maximum. And18 in this case, the defendant actually got 1 year for this19 bank fraud. He got a ­­ a stacked sentence of 2 years20 for identity theft, which is separate from this21 provision.22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Yang, if we are23 concerned about federalizing every case involving a24 check, okay, you ­­ your brief does give us an25 alternative.421 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. YANG: Yes.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: My problem is, I can't locate that alternative in the language of the statute.MR. YANG: Well, I think ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So are you asking us just to make it up? Or if not, how do we reach it?MR. YANG: We're not asking you actuallyto ­­ to make that interpretation. It would be if the Court concludes that our first interpretation is somehow problematic, then we think that that is a superior reading than Petitioner's for the following reason: Congress addressed ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, no. Please answer, how do we get to your reading from the text of the statute.MR. YANG: I will. The way you get there is that Congress, in Clause 2, again, remember, specifies you have intent to obtain money or property from a bank by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises. It does leave silent to whom those false or fraudulent representations must be made.      Now, if you look at the legislative history,it's very clear that Congress was at least concernedwith situations like Maze where a bank would be a victim43￼18 we have a duty to save19 sensible amendment?20 MR. YANG:21 JUSTICE KENNEDY:22 do you ­­ what case do23 your alternate ­­ your24 MR. YANG:poorly drawn statutes by aNo.  No, I don't think we ­­       I mean, what ­­ what caseyou want me to cite if I adoptfallback position?I don't think we are relying on￼1 of a fraud. And those ­­ and Maze involved a situation2 precisely like what we have here, where the reason that3 the bank is a secondary victim is because that false4 signature, the false charge slip ­­5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So far I'm with you, but6 you haven't answered my question.7 MR. YANG: But the way it is in that8 context, the reason that the bank is the victim of the9 scheme is because the fraudulent method is actually10 transferred to the bank as an inherent part of the11 scheme itself. And so ­­12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I ­­ I agree that that13 interpretation substantially narrows the statute because14 the altered check, the bank is going to be certainly at15 risk of loss. If ­­ if we were to agree with that16 suggestion and were inclined to read the statute that17 way, is there a case that you can cite to us that says25 the idea that the ­­ what the Court is ­­ would be doing44￼1 is construing the statute in light of, presumably, some2 good reason to reject what we think is what the statute3 normally says.4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why don't you try the rule5 of lenity. Why don’t you try the rule of lenity?6 MR. YANG: We think that the rule of lenity7 doesn't apply for the reasons that we said on our8 broader argument. If the Court rejects that, that might9 be a reason but, again, it's construing the term10 "means."11 JUSTICE KENNEDY:12 provide a precedent for us to13 interpretation, your fallback14 MR. YANG: I think just in any context where15 you might have constitutional doubt, the Court16 sometimes, you know, construes a statute in a way that17 it might not otherwise do.18 And here what we're giving you the hook for19 this is that the means specified leaves open to whom20 that false or fraudulent communication must be directed.21 You could read, in light of the history and in light of22 what Congress's main intent was here, to read the23 statute as saying, ah, Congress actually in clause 2 was24 concerned with the specific type of means, that is the25 means that are directed to the bank.45Does the rule of lenityadopt the narrowingposition?￼1 And the reason I think this is far superior2 than what Petitioner suggests is because we are at least3 construing silence in the statute. Congress4 specifically addressed intent already in clause 1, that5 is intent to defraud a bank, which is what Petitioner6 says clause 2 does. But clause 2 says there's intent to7 obtain money or property from the bank. There's no8 reason to run over Congress's choice about what types of9 schemes have to be intended in order to achieve this10 result. Again, this is our fallback position ­­11 JUSTICE SCALIA: If ­­ if we adopt your12 fallback position, does (2) do anything that (1) doesn't13 do? I mean, if you made ­­ if you made your false or14 fraudulent representations to the bank, surely you15 intend to defraud the bank.16 MR. YANG: Both clauses, actually, under our17 fallback or our main position cover things that the18 others will not. And I'll give you two examples. On19 clause 1, clause 1 covers what's called bare check20 kiting, where you write a check, it hasn't sufficient21 funds, you withdraw the money, then you write another22 check to cover it and another check and you play the23 float. Nine courts of appeals have addressed this24 question. All of them have concluded that it falls25 under clause 1. Six of them have concluded it doesn't46￼1 fall under clause 2, and the additional three court of2 appeals that have criminal jurisdiction in either3 unpublished or in dictum have suggested agreement.4 So it's pretty well established check kiting5 falls under (1), not (2).6 With respect to (2), it covers schemes like7 this, where you can argue maybe you didn't intend to8 defraud the bank itself, but you used false or9 fraudulent means that would inherently go to the bank10 because of the nature of the means themselves. Here11 where you direct a check, it's a financial instrument.12 It is ordering a bank to pay money. It goes to the13 bank, and one normally intends the natural consequences14 of their acts. It goes to the bank in the ordinary15 course.16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which part of the17 statute are you interpreting with this limiting18 principle, the "obtain" part?19 MR. YANG: "By means of."20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: "By means of."21 MR. YANG: By means of the false or22 fraudulent pretenses in this, understanding these false23 or fraudulent pretenses to be ones which are directed to24 the bank as an inherent consequence of the scheme25 itself.47￼1 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Yang, your first order2 argument, which is, you know, the natural way one would3 read a statute that says "(1) or (2)," is to interpret4 it as meaning two different things.5 MR. YANG: Yes.6 JUSTICE KAGAN:7 it differently from the way we read the exact same8 words, without the numbers, but the exact same words in9 McNally. And we know that Congress wanted the bank10 fraud statutes to mirror the mail and wire fraud11 statutes. So we end up with this ­­ you know, if we ­­12 if we go with your friend over there, we read a statute13 in a way we wouldn't normally. But if we go with you,14 we have to read these two statutes that say the same15 thing and that we know Congress meant to say the same16 thing differently.17 MR. YANG: Right. And I think that there18 are very sound reasons for doing that and I'll explain19 why. First, when you look at the statute, Section 1344,20 this is on page 5A in the bank frauds ­­ or the mail21 fraud statute is 1341 on 2A, they are quite different.22 I mean, even when we just look at the statutory23 structure alone, Congress broke these clauses up, put24 them on different lines, numbered them, indented them25 equally. One would not naturally say you have the48But that requires us to read5 differences in spacing6 difference in meaning,7 MR. YANG:8 certainly true that Congress modeled the bank fraud9 statute on the mail fraud statute. But that doesn't￼1 option of one, Option A, or two, Option B ­­2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I take your point that3 the words on the page look very good for you. But we4 also know that Congress didn't intend for thoseand numerology to have adon't we?No, no.  Congress modeled ­­ it's10 mean that Congress wanted the two statutes to be11 coterminous. In fact, Congress not only expressed its12 understanding that these were disjunctive for the13 various structural reasons, which I think are14 inescapable from the text. But also Congress modified15 the text itself. Congress didn't simply say a scheme to16 defraud. It requires a scheme to defraud a financial17 institution. Congress did not say a scheme to obtain18 money or property. It specified that it's not only19 property of the bank, owned by the bank; it is property20 under the bank's custody that the bank doesn't own and21 bank ­­ property that the bank owns, but is not even22 under its custody or control, it's under the custody or23 control of others.24 This is a different statute, of course25 modeled on the mail fraud statute, but it's different.4925 JUSTICE GINSBURG:Is the government still￼1 And Congress I don't think in 1984 could have been more2 clear about its intent to make these two provisions,3 that is the intent to defraud and the intent to obtain4 provisions, distinct based on the choices that it made5 in text.6 It's just, I think, impossible to read the7 text and come away with the conclusion that in 1984 what8 Congress intended, regardless of what happened in the9 mail fraud statute in 1987, that Congress intended that,10 or notwithstanding the only reading of "or" in this11 context that makes any textual sense, since it's not12 even defended in the textual argument on the other side,13 that Congress meant that "or" in that structure to mean14 anything but "or." That is, a disjunctive, two separate15 clauses having independent meaning.16 And in fact, it would be anomalous to do so17 because Section (2) covers, for instance, bank­owned18 property that's not under the custody or the control of19 the bank. So why would you intend to defraud the bank20 when you're trying to really get it from the custodian21 of the bank's property? The idea would be that the22 means obtained, at the very least, would probably be23 directed to the custodian of the property, not ­­ which24 is not always the bank under clause 2.50￼1 taking the position that it took in the district court,2 that 1344(1) also covers this case?3 MR. YANG: Well, we disagree with the court4 of appeals precedent which says you need a risk of loss5 under clause 1. But the government acquiesced to the6 district court's narrowing of this to clause 2.7 JUSTICE ALITO: Along those lines, if we8 were to agree that under sub (2) it was necessary to9 show an intent to defraud the bank, what would the10 government have to prove in an altered check case?11 MR. YANG: Well, I guess you've ­­12 JUSTICE ALITO: Or what would you have had13 to prove under sub (1) if this case could properly be14 prosecuted under sub (1)?15 MR. YANG: Well, you'd have to show that the16 scheme was actually intended to obtain, to deceive the17 bank, as well as obtain its property, as opposed to a ­­18 and that intent difference can be significant in cases.19 What we will have to show in here ­­20 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how can that intent21 difference be significant? I mean, I would have thought22 that you would said the same proof that goes to whether23 you intend to obtain bank property, even though you're24 presenting this check only to a third party, and the25 check may or may not be honored by the bank. You could51￼1 say the exact same thing about whether you intend to2 defraud the bank.3 MR. YANG: We certainly would probably rely4 on the same types of evidence. We would then have the5 additional burden of having to show that the intent was6 to deceive the bank specifically.7 JUSTICE ALITO: What I'm getting at is would8 this require delving into the defendant's knowledge of9 the legal relationship between the merchant here and the10 bank?11 MR. YANG: I think it inevitable is going to12 come to that, and you're going to throw to juries these13 questions of, like, you know, despite the fact that the14 defendant has used a check, did the defendant really15 know what a check was or did the defendant ­­ what is a16 check ­­17 JUSTICE KAGAN: But why isn't that the18 same under the intent to obtain bank property? Where19 you also, the defendant, might say: No, I really didn't20 intend to obtain property, because I didn't really know21 whether the bank would honor the check and, in fact, I22 thought it wouldn't.23 MR. YANG: Well, the scheme would be to24 obtain. You don't have to necessarily show that the25 specific means that you were using were intended to52￼1 deceive the bank, because that requires a lot more2 inquiry ­­3 JUSTICE KAGAN: But even on the obtain4 property wing, it's obtain property from the bank, isn't5 it?6 MR. YANG: Not obtain property from the7 bank. It is obtain property that is ­­8 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, in the custody of the9 bank?10 MR. YANG: It doesn't have to be in the11 custody of the bank. It can be bank­owned property in12 the custody of others. So, for instance, banks have a13 lot of assets. For instance, they can foreclose on14 houses and such. In those contexts, you might have15 someone who is scheming to obtain bank property by16 directing their fraud to a third party to whom the bank17 has entrusted their assets.18 JUSTICE KAGAN: No, but in a case like this,19 wouldn't the difficulties of proof be the same? The20 person ­­ whether you charge somebody with trying to21 defraud the bank or with trying to obtain property owned22 by or in the custody of the bank. If Justice Alito is23 right as to the one, that all these questions about the24 relationship between a bank and a retailer are going to25 come in, isn't he also right as to the other?53￼1 MR. YANG: I'm not quite ­­ I don't think2 that's quite right. And the reason is that whenever you3 have to show an additional intent requirement, it ups4 the ante. Just like in homicide, you have various5 gradations of a homicide including up to murder. When6 you have an additional ­­7 JUSTICE ALITO: Doesn't the answer depend on8 from whom ­­ for whom the money, either owned or9 under ­­ in the custody of the bank has to be obtained?10 If it ­­ if it doesn't have to be obtained by the11 defendant, then it wouldn't seem to me that there would12 be much of a question. Because even if the only thing13 that the defendant obtains from the merchant is an Xbox,14 if the ­­ if the check is honored, it is going to be15 obtained by the merchant. Somebody is going to be16 obtaining money from the bank if the check is ultimately17 honored.18 MR. YANG: May I just ­­ I would just19 qualify that by saying that the defendant is obtaining20 the money. It's obtaining it through the check to be21 paid to the merchant. That's ­­22 JUSTICE ALITO: Right. The ultimate ­­23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me.

Banks suffer about a billion dollars in check fraud a year. There are $10 billion that banks put into check fraud prevention. There are so many checks that fly through, including the checks here. If you look at the checks here, the ones that he got caught for, not the ones that he might have washed and dried, weren't artfully done. But some still go through. And the transaction costs that it imposes on the financial system is something that Congress could have been concerned with. In fact, we think it was.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Russell.55And if it's a scheme￼1 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL2 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER3 MR. RUSSELL: Thank you. Congress was4 concerned about the ­­ the risks to banks of altered5 checks, but it dealt with that in Section 513, not6 Section 1344.7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Yang said it8 wasn't ­­ wasn't ­­ the scope of 513 wasn't clear.9 MR. RUSSELL: I don't think that that's10 correct. I mean, we cited a case in our brief in which11 the government actually succeeded in prosecuting someone12 for an altered check under Section 513. I don't13 understand the argument that checks aren't encompassed14 within 513. We've reproduced the language at 10­A of15 the blue brief. And what it says is that it16 criminalizes the use of a forged security. And it17 defines "forged" to mean altered. It defines "security"18 to mean check. And then it has to be a forged security19 of an organization. And it defines "organization" to20 mean any legal entity other than a government21 established or organized for any purpose and includes22 any corporation, company, association, firm, et cetera.23 I just don't understand what the argument is24 that Section 513 doesn't cover some species of altered25 checks. But at the very least, if you thought that56￼1 Congress must have intended to Federally criminalize use2 of all altered checks, it's an easier interpretation to3 say that 513 covers it than the bank fraud statute.4 The government's argument here today makes5 utterly clear how broad the Federal bank fraud statute6 will be if you adopt their interpretation. They're7 going ­­ it encompasses the fake Renoir example and all8 of the ones in our briefs and it includes every9 not­sufficient­funds case. And ­­ and the government10 acknowledges ­­11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you please tell me12 why ­­ what your objections are to the "by means of13 limiting principle" the government gives as an14 alternative?15 MR. RUSSELL: So there's ­­ there's several16 objections. One is the one that you raised. There's no17 basis for it in the text. It is a limitation on what18 the ­­ the statute says. Any false representation, then19 they say no, only those false representations that would20 foreseeably go to a bank and might fool them into paying21 a check.22 Second, it doesn't do any useful work23 because all it does is ­­ the only difference between24 their fallback position and intent to defraud a bank is25 two things. One is it permits them to bring cases in57￼1 these third­party altered check cases, and we've argued2 we don't think that those fall under the statute anyway.3 But even if you think that they do, the much4 easier thing to say is they fall under the statute.5 Intent to require ­­ you know, defraud a bank is6 required, but the use of the altered check is sufficient7 evidence.8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think it does a9 lot of work because it ­­ it takes out of the equation10 schemes to defraud where the bank is not going to be11 liable.12 MR. RUSSELL: Right. I'm ­­ I'm saying it13 doesn't do any work that intent to defraud a bank14 doesn't already do. So if you're choosing between our15 test and their test, both tests allow prosecutions of16 paradigmatic fraud cases. Both cases, both tests17 eliminate the Renoir example. But their test permits ­­18 the only difference, practical difference, is their case19 facilitates prosecution in these third­party cases that20 we don't think are covered by the statute anyway, but21 even if there are, you don't have to adopt this extra22 textual interpretation. Instead ­­23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But I don't understand24 how, if the falsehood is made to Target, who gives the25 person the DVD off the shelf, how you prove that that's58￼1 an intent to defraud the bank as opposed to defraud2 Target.3 MR. RUSSELL: Well, so there's the ­­4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what's the charge you5 give to the jury to get to that? I think the limiting6 principle is the charge that they want to get.7 MR. RUSSELL: You say that they have to show8 that the defendant intended to deceive a bank, and the9 government can argue ­­ and the government has10 successfully argued in many cases that use of an altered11 check shows that the defendant intended to deceive a12 bank.13 And the government raises ­­ you know, the14 government never likes to have to prove intent. But the15 government raises these theoretical difficulties in16 proving intent, but it hasn't shown that this actually17 ever arises. In fact, the government routinely convicts18 people in circumstances like this case, even in circuits19 where intent to defraud a bank is required. It's just20 they didn't try to do that here because they didn't ask21 the jury to make that finding.22 In addition, the difficulty of their test is23 it's just plain strange. They say you should adopt24 their test because Congress didn't care about intent to25 defraud a bank. Then they adopt a rule that looks very59￼1 much like the kind of rule you would adopt if you2 thought Congress cared about intent to defraud a bank.3 It's simply substituting some circumstantial evidence4 that one could argue to a jury shows intent to defraud a5 bank and saying that's all the government has to prove.6 JUSTICE ALITO: Your textual hook is that7 there ­­ that the representation has to be made to the8 bank, right? That's the only way you can get this9 within the statute.10 MR. RUSSELL: That's correct.11 JUSTICE ALITO: But that's different from an12 intent to defraud the bank, isn't it?13 MR. RUSSELL: I think ­­ well, that's the14 first half. So there's two pieces: Intent to deceive15 the bank, intent to obtain bank property.16 We say that you can read the statute to17 require intent to deceive the bank because there's a18 statutory silence. And then the government has to prove19 intent to obtain bank property. That's easily proven20 when the check is directly presented to a bank. We21 don't think it can be proven in a case like this because22 our client intended to obtain Target's property, not the23 bank's.24 JUSTICE ALITO: But where is the textual25 silence about ­­ where do you get intent to deceive the601 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425bank into this?MR. RUSSELL: I think that's what ­­ I getit from this Court's decision, for example, in McNallywhere it said ­­JUSTICE ALITO: Where do you get it the from the text? I understand the argument. It's a ­­ it's a very credible argument. It doesn't say to whom the representations have to be made. So you put in to the bank.MR. RUSSELL: Right.JUSTICE ALITO: I don't see how you get from there to defrauding the bank.MR. RUSSELL: So if you read it to mean that you have to direct the false statement to the bank, that is the first half of what McNally said intent to deceive a bank ­­ or intent to defraud a bank is, you have to intend to deceive a bank. And the second half is you have to get ­­ intend the deceit to obtain bank property, which is on the face of Subsection (2).CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
