Marsh.          General Kline.               ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILL KLINE               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. KLINE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          This Court has never held that a specificstructure for weighing aggravating and mitigatingfactors is required by the eighth amendment.  Yet, thisCourt has consistently held that all that is requiredby the eighth amendment is for States to afford anopportunity to jurors to consider all mitigatingevidence relevant to determination of a sentence otherthan death.          The Kansas statute, it is undisputed in thiscase, allowed the respondent to introduce all suchevidence and that the jurors, under Kansas law, arespecifically instructed to consider all such mitigatingevidence on an individualized basis.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  General, may -- may I -- I'dlike to pose a question which at least gets to the nubof the issue, as I see it, and -- and get your response31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 to it.2 The premise of my question is this. We -- we3 generally regard mitigation evidence as favoring life,4 aggravation evidence as favoring death. We've got a5 case in which the -- the assumption is that they are6 evenly balanced. The -- the pans of the scale are7 exactly even on that. Kansas says in that case the8 jury shall return the verdict of death.9 If we are going to demand, as we have said10 that we're going to demand, that the determination --11 that the death penalty determination be one of12 what we have called reasoned moral judgment, then what13 has to be supplied in order to make the Kansas14 provision consistent with reasoned moral justice, it15 seems to me, is a presumption in favor of death. Other16 things being equal, there is a presumption in favor of17 death.18 And my question is, am I correct in saying19 that in order to hold your way, we have to hold that20 the eighth amendment -- is consistent with the21 eighth amendment to presume the appropriateness of22 death, other things being equal?23 MR. KLINE: As the Court -- yes. As the24 Court has done in Walton, the standard in the --25 JUSTICE SOUTER: You -- you agree that's --41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that's a proper way to look at the issue then.2 MR. KLINE: Well, to take the issue in its3 total context and refer to the instructions and the4 totality of what the jury is instructed, I would5 disagree that there is a presumption of death --6 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then how do you get off the7 dime?8 MR. KLINE: The jury is given in the9 instruction, instruction number 4 and instruction10 number 5, a direction as to the effect of their11 reasoned moral judgment.12 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the -- the13 direction, as I understand it, is that if mitigation14 and aggravation are even, then the only way to come to15 a conclusion is to say, as the statute does, because16 the mitigation does not outweigh the aggravation, you17 should return a verdict of death. And that seems to me18 another way of saying there is a presumption that if19 aggravation and mitigation are equal, that the penalty20 should be death.21 MR. KLINE: Instruction number 5 does22 instruct the juror, Justice Souter, that if the State23 meets the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt24 that the mitigating factors do not outweigh the25 aggravating factors, then the jury shall sentence the51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425defendant to death.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  The State has made ajudgment that this particular offense -- what's itcalled?  Aggravated murder, you know, whatever --          MR. KLINE:  First, they have to be convicted,Justice Scalia, of capital murder.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Capital murder, as its nameimplies, warrants a judgment of death unless there aremitigating factors that -- which indicate that that isnot proper.          MR. KLINE:  That is correct, Justice Scalia.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's a moral judgment,isn't it?          MR. KLINE:  That certainly is, and --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And even if the State hadsaid the opposite, it -- it is a -- still a State-prescribed moral judgment.  If the State had saidcapital murder warrants a judgment of death only if themitigating factors outweigh the aggravating factors,that's still a State-prescribed moral judgment, isn'tit?          MR. KLINE:  That is correct.          JUSTICE BREYER:  And can -- can you go backto Justice Souter's question for a minute?  Because theway I'm thinking about this, I'm making two assumptions61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that I'd like you to make: first, that there could be2 such a case, which I very much doubt, but -- but this3 is a lawyer's hypothetical, this whole thing, in a4 sense. But I'll make the assumption there could be5 such a case. Second, I will assume that our case law6 leaves this open, a matter that can be argued.7 But suppose that we do make that assumption8 for the moment. Then what I'm thinking of is this9 made-up case is the case of the following. We have10 aggravating factors and break them down into molecules11 on a scale, and for every molecule of aggravation here,12 there is a molecule of mitigation there, so that the13 juror who is very conscientious ends up with the same14 number of molecules of equal weight on this scale. And15 in our made-up instance, Kansas says, if that's the16 situation, you must say death.17 Now, if that's the case, how would you18 reconcile that with a view of the eighth amendment that19 says if you're going to sentence someone to death,20 there has to be something special about his case that21 means it's somewhat worse than the ordinary case22 because, after all, for every molecule of specialness23 that warranted death, we have a molecule of mitigation24 that doesn't?25 So that's where I am, trying to get the cases71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 out of it and trying to take very seriously the2 hypothetical that is before us.3 MR. KLINE: There -- thank you, Justice4 Breyer. There are several considerations and steps5 that must6 we get to78 discretion standard of this Court, as laid out in9 Furman and its progeny, to a very narrow definition ofbe approached and proven by the State beforethat actual equation.First of all, the State follows the guided10 what capital murder is. In fact, the Kansas death11 penalty statute is one of the most narrow in the12 Nation.13And then past that point to the sentencingState must prove beyond a reasonable doubt atof eight specific aggravating factors existunanimity.14 jury, the15 least one16 with jury1718 with this19 amendment20 all mitigating evidence relevant to a sentence other21 than death and that instruction is specifically pointed22 out in your appendix, pages 23 through 28.23 Furthermore, the jurors are --24 JUSTICE SCALIA: The Furman -- the --25 it's hard to tell where the voice is coming from, IAnd then past that point, Kansas has compliedCourt's requirement under the eighthfor a juror to consider and give effect to81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 know. We ought to get that fixed.2 (Laughter.)3 JUSTICE SCALIA: The Furman narrowing is4 produced by the very first part of subsection (e). If,5 by a unanimous vote, the jury finds beyond a reasonable6 doubt that one or more of the aggravating circumstances7 enumerated in -- in section 24-4625 and amendments8 thereto exist -- that's the Furman.9 MR. KLINE: That is correct, and --10 JUSTICE SCALIA: And then beyond that you say11 if that is found, then the jury has to find that the12 existence of such aggravating does not outweigh.13 MR. KLINE: That is correct. And that --14 that is how it complies with your hypothetical, Justice15 Breyer.16 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you see, my17 hypothetical is designed to cut free of the language of18 the cases. I have no doubt you can go through the19 language and show that. And it's designed to say, but20 the very point of those cases is you do not send21 someone to death unless the jury decides that the22 circumstances here make him somewhat worse, at least23 one molecule worth of worse, than the typical person.24 And given the evenness of the balance, I don't see how25 we can say that, though I grant you, when you go back91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 to those words in the cases, you're right.2 MR. KLINE: Well, the guided discretion of3 this Court has indicated that the State must be able to4 -- and a juror -- differentiate between a defendant who5 is convicted of the same crime as to the -- and6 sentenced to life as the defendant who is sentenced to7 the same crime and sentenced to death. And that is8 laid out, as Justice Scalia pointed out, in the9 definition of capital murder and the requirement of10 aggravated factors.11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, the -- the12 instructions don't tell the jury to weigh the13 molecules. They tell the jury that the State has to14 prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigating15 molecules do not outweigh the aggravating molecules.16 MR. KLINE: That is correct.17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And how likely is it,18 if you have a jury who thinks the -- a juror, who19 thinks the molecules are precisely balanced, is going20 to conclude that the State has carried its burden of21 proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the 50 here22 don't outweigh the 50 here?23 MR. KLINE: Mr. Chief Justice --24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a theoretical25 proposition --101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. KLINE: Mr. Chief Justice, we are dealing2 with a hypothetical that we believe does not exist in3 jury deliberations. A juror steps back and decides4 whether they can live with the decision that is before5 them and then decides whether the death penalty is6 warranted.7 And in fact, Kansas law leads them to that8 reasoned moral decision. In Kansas law, in instruction9 number 4, which again is laid out in your appendix,10 instructs the juror that mercy, in and of itself, is11 sufficient to determine a sentence other than death.1213 this. As14 this case15 -- I take16 State to introduce mitigating evidence. That's --17 that's the responsibility of the accused.18 MR. KLINE: That is correct.19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And so what we're saying20 here is that when a State shows that the mitigators do21 not outweigh the aggravators, then it's the22 defendant's/accused's burden to go forward and show23 that they do.24 MR. KLINE: Except -- you're correct, Justice25 Kennedy, except that the burden on the State is beyond111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, let me ask -- ask youa -- rather than presumptions, can we look atas a matter of shifting burdens of proof?  Iit the Constitution does not require the￼1 a reasonable doubt to demonstrate that, the highest2 burden allowed by law. And beyond that burden that was3 in the Arizona statute, which was functionally4 identical to the Kansas law, that was presented in this5 -- to this Court in Walton v. Arizona, and this Court6 rejected that very argument in that case. As you may7 recall, the Arizona law was that there was a8 responsibility for the defendant to demonstrate that9 mitigating factors were sufficiently substantial to10 call for leniency. The Arizona Supreme Court had11 decided that that meant that the mitigating factors12 must outweigh the aggravating factors.13 And this Court accepted that case because of14 a conflict between the ninth circuit which held, as the15 Kansas Supreme Court did, in Adamson v. Ricketts, that16 that was an unconstitutional violation of the eighth17 amendment.18 This Court resolved that conflict, and in19 fact, States relied on that resolution, as did the20 Kansas21 except22 State.2324 burden 25legislature, in articulating the very standardKansas goes further and keeps the burden on the   JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Yes.  In Arizona, thewas placed on the defendant, was it not --MR. KLINE: That is correct, Justice 121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 O'Connor.2 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- to -- to prove the3 mitigation? And yet, the Court upheld that even in the4 equipoise 56 O'Connor. 789 dissent. 1011 burden on 1213 proceeding. The burden remains on the State to prove14 beyond a reasonable doubt.15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- but I take it16 the State has no duty to adduce mitigating factors.17 MR. KLINE: It is incumbent upon the18 defendant, Justice Kennedy, to bring forth factors in19 mitigation. The standard, though, in introduction is20 relevancy, and Kansas has met the -- the requirements21 of this Court, as it relates to the specific sentencing22 or individualized sentencing structure, by allowing the23 jury to consider all evidence relevant to the24 determination of a sentence other than death.25 JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, that means they131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-situation.MR. KLINE:  That is correct, JusticeJUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Over a dissent.MR. KLINE:  Correct.  Justice Blackmun'sJUSTICE O'CONNOR:  So Kansas does not put thethe defendant.MR. KLINE:  Not at any stage of the￼1 comply with Lockett.2 I want to ask you one question that goes back3 to your colloquy with Justice Souter and Justice4 Scalia. Justice Scalia pointed out that the State has5 made a moral judgment on a certain state of facts, the6 death penalty shall be imposed and which you agreed7 with. And that was true in the cases back in 1975 and8 6. There were some State statutes that mandated death9 based on the moral judgment of the State in certain10 circumstances. I think one was a North Carolina11 statute.12 Do you ask us to reexamine those cases?13 MR. KLINE: No, Justice Stevens. Actually14 the State's position is consistent with the previous15 decisions of this Court in this fashion.16 JUSTICE STEVENS: It -- it does not rely on17 the proposition that there's a situation in which18 there's a mandated death penalty which is perfectly19 okay.20 MR. KLINE: No, because there is a21 requirement upon the State in the sentencing phase to22 prove factors in aggravation with jury unanimity beyond23 a reasonable doubt that set aside this particular act24 in a different framework than those who commit capital25 murder and are convicted of capital murder. If the141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425State does not meet that burden --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes, but of course, theaggravators -- it would be permissible for a State toinclude the aggravators necessary to narrow the categoryin the definition of the crime itself.          MR. KLINE:  This Court has held that it does. And Kansas has a very narrow death penalty in thedefinition of capital murder and also the specifiedaggravators that the State must prove.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But you would say that ifthe State met that burden and there was no mitigatingor no substantial mitigating evidence, it would bepermissible to -- for the State to mandate the deathpenalty.Arizona.Stevens.MR. KLINE:  Just as it is in Walton v.JUSTICE STEVENS:  The answer is yes.MR. KLINE:  Yes.  The answer is yes, Justice          JUSTICE STEVENS:  And you think that's fullyconsistent with the North Carolina case.          MR. KLINE:  It is not fully consistent, Idon't believe.  It is consistent with the Walton casein that this Court said a mandatory death penalty isnot unconstitutional, as long as the State151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 differentiates between those convicted of the same2 crime and who are sentenced to life and those who are3 convicted of the same crime and sentenced to death.4 Kansas clearly does that in the requirement that the5 State prove beyond a reasonable doubt that one of at6 least eight specific statutory aggravating factors7 exist in the case.8 But Kansas goes further. Unlike in Walton v.9 Arizona, the burden remains on the State to also prove10 that the mitigating evidence proffered by the defendant11 who has the lowest threshold allowed by law, and all12 that is required by this Court -- that is relevancy --13 that all of that evidence does not outweigh --14 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it -- that's15 Justice Blackmun interpreted the majority, but16 majority didn't quite say that because it said17 burden on the defendant was to prove sufficient18 mitigation to justify something other than the death19 penalty. And conceivably one could have met that20 burden with substantial mitigating evidence that came21 out even.22 MR. KLINE: Well, the --23 JUSTICE STEVENS: Under the majority's24 opinion -- now, you're dead right about what Justice25 Blackmun said, but --161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-the waythethe￼1 MR. KLINE: Justice Stevens, you are correct.2 The majority didn't specifically address that, but3 they also analyzed the case, much as Justice Kennedy4 just did, in saying that really what we're talking5 about is whether the State eventually at some point,6 once it has met the requirement of the individualized7 sentencing requirements of this Court, can say that8 death is appropriate. And the answer in this Court's9 jurisprudence has been clearly yes once we are able to10 set aside11 convicted1213 would be consistent with the -- the text of the14 majority opinion to say it really meant they have to15 prove enough mitigating evidence to make death the16 inappropriate sentence, which could be less than --17 even a 50/50 balance?this defendant from other defendantsof the same crime.JUSTICE STEVENS:  But you would agree that it18 MR. KLINE: Arguably, yes, Justice Stevens.19 And that is the language of the Arizona statute, but it20 would fly in the face of the interpretation of the21 Arizona Supreme Court, as well as the Ninth Circuit22 Court of Appeals in Adamson v. Ricketts which,23 subsequent to the Walton decision, held that Walton24 controlled and allowed the potentiality of equipoise to25 be constitutional.171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 Now, one thing I would like to --2 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Are you going to address3 the other questions? I think we added a question4 about whether the Kansas Supreme Court's judgment was5 adequately supported by an independent State ground.6 And I'm not sure that this has been adequately7 addressed.8 Do we have jurisdiction here? The -- the9 Kansas Supreme Court vacated the capital murder10 judgment and remanded it and said it would have done it11 anyway because of the State law evidentiary error12 concerning admission of third party guilt evidence. So13 does that independent ground mean we don't have14 jurisdiction here on this thing?15 MR. KLINE: No, Justice O'Connor, there is16 not an independent and adequate State ground for this17 decision. It is undisputed that the Kansas Supreme18 Court relies on this Court's interpretation of the19 eighth amendment for the interpretation of the cruel or20 unusual punishment clause of the Kansas constitution.21 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But there was another22 ground.23 MR. KLINE: Yes, but it is not adequate and24 independent. The argument of the respondent is that25 the constitutional savings doctrine and severability181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 arguments are independent and adequate, and by their2 very nature, they are dependent rather than3 independent.4 The Kansas Supreme Court engaged in a -- and5 I quote from the decision -- a full reexamination of6 the eighth amendment jurisprudence in coming to the7 conclusion in paragraph 25 of the syllabus, which is8 the law of the case in Kansas under Kansas law, that9 the Kansas death penalty statute is unconstitutional on10 its face. That was the first such holding in Kansas11 jurisprudence history finding that determination.12 Previously, 3 years earlier, the court had13 found the death penalty statute constitutional as14 construed, and as this Court knows, you will not accept15 jurisdiction of a State court's interpretation or16 construction of a State law. So, therefore, this is17 the first18 would say1920 this case 212223 is a conviction and a sentence, you could come back24 here again by25 MR.1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400way of a cross appeal.KLINE:  That would be incorrect, Justice19 Washington, DC 20005 1-opportunity that the State has had and Ithe last.JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, but was this -- wasremanded for a new trial?MR. KLINE:  It is, Your Honor.JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  And presumably, if there￼1 O'Connor. Kansas is prohibited. The prosecutors are2 prohibited and limited of the right of appeal in Kansas3 law as in most States.4 And -- and this Court had a similar case in5 Neville v. South Dakota in which you construed South6 Dakota law as it relates to limiting the prosecution's7 ability to appeal and, through that construction,8 identified in an interlocutory basis, when the lower9 court passes on a constitutional measure that has10 import for this Court, that the inability of the State11 to be able to pursue that case renders jurisdiction12 under 28, section 1257. So --13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If I -- if I understand14 what the situation is, there is no death penalty in15 Kansas as a result of this decision.16 MR. KLINE: That is correct, Justice17 Ginsburg. There is no death penalty. The highest18 court of our State has spoken and stricken it down as19 unconstitutional on its face.20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Has there been any21 movement in the legislature to change the law so you22 won't be in this situation where there is no death23 penalty?24 MR. KLINE: Justice Ginsburg, there's25 significant discussion in the legislature, but that201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 discussion is somewhat mixed, as you might imagine, and2 some were concerned that action might moot this case.3 Right now there are 12 pending capital murder cases in4 Kansas which, if this Court does not reverse the Kansas5 Supreme Court, the State will not be able to seek6 capital murder charges and the death sentence in those7 cases.8 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, that wouldn't be true9 if you amended the statute though, would it? If you -- if10 they amended the statute to take the 50/50 problem out11 of it, which wouldn't seem to me all that difficult,12 you could13 12 people1415 Stevens, since their crimes were committed prior to any16 act of the legislature, we would be prohibited fromstill impose the death penalty on these otherwho haven't been tried.MR. KLINE:  It is our position, Justice17 seeking the death penalty.1819 amendment 2021 position. 2223 position if they did it.24 (Laughter.)25 MR. KLINE: Well, Justice Stevens, if you put211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-JUSTICE STEVENS:  Because of an amelioratingto the death penalty statute?MR. KLINE:  That is -- that is our -- our It would have to take an entire --JUSTICE STEVENS:  I doubt if you'd take that￼1 me in that position, I will be an advocate for the2 State.3 However, it is our position, as Justice4 Ginsburg alluded to, that the State has no death5 penalty and it would take a complete reenactment of the6 death penalty for the State to have one.7 And that is borne out in case law. There is8 no uncertainty as it relates to the ability of the9 State to seek appeal in charging death once there is no10 death statute that is available. The references in11 Kansas law to KSA section 22-3602(b) are a very settled12 area of the law. The respondent argues that subsection13 (1) of that statute would allow us an opportunity to14 preserve this issue below. However, that only relates15 to the State being able to appeal charging documents,16 and the definitions of those documents are very17 specific in Kansas law.18 Furthermore, subsection (3) states that a19 prosecutor can reserve an issue, but case law is very20 clear, and that is only if the Kansas Supreme Court21 sees that issue as important for the administration of22 justice, the uniform administration of justice, in the23 State, and has interpreted that to mean only where24 guidance of the supreme court is necessary. It is not25 a method for moving for rehearing. The Kansas Supreme221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 Court rejects that. We moved for reconsideration and2 reconsideration was not granted.3 If this Court embarks, as the respondent asks4 it to, it will put in jeopardy 12 capital murder cases5 and prevent 12 capital murder cases from being pursued6 in Kansas. It will effectively strike down the laws of7 seven other States that have functionally identical8 statutes as Kansas.9 And furthermore, it would effectively call10 into question the laws of five other States that do not11 even require any weighing mechanism whatsoever. This12 Court has never gone further and required a specific13 mechanism of weighing aggravating and mitigating14 circumstances and has relegated that duty, as it15 should, to the States as long as the juror has the16 opportunity to make the reasoned moral decision based17 on the consideration of all mitigating evidence18 relevant to a decision other than death that relates to19 the character, the background of the defendant, or the20 circumstances of the offense.21 And if you would look in your joint appendix22 on pages 25 and 26, you will see the instructions that23 the State of Kansas gave in this case, and it is24 undisputed that the respondent's presentation of25 mitigating evidence was presented to the jury in full,231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 and additionally, the jury was specifically instructed2 to consider and give weight -- I'm sorry. It's pages3 24 and 25 -- specifically instructed to give weight to4 all of that evidence. Pages 24 and 25. I am referring5 to instruction number 4. And you will see the6 delineation beginning on page 25 of all the mitigating7 evidence that was admitted as relevant in this case.8 And I would also say that Kansas continues to9 bear a greater burden in its consideration -- for the10 juror's consideration in that the juror is instructed11 on paragraph 2 of instruction 4 that mercy in and of12 itself is sufficient -- is sufficient -- to outweigh13 the aggravating evidence presented by the State. So14 contrary to the --15 JUSTICE SCALIA: I have no idea what that16 means. I mean, you -- you go into this very elaborate17 system, you know, molecules on one side, molecules on18 the other.19 (Laughter.)20 JUSTICE SCALIA: And then you throw the whole21 thing up in the air and say mercy alone is enough. I22 mean --23 MR. KLINE: Justice Scalia, I think it is --24 it is default for a life sentence. And I believe it25 is certainly an acknowledgement that what really241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425happens here is a juror steps back, after theconsideration of all the evidence that this Courtrequires under the eighth amendment, and decides whatthey can live with:  a sentence of death or a sentenceof life.  And one juror who has doubt can extend mercy.          And, Mr. Chief Justice, if it may please theCourt, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, General.          Ms. Woodman, we'll hear now from you.           ORAL ARGUMENT OF REBECCA E. WOODMAN               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MS. WOODMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          I'd like to devote the bulk of my time toanswering the State's arguments on the merits becausethe constitutional issue presented by the Kansascapital sentencing statute is actually quite differentthan the State and its amici would have it appear.Their arguments rest on an erroneous assumption aboutthe way the statute operates and the real issues thatits operation raises.          Under the Kansas formula, prosecutors can anddo urge jurors not to persevere in their decision-making if they are undecided regarding the balance ofaggravating and mitigating circumstances.  In other251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 words, if the decision is too hard to make, the2 sentence must be death. The formula --3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But is it reasonable4 to suppose that one of those cases where it's too hard5 to decide is when there are 50 molecules on one side6 and 50 on the other? In other words, it would seem to7 me that that's an easy case to say that the State has8 not met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt9 that the mitigating factors don't outweigh the10 aggravating ones when the evidence is evenly balanced.11 MS. WOODMAN: No, Your Honor. I think that12 it's not right to think of this in terms of13 mathematical formulas, molecules on one side or the14 other. This is a subjective, qualitative determination15 that the jury makes, and whatever capital sentencing16 statute a State chooses, States are free to choose17 whatever structure they see fit to determine whether18 death is an appropriate sentence. However, States are19 not free to enact a statute that doesn't ensure a20 reliable determination that death is an appropriate21 sentence, and that's what we're dealing with here.22 It's a qualitative judgment and one can imagine, very23 easily I think, a scenario where jurors are24 deliberating. They take their jobs very seriously and25 they cannot make a determination whether aggravators261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 outweigh mitigators, or vice versa.2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's because the3 defendant hasn't introduced enough evidence of4 mitigation and that's the duty of the defendant to come5 forward with it.6 MS. WOODMAN: Well, in -- in a situation of7 equipoise, by which I mean a state of indecision on8 whether the relative balance between aggravating and9 mitigating circumstances, burden of proof is not the10 sticking point there.11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you say it's a state12 of indecision. The jury has decided that aggravating13 factors have been established.14 MS. WOODMAN: But that -- that's -- that's15 the problem because that's not a reliable16 determination. It's no determination that based upon17 the individual --18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why isn't it a reliable19 determination that, number one, it's a death-qualified20 accused in -- in any event, and there have been21 specific aggravators proved? That has been determined.22 It's now for the defendant, in effect, to show that23 the mitigating circumstances outweigh this. The -- and24 you have the bonus that the State has to prove beyond a25 reasonable doubt that the mitigators have not271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 outweighed the aggravators.2 MS. WOODMAN: But the jury is specifically3 instructed under this formula that they have a third4 option, and that is where they can't make a decision,5 whether aggravators outweigh mitigators, or vice versa6 --7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: They have made the8 decision. They have made the decision that the9 aggravators are there and have not been outweighed.10 They have made that decision.11 MS. WOODMAN: But the jury is required to12 impose death at that point, and it is a decision that13 aggravators are not outweighed by mitigators. But this14 Court's eighth amendment jurisprudence requires --15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's because the16 mitigation case hasn't been made.17 MS. WOODMAN: The eighth amendment requires18 jurors to make a determination, based upon individual19 characteristics, whether death is an appropriate20 sentence, whether the defendant deserves death. And21 when the jury is in a situation of equipoise and is22 required to impose death, they're imposing death23 without having made that determination that death is an24 appropriate --25 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. They're -- they're281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 saying it is appropriate. They're saying it is2 appropriate. We have the people put in the box. The3 box is are they in a situation that is different from4 the average murderer. Yes. And they're making the5 determination that although they're in that box, that6 morally they're no different. Morally they're the same7 --8 MS. WOODMAN: Well, there's no --9 JUSTICE BREYER: -- because for every factor10 that makes them morally one way, there's a factor that11 makes them morally the other way. So they're12 different, but they're not morally different.13 Now, that's -- that's what I think this case14 presents. And I -- I mean, I imagine a juror who's15 thinking just what I said. I don't know if there ever16 was such a juror, but if there was such a juror, the17 statute in this instant tells him what to do.18 MS. WOODMAN: The statute does tell them what19 to do. It tells --20 JUSTICE BREYER: It says where you think21 there is an equivalent, but not a moral difference,22 death.23 MS. WOODMAN: Well, but if -- if you think --24 if you look at the prosecutorial arguments, for25 example, that have been made in both the Kleypas and291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 Marsh cases, those prosecutorial arguments have urged2 the jurors to do exactly what I described, and that is3 to abdicate their decision to make a -- a determination4 based on the -- on individual characteristics on5 the question of whether death is an appropriate6 punishment for this individual offender based on the7 specific circumstances of this crime, and that if8 they're in equipoise, they have to impose a death9 sentence. That is encouraging the jurors to abdicate10 their decision to determine whether death is an11 appropriate sentence or not.12 Then --13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. -- Ms. Woodman, you14 know, I -- I have not, you know, gone along with --15 with most of our Walton jurisprudence anyway, but --16 but what I have really always thought it demanded was17 really nothing more precise than that a jury has to be18 given the opportunity to grant mercy. I -- I'm not19 sure I would describe any of it as any more precise20 than that.21 MS. WOODMAN: Well --22 JUSTICE SCALIA: The jury has to be given the23 opportunity to say this poor devil doesn't deserve the24 death penalty. However you want to put that, you know,25 you can put the burdens here, the burdens there. You301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 can talk about equipoise or not. Does the jury have a2 chance to say this -- this fellow does not deserve the3 death penalty? That --4 MS. WOODMAN: Well --5 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and clearly exists6 under this scheme, it seems to me. Any jury that --7 that really thinks this person should not go to death8 can -- can do it. In fact, you know, I guess the9 statute does not demand that instruction, but that10 instruction that says -- what is it? The11 appropriateness of the exercise of mercy can itself be12 a mitigating factor. I mean, gee, what -- what else --13 what else do you have to do?14 MS. WOODMAN: But that's one factor among15 many that the jury has to consider. And the problem16 here is that the jury could have all of the information17 that a defendant has proffered as a basis for a18 sentence less than death, and a jury could still be19 unable to decide whether aggravation or mitigation is20 the weightier in a closely balanced case. And that is21 the problem here.22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Any jury that thought this23 -- this person did not deserve death would have ample24 opportunity to give expression to that determination25 under this scheme.311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MS. WOODMAN:  Only if they persevere in thatdecision-making, and prosecutors urge them not to bytelling them that they must impose death when theycannot decide the balance between aggravating andmitigating circumstances.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Ms. Woodman, you said thatthey didn't make such an argument in this case and insome other case, but you did not include the argumentin the joint appendix, did you?          MS. WOODMAN:  No, I did -- we did not includethe prosecutorial closing arguments.  They are in --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Are you -- are you -- the-- the argument --          MS. WOODMAN:  They are in the brief.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There is a brief from theKansas law professors, and this is the instruction fromthe Kleypas case?          MS. WOODMAN:  Yes.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If the aggravators are notoutweighed by the mitigators, you shall impose thedeath penalty, not that you may, not that you can, butthat you shall impose the death penalty.  This is theduty you were sworn to uphold.  Shows command.  Itmeans must.  That's -- is that the type of instruction--321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MS. WOODMAN: That's correct.2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the type of argument?3 MS. WOODMAN: That's correct, and then in Mr.4 Marsh's case, which is part of the record in this case5 -- and I've cited to the record for that argument,6 which is at -- I apologize. It's at volume 54 at pages7 54 and 55 of the record of the Kansas Supreme Court in8 the Marsh case. And in that case, the prosecutorial9 arguments told the jury that they can't even consider10 mitigating evidence unless they find that mitigating11 circumstances outweigh aggravating circumstances12 because the law has told you and the judge has told you13 that the law says that if the aggravating circumstances14 are not outweighed by mitigating circumstances, you15 shall return a verdict of death.1617 shouldn't 1819 not being20 And as I said --21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is -- is this mercy22 instruction always given? Is that standard? Is it --JUSTICE SCALIA:  And therefore, theyconsider mitigating at all, he told them?MS. WOODMAN:  No.  This is not a question ofable to consider mitigating circumstances.23 is it, in effect, that -- that mercy24 one of the mitigating circumstances?25 MS. WOODMAN: Yes. That's331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  1-is -- is alwayspart of the juryWashington, DC 20005￼1 instructions in capital cases.2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Gee, I -- I really don't see3 what -- what complaint you have then. Any jury that --4 that thinks this person deserves mercy says, I think he5 deserves mercy, and that's -- that's a -- a mitigating6 circumstance that outweighs whatever aggravating7 circumstances there are.8 MS. WOODMAN: But when you think about the9 difficulty of the individualized sentencing decision10 that the jury has to make, the -- one juror might feel11 that way, but it's only if they persevere in that12 decisionmaking. This statutory equipoise provision13 encourages jurors not to persevere in their14 decisionmaking. They're -- they're sitting around in15 the jury room. One juror --16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what is the17 statutory equipoise provision?18 MS. WOODMAN: It says that if the jury finds19 the existence of at least one aggravating factor and20 determines further that any aggravating circumstances21 that exist are not outweighed by any mitigating22 circumstances found to exist, the sentence shall be23 death.24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's my25 question. There is no --341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: If the State is --2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There is no statutory3 equipoise provision. The State has a burden of proof4 to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigating5 factors don't outweigh the aggravating. That's what6 you mean by the statutory equipoise provision?7 MS. WOODMAN: The statutory equipoise8 provision, as the Kansas Supreme Court found -- they9 construed this statute. They construed it to mean that10 it requires death when jurors are undecided about the11 balance between aggravating and mitigating12 circumstances. That construction of the statute is13 entitled to respect. And under --14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Who said that? Excuse me.15 That -- that description of the statute.16 MS. WOODMAN: The Kansas Supreme Court in the17 Kleypas case in holding it unconstitutional.18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but it seems to me the19 statute doesn't really say that, does it? But I20 what the statute says is that if it's in perfect21 equipoise, the State loses because the State has22 burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that23 that the mitigators do not outweigh the aggravators.24 It seems to me if a jury sees them in perfect25 equipoise, the jury would have to say the State has not 351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-mean,the the --￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigators donot outweigh the aggravators.  What -- isn't that what ajury would have to say?          MS. WOODMAN:  No.  Under the statute, theState's burden of proof, which is beyond a reasonabledoubt -- I'll grant that, but it's to prove beyond areasonable doubt that the aggravators are notoutweighed by the mitigators.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's right.  Okay.  And --and if the jury cannot decide whether the aggravatorsare outweighed by the mitigators, if they're in perfectequipoise, who loses?          MS. WOODMAN:  The defendant.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  No.  The State loses.  It'sthe State that has the burden of proving beyond areasonable doubt that they are --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, the Kansas SupremeCourt thought that --          MS. WOODMAN:  The Kansas Supreme Courtconstrued it to mean that a tie goes to the -- to theState.          JUSTICE BREYER:  That's different from sayingnot decided.  I thought the Kansas Supreme Court didn'tspeak of not decided.  I thought it didn't speak inKleypas about a jury who -- a juror who can't make up361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 its -- his mind. I thought it said the jury has made2 -- it assumed the juror has made up his mind. That's3 why I think it's artificial. It says where the jury4 finds. It finds equipoise as to the mitigating and5 aggravating circumstance, then death, that the jury has6 to find that.7 MS. WOODMAN: But this is not about8 structuring decisionmaking. This is about terminating9 decisionmaking on the issue that is central to the10 eighth amendment requirements at the selection stage --11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's terminating it12 because there's not enough mitigating evidence.13 JUSTICE BREYER: That's true I -- I think,14 isn't it?15 And then the question is, does a State have a16 right not to do with burden of proof, not to do with17 anything else, but to have perhaps the artificial18 situation where the jury finds that the evidence is in19 equipoise whoever has the burden of proof. Put it all20 on you, whoever had it. That was their final21 conclusion. I find it is in equipoise.22 Next question: what happens?23 MS. WOODMAN: Well, the statute hasn't24 assigned a burden of proof, but still that's not the25 problem here.371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I agree with you.2 That's not the problem.3 MS. WOODMAN: Because what the4 individualization requirement means, in this Court's5 own jurisprudence, is that mere consideration of6 mitigating circumstances is not enough. The Court said7 so in Tennard and in many other cases, Penry v.8 Johnson, that it's not enough that the sentencer be9 allowed to consider mitigating circumstances. It must10 be allowed to consider and give effect to those11 mitigating circumstances.12 And when a jury cannot decide between13 aggravating and mitigating circumstances, when that14 jury is, nevertheless, required under this -- that15 situation to impose a sentence of death, the sentence16 of death has been imposed without the jury having made17 the requisite individualized sentencing decision under18 the eighth amendment at the selection stage.19 JUSTICE STEVENS: I might point out -- I just20 looked at the question presented. It does assume --21 and I guess is drafted by the Kansas Attorney General.22 The question is what happens when mitigating and23 aggravating evidence is in equipoise. So the24 assumption on which we took the case is that there will25 be cases in which there's equipoise.381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MS. WOODMAN: That's right. And the Kansas2 Supreme Court found that that was a real possibility.3 And the Kansas Supreme Court found this statute4 unconstitutional in Kleypas because it violates the5 individualized sentencing requirement, and the court6 specifically found that it requires death when jurors7 are unable to decide the balance between aggravating8 and mitigating circumstances. That's how the statute9 was construed in Kleypas.10 I would like to address the jurisdictional11 issue for a few moments, unless there are any further12 questions from the Court on the equipoise issue, which13 I'd be happy to answer. But one of the things I want14 to discuss today is the jurisdictional issue on the15 adequate and independent State law ground, which this16 Court asked the parties to brief.17 I feel that the State misstates the issue18 there as well because in the Kansas Supreme Court, the19 State conceded the Federal unconstitutionality of the20 Kansas equipoise formula, as decided by the court in21 the Kleypas case 4 years ago, and defended in this case22 only on the contested State law ground of severability23 and bypassed raising a Federal question in a motion for24 a rehearing, which again relied solely on State law25 severability grounds.391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the -- the Attorney2 General said that the -- the fact that in this3 particular case the issue was focused on, in effect,4 sort of remedy, severance, and so on, was dependent5 upon the assumption about what Federal law required.6 It was dependent upon the earlier case which so held.7 So I don't -- and -- and what he seem -- says seems8 plausible to me. I -- I don't see how we can divorce9 the judgment here with the earlier judgment, which10 Kansas -- which the Kansas Supreme Court relied upon11 here, which was a Federal ground.12 MS. WOODMAN: Well, it's clear that the13 Kansas Supreme Court's decision relies on severability14 as a basis for its decision, and it's true that the15 Kansas Supreme Court, in doing so, reiterated the16 Kleypas holding.1718 the issue19 holding.2021 raised the issue on State law severability grounds.22 The State conceded that Mr. Marsh was entitled to have23 his death sentence vacated because of the24 unconstitutional equipoise provision.25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you -- do you -- IJUSTICE SOUTER:  It wouldn't have even raisedhad it not been for the earlier FederalIsn't that correct?MS. WOODMAN:  That's right, but Mr. Marsh401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 -- I take it this is the implication of your position.2 Do you take this position that in any instance in3 which a State supreme court decides a case on a Federal4 -- decides an issue on a Federal ground in case A, and5 for whatever reason, case A is not brought to this6 Court for review, that in every subsequent case in the7 State system, which depends upon State A, the State is8 totally without the -- or this Court is -- is totally9 without jurisdiction to review it?10 MS. WOODMAN: Where the issue has not been11 pressed by a party in the State court, no, I don't --12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, how could the issue be13 pressed? I mean, it had already been decided by the14 supreme court. I mean, what -- what could the State15 say to the trial court?16 MS. WOODMAN: Well, we asked the court to17 overrule the severability decision in Kleypas. There18 was absolutely nothing preventing the State from19 arguing that the constitutional decision in Kleypas20 should be overruled. Absolutely nothing preventing21 that.22 JUSTICE SCALIA: You think this -- you think23 the State has to challenge as unconstitutional a24 decision of the State supreme court in -- in the lower25 court, lower State court.411111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MS. WOODMAN:  I think that they --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  How do you expect the lowerState court to come out on that?          MS. WOODMAN:  Well, but futility is never areason for not raising an issue.  Criminal defendantsare required to raise issues all the time in order topreserve them for later review.  In Engle v. Isaacs,this -- this Court said futility is no excuse.  Andwhat is good for criminal defendants, veryrespectfully, is good for the State.  And JusticeRehnquist said as much for the Court in the Court'sdecision in Illinois v. Gates, that -- that States arenot exempt from the ordinary rules of procedure whichgovern this Court's jurisdiction.          And the fact of the matter is that the Statenot only did not raise the Federal issue in the KansasSupreme Court below, which it could have, but itconceded the Federal unconstitutionality of thestatute.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's a little differentfrom an adequate and independent State ground argument. You're -- you're now making a -- a waiver argument.          MS. WOODMAN:  Well, there's a -- there's arelationship between the adequate and independent Statelaw cases and the not pressed or passed upon cases421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 because, for example, in Michigan v. Long, this Court2 has said where an issue is pressed -- a Federal issue3 is pressed in the State courts, then this Court on4 review will resolve any ambiguity in the Court's5 opinion in favor of a presumption that the issue was6 passed upon by the State court.7 But conversely, in Coleman v. Thompson, this8 Court held that where an issue is not pressed in the9 State courts, then the presumption will be the10 opposite. The presumption will be that the State court11 has not passed upon --12 JUSTICE SCALIA: We -- we don't need a13 presumption here. I mean, the -- the only basis for14 inquiring into severability is the presumed15 unconstitutionality of the statute. I mean, that's the16 only basis why severability comes up. We don't have to17 presume anything.18 MS. WOODMAN: But the Kansas Supreme Court19 didn't redecide that issue in the Marsh case.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't matter whether it21 redecided it. It -- it was the postulate of -- of its22 -- necessary postulate of -- of its decision in this23 case, it seems to me.24 MS.25 III and under1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400WOODMAN:  There -- well, under articlesection 1257(a), there has to be a case43 Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 or controversy for this Court to review. There was no2 live case or controversy in the Kansas Supreme Court on3 the Federal question of whether the equipoise provision4 in the Kansas statute was constitutional. It was5 conceded that it was unconstitutional and the parties6 agreed on that. It was treated as settled. And all7 the Kansas Supreme Court did, before overruling the8 Kleypas severability decision, which is a matter of9 State law, was to reiterate that holding, and mere10 reiteration, as this Court knows from the Morrison v.11 Watson case, approved in Illinois v. Gates, that is not12 the decision of a Federal question.13 JUSTICE SOUTER: If you're -- if you're14 right, I take it, we would not have jurisdiction to15 review a Federal ground that was raised by a State16 court, even though it had not been raised by the17 parties. If they get -- you know, they get the opinion18 from the court and there's a big surprise -- the -- the19 State court decided to go off on -- on a Federal20 ground, which had not been pressed -- I take it on your21 view we would not have jurisdiction to review that.22 MS. WOODMAN: I don't believe the Court23 would, and I think that's what the Court's original24 jurisdictional rules were intended to be.25 Now, I do understand that the Court has taken441111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 jurisdiction over such issues, and it's usually --2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's because3 the -- the formula is that the issue has to either have4 been raised or decided.5 MS. WOODMAN: Well, the only issue that I6 could find that says that -- that really enforces that7 rule is the Cohen v. Cowles Media case. And if you8 look at the provenance of that decision, that's the9 only case where the Court actually considered a10 question for the first time in -- in this Court. And11 what happened in that case is that the Federal issue12 that was presented to this Court was actually discussed13 at oral argument. It wasn't raised by either of the14 parties in their briefs in the State court, but it was15 discussed at oral argument. And the Court decided a16 first amendment issue on the basis of that discussion17 at oral argument. And so this Court took jurisdiction18 and stated that as long as it's been passed upon, it's19 not necessary that it was pressed upon.20 And the decision, which the Court relied on21 in that case is, if I'm remembering it correctly, was a22 decision involving a Federal question which was raised23 too late to comply with the procedural requirements in24 State court. And so it's really not the case that this25 Court routinely takes cases where the issue was not451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 pressed by the parties in the State courts. And that's2 the situation we have in this case.3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I don't -- I4 don't -- excuse me. I don't understand how that makes5 any sense. If you had an -- a -- a case that's6 litigated entirely on State law grounds and in the7 State supreme court opinion, they announce we are sua8 sponte deciding this on the basis of the Federal9 Constitution and you, State, lose, your argument is10 that State is just out of luck. They can't seek11 review of that decision?12 MS. WOODMAN: I think where the issue is13 decided sua sponte and affects the parties in that14 case, then maybe.15 But that didn't happen here. What happened16 here was that the court merely reiterated a holding17 from 4 years ago, and the State law severability18 decision, which was the issue in contest in this case19 and the issue that was decided in this case, the20 matter of State law, and it was sufficient to support21 the judgment of the Kansas Supreme Court.22 And really, what -- what the State is trying23 to do here is to -- I mean, these issues were decided24 in the Kleypas case, and if we were here on the Kleypas25 case, there wouldn't be any argument as to whether the461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 Kansas Supreme Court's decision rested on an adequate2 and independent State law ground because the Federal3 issue was clearly decided and it was interwoven with4 the State law determination. But that's not the case5 here.6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Kleypas didn't hold that the7 whole statute was bad. Kleypas gave a savings8 construction of the statute, as I recall.9 MS. WOODMAN: Yes, they did. But the State10 is misconstruing their decision by saying they didn't11 decide the constitutional question in Kleypas. It was12 merely construction of the statute to avoid the13 constitutional issue and therefore --14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but in the case15 before us, the court -- the Kansas court said -- I16 think it's 24 or 25 of the -- of the headnote -- we are17 reconsidering the issue.18 MS. WOODMAN: The -- that language in the19 court's opinion was, after full reconsideration, we're20 declining to revisit the issue at the dissenter's21 invitation. We're declining that invitation to revisit22 the issue.23 And there's no question that the court24 discussed it and thought about it, and the dissenters25 were clearly inviting them --471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And made a reasoned2 judgment about it.3 MS. WOODMAN: But they didn't reopen the4 issue. They said there's nothing new here. We don't5 need to reopen this decision, and --6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, they reopened it to7 the extent as Justice Scalia has indicated, but they8 now take a different view of the validity of the State9 statute.101112 following 1314 they were15 Kleypas was to return the subject to the legislature16 because the statute was ambiguous and the court had no17 authority, under separation of powers grounds and under18 State law statutory interpretation grounds, to construe19 this statute to mean the opposite of what it said. And20 that's the decision that they overruled in this case,21 and that's a State law decision.22 JUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so the State can get23 mouse-trapped in this way. In -- in the first case, it24 doesn't take the case up because not too much has been25 lost, and then in the second case, the court says, oh,481111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-MS. WOODMAN:  They're taking a --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's -- that's a decisiona reason, and the reason is a Federal reason.MS. WOODMAN:  Well, no, because the -- whatsaying was that the appropriate remedy in￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425by the way, everything has been lost.  And you say thatwe can't review that because -- because the -- theState didn't -- didn't challenge Kleypas at the time.          MS. WOODMAN:  Or challenge that decision inthis case.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but that decision inthis -- they had no reason to challenge it until theState decided to -- to change it.          MS. WOODMAN:  But if they wanted to raise theissue, they could have raised it in either case, and wewouldn't have this problem here.  But they didn't raiseit, and that presents a jurisdictional problem for thisCourt.          What they're trying to do in this case isyoke a live horse to a dead one to form a plowing team,and it doesn't work.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I like that.          (Laughter.)          MS. WOODMAN:  I looked -- as a matter offact, I looked at our Kansas State seal because it hasa plowing -- a horse-drawn plow on it, and I looked atit again this morning before I came in here because Icouldn't remember whether it was one horse or two, andit's two horses.  And I was thinking about how themeaning of that State seal would be fundamentally491111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 altered if one of those horses was dead.2 (Laughter.)3 MS. WOODMAN: Thank you.4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.5 Woodman.6 General Kline, you have 4 minutes remaining.7 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PHILL KLINE8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER9 MR. KLINE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and10 may it please the Court:11 The State is here on a final court decision12 wrongfully -- the State supreme court wrongfully13 interpreting this Court's eighth amendment14 jurisprudence. And just as Justice Souter and the15 Chief Justice's hypotheticals, as it relates to this16 case, were articulated, it is actually true that in17 this case the State was not aware that this issue would18 be raised again and only conceded -- and waiver is19 truly not an issue because a lower court did not rely20 upon it. And we have some confusion between the terms21 here. It only conceded that Kleypas, a decision by the22 Kansas Supreme Court, was the law of the case in23 another case subsequently reaching the Kansas Supreme24 Court. And the Kansas Supreme Court, on its own25 motion, engaged in a full reconsideration and the501111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 respondent in their brief argues that the primary2 reliance of the court was not on eighth amendment3 jurisprudence but other grounds.4 There is no requirement for jurisdiction5 under 28-1257 that the primary reliance be on a Federal6 issue. There is a requirement to deny jurisdiction7 that there be an independent and adequate State ground8 on which the decision would rest regardless of the9 outcome of the Federal issue. Clearly that's not the10 case here.11 JUSTICE STEVENS: Wouldn't they have come out12 the same way if they never mentioned the Federal issue?1314 would not15 Kansas --16 constitutional as construed. And the Kansas court in17 this case found it unconstitutional on its face. And18 there is a significant difference, and the court raisedMR. KLINE:  This case come out -- no, itbecause the Kleypas court found that theor the Kansas death penalty was19 the issue 2021 there are22 reasoned moral decision, give effect to the belief that23 the mitigating evidence does not warrant the death24 penalty. 25The juror can state that they have a 51again.I would like to point out to the Court thatfive ways that a juror can, after their1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 reasonable doubt as to whether the State has met its2 burden of proving that the mitigating factors do not3 outweigh the aggravating factors.4 The juror can simply delay. Kansas law has a5 defect -- default for life in its sentence or in its6 structure, and I would encourage you to read on page 287 of your appendix instruction number 12 in which the jury8 is told that if, after a reasonable time, you are unable9 to make a decision -- in other words, in a doubtful10 case -- the judge is required by law to dismiss the11 jury and sentence the defendant to life. And so there12 is a default for life, and that is another way that a13 juror can give effect to their reasoned moral decision14 that death is not appropriate.15 The juror can give effect to their reasoned16 moral decision that is not appropriate by determining17 that the mitigating factors outweigh the aggravating18 factors. And the juror under instruction number 5 --19 JUSTICE STEVENS: But it cannot do that by20 determining that they're in equipoise.21 MR. KLINE: That is correct, Justice Stevens.22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Which is the very issue23 your -- your petition presents us with.24 MR. KLINE: It is, but the juror does know25 what the effect of that decision is and, therefore, is521111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 able to engage in a reasoned moral choice.2 What truly happens -- and -- and Justice3 Breyer alluded to it, I believe, as it relates to this4 hypothetical about weighing molecules -- is that a5 juror essentially steps back and decides what is the6 appropriate sentence --7 JUSTICE BREYER: No, do it. Do it.8 Make the reasoned moral choice. And the facts are that9 we have, because of the balancing, molecules or not --10 we have by the balancing made a determination that11 anything for the bad that distinguishes this person12 from the ordinary is -- is equally balanced by the13 good. Now, make the moral choice.14 MR. KLINE: I think the moral --15 JUSTICE BREYER: What is the reason?16 MR. KLINE: I think the moral decision,17 Justice Breyer, is determined in all the variables of18 the introduction of the evidence, and as this Court has19 required under the eighth amendment, that it allow the20 jury to consider and give effect to all mitigating21 evidence relevant. And that's in Kansas law.22 I would state this in closing, and that is23 that the Kansas legislature reenacted the death penalty24 for the first time since this Court struck it down in25 Furman in the spring of 1994. And in doing so, it gave531111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425great deference to this Court's role as final arbiterof the meaning of the Constitution.  And if you readthe instructions and the law that is provided to you inthis case, you will see this Court's words mirroredback to you in the scheme of the Kansas law as itrelates to the death penalty.Kline.Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, GeneralThe case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 12:08 p.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)1111 14th Street, NW Suite 40054 1-Washington, DC 20005
