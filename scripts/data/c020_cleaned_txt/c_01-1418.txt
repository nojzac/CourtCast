Elliott Archerversus Arlene L. Warner.          Mr. Goldblatt.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG GOLDBLATT               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MR. GOLDBLATT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:10111213   pre-bankruptcy debts.  That discharge, however, is subject14   to a number of statutory exceptions, each exception          An individual debtor at the end of a bankruptcycase will typically receive a discharge of that debtor's15   reflecting a congressional judgment that a particular16   category of debt be paid notwithstanding the prior17   bankruptcy.  Those exceptions include not only debts for18   money obtained by fraud, debts for injuries caused by19   drunk driving, and amounts due for alimony and child20 support.21             With respect to the fraud exception at issue22   here, under the Bankruptcy Code and this Court's cases, a23   debt is nondischargeable in bankruptcy if the creditor can24   establish that the underlying debt arises out of an act of25   fraud.  The question presented in this case is whether a31111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   debt that would otherwise be nondischargeable for that 2   reason becomes dischargeable if the parties enter into a 3   settlement agreement that resolves the amount of the debt. 4             The court of appeals said that a settlement did 5   have that effect, emphasizing that the effect of a 6   settlement was to trade a fraud claim for a contract 7   action that would be discharged in bankruptcy. 8             QUESTION:  Is it your understanding that if the 9   Fourth Circuit were correct and were to be affirmed in10   this case, that its rule would be the generally prevailing11   rule in all of the States, or would certain States differ12   on whether or not there was, in effect, a novation when13   there was a settlement agreement?  Would we have to go14   State-by-State?15             MR. GOLDBLATT:  No, Your Honor.  The question of16   dischargeability is a question of Federal law.  That is17   how each of the courts of appeals that have addressed the18   question has treated it.  Indeed, this Court, in Grogan19   versus Garner, has emphasized that the construction of20   section 523(a) of the Bankruptcy Code is a question of21   Federal law.22             QUESTION:  Well, my -- my question, perhaps, was23   not as clear as it ought to have been.  The Fourth Circuit24   placed substantial reliance on the fact that this was a25   novation under State law, that there was a new debt41111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   created superseding the old, et cetera, and my question is 2   whether or not -- if we affirm its judgment, that we will 3   find in almost every other State a settlement is also a 4   novation, or will the rule vary from State to State, and 5   if it does vary from State to State, will the Fourth 6   Circuit rule from this particular State be the majority 7   rule or minority? 8             MR. GOLDBLATT:  Your Honor, the court of appeals 9   did, indeed, say that the -- the settlement effected a10   novation.  That is a common rule.  I'm unaware of any11   jurisdiction in which that -- that wouldn't be the12   principle.  The question, nevertheless, before this Court13   is the effect as a matter of Federal bankruptcy law of14   that settlement.15             QUESTION:  I'm -- I'm well aware of that, but16   what I'm just asking is -- this case came from South17   Carolina, was it?18             MR. GOLDBLATT:  From North Carolina, Your Honor.19             QUESTION:  Oh, from North Carolina.20             MR. GOLDBLATT:  Yes.21             QUESTION:  Is the North Carolina rule about22   novations and settlements the majority rule for most of23   the States?  In most States, would this be called a24   novation?25             MR. GOLDBLATT:  Yes, Your Honor.  I'm unaware of51111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   any jurisdiction in which a settlement doesn't effect 2   novation.  When the parties to a dispute settle that 3   dispute, it is commonly the case that -- indeed, in every 4   jurisdiction of which I'm aware, following that 5   settlement, the -- the creditor or the plaintiff is unable 6   to bring a new lawsuit for fraud.  Rather, the party is 7   left to enforce the -- the settlement. 8             QUESTION:  Mr. Goldblatt, I take it you're 9   saying, yeah, a novation is fine with you.  No longer do10   they have the original claim.  They have substituted for11   it, what the claim is, the amount of the settlement.12   The -- what was it, immediate payment of X dollars?  Wasit 2,000?          MR. GOLDBLATT:  It was an immediate payment of1314151617   they say is the basis of their claim in bankruptcy.  They18   think -- they know they can't go back to the original19   claim.  To that extent, it's a novation.  That's not20   disputed.  But there is one element of the background of21   this case perhaps you can clarify for me.  It's odd that22   Leonard Warner stipulated that this was a nondischargeable23   debt, but his wife, who's in the bankruptcy with him, says24   yes, it is dischargeable.  What is the effect of the25   stipulation by Leonard Warner that this debt is61111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005$200,000 and a promissory note for $100,000.￼QUESTION:  And that's -- that's what they -- 1   nondischargeable? 2             MR. GOLDBLATT:  Your Honor, Leonard Warner 3   stipulates that the debt is nondischargeable as to him. 4   With respect to Mrs. Warner, it would remain our burden in 5   bankruptcy to show that -- that there is an act of fraud 6   that is properly attributable to her, either because she 7   committed it herself or by some principle of agency that 8   it is nondischargeable because of her, so I -- I don't 9   believe that the -- the stipulation by its terms is -- is10   dispositive on the question of whether it is11   nondischargeable as -- as to her.12             QUESTION:  But does that mean that -- let's say13   the Fourth Circuit is affirmed, that you could still,14   post-bankruptcy, go after Mr. Warner because he stipulated15   that the debt as to him was nondischargeable?16             MR. GOLDBLATT:  I -- I believe that -- that's a17   final and unappealable order at this point, and yes,18   that's right, of course.  Petitioners assert that they19   have the right as a matter of Federal bankruptcy law also20   to continue to recover on this debt as against21   Mrs. Warner, who also is an obligor on the promissory22   note.23             On the essential point that, Justice Ginsburg,24   you were making with respect to the holding below, the25   description you offered is -- is exactly right.  It is71111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   true that there is a novation.  It is true that the 2   underlying claim of fraud has been released, but just -- 3   that was equally true in this Court's decision in Brown 4   versus Felsen. 5             In Brown, the parties to a State court 6   litigation resolved that litigation by agreeing to the 7   entry of a consent judgment.  It was as equally true 8   there, as it is here, that the parties who had been -- 9   whose litigation had ended in the consent judgment were10   barred, in that case by the preclusive effect of the11   consent judgment, here by the binding effect of the12   settlement, from bringing a new suit claiming fraud.  Allthey could do was enforce the consent judgment.          Nevertheless, this Court held in a unanimousopinion in Brown versus Felsen that in bankruptcy, the1314151617181920   the underlying debt.  It was trying to find out what the21   judgment actually decided.  They were -- they were able to22   go beyond the terms of the judgment to determine what the23   judgment actually resolved.  I'm not quite sure it's24   exactly parallel --25             MR. GOLDBLATT:  Well, yes, Justice Stevens,81111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼creditor nevertheless had the right to seek to establishthat the underlying debt arises out of an act of fraud,and the -- the reason this Court --QUESTION:  Well, of course, there it wasn't just 1   that's right, and here what -- what petitioners seek to do 2   is go behind the settlement agreement -- 3             QUESTION:  Yes. 4             MR. GOLDBLATT:  -- and see what the settlement 5   actually resolved. 6             QUESTION:  Supposing the settlement -- they had 7   gone along with the settlement, and then they came up with 8   a -- a third proposal where the debtor said, I'm not sure 9   I'm going to be able to meet my obligations, but I've got10   another proposal, we'll go in the joint venture to do11   something else and we'll release the contract claim and12   substitute a third, could you go -- still continue to go13   behind to find out what the original source of the debt14 was?15             MR. GOLDBLATT:  Yes.  Yes, Your Honor.16             QUESTION:  So even if, say, they had five or six17   different transactions, each of which purported to be a18   complete substitute for the deal they had just been unable19   to -- you can always go -- say, Well, the whole thing20   started because you cheated me out of something?21             MR. GOLDBLATT:  Well -- well, for each22   particular debt that one asserts is nondischargeable, the23   creditor bears the burden of proving in bankruptcy that24   that debt arises out of an act of fraud.25             QUESTION:  Directly or indirectly out of.91111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. GOLDBLATT:  That's right, but nevertheless,under Brown versus Felsen, that is the creditor's --          QUESTION:  Suppose I have an indebtedness.  I'mrunning a business and I have one indebtedness, and inorder to cover the payments for that indebtedness, I incura second indebtedness which I otherwise would not haveincurred, is that traceable to fraud?          MR. GOLDBLATT:  If the original indebtednessarises out of an act of fraud, Justice Scalia, then --then yes, it is all debt --10111213141516171819   about here, isn't -- isn't it?  How -- how -- you know,20   how far down the line do we carry traceable to, and does a21   novation end the traceability, but you -- you have to22   acknowledge it has to end somewhere.23             MR. GOLDBLATT:  There certainly is a principle24   of proximate causation.  You -- you need to show that25   there is a direct connection between the act of fraud --101111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          QUESTION:  Anything that happens later is --that -- that wouldn't have happened but for the originalindebtedness is, within the terms of the Bankruptcy Act,traceable to the fraud?          MR. GOLDBLATT:  Justice Scalia, we -- wecertainly acknowledge that there must be some principleof, say, proximate causation.￼QUESTION:  Exactly, and that's all we're talking 1             QUESTION:  Wait, but what about -- I mean, this 2   doesn't make too much sense to me.  You say, A owes B 3   $100,000 because of a fraud that A committed against B, so 4   they settle it, and they say, our settlement arrangement 5   is the following.  We enter into a new business called 6   Macy's Department Store, and many years later there's 7   another debt between the partners arising out of buying 8   furniture for Macy's that has nothing to do with fraud, 9   and now you're saying that that debt's going to be never10   dischargeable because the cause of Macy's was the fraud?11             MR. GOLDBLATT:  No, Justice Breyer, I'm not12   suggesting that there is never a point in which the13   causation becomes too tenuous that you can't prove that14   the debt that one is contending is --15             QUESTION:  No, I -- absolutely.  Macy's would16   never have been created but for the debt, no doubt about17 that.18             MR. GOLDBLATT:  But not -- not only is -- is the19   principle of --20             QUESTION:  They never would have had this21   furniture argument but for the debt.22             QUESTION:  Well, you're talking not just about23   cause, but about proximate cause.24             MR. GOLDBLATT:  Exactly.  It's not just a25   question of but-for causation, but as in common law,111111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   proximate causation. 2             QUESTION:  And what does that mean, proximate 3   cause, then?  What's the difference between this case and 4   Macy's? 5             MR. GOLDBLATT:  Your Honor, here, all that 6   happened is that the -- the form of the debt changed.  The 7   parties entered into a settlement agreement in which they 8   changed the debt from an unliquidated cause of action for 9   fraud into a liquidated promissory note.10             QUESTION:  In -- in connection with that, one11   side said to the other, I don't care whether this has come12   out of fraud or not.  Regardless of whether it came out of13   fraud, I'm going to give you this money, and we'll be14   quits.  Why isn't that enough to terminate the proximity,15   because the averment of both parties is, never mind fraud,16   it doesn't have anything to do with fraud, we're going to17   settle this.  Whether there was fraud or whether there￼wasn't fraud, you get the money.          MR. GOLDBLATT:  That -- that's right, Your18192021222324   was -- there was no acknowledgement of the fraud.  It was25   given with the averment that this debt does not hinge upon121111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005Honor, and all a creditor seeks to do in showing a debt asnondischargeable is seeks to enforce the debtor's promiseto pay the amount of money given in that settlement.QUESTION:  That's true, but -- but here it1   fraud.  This debt is just to settle this controversy2   between us whether there was fraud or whether there wasn't3   fraud.4567   bankruptcy?89 10          MR. GOLDBLATT:  Just a couple of -- of answers.First, it -- it doesn't terminate the proximity any morethan the consent judgment in Brown versus Felsen mightMR. GOLDBLATT:  That's --          QUESTION:  Why isn't that enough to terminatethe proximity necessary for -- for nondischargeability in11   have terminated the proximity in that case.  It's, of1213141516171819202122232425course, true that a -- a consent judgment operates as a --extinguishes the prior cause of action and the claimsmerge into the consent judgment.          Nevertheless, this Court said in Brown versusFelsen that notwithstanding the preclusive effect of thatjudgment, a creditor has the right in bankruptcy toestablish that the debt is traceable to fraud, and what itsaid is --          QUESTION:  But doesn't a consent judgmentalways, at -- always hinge upon the existence of a causeof action?￼and --  MR. GOLDBLATT:  Presumably yes, Your Honor,  QUESTION:  Whereas a settlement doesn't.131111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1             MR. GOLDBLATT:  That's right, and unless the 2   creditor can prove in bankruptcy that the debt that's now 3   reflected in -- in the settlement agreement is traceable 4   to an act of fraud, the creditor will lose the 5   nondischargeability action, and the only question is 6   whether the creditor should have the opportunity to 7   establish in bankruptcy that there is, in fact, an act of 8   fraud that -- that is reflected in and resolved by the 9   consent judgment.10             The consent judgment that says expressly -- it11   doesn't say there's no fraud.  It says that this is a12   compromise of disputed claims, and in exchange for the13   release, what the creditor got was a clear carve-out from14   that release for the right to enforce the $100,000 of debt15   that's reflected in the promissory note.16             QUESTION:  It doesn't say there's no fraud, but17   it does say that this indebtedness has nothing to do with18   whether or not there was fraud.  Whether or not there was￼19202122232425fraud --MR. GOLDBLATT:  That's right.  The settlement --          QUESTION:  -- this indebtedness exists.  Itseems to me it severs the connection between the fraud andthe indebtedness.          MR. GOLDBLATT:  But it is completely silent onthe question of whether fraud had occurred, just as the141111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051   consent judgment in Brown v. Felsen was completely silent2   on the question whether that debt arose out of contract or3   fraud.  In Brown, this Court said that the creditor has4   the opportunity to look behind the fraud -- to look behind5   the settlement to determine whether or not it was for6   fraud, and there -- there's no difference here.7             Your Honor --8             QUESTION:  Would there be -- would there be a9   difference if the settlement had expressly said, we10   stipulate that there was no fraud leading to the creation11   of the debt of -- for which this in effect is a -- a12   novation?13MR. GOLDBLATT:  Justice Souter --QUESTION:  Would that make a difference?MR. GOLDBLATT:  Justice Souter, that would be a14151617   briefs.  We contend as a matter of bankruptcy policy there18   are reasons why such an agreement shouldn't be enforced,19   but that would certainly be a much more difficult case￼much harder case for reasons we set out in -- in our20   than this one.21             QUESTION:  But your argument here is we don't22   really have to get to bankruptcy policy.  There simply has23   not been an agreement which eliminates the fraudulent24   character of the debt.  Is that basically it?25             MR. GOLDBLATT:  That's -- that's exactly right,151111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   Justice Souter. 2             The way this works in bankruptcy is that when 3   the debtor files for bankruptcy with this promissory note 4   outstanding for a hundred-and-some-thousand dollars, the 5   creditor comes into bankruptcy and files a proof of claim 6   saying, I have a claim of a hundred-and-some- thousand 7   dollars, and I'm entitled to my pro rata distribution on 8   that hundred-and-some-thousand dollars.  The proof of 9   claim is on page 82 of the joint appendix.10             No one's contending that the release bars the11   creditor from seeking recovery on the amount of that debt.12   The only question is whether they can receive recovery in13   the full amount of the debt by showing it's14   nondischargeable, or whether they're limited to simply the15   cents on the dollar that the claim will pay in bankruptcy,16   because the text of the Bankruptcy Code makes clear that17   the form of the debt doesn't matter, that a debt -- that18   under section 523, a debt can take any number of19   different -- under -- I'm sorry.20             Under section 523 of the Bankruptcy Code, any21   debt, the code says, is nondischargeable if it's traceable22   to an act of fraud, and the code defines debt very broadly23   to include debts that are liquidated, unliquidated,24   reduced to judgment, et cetera.  It's quite clear the form25   of the debt doesn't matter, unless --161111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  But the traceability does, and that'swhat we're talking about here, how traceable is traceable.          MR. GOLDBLATT:  That's right, Justice Scalia,and with respect to that question there is -- there is nodifference between a consent judgment that is a finaladjudication of the claims between the parties and asettlement agreement, both of which are equallypreclusive, and both of which are equally silent on thequestion of whether fraud occurred.          Unless the Court has further questions, I'llreserve the balance of my time.101112131415161718192021222324   dischargeability.  That conclusion is confirmed by Brown,25   which held that a creditor who settles a fraud claim by171111 14th Street, N.W.

BLATTON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,￼      SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERSMS. BLATT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court:          When a creditor settles a fraud claim withoutresolving the disputed issue of fraud, the creditor hasthe right to enforce the settlement debt for the fullamount in bankruptcy by filing a proof of claim and byestablishing fraud in response to the defense of1   consent judgment may establish fraud in response to a2   bankruptcy --3             QUESTION:  But the real inquiry in Brown, as I4   read it, is can we go behind a judgment to see what was5   actually determined by the judgment.  It wasn't any6   emphasis on the settlement aspect of it, as I read the7   opinion.89MS. BLATT:  Right.          QUESTION:  And I guess the holding is, yes, youmay go behind a judgment to see what was decided, and thatseems to me a little different from going behind a101112   settlement.          QUESTION:  Well, didn't Brown decide twoseparate issues?1314151617181920   litigated.21             The question before the bankruptcy court in22   Brown is whether the money owed under that consent23   judgment was money obtained by fraud.  So, too, the exact24   same question is relevant here.25 QUESTION: It didn't look to what the Court had 181111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          MS. BLATT:  The Court in Brown did two things.The Court -- the question of fraud was not litigated inBrown because the case was settled, and the Courtmentioned in its last footnote that there would be adifferent situation if the question of fraud was actually￼ 1   decided, but what the claim was about, but here we have 2   something in addition.  There is a judicial order.  There 3   was a complaint filed, and it was dismissed as part of the 4   settlement.  That complaint in the court action was 5   dismissed with prejudice.  What effect should that have? 6             MS. BLATT:  Not -- a dismissal with prejudice 7   following a settlement.  As this Court stated in Lawlor 8   versus National Screen Service, it's cited in the reply 9   brief at page 9, is that it has -- does not have10   preclusive effect on the disputed issue unless the11   judgment is accompanied by specific findings on the12   disputed issue, and that's the classic requirement for13   issue preclusion or collateral estoppel, that the matter14   be actually litigated.15             QUESTION:  We're not talking issue preclusion,16   just -- just as far as whether it suffices to terminate17   the traceability.  That -- that isn't necessarily18   coextensive with -- with whether there was issue19   preclusion.20             MS. BLATT:  No, the -- the dismissal with21   prejudice doesn't impair the creditor's right to walk into22   court and sue to enforce the settlement debt, including23   the right to try to get the full amount of the settlement24   debt in bankruptcy, and on this issue of traceability,25   it -- it is not only identical to Brown, but the code by191111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1   its express terms disclaims any distinction between a2   liquidated debt and an unliquidated debt.  The settlement3   in Brown and the settlement here converts an unliquidated4   fraud claim into a liquidated claim to collect on the5   settlement debt.6             QUESTION:  May I -- would you just clear up one7   thing for me?  Say the fraud claim was for $300,000 and8 9101112131415161718192021the contract was -- the novation was $200,000, in thebankruptcy court do you contend they can get the full 300or just the 200?          MS. BLATT:  No.  Under -- under -- he wouldbe -- the -- the creditor would be bound by the settlementagreement under principles of State law that the amount ofhis debt would only be the $200,000.          QUESTION:  It seems like a strange result,doesn't it?          QUESTION:  I don't understand that.          QUESTION:  Why shouldn't he get the full amount?          QUESTION:  You conduct this big inquiry and findout that the guy's been defrauded of $300, and then that￼     the settlement agreement really covers up a fraud and you22   say, Well, but you know, a deal's a deal.  Even though you23   defrauded him of it and the whole thing's traceable to24   fraud, we're only going to give you $200,000.  That's very25   strange.201111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MS. BLATT:  I'm sorry, are you talking about thesettlement agreement itself was procured by fraud?          QUESTION:  No, no, no, no.  No, the settlementagreement was just an arm's-length agreement, but if youfind that, in fact, the debt underlying that -- thatagreement was fraudulently obtained, having gone throughall the trouble of determining that fact, why don't youmake the guy cough up all the money that he got by fraud?               MS. BLATT:  The Court -- the Court addressed10   this very issue in Brown.  The creditor there did not get11   a fraud judgment for exemplary damages and special --12   special damages under State law.  He was limited to, in13   bankruptcy, of just seeking this settlement debt, and what14   the bankruptcy code does is, it gives the creditor a15   statutory right to render that settlement debt16   nondischargeable if fraud can be -- can be shown.17             You don't -- and there's another way of looking18   at it, too.  The Court --19             QUESTION:  But -- but what's the policy reason20   behind that.  I mean, if -- if what we're concerned about21   is vindicating the Federal policy that the -- the22   Bankruptcy Code protects only honest debtors and not23   dishonest debtors, why not give them the whole $300,000?24   I mean, I -- I know Brown didn't do that, but why didn't25 it do that?211111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1             MS. BLATT:  The Court in Grogan -- it's because 2   of two issues, Justice Kennedy.  Under State -- State law 3   determines the amount of the debt that is owed, and 4   there's just no question, at least I don't think that the 5   creditor could make an argument that he's owed any more 6   than $300,000.  He can't relitigate and try to get up to 7   $600,000.  That's just governed by State law. 8             QUESTION:  Well, the Fourth Circuit -- the 9   Fourth Circuit says State law says that this is a10   novation, too, so -- and you're -- you don't want us to be11   bound by that interpretation of State law.12             MS. BLATT:  The -- again, this Court in Grogan13   versus Carter said that State law determines the amount of14   the debt, and I just don't think the creditor would have a15   good faith argument that he could go beyond the settlement16   agreement, but on the question of nondischargeability,17   what the creditor is trying to do is collect the entire18   amount of the debt by -- by showing fraud, and we think19   applying Brown --20             QUESTION:  What their main argument, I think, on21   the other side is, you get a debt, that's what it is, a22   debt for money obtained by fraud, and this is not a debt23   for money obtained by fraud, this is a debt for money owed24   under a settlement agreement.25             Now, the virtue of that is, it's a bright line,221111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1   and what we're saying, I think, in the negative -- the2   negative of it is that if you depart from that, well3   there's no end to it.  You have a settlement agreement,4   and no matter how long you go into the future, whatever it5   is, that -- whatever it says you're supposed to do in that6   settlement agreement, it is.  Use the words proximate7   cause, use whatever they want, but it is a debt.  Where it8 9101112131415161718192021222324comes from is the fraud.          That's where the source of the debt is, nomatter what it says in that settlement agreement, andthere's just no stopping place, no way to look into it, noattenuation forever, et cetera, so that's what I'd likeyou to here address.          MS. BLATT:  Well, this Court already crossedthat bridge in Brown.          QUESTION:  Well, all right, so then maybe Brownwas wrong.          MS. BLATT:  But the second point is that --          QUESTION:  Maybe it was wrong.          MS. BLATT:  Whatever the limits of thetraceability point, which this Court addressed in aseparate decision, Cohen versus de la Cruz, which dealtwith the traceability aspects --￼               QUESTION:  There is no traceability.  There's25   never a problem.  Underlying this was the fraud.  Whatever231111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9it says in that settlement agreement is based on fraud.          MS. BLATT:  The code itself says that anyenforceable obligation, whether or not it's liquidated orunliquidated or appears in a judgment, if you can provethat there has been a fraudulent acquisition of money, theresulting debt is nondischargeable, and that is --          QUESTION:  Ms. Blatt, what is your -- what isthe Government's position if the parties had expresslydealt with it in the settlement agreement?               MS. BLATT:  We think the right would be subject11   to waiver.  We don't think -- we don't see anything in the10code that would be --          QUESTION:  So you don't agree with petitioner's121314151617181920   litigation.  Was that not a waiver of this claim?21             MS. BLATT:  No, it certainly wasn't a waiver of22   the right to collect on the debt, and in fact there's an23   express preservation of not only the right to collect all24   the obligations under the promissory note, but to collect25   the amounts under the settlement agreement, and we think241111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005counsel that it's a harder case, but wouldn't give it up?          MS. BLATT:  We think the right can be waived.￼What we do think, though --          QUESTION:  All right, now, the language in thisparticular settlement agreement gave up claims arising outof or relating to the matter of the State court 1   to apply a contrary rule, the rule that the court below 2   applied, would be unsound for three reasons. 3             It would force creditors and parties trying to 4   settle a case to start negotiating over bankruptcy 5   contingencies that are purely hypothetical, may never 6   happen, and are entirely extraneous to the settlement. 7   The rule adopted by Brown also, our second point, is that 8   it reflects the common sense and ordinary understanding 9   that settlements preserve the creditor's right to enforce10   the settlement agreement and the statutory right to prove11   fraud to render the debt enforceable, notwithstanding12   bankruptcy, and that has been the premise of hundreds, if13   not thousands of settlement agreements entered into by the14   Government that do not refer to bankruptcy contingencies.15             Third, to hold that those settlement agreements16   waive the creditor's rights in bankruptcy would render17   debts dischargeable even where the debtor committed fraud,18   and that result would undermine congressional policy to19   favor the rights of innocent victims of fraud over the20   perpetrators of fraud.21             QUESTION:  But you do agree that some fraud22   claims could be waived as far as the dischargeability,23   because you wrote the rights settlement agreement.24             MS. BLATT:  Yes, if there was an affirmative25   manifestation of an intent.251111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  Why isn't that inconsistent with thestatutory policy, just as this case would be?          MS. BLATT:  Because there is a backgroundpresumption, Justice Stevens, that rights are subject towaiver, and so if there's an intentional relinquishment ofa Federal statutory right, then a court can give thateffect, but not only is there silence on that issue inthis case, there is an express reservation of the right toenforce the settlement agreement, and --QUESTION:  To enforce the settlement agreement.MS. BLATT:  Yes, and that includes --QUESTION:  But that's not a reservation of the10111213141516   the full amount in bankruptcy.  By asking the bankruptcy17   court, not only by filing the proof of claim, but toright to sue for fraud.          MS. BLATT:  They're not suing for fraud.They're suing to collect on the settlement agreement for￼18   render the debt survivable and enforceable in bankruptcy.19   It's no different than the settlement judgment in -- in20 Brown. 2122 23 24 25QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Blatt.Mr. Ayer, we'll hear from you.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. AYER       ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT  MR. AYER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may261111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425it please the Court:          I would like to make four points this morning.The first one, to pick up on what Justice O'Connor said, Ithink there's a fundamental misconception in the questionas it's presented and as it was described by Mr. Goldblattthis morning, and this conception is that what we'redealing with here is a categorical rule that says thatwhenever you have a settlement, because it's a contract,it bars any further pursuit of a nondischarge claim.          That is completely inconsistent with theholdings of the court below, all of which lookedspecifically at the language of the release and concludedthat what had specifically been released was the right topursue the claim under 523.Second --          QUESTION:  This would have been a release inState court proceedings?          MR. AYER:  Correct, Your Honor, and -- and thatleads to the second point, which is that what is at issuehere really is the interpretation of the language, thespecific language --          QUESTION:  There's no language about 523, whichyou just said --          MR. AYER:  That's correct, Your Honor.          QUESTION:   -- this is a standard settlement.271111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   It's a compromise.  Neither side is admitting anything. 2   One side is not admitting fraud, and the other side isn't 3   saying we've proved fraud.  It's just a zero on there. 4             MR. AYER:  Well, Your Honor, I think what you 5   said in terms of the language is certainly correct. 6   I think the important issue is that this is a settlement 7   and, indeed, there is also a -- a voluntary dismissal with 8   prejudice in a State court case.  I would submit the 9   proper analysis of that is to interpret the settlement10   under State law and then ask the question, is there some11   problem with Federal bankruptcy law that requires you to12   somehow override what's been agreed to or what's been done13   in State court.14             QUESTION:  But isn't -- isn't the problem with15   approaching it that way -- I -- at least, I think the16   problem with approaching it that way is that there is no17   State law analog to the issue that is being raised here.18   In other words, under -- under State law, there was a19   fraud claim, there was a settlement of the fraud claim,20   but there is no issue under State law about bankruptcy,21   and that is strictly a -- a Federal policy --22             MR. AYER:  Well --23             QUESTION:  -- and I don't know how we get --24   we -- we look to State law to find out whether there is25   doubt or not, but I don't know why State law should be a281111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   source of an answer to this Federal question, which is 2   peculiarly Federal. 3             MR. AYER:  Well, I -- I don't think, Your Honor, 4   that it is the final answer, but it seems to me it's 5   entirely possible for parties in a State court proceeding 6   to enter into a settlement that says, and we hereby 7   specifically release our 523 claim, and had that been -- 8             QUESTION:  They -- they might be able to -- I 9   mean, I'll assume for the sake of argument that they might10   be able to do that, but in -- in that case, the -- the11   issue here would be resolved, on -- on your theory,12   certainly, by the express agreement with the parties, and13   they didn't do that, so we've got a case in which they14   didn't agree on the issue expressly, and I don't see why15   State law, which doesn't have the issue, is a good place16   to look for the answer.17             MR. AYER:  Well, I think -- I guess my point,18   Your Honor, is that the question of whether they expressly19   agreed to it becomes a question of interpretation, and I20   would like to get to arguing that they did, in fact,21   expressly agree to it.  The first --22             QUESTION:  Well, didn't Brown versus Felsen23   suggest some discouragement to the idea of anticipatory24   litigation in State courts of issues that would arise in25   bankruptcy court?291111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1             MR. AYER:  I -- I think Brown versus Felsen 2   certainly expressed the view that they didn't want to 3   encourage people to have to affirmatively determine fraud 4   in State court when it had been, in fact, been -- been -- 5   the issue of nondischargeability had been put into the 6   bankruptcy court, but nothing in Brown versus Felsen in 7   any way qualifies the proposition that parties can, in a 8   State court proceeding, resolve, for example, by trial an 9   issue of fraud that would be preclusive under collateral10   estoppel.11             QUESTION:  You say it doesn't qualify the12   proposition.  It doesn't address the proposition.MR. AYER:  Correct.QUESTION:  Suppose --MR. AYER:  But it does, Your Honor, address it1314151617181920   estoppel here.  That argument absolutely dumbfounded me,21   frankly, because for collateral estoppel, issue22   preclusion, you must have raised, actually litigated,23   there must be a court determination of the issue, and that24   determination must be essential to the judgment.  You25   don't have any actual litigation here, so I don't know how301111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼in the sense, and then Grogan confirms that collateralestoppel does apply, so that if you have a Stateproceeding --QUESTION:  There's -- there's no collateral1 you can -- 2             MR. AYER:  Your Honor, under this Court's 3   Matsushita decision, it is perfectly clear that in order 4   to determine whether there's issue preclusion, you have to 5   look at the State law in the State where the judgment is 6   entered, and -- and the State law, as we indicate in our 7   brief, in North Carolina is that if you have a voluntary 8   dismissal with prejudice under the Miller Building case, 9   under the Barnes case, that voluntary dismissal with10   prejudice resolves the issues that were put in issue --11             QUESTION:  The only decision that you cite from12   the North Carolina Supreme Court says, we go down the line13   with what is the standard understanding of issue14   preclusion, actually litigated, decided, and essential to15   the judgment.16             MR. AYER:  Your Honor, I --17             QUESTION:  That's what the North Carolina18   Supreme Court said.19             MR. AYER:  I disagree, Your Honor.  The -- the20   Thomas McInnis case that you're referring to is a case21   where what actually happened with regard to the issue of22   whether prejudgment interest was available was that a23   husband, in litigating that issue, in fact, failed to24   timely raise it, and when he failed to timely raise it,25   the wife was subsequently collaterally estopped from311111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1234   estoppel.  There are multiple cases, Your Honor, in North5   Carolina that are entirely clear that the rule is that if6   you have a voluntary dismissal with prejudice, thatpursuing it.          There's one sentence in the Thomas McInnis casethat says, we apply the usual principles of collateral 7   voluntary dismissal is determinative as though the matter, 8   and this of -- almost a quote, as though -- 9             QUESTION:  Well, that would certainly run10   entirely against the stream, and it would run against the11   Restatement of Judgments, which you cite, and that says12   you must manifest -- yes, parties can make a stipulation13   finding.  They can do it in a consent judgment just as14   they can in the settlement, but they have to make that15   manifest.￼16171819202122232425          MR. AYER:  Right.          QUESTION:  The court does not infer that anissue that was never litigated was, in fact, decided.          MR. AYER:  I guess what -- what I would like tosuggest to -- to the Court is that what we do have here isa settlement of a State court litigation followed by avoluntary dismissal with prejudice, that the effect ofthat, of those acts, including the language, becausethat's what the courts here -- all three of these courtsfocus specifically on the precise language, and they321111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051   concluded that that language was a waiver.  I would submit2345   has a problem with that.  The question is whether there6   is -- is a waiver on the disputed fact issue, and -- and7   my -- my question to you is, you -- you refer to thethat was --          QUESTION:  Well, if they concluded that it's awaiver of claim, and we don't have any -- I presume no one 8   myriad State law cases that hold in your favor.  Is it 9   clear that those are cases on issue preclusion --10             MR. AYER:  Yes, Your Honor.11             QUESTION:  -- as opposed to claim preclusion --12             MR. AYER:  Yes, Your Honor --13             QUESTION:  -- or res judicata?14             MR. AYER:  The -- the Miller Building case and15   the Barnes case, both of those cases involved collateral16   estoppel.  It was invoked by a new party, and it was17   clearly based upon the fact that the -- that the matter18   had been -- in one case, it was a voluntary stipulation19   with prejudice.  The other was a voluntary --￼202122232425          QUESTION:  Well, was it a stipulation that --that expressly addressed the -- the fact issue?          MR. AYER:  I don't believe you can tell from theopinion, and that's not, certainly, what they rely on.The principle that is stated in those cases in a -- in acategorical way, and I can -- I can read it to the Court,331111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   is that -- let's see. 2             QUESTION:  May I read you the language from 3   McInnis, which is the North Carolina Supreme Court?  It 4   was not just simply a statement that, we recognize issue 5   preclusion in its traditional guise.  It was, issue 6   preclusion does not apply unless, quote, the prior suit 7   resulted in a judgment on the merits, identical issues are 8   involved, the issue was actually litigated, the issue was 9   actually determined.10             Now, you're asking us to reject that as the law11   of the -- North Carolina.12             MR. AYER:  Well, I -- I think, Your Honor, there13   are -- there are many Federal court cases that recognize14   that a matter which is not actually litigated in the sense15   that it went to trial and was determined after a trial or16   a fact-finding.  If the parties intend for a settlement17   agreement to be preclusive, and that is incorporated into18   a judgment, that will have collateral estoppel effect, and19   that's what happened --20             QUESTION:  Well, are you relying on -- I thought21   you were relying on North Carolina law.22             MR. AYER:  We are.  I'm simply trying to point23   out that the notion that there is some sweeping,24   overarching general law that says it always must be25   actually litigated, that that, in fact, is not correct.341111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1             QUESTION:  No, I -- no, no, we made it plain,2   and I don't think there's any question here that the3   parties can stipulate, and the stipulation will have --4   will have the same effect as a finding, but, as the5   Restatement of Judgments points out, that must be made6   manifest.  You don't imply it from words that don't say,7 8 9and we stipulate that this claim is going to bedischargeable in bankruptcy.               MR. AYER:  Well, what -- let me suggest to the10   Court a -- a way in which this was clear.  First of all,11   I -- I do really want to emphasize that -- that all three12   of the opinions of the court below, none of them adopt13   this sort of categorical, it's a contract, therefore the14   right is waived approach.  That is not the issue in any of15   these cases.  They all look at the specific language, and￼16171819202122232425they reason to the conclusion.          The -- the court of appeals, for example,specifically said that, quote, a --          QUESTION:  Where are you quoting from, Mr. Ayer?What page?          MR. AYER:  Let's see, here.  Page 10a of the --of the appendix.          QUESTION:  Thank you.          MR. AYER:  The petition appendix.          They said, in invoking the novation concept,351111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051234   Honor, it's -- it's 9a.  If you look at the end of the5   first paragraph, under the novation theory, courts need6   only address -- wait a minute.  I'm sorry, the top of the7   page on 9a.  When following the novation theory, the terms8   of the settlement should be examined to determine whether9   the nondischargeability claims were released.it's necessary --          QUESTION:  Whereabouts on the page are you?          MR. AYER:  It's actually -- I'm sorry, Your10             The rest of that page is an examination of the11   terms, and if you look over onto the next page, 10a, they12   quote the West case, which says, a promissory note does13   not discharge the underlying obligation unless the parties14   expressly release and substitute the new.  That is what15   these cases are all about, all three of them, and the16   question of whether the settlement released the claim is a17   question, I would submit, in the first instance -- not in18   the last instance, but in the first instance, it's a19   question of State law, and --20             QUESTION:  I think there's no dispute that the21   settlement released the claim.  There's no dispute that22   there was a novation here.  There's no dispute that they23   no longer have the original fraud claim.  They have a24   claim only on the promissory note that they got as a25 result of the settlement, so it -- they're -- they're not 361111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   claiming, oh, we can go back to the day we filed our fraud 2   complaint.  They're saying, we have a debt here, a 3   promissory note, and that is the sum total of what we can 4   claim. 5             MR. AYER:  Right, but Your Honor, the -- the 6   holding of all the courts below went beyond what Your 7   Honor is saying. 8             QUESTION:  The words that you read -- 9             MR. AYER:  Well --10             QUESTION:  -- are simply supportive of that --11             MR. AYER:  -- let me -- let me --12             QUESTION:  -- but you can't -- you can't get13   anything more than the amount of the promissory note that14   results from the settlement.15             MR. AYER:  Well, let me refer the Court, for16   example, to 35a of the petition appendix, where it is17   stated that, quote, by including in the release future18 claims --19             QUESTION:  What -- what is this from, this is20   the opinion of the bankruptcy court?21             MR. AYER:  This is the opinion of the bankruptcy22   court.  I'm just trying to -- this was the consistent23   analysis in all of these courts.  By including in the24   release future claims, the court concludes that the25   plaintiffs effectively released and extinguished the371111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1   dischargeability claim which they now seek to assert.2             QUESTION:  Well, that's a new, different issue3   than we granted, isn't it?  I mean, that's -- the4   question, I take it, is, we're assuming there is a5   novation, there is a settlement, and fine, and that6   settlement says, I promise to pay $200,000, so it's a7   debt.  It's a debt for money, and the question is, is it a8   debt for money obtained by actual fraud?9 10MR. AYER:  Well --QUESTION:  If so, how do we characterize that11 debt?12             MR. AYER:  I --13             QUESTION:  You're saying it was, but it was14   released.  I -- I don't see that we reach that.          MR. AYER:  Well, whether -- whether this is adifferent issue than you granted, I guess -- I -- I agreethat the question as it was presented in the petition --151617181920   blanket rule.  That is not --21             QUESTION:  Well, I -- I would assume that the22   text and the wording here that you're relying on, and the23   rule of the State about a novation and so forth, are --24   are prevalent, not universal, but are -- are the standard25   form of -- of settlement and release in almost every381111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼QUESTION:  Yes.MR. AYER:  -- is most easily read as this broad, 1   State, and apparently the novation rule is standard as 2   well, so the -- the result that you're asking us to reach 3   is that this also forecloses any Federal characterization 4   of this as being a debt incurred by fraud, and -- and 5   that's a very sweeping statement, and a very sweeping6 rule. 7             MR. AYER:  Well, I -- I think -- I think there 8   is -- I think the ultimate question, and the last question 9   and the fourth question I'm hoping to get to, and I will10   get to now, is the question of, if -- if you agree with me11   for purposes of argument that initially, you look to see12   what the State settlement does and, indeed, here also what13   the effect under State law of the voluntary discharge with14   prejudice is -- voluntary dismissal with prejudice is,15   and -- and you see, as these courts below held, that the16   effect is, in fact, to give up the right, then the17   question is, is there something about Federal bankruptcy18   law or policy that prevents parties from voluntarily19   agreeing to do that?20             QUESTION:  May I go back just one step?  Suppose21   this settlement had been entered as a consent judgment,22   just as was the case in Brown against Felsen, what then?23             MR. AYER:  I think it would depend, Your Honor,24   what was in the consent judgment.25             QUESTION:  Nothing.  The Court just enters --391111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   there's -- the parties' settlement is incorporated in the 2   consent judgment. 3             MR. AYER:  I -- I think it would become a 4   question of whether, under the laws of the place where the 5   consent judgment is entered, the fact that there's a 6   settlement that is somehow appended to that order, if it's 7   appended, whether that becomes limiting or defining of the 8   terms of what's agreed to. 9             If all you have -- I would agree with this.  If10   all you have --11             QUESTION:  Wasn't -- in -- in Brown against12   Felsen, there wasn't -- the settlement was not on the13   record?14             MR. AYER:  There's -- there's no discussion,15   Your Honor.  In fact, what's pretty clear in Brown versus16   Felsen, and the critical difference between Brown and this17   case is that there was no -- there was no kind of any18   release of a fraud claim.  You simply had the settlement,￼19202122232425and the -- the creditor got paid, and -- and nobody hadyet proven affirmatively that there was fraud.          What this Court said is, on those facts, you getto come in and prove fraud.          QUESTION:  Okay, so you're -- you're thenconceding the following, is that right, that if, in fact,I owe you $300,000 because I cheated you by fraud, we then401111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051   enter into a settlement which might be approved by the2   court, assume it is, and what that settlement says is, in3   light of what you claim I did to you, cheat you through4   fraud, I promise to pay $200,000, and you are conceding if5   that's all there is to the case, that that is6   nondischargeable?7 8 9          MR. AYER:  I -- I am at least conceding thatthere's no waiver of the right to argue --          QUESTION:  Well, I want to know on my -- thefacts I just gave you --101112131415   nondischargeable?16             MR. AYER:  If it amounts to a clear concession17   that there was fraud, yes.18             QUESTION:  No.  What I'm saying is, you have the19   facts I gave you.20             MR. AYER:  Okay.21             QUESTION:  Remember what they were.22             MR. AYER:  In consideration of --23             QUESTION:  You said it was $300,000 obtained by24   fraud.  I said, I will settle that by entering into this25   piece of paper which says, I promise to pay 200.411111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MR. AYER:  Well, it -- it --QUESTION:  -- in your opinion --MR. AYER:  Your --QUESTION:  -- is that 200,000 debt￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. AYER:  I -- I would say --          QUESTION:  Approved by the court.          MR. AYER:  I would -- I would say that that isnon -- that is not nondischargeable without affirmativelyproving fraud, although you would --          QUESTION:  There are -- there are too manynegatives in your statement.          MR. AYER:  Well, you --          QUESTION:  I'm lost.          (Laughter.)          MR. AYER:  That leaves --          QUESTION:  I give -- remember my example.  I1011121314151617181920   prove fraud.  Your -- your hypothetical does not establish21   fraud.22 23 24 25          QUESTION:  Oh, okay, but you're saying you havean opportunity --          MR. AYER:  Yes.          QUESTION:  -- to prove the fraud?421111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005want to say, in your opinion, is that nondischargeable,yes or no?MR. AYER:  It is not non -- it is --(Laughter.)MR. AYER:  It is not clear from the hypothetical￼that it is nondischargeable, but it is certainly not --you have the opportunity to come into bankruptcy court and1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. AYER:  Absolutely.          QUESTION:  And your case is different from thatin -- I gave in which respect?          MR. AYER:  In the respect --          QUESTION:  In the release?          MR. AYER:  In the respect that our case includedlanguage which was interpreted by all three of thesecourts as a release -- under State law as a release of theright to go to bankruptcy court and pursue --          QUESTION:  Fine, and the reason that's in thequestion presented is?10111213141516   below.17          QUESTION:  Yes, it isn't in the questionpresented, that's what I thought.          MR. AYER:  The reason it's in the questionpresented is because it's --it is the holding of the case￼1819202122232425          QUESTION:  Well --          MR. AYER:  The case below doesn't --          QUESTION:  -- the -- the question presented,Mr. Ayer, is whether a debt that would otherwise benondischargeable becomes dischargeable if the partiesenter a settlement agreement under which the amount of thedebt is -- it literally doesn't say anything about fraudor collateral estoppel.          MR. AYER:  That's correct, Your Honor.  I guess431111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9what I would say is that that question is --          QUESTION:  You're answering the question.  Youjust want to answer it, maybe, right?          MR. AYER:  Well, that's right.  The answer ismaybe, and it depends --          QUESTION:  Sometimes yes, sometimes no.          MR. AYER:  -- and what it depends upon is, hasthere been a basis on which to conclude that that righthas been given up, and the answer is that no such basis10   arises simply because there's a settlement contract.  We11   do not claim that, and neither did any of the courts12   below.  There -- there's nobody here in this courtroom or13   in this case who says, that's the rule of law.  That you14   can say it's not the rule of law and everybody will agree15   with you, but that's not the issue in the case.16             QUESTION:  Okay, taking your terms, everybody, I17   guess, agrees that if the settlement agreement said, we18   agree, the two parties, that there was no fraud involved19   in the creation of the debt which this agreement settles,20   that that would, in fact, be preclusive, that they could21   not, in fact, prove fraud and -- and nondischargeability.22   Why is the settlement here like the settlement I just23   described, because that, as I understand it, is your24   argument.  There's no legal difference between the25   settlement we've got here, which says nothing about fraud,441111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1   and the settlement that I described in which fraud is2   expressly addressed.  Why are the two alike?3             MR. AYER:  Well, one reason why, and this --4   this gets back to my point that I think you have to take a5   State court settlement under State law first to understand6   it, this -- this settlement, among the other language of7   releases which we've talked about, also includes language8   that commits to filing a voluntary dismissal with9 prejudice.10111213141516171819202122232425          Now, as I've indicated, in order --          QUESTION:  Well, isn't -- isn't that what anyneither party settlement does?          MR. AYER:  Well, it may or may not, Your Honor,but in this case in North Carolina, under North Carolinalaw, under Miller Building and Barnes, when you file avoluntary dismissal with prejudice, it is as though thematter were litigated to a conclusion and the plaintifflost, and --          QUESTION:  I thought that --          QUESTION:  So far as --          QUESTION:  I thought that was true, certainlytrue as far as claim preclusion goes.          MR. AYER:  Right.  It's --          QUESTION:  It's claim-precluded, but youconstantly mixed up --451111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6   with prejudice is preclusive of that claim.  You can never 7   bring that claim again, but it resolves no issues. 8             MR. AYER:  Well, Your -- Your Honor, that -- 9   that is the law in many places.  That is not the law in10   North Carolina, and I simply -- I know this Court doesn't11   spend its time deciding State law issues, but --12             QUESTION:  I haven't seen a single North13   Carolina Supreme Court decision that so holds, that a14   voluntary -- I thought that North Carolina rules, by the15   way, were based on the Federal rules with respect to the16   voluntary dismissal rule.  Isn't that so?17             MR. AYER:  I -- I think the rules are somewhat18   similar.  I've not studied them to know how preciselyMR. AYER:  Well --          QUESTION:  -- claim preclusion and issuepreclusion --MR. AYER:  Well, Your Honor --QUESTION:  -- and yes, a voluntary dismissal￼19202122232425parallel they are.          QUESTION:  And -- and the voluntary dismissal isclaim-preclusive but not issue-preclusive?          MR. AYER:  Well, let me -- let me just quote,because I -- I've found it -- the language in MillerBuilding and Barnes is that a voluntary dismissal withprejudice, quote, precludes subsequent litigation to the461111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   same extent as if the action had been prosecuted to a 2   final adjudication adverse to the plaintiff. 3             QUESTION:  All right, Mr. Ayer, let's assume 4   that that particular reason isn't necessarily going to 5   persuade all of us here.  Do you have another reason to 6   say that the agreement, the settlement here should be 7   treated in law by this Court under the Bankruptcy Code 8   just like a settlement that expressly says there wasn't 9   any fraud?  Do you have any other reason?10             MR. AYER:  I think the language of the release11   is quite clear.  The language of the release talks about12   releasing any and all rights, including future rights.13             QUESTION:  Well, but it's a question of Federal14   law as to whether that includes a nondischargeability15   claim.  I mean, that's what we're here to talk about, and               MR. AYER:  Well, let me --               QUESTION:  -- that's going to be the same in￼I think that's --16171819   every State, which is what I've asked.  The very first202122232425question we asked, or I asked, was whether or not this wasa rule depends on the -- the vagaries of the law of NorthCarolina or not.          MR. AYER:  Well -- and let me suggest, YourHonor, that -- that in order --          QUESTION:  And I would -- I would have to agree471111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051   with what Justice -- Justice Ginsburg seems to be2   indicating, that this -- that what you're saying is that3   there's issue preclusion as to an issue that's never been4 litigated.5 6 7 8 9          MR. AYER:  Well, and the parties --          QUESTION:  That's astounding.          MR. AYER:  But I think we know under Arizona v.California and other decisions that parties can do that ifthey in -- if they indicate an intention to do it, and thequestion is, have they done that here.          QUESTION:  Can I ask -- this -- this puzzles me.Is it, indeed, a question of Federal law whether acontract which -- which gives up all future rights inconnection with this claim includes -- whether -- whetherthe contract includes the right to claim1011121314151617   nondischargeability?Let me --￼1819202122232425          MR. AYER:  No, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Is -- is that a Federal question or aState question?          MR. AYER:  I think -- I believe it's not, and Ireally feel --          QUESTION:  What do you -- you think it's aquestion of State law?          MR. AYER:  I believe it's a question of State481111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 law. 2             QUESTION:  It's a question of Federal law what 3   the consequence -- 4             MR. AYER:  Correct. 5             QUESTION:  -- of that State contract is. 6             MR. AYER:  Absolutely. 7             QUESTION:  Okay. 8             MR. AYER:  And let me address, if I could, what 9   I view as the logical way to think about this.  Once you10   have a State contract that is given meaning under State11   law, the question is, is that somehow to be modified or12   overridden in light of Federal bankruptcy policy, and what13   we have here, on the other side, I think, are two14   different views.15             We have one view of the petitioners that it can16   never be done, there's no way, bankruptcy policy won't17   allow it, and the other view of the Government is that,18   well, you can do it if it's clear enough, and then you get19   into nice questions of what, I guess, our Federal common20 law --21             QUESTION:  Your view, Mr. Ayer, would simply22   encourage anticipatory litigation of issues that might23   arise in bankruptcy, which I think Brown suggests is not a24 good idea.25             MR. AYER:  Your Honor, I think all -- all our491111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1 2 3 4   probably there's general agreement.  If in so many words 5   you say in the State court settlement, I waive my right to 6   claim nondischargeability in bankruptcy, probably 7   everybody would say, or a majority would say yes, but you 8   don't have that here. 9             MR. AYER:  Well, what it -- I mean, I guess the10   next question would be, what else might be adequate, and11   do you really want to develop a -- a body of Federal law.12   Let me, if I could, just point to the arguments on the13   other side why this should be treated as essentially a14   Federal override of State law interpretive principles is15   based first upon citation of a number of express16   provisions of the Bankruptcy Code which have nothing to do17   with the subject and, I think, prove the opposite point.18             There's a whole section on debtor reaffirmations19   which set up detailed procedures that the bankruptcy court20   enforces to make sure that debtors don't get taken21   advantage of, and they are specific, and they're clear,22   and the bankruptcy court follows them.  That's an occasion23   for the bankruptcy court to get involved.24             There's the idea that the automatic stay cannot25   be voluntarily given up.  Again, that's the product of501111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005approach does is allow parties to enter into settlementsto be given what effect they have.QUESTION:  Well, but, I -- I think here, too,￼ 1   specific language that creates an automatic stay to 2   protect the debtor and has 18 itemized exceptions, 3   specific language.  There -- they invoke the preference 4   provisions which let, of course, the bankruptcy court go 5   back into transactions that occur prior to bankruptcy, and 6   look at them on very specific terms set forth in section 7   547.  They talk about the fraudulent conveyance section 8   does the same thing in a slightly different way, but there 9   are no such provisions whatsoever with regard to waivers10   of section 523 claims.  Section 523 claims are something11   that the creditor loses if he does not affirmatively file12   within 60 days of the first meeting of creditors.  There13   are no protections with regard to that in the code, and14   if -- if something isn't filed, they disappear.15             Indeed, the whole idea that creditors are --16   that -- that the issues with regard to nondischargeability17   under (a)(2), (a)(4), (a)(6), and (a)(15), are made a18   matter of exclusive Federal jurisdiction, the reason for19   that, and your case and Brown talk specifically about20   that, was because creditors were abusing the process by21   pursuing them.  This is not a protection for creditors.22   This is a -- a way of making sure creditors don't come in23   after bankruptcy and basically put the screws to -- to24   debtors who have gotten a discharge.25             What language there is -- and we talk about this511111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   in both the briefs, I think specific language runs counter 2   to this.  We talked in the briefs about (a)(11) and 3   (a)(19), which specifically mention settlements, and I 4   would submit the better interpretation of that language is 5   to say, in those instances where the language specifically 6   says that any settlement may give rise to a 7   nondischargeable claim, is to allow the bankruptcy court 8   to go back in and look at those facts even if the right to 9   a nondischarge -- right to pursue nondischarge was given10 away.11             I think the bottom line is that the arguments on12   the other side relate to a series -- they don't relate to13   any language of the code, other than the much overbroad14   idea that it -- that it's any debt, and of course that15   doesn't mean that a party can't be foreclosed from16   litigating the 523 claim because he's already lost it in17   State court, so any doesn't mean absolutely every.18             The policies that are invoked are, first, the19   honest but unfortunate debtor policy, but nobody here,20   I think, seriously suggests that a party can't give the21   thing away, give the right away if they want to, and so22   I think -- give the right to pursue the 523 action away by23   clear enough language.  That seems to be the -- the24   petitioner I think disagrees with me, but other than that,25   I think the better view is that they can, and I don't521111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1   think this Court in any of its cases has ever suggested2   that the honest but unfortunate debtor policy forecloses3   relying on prior resolutions under State law.  Collateral4567   trap for the unwary.  It would be a trap if the rule were8   this categorical rule that says, boy, you enter into aestoppel certainly applies, and we think settlementlanguage that's clear ought to apply.They claim that allowing this is some sort of a 9   settlement contract, you lose your 523 claim.  That's not10   the issue in the case.  The issue is, does the language11   here support the -- the idea that the -- the right to12   pursue the 523 claim has been given up, and to hold13   parties to the State law effect of releases that they sign14   is no trap for the unwary.  That's how we do litigation in15   this country every day.16             QUESTION:  Mr. Ayer, may I ask you this17   question:  You started out telling us you were going to18   make four points.  I know what one, two, and four are, but19   I'm just curious as to what three was.20             MR. AYER:  Three was the State law point.  I --21   I guess -- three was the point that when you look at State22   law here, the reading of -- the fair reading of State law23   does, indeed, support the State law rulings of all three24   of the courts below, and point four, of course, is that25   there's no reason in Federal law to go back and say no, we531111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1234   in -- in the settlement agreement.  I -- I've never seen a5   settlement agreement in which the parties agree that it's6   going to be nondischargeable.  As a matter of common7 8 9course, do these clauses appear in contracts, or --          MR. AYER:  I'm not aware of it, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Ayer.          MR. AYER:  Thank you, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Mr. Goldblatt, you have 4 minutes           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG GOLDBLATThave to second-guess that.          QUESTION:  I -- I suppose after this case, nomatter which way it goes, you can have an Archer clauseThey certainly can if they want to.          QUESTION:  I know they can.1011121314   remaining.15￼     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. GOLDBLATT:  Okay.  Thank you.  I only have161718   four points.  First, with respect to the State law19   question of preclusion, we say in our reply brief on pages20   7 and 8 that that issue had been waived.  I don't want to21   belabor that point, but I -- I will point out that the22   brief respondent filed in the court of appeals, which23   is -- which is, of course, in the record here, states24   State law correctly.  There, on page 29 in the court of25   appeals respondent said, there is no issue of collateral541111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1 2 3 4   law.  None of the North Carolina cases cited by respondent 5   involved a case in which a settlement agreement is given 6   preclusive effect. 7             Second, with respect to the language of this 8   particular release, it would certainly present a harder 9   case if you had a situation which the release said, we10   give up all of our rights in bankruptcy, and in the event11   you file for bankruptcy, we will not make any effort to12   collect on the debt.  This release is quite far from that,13   and expressly preserves the right at all points to recover14   on the amount that was promised in the promissory note,15   and this Court's opinion in Brown makes clear as a matter16   of Federal law that what a nondischargeability action is17   is simply an action to enforce the obligations that were18   promised as part of the settlement.19             Finally, the question of the form of the debt,20   and whether the form of the debt drove the decision below,21   there -- the court of appeals certainly does say -- and22   this is in the joint appendix at page 8 -- I'm sorry,23   page 9a, footnote 8.  It explains quite clearly that a24   basis for its decision is the notion that the creditor was25   substituting the tort claim, the fraud claim for a551111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005estoppel in this case because there have never been anyevidentiary findings.We submit that's a correct statement of State￼ 1   contract claim and rests its decision on that basis. 2             The consequence of that decision would be that 3   from the creditor's perspective, if a creditor has an 4   unliquidated claim, and this applies not only to claims 5   for fraud but, say, an injury caused by drunk-driving, any 6   of the categories of nondischargeability, if you have an 7   unliquidated claim and they file for bankruptcy, you can 8   contend its nondischargeable. 9             If, on the other hand, you've litigated all the10   way to judgment, under Brown you can say in bankruptcy,11   even if the judgment doesn't say what it's for, that12   that's nondischargeable.  It would create an anomalous13   situation in which the middle category, cases that are14   resolved in settlement agreements that don't resolve the15   question of liability, the rights in bankruptcy to show16   nondischargeability is given up, and because the code17   makes clear that the form of the debt is irrelevant to18   persons of dischargeability, and because this Court's19   decision in Brown versus Felsen is essentially20   indistinguishable from this case, we submit the decision21   below should be reversed.22             QUESTION:  It's rather unfortunate,23   Mr. Goldblatt, that there's nobody in the room to defend24   the position that I understood was taken by the question25   presented, namely that a novation -- a novation is all you561111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1   need.  I think that's, at least, an arguable position,2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9but -- but nobody -- nobody seems to want to --          MR. GOLDBLATT:  We agree that -- that --          QUESTION:  -- discuss the issue on -- on whichwe took the case.          MR. GOLDBLATT:  Your Honor, we -- we agree, aswe say in our reply brief, that the principal basis of thedecision below has been abandoned by respondent here, andwe believe it's been abandoned because it can't be squaredwith this Court's decision in Brown versus Felsen, whichholds squarely to the contrary.1011121314151617181920   Mr. Goldblatt.  The case is submitted.QUESTION:  Thank --          QUESTION:  What about the (a)(11) and (a) -- the19, the express provisions for nondischargeability?          MR. GOLDBLATT:  Your Honor, what Congress wasdoing in -- in sections (a)(11) -- I -- I see my timehas -- has run out, but what Congress was doing in (a)(11)and (a)(19) was giving preclusive effect --￼21 22 23 24 25          (Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)571111 14th Street, N.W.
