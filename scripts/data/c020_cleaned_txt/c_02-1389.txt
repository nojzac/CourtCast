Abel Cosmo Galletti.Mr. Jones.ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONESON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. JONES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleasethe Court:Federal employment taxes owed by a partnershipwere assessed by the commissioner, and when the partnership failed to pay the taxes, the United States brought this action to recover the taxes against the individual partners who were derivatively liable under State law for all debts of the partnership, including its tax debts.QUESTION: Did the Government have to wait until the partnership failed to pay? Could it have proceeded immediately against the partners under -- under the governing State law?MR. JONES: You've addressed an -- an unanswered question that isn't presented here, of course. It's unanswered because Federal law --QUESTION: It -- it's not presented, depending3, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 on what you mean by derivative liability. I -- I always2 thought that derivative liability would be liability that3 doesn't attach unless and until the person primarily4 liable fails to -- fails to pay up.5 MR. JONES: And -- and I agree with that, and --6 and the Uniform Partnership Act, which California has7 adopted, contains a provision that specifies that the8 creditor must exhaust his efforts to recover from the9 partnership before he can recover from the partners.10 QUESTION: I see.11 MR. JONES: And -- and so that's what makes it12 clear this is indeed a derivative secondary liability.13 QUESTION: You think maybe the United States may14 not be bound by that. You -- you don't want to -- you15 don't want to concede that the United States is bound by16 that.17 MR. JONES: It's not so much I don't want to18 concede. I don't feel that I'm able to concede that not19 because it is related to this case, but because of a -- a20 structural intellectual problem about the extent to which21 whose law governs in that situation. If it's a22 limitations provision, we know Federal law governs when23 the United States is bringing a claim that it acquires in24 its sovereign capacity. Whether this would be regarded as25 a procedural restriction that the State substantive law4, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 didn't -- now, whether you want to think this is2 substantive or procedural may affect the answer to the3 question -- the hypothetical that you've raised.4 QUESTION: Well, can you tell me as a matter of5 practice if -- if you know? Suppose there's a partnership6 which is a little murky. It's in the Cayman Islands and7 they're behind, but that one of the -- the general8 partners is in California. Can you just proceed against9 him, do you know? Does the Revenue Service ever do that?10 11 1213 -- in the14 where the15 not required to do a senseless act. You're not required16 to pursue and exhaust against the partnership when it's17 known to be insolvent. So in that situation, you have18 exhausted because the partnership is insolvent.MR. JONES: Well, there --QUESTION: -- ever do that?QUESTION: There -- there is an -- the uniform case law, there's a discussion of situations partnership is known to be insolvent. You're￼19 QUESTION: And I take it in that situation --20 you correct me if I'm wrong -- but you can't just levy on21 the account if the tax has not been assessed against that22 partner individually, but you can commence some other23 sorts of proceedings which would allow a subsequent levy.24 Or am I wrong, or is that clear?25 MR. JONES: Well, you've brought me through --5, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 to a lot of levels of complexity, but I think the answer2 to the question is we -- we don't dispute that you need to3 give a -- a notice of assessment in order to collect4 administratively through liens and levies. That's not5 relevant to this case because this is a judicial6 collection case.7 QUESTION: Of course.8 MR. JONES: But, nonetheless, there is case law9 that says that when you give notice to the partnership of10 its liability, that's sufficient as constructive notice to11 the partners to permit administrative collection through12 liens and levies.13 QUESTION: Mr. Kent, if you're not right about14 that and you do have to have individual notice and demand15 to the partners, then there's a consequence other than16 liens and levies, isn't there, where you have whopping17 penalties and interest attached? I thought if you don't18 give notice and demand within the 60-day period, then not19 only can't you impose liens, but that the interest and20 penalties stop running.21 MR. JONES: I'm -- I'm familiar with the -- the22 concept of interest doesn't run until notice of the23 assessment is made, but nonetheless again, notice to the24 partnership would be constructive to the partners.25 QUESTION: But if you're wrong about that6, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 constructive notice, then you could still say, well, the2 statute has been extended 10 years because of the3 assessment. However, one might conclude that the interest4 stops running and that you can't use administrative5 collection procedures.6 MR. JONES: Well, I -- I don't mean to be -- I7 don't mean to sound like I'm retreating from that issue.8 I'm just -- it's not presented here, and so I'm not really9 capable standing here --10 QUESTION: Well, it would be to the extent on --11 if -- if this thing is remanded with instructions that the12 assessment counts against all of them, that there would be13 the question remaining about the interest and penalties.14 MR. JONES: That's -- I don't -- it is possible,15 and if the Court were to reverse and remand for further16 proceedings, it's possible that that issue would be17 raised.18 QUESTION: Are you -- are you saying that we19 should maybe flag it but not decide it? Is it --20 MR. JONES: I don't -- I don't know what your21 practice would be. I would think your practice would be22 to decide the issue that's presented. You could note23 other issues haven't been raised, but since those issues24 haven't been briefed here, we're not really in a position25 to advise you on their proper resolution.7, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Why don't you go ahead with the2 issues that are presented?3 MR. JONES: Okay. Well, the point I was making4 was that the court ruled against us because they said that5 the partnership taxes had not been assessed directly6 against the partners. But respondents now correctly7 concede that there is no requirement of Federal law that a8 derivative or secondary State law liability to pay a tax9 has to be assessed before it can be collected, and that10 concession is plainly correct in light of this Court's11 decision in 1933 in the Leighton case where the Court held12 that a derivative or secondary liability that arises under13 State law to pay a tax may be recovered -- and I quote --14 without assessment of that liability. And there are15 numerous cases that have applied that principle in -- in16 related secondary and derivative liability contexts.17 And as -- as I've already indicated, those18 principles plainly apply here because under the Uniform19 Partnership Act, which applies in California, the20 liability of the partner is derivative for the -- and21 secondary rather than principal, as I've discussed with22 Justice Scalia. Not only is it clear from the legal23 structure of the UPA, but the official comments to the --24 of -- to that act state that the liability of the25 partnership for partnership debts is principal and that8, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the liability of partners is -- is in the nature of a guarantor. It's secondary. It arises only when the partnership doesn't pay its own debts.Federal law also makes clear that this is a liability that attaches directly to the partnership. This is a Federal employment tax. It applies to employers because, under California law, the -- the partnership is a separate and distinct legal entity. It is the employer. It pays the wages. Its payment of wages is what causes the taxes to be imposed.QUESTION: But you -- you agree that it's the law of California that imposes the derivative liability on the partners?MR. JONES: That's the way the cases describe it. From my -- and that's the way this Court described it in -- in Commissioner v. Stern.QUESTION: What more do you want?MR. JONES: Pardon me?QUESTION: I say what more do you want.MR. JONES: Well, I don't want more. I'm justbeing finicky I guess, because to me we -- the Court in Commissioner v. Stern said that these -- historically these are substantive liabilities that Congress accepts from State law. And therefore, the Court applies the substantive body of State rules in -- in implementing that9, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 liability.2 You could also think of this -- and I'm not3 asking the Court to reconsider Commissioner v. Stern. But4 you can -- even in light of Commissioner v. Stern, you can5 think of this as Federal law borrowing State law for this6 remedial purpose, and Congress has sanctioned that by not7 altering the principles that have long existed on this.8 The -- but the -- the point that this Court made9 in Leighton is that these principles that they apply come10 from State law and you don't a -- actually respondents now11 admit there's no mechanism in Federal law to assist this12 -- assess this sort of secondary derivative State law13 liability, and that's correct. That's what the Court14 addressed in the Leighton case. And the court of appeals15 in this case just misapplied those well-accepted16 principles.17 Once the assessment of the partnership taxes was18 made, under section 6502 the United States has 10 years19 from the date of the assessment to bring any proceeding in20 court to collect the taxes. And in the Updike case in21 1930, the Court held that that 10 years applies not only22 to actions against the directly liable party but also to a23 person whose liability is derivative or secondary and24 arises from State law. And the Court explained that the25 broad purpose and broad text of 6502 applies equally in10, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 both cases because in the Court's words, in a real sense2 the action against the derivatively liable party is a3 proceeding in court to collect the tax. As the Court said4 in Updike, the aim in the one case, as in the other, is5 the same. It's to collect the tax liability.6 Now, in this Court respondents do not dispute7 that accepted understanding of 6502. Instead, they raise8 here a new and, indeed, a radical claim that no court has9 adopted and that they did not raise prior to their merits10 brief in this Court. What they argue now for the first11 time is that the Federal statute of limitations should not12 govern this derivative liability claim because since it13 stems from substantive State law, the State statute of14 limitations should govern it. Now, since they didn't15 raise that claim at any time before their merits brief in16 this Court -- and it is a statute of limitations which is17 an affirmative defense -- they're -- they've waived the18 claim as too rate to -- too late to raise it.19 But nonetheless, I think it is important to note20 that their claim is plainly inconsistent with this Court's21 decisions. For example, in the Summerlin case, this Court22 held that whenever the United States acquires a claim23 acting in its governmental capacity, that claim of the24 United States is not subject to a State statute of25 limitations because of the sovereign rights -- sovereign11, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 immunity of the United States. And they applied that2 holding in Summerlin to a situation where what the United3 States obtained was a right to enforce a private note and4 private mortgage that the --5 QUESTION: May I interrupt for this question?6 You know, there are some State statutes of limitations7 that -- or some States have limitations provisions that8 are either affirmative defenses or some are, in effect,9 conditions precedent to bringing an action. If California10 had the latter form of action, how would you decide this11 case?12 MR. JONES: I think that in -- in Commissioner13 v. Bresson where the Ninth Circuit addressed that very14 point, they -- they were -- they wrote a very useful15 opinion that seems to me to be perfectly correct, that the16 -- that if it is the passage of time after the United17 States acquires its right that causes the claim to expire,18 that that is what is barred by the Summerlin rationale19 because the sovereign rights of the United States can't be20 extinguished. And so whether you think of it as21 extinguishing the claim or limiting the -- the period of22 recovery, in either event what's instrumental is that the23 -- the United States had the right at the time it obtained24 the claim and that the State law could not thereafter cut25 that right off.12, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Why not? Why -- why -- suppose that2 you have a -- a bank that guarantees a debt, and the debt3 is Smith's debt. And the guarantee is to pay, including4 tax debts. That's what it says. It was a condition of5 the borrowing or some other thing. Now, why wouldn't6 State law govern the period of time in respect to which7 any creditor, including the Government, has to assert a --8 a claim under that note, let's say, or under that9 particular written guarantee since the liability there is10 a creation of State law and the State would have the right11 to define its contours? And after all, that guarantor is12 not the taxpayer. The -- the guarantor's liability arises13 solely out of the fact that he happens to have entered14 into a note with a guarantor who promised to pay.15 MR. JONES: So you're talking about a -- a16 private contractual right --17 QUESTION: Yes. Say a private --18 MR. JONES: -- that the United States somehow19 obtained rights under by --￼202122232425 why isn'tQUESTION: MR. JONES: QUESTION: MR. JONES: QUESTION: this that.Yes.-- levying, for example --Yes, yes.-- on the -- on the right.Yes, yes, and then I'm going to say13, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. JONES: That's -- that's a -- that's exactly frankly what happened in Summerlin --QUESTION: Yes.MR. JONES: -- except Summerlin involved a housing program instead of the Internal Revenue Code. In Summerlin, the Government obtained a private note and enforced it, regardless of the State statute of limitations, and the Court's reasoning was that the -- that the United States as sovereign cannot be subject to limitations imposed on the rights that it obtains.QUESTION: So if I -- if I enter into a promise with you and say in return for my lending, you know, whatever it is, I -- I promise that I will pay your tax debts, but by the way, I don't want to pay any tax debt that isn't definite before January the 5th, 2004 or 2010. I don't want to pay anything that arises --MR. JONES: It's a limit -- if you're talking about a substantive limitation in the document itself, well, the United States takes its -- stands in the shoes of the assignor in that situation, and we don't get a better substantive right -- substantive right.QUESTION: Okay. So it's a substantive procedural distinction.MR. JONES: Well, certainly that's the way the Court has looked at it, and I --14, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: But you know, in -- in other cases,2 let's say when the -- when the Federal Government creates3 a Federal right without establishing a statute of4 limitations for that Federal right, State law does not5 govern, but Federal law looks to the -- to the State6 statute of limitations as a matter of Federal law. I7 don't know why it wouldn't be the same thing with respect8 to a -- a Federal claim. You mean there is no statute of9 limitations whatever on Federal claims?10 MR. JONES: No. Well, that's the second route11 that the Court has used to say the State's limitations12 don't control, and that is, when there's a Federal13 limitations period that applies to the claim, then the14 State provision doesn't control.15 QUESTION: Of course.16 MR. JONES: And under -- under Updike, what this17 Court concluded in Updike was that there is a Federal18 statute of limitations that applies to these proceedings19 in court to collect the taxes, which includes the20 derivative claim.21 QUESTION: Well, that -- that's fine. But I'm22 talking about the more general proposition that -- that23 you're -- that you're defending or -- or proposing that --24 that State law does not -- never -- never applies to a --25 to a Federal claim.15, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

JONES: It doesn't --QUESTION: I think it does. Now, it may notapply of its own force.MR. JONES: Exactly.QUESTION: But it applies because of adoption by the United States.MR. JONES: If the -- if the Court were to find it appropriate in a particular instance to adopt a State rule, that would not interfere with Summerlin, but that would -- that would -- I can't think of a case exactly like that. There may well be some.But most Federal claims --QUESTION: I can't imagine our not doing it. Ican't imagine our saying that, you know -- MR. JONES: Most --QUESTION: -- the clock keeps ticking on Federal claims forever and ever.MR. JONES: Most Federal claims come within some general statute of limitations, and this is certainly a situation like that.QUESTION: Is it -- is this question really academic in this case because you have not one but two Federal limitations, one, the regular 3-year period, then16, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

JONES: Well, I think the Updike case makesthis discussion somewhat hypothetical, and I understood Justice Scalia's question to be in that vein.QUESTION: But here, what you're relying on are the Federal limitations period. So you don't need to worry about suppose there had been no Federal limitations.MR. JONES: I -- I don't need to worry about them, and I -- but I'm only addressing them because respondents have raised them at this point in the case, and so I'm just discussing the two theories that this Court has applied in rejecting that kind of contention.QUESTION: You're saying it's doubly hypothetical because they can't raise the whole issue --MR. JONES: Yes.QUESTION: -- at this point anyway.MR. JONES: Yes, sir.QUESTION: I thought their primary position,though, was that the partners are not secondarily liable, they're primarily liable, so that they are the taxpayer and they're entitled to assessment notice and demand.MR. JONES: That is now clearly their primary position, and for the reasons I've already described that position can't be reconciled with the Uniform Partnership Act or with -- or with the Federal law that applies to17, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425these taxes.QUESTION: Can you -- can you tell me in thecase of a corporation, if the responsible officer does not withhold employment taxes, I -- I take it -- I thought I remembered that -- that the responsible officer is personally liable. Or am I wrong about that?MR. JONES: Yes. There is a statute that authorizes an assessment of that liability against a responsible officer.QUESTION: Ah, but you have to assess it.MR. JONES: It -- it authorizes the assessment. That's -- you know, it's interesting. There are certain types --QUESTION: Can -- can you proceed against the responsible officer without the assessment?MR. JONES: If you have a claim based on State law or common law, and that's the reason we have a responsible officer statute is that this is a Federal claim. There isn't -- unlike in the partnership situation and in the ordinary transferee situation, there's not a backup State law action.QUESTION: Well, if -- if in the case of corporate officers, there must be an assessment, then by analogy it would seem that it wouldn't be too much trouble for the IRS to assess the partners in your case.18, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. JONES: Well, sometimes it is troublesome, but it's not required in any situation under our understanding of the existing law.QUESTION: I -- I thought that it was required in the -- in -- in the corporate case. You said it has to be assessed against the responsible officer.MR. JONES: Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were talking about the partnership then. Yes. I -- the responsible officers -- officer liability is created by Federal statute, unlike the partners' obligation for the debts of the partnership.QUESTION: I'm simply wondering if -- if that isn't a model, if that's what happens in the corporate instance, in this case where the statute is -- is silent on the point, whether we shouldn't just assume that since it's not too much of a burden on the Government in the corporate context to require it to assess the responsible officer before the tax can be collected, that we shouldn't say the same thing here.MR. JONES: There is --QUESTION: I'm just --MR. JONES: I understand. But the responsibleofficer liability is -- is really a radically different concept. It only -- it only arises when that officer had knowledge of the fact that the taxes weren't being paid as19, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 they accrued and willfully failed to pay them and -- and2 was responsible, had the responsibility to pay them. It3 is a -- it is a malfeasance claim, whereas the derivative4 liability claim is just under State law, you are liable as5 is the partnership, and we can enforce that State law.6 There's another example --7 QUESTION: There's a --8 MR. JONES: -- where the similar thing happened.9 3505, which is the lender's liability. There was no10 lender's liability for employment taxes that the Court11 discussed in the Jersey Shore case. That liability didn't12 have a -- a common law precedent, and so Congress created13 the liability because they saw a specific problem where14 lenders were allowing or in -- in effect, helping15 employers evade employment taxes by loaning them money16 from which they paid wages but didn't paid taxes. And so17 Congress created this separate statutory scheme.18 But respondents are correct in their concession19 that there is no mechanism under Federal law for assessing20 the derivative State law liability of a partner for the21 debts of the partnership. And so as the Court held in --22 in Leighton, we can proceed without assessment against23 them to enforce that liability.24 Now, I do want to also mention the -- the25 citations that respondents make to section 6303. That20, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 section appears in the portion of the code that addresses2 administrative collection through liens and levies, and it3 states that the Secretary is to give notice of the4 assessment to any person liable for the tax. The cases5 that have interpreted and applied that statute, which stem6 from 1954, have -- have concluded correctly that that7 statute applies only to administrative collection through8 liens and levies and has no application to judicial9 collection actions.10 And there's a -- a sound historical explanation11 for that, and that is that prior to 1954, there were two12 independent routes for collecting taxes. The Secretary13 was authorized by the code to bring a judicial collection14 suit, but there was a separate officer known as the15 collector of revenue for each district. And the collector16 of revenue was, by the code, authorized to do the17 administrative collection through liens and levies. And18 the predecessor of 6303 had said that the collector is to19 give notice of the assessment and make demands for20 payment. And it was well established that that applied to21 his actions in administrative collection and had no22 application of the Secretary's independent authority to23 bring a judicial collection suit.24 In 1954 in revising the code, Congress25 eliminated references to the collector in the code, placed21, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 the Secretary in charge both of the -- of judicial and2 administrative enforcement and changed the predecessor3 language of 6303 from saying the collector is to give4 notice to saying the Secretary is to give notice. But in5 doing so, Congress did not mean to change -- and the6 courts that have reviewed this have correctly concluded7 did not change -- the fact that this notice of assessment8 requirement applies only to the administrative collection9 area, has no application to judicial collection suits like10 this one.11 QUESTION: Are you conceding then that there12 could be no liens and levies against the partners here13 because there was no notice and demand --14 MR. JONES: I --15 QUESTION: -- individually to them?16 MR. JONES: I don't think the record discusses17 whether there was notice to the partnership.￼18192021 different 22QUESTION: No, no. To the partners. MR. JONES: No.QUESTION: You just explained these two routes.MR. JONES: Yes.QUESTION: And you said that this is a judicial22, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200052324 collection proceeding.25 MR. JONES: Yes.1 QUESTION: So the other doesn't apply. So I'm2 asking you if you are now making the concession that those3 words -- what are they -- each person liable for unpaid4 tax, would stop you from using the administrative5 collection route because you didn't give notice and demand6 individually.7 MR. JONES: Let me -- I can't say what we did or8 didn't do in notice because there's nothing in the record9 on that in this case because administrative collection10 isn't involved in this case.11 QUESTION: Well, let's assume you gave notice12 and demand only to the partnership.13 MR. JONES: Okay, let's assume that. If we gave14 notice and demand to the partnership, what we would be15 authorized to do is clearly under 6321 and -- make a lien16 and levy against any assets of the partnership. And then17 as I said, although -- the -- the cases are also perfectly18 consistent that the notice to the partnership is valid as19 constructive notice to the partners.20 And so, for example, if we have a partnership21 employment tax liability from Smith Construction and the22 two partners are Bob Jones and Bill Wilson, notice of the23 assessment to the partnership is valid as notice to its24 two partners. And so our lien arises, if they don't pay25 the tax, but if a third party creditor is out there, First23, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 National Bank, the First -- our notice to the partnership2 may not be notice to the First National Bank. And so in a3 lien contest we might not have the prior lien vis-a-vis4 this other party, but vis-a-vis the two partners, the5 cases say that our notice is valid for 6303 purposes to6 them because, well, of course, a partnership only acts7 through its partners and notice to one of them or to the8 partnership is valid, constructive notice to all the9 others.10 There is no case inconsistent with that11 conclusion, but again, it's plainly not presented in this12 case and we would not ask the Court to address it.13 There's no need for it to. This is just a judicial14 collection case.15 The only issue that is really before the Court16 is whether we have to give notice -- I'm sorry -- whether17 we have to assess the individual partners to collect the18 State law derivative liability. And for the reasons I've19 described, that the decision below is incorrect on that20 and -- and should be reversed.￼2122 time. 232425And I would like to reserve the balance of myQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Jones. Mr. Haberbush.ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID R. HABERBUSH24, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS2 MR. HABERBUSH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it3 please the Court:4 We've heard some interesting arguments, and I'd5 like to address the history here of the way in which this6 alleged derivative liability is imposed upon the partners.7 We contend that the partners --8 QUESTION: Now, the Government says you -- you9 did not raise what is now your principal argument until10 your merits brief. Do you agree with that statement?11 MR. HABERBUSH: Your Honor, no, I don't. This12 case has always been about statutes of limitation. We13 were addressing, in fact, a argument raised in the merits14 brief by the Government. If the Court will note, at page15 5 -- I'm sorry -- page 12, footnote 5, this specific16 question is addressed by the Government stating that it's17 a Federal not a State statute of limitation that comes18 into play. And our portion of the brief is simply a reply19 to that.20 QUESTION: Wait. It seems to me it's -- it's --21 the burden is on you to make the claim that a State22 statute applies, and you never claimed that any State23 statute applies. Now, the Government here, out of an24 excess of caution or maybe to explain the whole situation25 to us, puts in that footnote, but that doesn't create a25, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425claim on your part that the State statute governs.Did you ever assert that -- that this matter wasgoverned by -- by a State statute of limitations until your merits brief?MR. HABERBUSH: Yes, we did in the courts below and our briefs below.QUESTION: You asserted that it was governed by a State statute of limitations.MR. HABERBUSH: Your Honor, what we argued was that if the Federal statutes did not apply, section 6303 requiring notice and demand, if these partners are not taxpayers under the Internal Revenue Code, then State law would govern. And yes, we did raise it below.QUESTION: Did the court of appeals touch on it?MR. HABERBUSH: The court of appeals did not need to touch upon it, because the court of appeals felt and decided that these partners are taxpayers under the Internal Revenue Code. And that's the precise question I would like to address.QUESTION: Did you raise the statute of limitations point in your pleadings in the district court? MR. HABERBUSH: In the United -- this originatedin the bankruptcy court, so the district court -- QUESTION: Well, I mean in the bankruptcy court. MR. HABERBUSH: Your Honor, we did. We raised26, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425it both in terms of the statute of limitations under section 6303 and under State law.QUESTION: Did you raise it as an affirmative defense under State law?MR. HABERBUSH: Well, we objected to the proof of claim which is akin to an answer, and yes --QUESTION: And one ground of your objection was under State law it's barred?MR. HABERBUSH: Our objection was a fairly generic objection in all honesty --QUESTION: So we're talking about did you ever say this claim is barred by -- it -- it is too late under this State statute of limitations, citing the State statute of limitations?MR. HABERBUSH: Yes, we did.QUESTION: Would you provide us with -- QUESTION: Where can we find that in the record? QUESTION: Where will we find that?MR. HABERBUSH: I believe you'll find that atthe -- the district court level after the bankruptcy court.QUESTION: Well, isn't the place to raise it in the bankruptcy court? I mean, that's where your pleadings -- that's where your responsive pleadings were filed.MR. HABERBUSH: If indeed it is an affirmative27, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 defense, yes. Our objection to the claim was this was not2 an enforceable claim under law, State or Federal, and our3 reason for it was barred by the limitations periods.4 QUESTION: As a Federal --5 QUESTION: Under California practice, I assume6 statute of limitations is an affirmative defense?7 MR. HABERBUSH: Yes, Your -- Your Honor, it is.8 We, however, believe that this case does not be9 controlled by State law, but rather by Federal law. A10 partner's liability for the debts of a partnership may11 arise under State law, and this Court has noted in the12 case of United States v. Kraft that State law defines the13 rights as between the parties, but the manner by which it14 may be collected, the tax itself or the claim, is governed15 by Federal law. And that is really the heart of what our16 argument is.17 There is no specific Internal Revenue Code18 provision that makes a partner liable for a partnership19 debt. What the Government in this case does is it relies20 specifically upon historical cases that stem from old21 section 280, which is adopted as section 6901 of the22 Internal Revenue Code, whereby assessments may be made23 against transferees, donees, and fiduciaries, and the24 cases interpreting those statutes basically find that25 there is a derivative liability with a coterminous statute28, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 of limitations.2 QUESTION: This would be an odd State law,3 wouldn't it? Imagine that I guarantee a debt or suppose a4 partner is like a guarantor. And suppose that the primary5 -- person primary -- primarily liable is in litigation6 with the debtor -- the creditor, rather. And because of7 delays and so forth, it takes about 15 years to resolve8 this litigation. I've never heard of a guarantor who9 wouldn't become liable at the time the thing is final and10 that the -- he just becomes -- I mean, how does it work?11 I would have thought a guarantor is liable for the debt12 the debtor owes. How does the statute work, the State13 statute?14 MR. HABERBUSH: Your Honor, we believe the State15 statute is -- is one that does not require exhaustion of16 remedies as against the partnership.17 QUESTION: It has nothing to do with exhaustion18 of remedies. I'm -- and I'm talking about States -- the19 State insofar as it sees the partner as a guarantor of the20 liability that is created by a different entity, namely21 the partnership. And I'm asking if under State law of22 California, wouldn't it be the case that if he's a23 guarantor and you get the statute of limitations on a24 matter to determine liability extended, that the guarantee25 also extends.29, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. HABERBUSH: That would --2 QUESTION: There's no State law that says you3 have to sue the guarantor before the liability that he's4 guaranteeing is determined.5 MR. HABERBUSH: That is correct.6 QUESTION: All right. If that's correct, what7 are we arguing about?8 MR. HABERBUSH: What we're arguing about here is9 that this is not a suretyship or a secondary liability --10 QUESTION: Yes, yes. You're back to your11 question of whether under partnership law in fact this is12 a guarantor or the equivalent or a surety. I understand13 that argument, but it sounds to me as if that argument is14 resolved against you, this statute of limitations argument15 is a serious red herring because it won't matter.￼1617 controls. 181920 taxpayers 2122 which you23 they are primarily liable, you win it or you lose it. If24 you win it, you win. If you lose it, your statute of25 limitations argument adds nothing.30, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MR. HABERBUSH: Well, unless Federal lawQUESTION: Right.MR. HABERBUSH: Unless these parties are under Federal law, in which case -- QUESTION: No, no. If the primary argument, want to argue, that they're taxpayers or that1 MR. HABERBUSH: I think not.2 QUESTION: That's my -- that's what I'm3 thinking.4 MR. HABERBUSH: I think not. I think we win,5 and let me explain why. It has nothing to do with6 limitations periods. It has nothing to do with State law7 governing guarantees. It has to do with the way this8 Court is asked to define this particular claim in this9 particular case. Is it a tax claim or is it a claim which10 is derived from the partnership liability? In other11 words, is it a tax debt or is it a debt because they're12 liable for a debt of the partnership so that it loses its13 nature as a tax claim?14 If that's the case, this is a bankruptcy case.15 Tax claims in bankruptcy have priority over other claims16 under section 507(a) of title 11 of the United States17 Code. Those claims too are not dischargeable if they're a18 tax claim under section 523 of title 11. So if the Court19 determines this is nothing more than a guarantee pursuant20 to State law and not a tax claim, then this debt will be21 discharged in this bankruptcy case.22 QUESTION: Do you have -- have any cases for23 that, that a tax claim loses its character as a tax claim24 when relief is sought not against the person primarily25 liable but against somebody derivatively liable? It seems31, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 to me it's still a tax claim.2 MR. HABERBUSH: No, Your Honor, we do not have3 authority for that. However, ifitisatax--4 QUESTION: I wouldn't expect you to find any.5 MR. HABERBUSH: However, if they are liable for6 the tax, this Court has already stated on a number of7 occasions, including the most recent case of U.S. v.8 Kraft, someone who is subject to the tax is someone who9 pays it, someone who is liable for it. These parties are10 liable for the tax. They are subject to the tax under11 section 7701(a)(14) of the Internal Revenue Code, and12 therefore they are taxpayers. Once they are taxpayers,13 that invokes the provisions of section 6501 requiring14 assessment or suit within 3 years. We don't claim that15 assessment is the only method. We claim assessment or￼16 suit, which is consistent with the history of the17 and that's a 3-year limitation period as to these18 QUESTION: No, but you say that they're19 taxpayers because they're partners, and therefore20 and -- and that's why the -- their -- their right21 assessment can be claimed. But by the same reasoning that22 you follow, if they are taxpayers because they are23 partners, why isn't notice to the partnership notice to24 the partners or assessment against the partnership25 assessment against the partners? Why -- why do you, in32, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005cases, --they -- to an1 effect, make a metaphysical distinction in the latter case2 but not in the former?3 MR. HABERBUSH: Well, Your Honor, I don't think4 that we do. I think that the argument that there is5 constructive notice merely because one is a partner6 creates notice to -- notice to the partnership is notice7 to the partners. There is no controlling case on this8 idea, and that would be too a question I think of State9 law, whether notice to a partnership is notice to the10 partners. And we've clearly cited to California law that11 says you must commence a separate suit against the partner12 in order to obtain a judgment against it. There is no13 California law that says that by filing a suit against the14 partner, that's sufficient for due process purposes of15 creating notice to the partners such that --16 QUESTION: We don't ordinarily decide questions17 of State law here. I think we would generally feel18 perhaps the Ninth Circuit knows more about California law19 than we do.20 MR. HABERBUSH: Well, certainly that's true.21 And that's --22 QUESTION: I said, we would think.23 (Laughter.)24 MR. HABERBUSH: Well, thank you. And -- and25 yes, this Court ordinarily does not address questions of33, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 State law.2 We think that this is a Federal statutory3 interpretation. Either these persons are taxpayers liable4 for a tax or they are not taxpayers liable some -- for5 something that is not a tax.6 QUESTION: The last part. They are for -- they7 are not taxpayers in the meaning of the statute who are8 liable for something that is a tax. And I don't know why9 that wouldn't be.10 MR. HABERBUSH: Well, Your Honor --11 QUESTION: And State law makes them, in effect,12 guarantors of debts. This is a tax debt. So they're13 guarantors of the tax debt. So, therefore, they're liable14 for the tax or sureties or some other equivalent word.15 MR. HABERBUSH: All of the cases referred to for16 the coterminous statute of limitations, which is what17 would be suggested would be applied here if in fact they18 are liable for this tax debt and therefore the provisions19 of the Internal Revenue Code apply, are all cases where20 specific enabling provisions created the liability of21 those persons. Under section 6324, certain persons are22 made personally liable. Under section 6901, certain23 persons may be assessed with taxes as transferees. And24 those specific statutes have provisions in them that say25 that the assessment and collection and enforcement of the34, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 tax -- this is 6901 and its predecessor, section 280,2 where the collection assessment and enforcement of the tax3 is subject to the same provisions and the same limitations4 as the tax itself. So it's not surprising that you have5 cases like Leighton and Updike where the statute of6 limitations set forth in what is now 6502 applies to them7 because they're subject to the same limitation periods.8 There is nothing in the Internal Revenue Code9 that sets forth a limitation period as to partners. If10 one adopts the guarantor analogy, then this is conceivable11 a case where any number of years could pass where the12 partners would become liable.1314 the joint15 proofs of16 and these17 Government in this case is not simply filing a claim as18 though it were a lawsuit against these partners. These19 proofs of claim were filed as secured claims in both of20 the two cases that are before the Court. Secured by what?21 Motor vehicles and real estate. So the Internal Revenue22 Service is taking the position clearly, unequivocally that23 it can enforce this debt by the summary collection process24 which has been called awesome and -- and super powers that25 are not available otherwise.35, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005Your -- I would point out the Court's record in appendix. At pages 100 and 102, we have the claim that were filed in these bankruptcy cases, proofs of claim on their face show that the￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Whether they could or not, they're saying that the question here is a judicial action.MR. HABERBUSH: Well --QUESTION: And -- and so maybe they're wrong and maybe they're right about that, but that's not before the Court.MR. HABERBUSH: That's not -- that may not be before the Court, but the Government has taken the position the only way, the sole and single way, it can collect taxes is to file suits against partners. We would suggest that if the Court were to permit assessment, rule that they are taxpayers subject to assessment, subject to suit, that that would enhance collection. It would encourage partners at the earliest opportunity to cause their partnerships to pay taxes. It would cause partners at the earliest opportunity to pay the taxes. In this instance, you have proofs of claim --QUESTION: It -- it would also cause an enormous number of assessments to be made that ultimately would have no -- no use. I mean, the -- the amount of administrative assessing going on would -- would be staggering.MR. HABERBUSH: Well, the amount of suits could be staggering as well to collect these kinds of taxes.QUESTION: What is the problem? Suppose -- I'm36, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 -- I'm failing to see it but maybe -- suppose it's true2 that what the Uniform Partnership Act says is true.3 Partners are, quote, in the nature of guarantors, end4 quote, rather than principal debtors on the debts of the5 partnership. So let's suppose they're like guarantors. I6 would have thought that State law was something along the7 lines of a guarantor must be sued in order to collect a --8 a guaranteed debt within a period of time after it becomes9 determined that such a debt exists. Now, I would think10 that that's how the normal State law runs.11 So unless there's something Federal to the12 contrary -- and by the way, if there is, they have 10 more13 years. But unless there is something Federal to the14 contrary, there's no problem with bringing this case.15 So the only question in this case is are they in16 the nature of guarantors. And I'd be interested -- well,17 A, I'm interested in your comment on what I just said, and18 I'm also interested in the comment of why they're not19 guarantors.20 MR. HABERBUSH: Very well. Here the Internal21 Revenue Service has filed proofs of claim in the22 bankruptcy court not for the debt of the tax but for the23 tax, for the penalties, and for the interest. Guarantors24 under California law are liable for the debt and perhaps25 the interest, but not for the penalties. The Court will37, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 note that these proofs of claim are approximately three to2 four times as much as the amount of tax that was3 originally assessed against the partnership in the initial4 instance. There is nothing in the record to suggest that5 these partners had knowledge or notice of these taxes at6 any time before these proofs of claim were filed.7 Now, under California law, if you have a8 guarantor, the guarantor knows of the liability that that9 guarantor is offering surety for. That guarantor knows10 that that liability exists. That guarantor can encourage11 the principal party to pay the tax or the debt in12 question. Here the policies that are urged by the13 Government do not encourage collection of this --14 QUESTION: Mr. Haberbush, do you defend the￼15 decision of the Ninth Circuit in thiscase?16 1718 partners,19 them?2021 limitation. We think that an assessment or a suit should22 be brought within the statutory period --23 QUESTION: Well, I thought -- I thought the24 reasoning of the Ninth Circuit was that you couldn't25 collect against the partners unless you assess them too.38, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MR. HABERBUSH: Yes, we do. QUESTION: That in order to an assessment would have tocollect against the be made againstMR. HABERBUSH: No, not within that specific12 wrong for3 that suit4 within the 3-year period, so that it's not exclusively5 assessment that's involved. And this Court and other6 courts, I believe, have -- have ruled that assessment is7 not a prerequisite to collection. However, some action8 must be taken within the statutory limitations periods.9 QUESTION: And the filing of a claim in a10 bankruptcy court is insufficient because?11 MR. HABERBUSH: It's untimely. It is not done12 within the period of time --13 QUESTION: So this is simply a statute of14 limitations case.15 MR. HABERBUSH: That's our position. Yes, Your16 Honor. It is simply a statute of limitations case. The17 Government has contended that this is a tax governed by18 the Internal Revenue Code. The liability may be created19 by State law, and this Court has consistently said while20 liability may be -- be created by State law, the21 enforceability of that liability is a subject of Federal22 law. The Federal laws provide for 6303 notice and demand.23 They provide for -- 6501 provides that assessment must be24 made. The -- the Government suggests that there can --25 QUESTION: Mr. Haberbush, would you be able,39, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MR. HABERBUSH: To that extent, the opinion is the reason that it is a well-held proposition or assessment may be brought under section 6501￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425after the argument, to furnish the Court with the places in the record available to us where it shows that you raised the State statute of limitations issue below?MR. HABERBUSH: Yes, I can.QUESTION: Thank you.MR. HABERBUSH: Yes, I can.QUESTION: Why shouldn't an assessment againstthe partnership be good as to the partners as well? I mean, the whole difference is that you'd have to add the -- the names of the individual partners. I mean, the assessment itself is something in a file in some building. Right?MR. HABERBUSH: Well, the assessment is the notation or recording of the liability. However, section 6203 says that to be a proper assessment, it must record the liability of the taxpayer and we, of course, say that the taxpayer also includes the partners.And yes, there could be a single assessment naming numerous parties. There are examples of that. For example, a husband and wife are jointly assessed. An assessment against a husband or a wife independently is not an assessment against the other. So there are multiple assessments that are capable of being made under the code.There are numerous other instances where40, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 assessments are made. 6901, for example, assessment --2 QUESTION: Is it -- does it -- would it matter3 if in fact the partners knew -- had received the -- I4 assume that the notice and demand would come to the5 partnership. This is a small partnership. There were6 what? Four partners involved? If they had actual notice,7 would that make any difference?8 MR. HABERBUSH: Your Honor, that might make a9 difference. We -- we would contend that it does not make10 a difference. We have cited to cases -- and I don't11 recall them right off the top of my -- my head at this12 moment -- where the assessment -- in fact, that was Cool13 Fuel, Inc. out of the Ninth Circuit where the assessment14 actually has to be received and made. It has to name who15 the taxpayer is.16 Marvel v. the United States. While the taxpayer17 there was named as a partnership's name, the individuals'18 Social Security numbers, taxpayer identification numbers,19 were on that -- that assessment, and that was found to be20 good as to those persons even though they were not21 individually named.22 QUESTION: But certainly they had actual notice.23 Your big due process objection that you make would not --24 would -- would be very thin, would it not?25 MR. HABERBUSH: I don't disagree with that, Your41, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Honor. There is nothing in the record below where there2 is -- that issue has been addressed. There is no facts3 that were derived at the trial of this matter where that4 was addressed. There is nothing in the record --5 QUESTION: But you addressed it in your brief.6 You said if they didn't get individual notice and demand,7 that would be a violation of due process.8 MR. HABERBUSH: Yes. It is not before the9 Court, however, whether they did or didn't, and there's10 nothing in the record suggesting that they did get such11 notice. That's why the -- the Government relies so12 heavily on its constructive notice theory, although13 starkly absent from that argument is any California14 support that idea that notice to a partnership is15 constructive notice to its partners.16 Turning back to the -- the idea of the --17 assessment in this case, the -- there are striking18 examples throughout the brief of the Government, although19 the Government contends that it is not able legally to20 assess partners, there are no less than 12 cases cited in21 the briefs, 10 of which were cited by the Government, in22 which summary collection process was instituted against23 partners, and in -- in any of those cases there was an24 assessment.25 In fact, the one case that's cited by the42, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005law tothe￼1 Government, the -- the United States v. Wright -- that's2 the case which came out of the Seventh Circuit that the3 Government contends is in direct conflict with the Ninth4 Circuit case in this instance is one where the United5 States District Court in its findings found that the6 partners were assessed. And it's not surprising7 therefore, that the Wright court found that there were --8 QUESTION: It said that -- but I thought Judge9 Easterbrook said that that was irrelevant, that there10 might have been a fact question about that whether there11 were individual assessments. But in any case, the court's12 rationale had nothing to do with that.13 MR. HABERBUSH: That is correct. However, the14 district court did find that there were assessments. The15 Seventh Circuit found that that was irrelevant to the --16 the determination. However, it is entirely consistent17 with the idea that in that case there were coterminous18 statute of limitations. For the reason that assessments19 were made within the statutory period of time -- that was20 still within the coterminous periods -- then the21 collection. The question was whether the 6502 allowed the22 collection against the partners who were jointly liable23 with the partnership in that instance. The statutory24 period of time allowed to the partnership, because it had25 been tolled during a bankruptcy, the court found43, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 coterminous statute of limitations, relying on the Updike2 case as its example.3 We -- we believe that the collection of taxes4 would be enhanced by adopting the position that we have5 taken in this case. We believe that requiring the filing6 of lawsuits in every instance where partners are liable7 for the debts of a partnership which has failed to pay its8 taxes and which may or may not be out of business, is9 simply a policy which would have litigation that is not10 required.11 If the partnership is liable for the tax and12 this Court were to find that the notice provisions of 630213 and the provisions of 6501 allowing suit or assessment14 within 3 years applies, that that would enhance the15 collection of taxes. We believe that -- excuse me -- we16 believe that by doing that, the tax will be paid at the17 earliest possible time. Interest and penalties, such as18 have accrued in this case, would not accrue because the19 partners would be encouraged at every point and at every20 spot to cause their partnership to pay or to pay the tax21 themselves.22 The Government is not in the business of banking23 tax claims, if you will, allowing them to accrue penalties24 and interest and thereafter, for who knows how many years,25 potentially as many as 3 plus 10, and if suit is filed44, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 within the 10 years under 6502, the -- the term for2 enforcing a judgment. So it could be 20-25 years that a3 partner could be out there liable for the tax during which4 penalties and interest continue to accrue, and then5 finally one day maybe that partner or that partner's6 estate or the partner's beneficiaries of the partner's7 estate might become liable for this tax.8 We believe that by filing the tax -- by filing9 an assessment at the earliest possible opportunity against10 the partners, this would encourage tax collection.11 QUESTION: Nothing would stop a partner from12 paying the tax.13 MR. HABERBUSH: If the partner knows, that is14 correct. If the --15 QUESTION: Isn't it reasonable to assume most16 partners know what's happening in their business?17 MR. HABERBUSH: I don't know that it's18 unreasonable to assume that, but I suppose it is19 reasonable. However, there are partnerships and there are20 partnerships, and some partnerships have managing partners21 who are actively involved in the business of the22 partnership and --23 QUESTION: Yes, but I -- I would think, by and24 large, most partners know what's going on.

HABERBUSH: That's exactly right.QUESTION: So don't become a general partner if you're not willing to know what's going on in the partnership. I -- I thought that's the deal.MR. HABERBUSH: Well, Your Honor, I don't know whether that --QUESTION: That's what it means to be a general partner. You're -- you're going to be liable for what the partnership does. So you better pay attention. I -- and you're saying this is unjust somehow?MR.

That's the only burden22 imposed.23 MR. HABERBUSH: Well, Your Honor, and looking at24 burdens there is no -- there is no insignificant -- excuse25 me. It's not a significant burden to place upon the48, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

JONES: Thank you.At page 3 of respondents' brief on the merits, they say -- and I quote -- if respondents are secondarily liable for the partnership taxes, then the Ninth Circuit's ruling that the IRS must assess respondents to collect the partnership taxes is incorrect. It is clear to us that there is -- this is a secondary derivative liability that partners have under State law. I didn't hear respondents give any explanation of why that isn't so.Given those two facts, then this Court's holding in Leighton seems clearly applicable, which is that we don't have to assess a derivative State law liability to bring suit to recover upon that liability.Now, respondents say, well, somehow that holding is influenced by the fact that transferee liability is provided in 6901 of the code. It's interesting that in -- in the Leighton case what the Court held was that the 6901 transferee liability is a supplementary remedy that did not displace and, indeed, left in place the right of the United States to bring its suit upon the derivative State law liability without assessment.So the -- the principle that we draw from the Leighton case is not dependent on any of the specific50, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 statutes that address specific types of -- of assignments2 of transferees. In fact, it's utterly independent of3 that, which was the very issue the Court decided in4 Leighton.5 Given that and -- and given that there's a6 derivative sub-secondary liability, we can recover against7 State law. Then the only other question is, well, what8 statute of limitations applies to that, which the Court9 held in Updike that it's 6502 which applies both to the10 direct liability and the derivative liability.11 QUESTION: See, that's what I'm really wondering12 about. I mean -- but -- but I mean, A, they may have not13 have raised it below. B, it's not within the scope of the14 question. C, it may not make any difference because the15 State and Federal may give you enough time anyway. But if16 you do have to get to it, I'm -- I'm a little worried17 about it because I don't -- I don't really see why it18 should be Federal.19 MR. JONES: The reason it should be Federal is20 because all of these actions are designed, as the Court21 stressed in Updike, to collect the tax. We have different22 remedies. Congress could Federalize all of this.23 Congress could write a statute that said, you know, you24 can bring suits for derivative liabilities and that those25 suits will -- specifically subject to 6502. And what the51, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Court noted in Stern was that Congress hasn't done that2 because the Court has consistently applied State law to3 permit such tax collection to occur.4 And -- and so that's why Updike has got to be5 right because this is a strong Federal interest in6 collecting taxes, not to be too big about it, but I mean,7 this Court has noted that the collection of taxes is the8 lifeblood of Government. This is as sovereign a claim as9 we have, and -- and because of that, we need to have a10 uniform statute of limitations, which Congress has11 provided under 6502.12 If -- if we were left to the haphazards of State13 law, we would certainly want Congress to -- to address14 that and correct it, but they don't need to correct it15 because since 1930 in the Updike case, the Court has16 explained that 6502 is broad enough to cover both types of17 -- of judicial collection proceedings. In the Court's18 words, the action against derivatively liable party is in19 every real sense a proceeding in court to collect the tax,20 and that's the -- that's the statutory language.21 And -- and I -- there has been no contention22 that that's not a correct interpretation of 6502. I do23 not know what references respondents may have in mind to24 arguments they raised under State statutes of limitations25 before. We're not familiar with those. The statute52, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 that's referred to in their merits brief is a specific2 State statute. We're not aware that that statute was ever3 cited before by the parties in this case, but even if it4 was, it seems to us that the reasoning of the Summerlin5 case and -- and of Updike, which is -- there's already a6 Federal statute -- should control that question and --7 QUESTION: Mr. Jones, why isn't Mr. Haberbush8 right at least when he says everybody would be better off9 if you went ahead and listed the partners as well on the10 assessment and gave them notice and demand? Then there11 would never be any hassle of whether you could use both12 remedies, administrative and judicial.13 MR. JONES: I think it's a question for Congress14 what's -- you know, what makes everybody better off. And15 what Congress has said is that we can assess these taxes16 against the employer. The employer under State law is a17 separate and distinct legal entity known as the18 partnership.19 QUESTION: Do you think you're impeded that you20 have no authority to give the partners notice21 individually?22 MR. JONES: We -- well, we have authority to23 give them notice of an assessment and collect from them24 administratively, but in terms of, if you will, making an25 assessment against them directly, we're supposed to assess53, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.
