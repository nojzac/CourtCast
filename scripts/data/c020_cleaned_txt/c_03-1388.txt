GOLDSTEIN               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Stevens, and may itplease the Court:          The petitioners in this case are Americancitizens who took cruises to and from this country ontickets bought here that call for the application of U.S.law.  They were subject to discrimination by respondent, aU.S.-based company on the land, in the ports, and in thewaters of the United States.          The question presented is whether the AmericansWith Disabilities Act applies or instead whetherrespondent's conduct is lawful because the case iscontrolled by Bahamian law, which freely permits cruiselines to discriminate against persons with disabilities.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Mr. Goldstein, may I inquireof you whether other countries, for instance, in the EUarea, have applied their own disability laws to some ofthe cruise ships that touch base in their courts?MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice O'Connor, our research 31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 does not reveal that the question has arisen in the EU. I2 can, however, provide you some information, and that is3 that -- two points I think.4 The first is they subscribe -- the members of5 the EU subscribe to the same conventions and to UNCLOS6 just the way we do, which gives the port state plenary7 authority within its ports and internal waters. And I8 have a couple of case citations for you on this issue. In9 the ECJ, the Diva Navigation case, 1992, ECR I-6019, and10 the Mateo Peralta case, 1994, ECR I-3453.11 It has not arisen in the EU, but it has arisen12 in Australia. Australia has a disability law. It applies13 that law to cruise ships, and the rule in Australia is14 that the port state law applies rather than the flag state15 law. And the citation for that is the Union Shipping16 case, 2002, NSWCA 124 CA 40379/01. I don't know what17 those numbers mean.18 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Thank you.19 And would you also address at some point how the20 treaty on Safety of Life at Sea would affect the21 resolution here? For example, it has, as I understand it,22 requirements that there be watertight doors and those23 doors have to be set above the level of the floor so you24 couldn't roll a handicapped wheelchair or something over25 it. Now, do you anticipate that there would have to be41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 structural changes if you were to prevail that would2 conflict with the treaty on Safety of Life at Sea?3 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, and you have put your finger4 on the point, and that is that there are no conflicts. We5 know that for a couple of reasons.6 The first is that there has been a detailed7 rulemaking underway in which the regulatory authorities8 charged by Congress with implementing the ADA have spent9 quite some time. They have produced this single-spaced,10 half-inch thick document that is dedicated to making --11 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Are they in effect yet?12 MR. GOLDSTEIN: They are not, but in terms of13 whether or not the statute, when it's applied, would14 conflict, you would look to this document and they took as15 their regulatory mission to make sure there were no such16 conflicts. What they did -- let me take your example17 specifically and then put -- place it within the statutory18 framework.19 Within the ADA and a question of the combings,20 what they said is, that's right. In certain cases SOLAS21 requires that the coamings be a certain height. If the22 coamings are below the bulkhead level, where you would be23 worried about water coming in below, that is not an24 accessible route, and so you don't have to worry about it25 at all. Above there, you ramp up to the coaming and ramp51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 down, unless that's structurally infeasible. So they --2 what they did is they -- and this is the broader point.3 they applied the rule of the ADA that a change to the4 structure of the vessel only has to be implemented if it's5 readily achievable. And what the regulatory authorities6 determined is that if there is any conflict with SOLAS at7 all, that change need not be made.8 Now, you -- Justice O'Connor, you also focused9 on the fact that there are some of our claims that10 implicate the structure of the ship. They are, however, a11 distinct minority, and we ought not lose sight of this12 because I don't think the other side has any good argument13 at all, under international law or anything else, that14 would explain why they can charge a person with a15 disability double.1617 bit about18 this case19 charging the double doesn't involve modification of the20 ship, obviously. How does it work if you have, oh, say,21 an English passenger who buys an English ticket and is22 charged double -- I don't know if that's the English law,23 but let's assume -- then he comes on a cruise ship and he24 goes to New York and Miami and -- and New Orleans? Can he25 -- does he -- could he then sue, if -- if we rule for you61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can you tell me just a littlethat, how it works?  Suppose that you prevail in-- and it does seem to me that the -- the￼1 in this case?2 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I would think on the question of3 the charging double, the answer to that question would be4 no because it would present a traditional, not unique to5 the ADA, choice-of-law question, and that is, if you're in6 England and you buy a ticket in England, your ticket is7 going to be subject to English common -- in that case, the8 English disability law. There is an English disability9 law. It doesn't discuss cruise ships. It's -- but it's10 broadly written.11 But with respect to the structure of the ship, I12 think that English passenger with a disability -- say that13 you come across to the United States and you want to get14 off in New York. I think that Congress clearly intended15 that that person would be able to come off a -- off the16 dock in a wheelchair, back onto the dock on the17 wheelchair; while you were in U.S. ports and you're18 staying in your cabin, that you would be able to, in your19 accessible -- your accessible rest room, have grab bars.20 We are -- and -- and let me not pass too quickly21 by the fact that even when we talk about some structural22 changes in the ship, by and large we're talking about23 things that have nothing to do with -- Justice O'Connor,24 you focused the name of the treaty is the Safety of Life25 at Sea. Whether the bathroom doors swing in and out has71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 nothing to do with that. Whether there is --2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Goldstein, may -- may I3 take it from your answer that it doesn't make any4 difference in your view, your answer to the question about5 the -- the ship leaving from a port in England and going6 many places and touching base in New York, that kind of a7 voyage, or what this case seems to be where the vast8 majority of the passengers are from the United States, the9 port of departure is in the United States, the port of10 return is in the United States. You don't seem to11 distinguish those cases because you say in the New York12 port, it doesn't matter if it's really a U.S.-centered13 cruise or a cruise centered in Italy or any place else.14 Is that correct?15 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I think your formulation is16 exactly right, Justice Ginsburg. It doesn't matter to us17 where the cruise is centered.18 We do, however, and this Court's precedents do,19 however, leave room for a highly unusual cruise that I'm20 not aware exists. Take, for example, a situation in which21 a cruise comes from England to the United States. It22 doesn't pick up any passengers here. They just visit.23 They stop in 15 other countries. They stop here. The24 same passengers get up on the ship and leave. This25 Court's precedents involving maritime choice of law leave81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 room for2 think --34 the more 567 saying that the U.S. rules the world. Even if the home8 port, the place where this vessel is usually berthed, says9 we -- we don't require our ships to take care of the10 handicapped, you are, in effect, saying no matter what the11 other ports say, what the U.S. law is is going to govern12 because practically if you're going to design the ship to13 meet the U.S. requirements, you're not going to rip those14 out when the ship goes elsewhere.15 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Ginsburg, we disagree16 with the characterization that the U.S. rules the world,17 of course. We're talking about the fact that Congress18 exercised its sovereign authority to control vessels in19 its ports and internal waters, just as in -- take the20 Cunard example. In the Cunard case, there were countries21 -- and I understand it didn't involve the structure of the22 ship, but the principle is the same. There were countries23 that required alcoholic beverages to be on those vessels,24 and --25JUSTICE SCALIA: We -- we could -- we could 9the conclusion that says, look, we just don't JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But if we go back to what isusual situation -- MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then you are, in effect,1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 require ships that are docked in the United States to pay2 their crews according to United States Jones Act3 requirements or United States minimum wage laws and so4 forth. We don't do that. We could do it, but we don't5 because it conflicts with -- with the law of the flag and6 -- and that's the usual -- it's not a matter of our power7 to do it. We could do it, of course, but it's just not8 something we ordinarily do.9 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Justice Scalia, I actually10 disagree with your characterization and would like to11 point you to a couple of precedents. The Benz and12 McCulloch cases, which are very important to the13 respondents, were very important to the Fifth Circuit,14 embody the principle that you just described, to some15 extent, and that is that when you have a foreign ship in16 our waters, we will not apply the NLRA to the labor17 contract between the foreign crew and the foreign vessel.18 But when Americans are involved, we do apply the NLRA, and19 that's the Ariadne precedent that the -- and -- and in20 fact, Ariadne is the most on-point case because it --21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Was -- was that the ship or was22 it longshoremen?23 MR. GOLDSTEIN: It was longshoremen working on24 the ship complaining about safety conditions on the ship.25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Longshoremen. Longshoremen101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 based -- based on shore. Right?2 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Based on shore, but so are the3 passengers.4 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a different --5 MR. GOLDSTEIN: But it is a different situation,6 but I think it's more analogous. Not only were the -- the7 protests in Ariadne directed at the safety conditions on8 the foreign-flagged vessel, but they were directed at the9 passengers. If I could --10 JUSTICE BREYER: What's -- what's the scope of11 what you're talking about here? I mean, are -- it says12 cruise ships. So I had assumed those are those big ships13 that carry people mostly around the Mediterranean from14 Florida. But based on what you're saying, now I think15 you're talking about something more. Are you talking, for16 example, about a merchant vessel that comes from, say,17 Saudi Arabia and has a few passengers? What's the --18 what's the scope of the definition?19 MR. GOLDSTEIN: The -- well, that -- the20 definition -- we would have to return to the ADA. If a21 merchant ship has a few passengers, it would not be a22 specified form of public transportation or a public23 accommodation.24 JUSTICE BREYER: Because? It -- what it does is25 it carries oil, but a certain number of people like to be111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425on a ship with oil, I guess.  And so every -- every monththey take 12 people and they put them in a cabin somewhereand they love it.too.JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's cheaper.  It's cheaper(Laughter.)MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I'm not aware of -- of --JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  I -- but all right.Now, I'm -- I'm being facetious.          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.          JUSTICE BREYER:  But I am aware of -- of peoplewho have certainly gone on cruises on what is a primarilymerchant ship.  Now that -- that I think is a commonthing.          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  If -- let me --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Are you talking -- because Ithink that makes a difference for the reason that once youtalk about those, you're talking about primarily foreign-flagged vessels that are rarely but sometimes in theUnited States where the costs would be very high probablyto change the ship and the benefit to Americans would betiny.  All right.  So I -- I want to know what you'retalking about.          MR.just to -- toGOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  Let me first say -- andlock the point down in that cost is12 Washington, DC 20005 1-1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400￼1 accounted for in the definition of what is readily2 achievable.3 But let's go to the definition of specified public4 transportation because this will tell us what's going to5 be covered by the ADA. And just for the transcript, the6 citation is -- this is section 12181(110). It's -- it's7 very short, but it's at the middle of page 12 of the blue8 brief. Specified public transportation means9 transportation by bus, rail, or any other conveyance other10 than by aircraft, which has its own statute, that provides11 the general public with general or special service on a12 regular and continuing basis. That too would be covered.13 And only the public places on the ship would be covered by14 it.15 Can I just return briefly to my Ariadne point?16 Because I just wanted -- that's a case where the -- the17 NLRA was applied. And let me just read to you what the18 protest was that the NLRA was applied to because it fits19 perfectly with this case. And again, for the transcript,20 this is in the lower court opinion at 215 So.2d 53. This21 was the handbill. Warning. Is your cruise ship a22 floating death trap? Can a substandard foreign-flagged23 cruise ship turn your holiday into a Holocaust? They were24 very illiterate. If thousands of unsuspecting Americans25 continue to place their lives in jeopardy every day on131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 cruises aboard foreign-flagged floating fire traps. And2 that -- that was a foreign-flagged ship. They we're3 concerned about the passengers.4 Justice Scalia, you also gave the example of the5 Jones Act, but remember that the Rhoditis case and the6 Uravic case, which involved injuries in the United States,7 then the Jones Act did apply. And that was -- and8 Rhoditis was a case in which someone was on the ship and a9 chain broke and they were injured as a result of it, and10 U.S. law applied.11 This is a situation in which millions of people12 in the United States are spending billions of dollars on13 cruises, and it seems --14 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but I -- if I understand15 you correctly, your case really isn't limited to cruise16 ships. It's limited to ships that come into -- passenger17 ships, which would include the Queen Mary and Queen18 Elizabeth, all the rest of them. Wouldn't it?19 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, but I -- I take it that the20 -- you know --21 JUSTICE STEVENS: And the fact that it's based22 in Miami or it had mostly American customers really is not23 relevant to the legal issue. Is it?24 MR. GOLDSTEIN: It -- it is in the sense that it25 makes this the recurring scenario that Congress would have141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 been aware of when it enacted the ADA in --2 JUSTICE STEVENS: But, of course, they would3 have been aware of those that are also less American in4 their patronage and so forth.5 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's true. In the very rare6 case, which I am not aware of, in which a cruise ship7 comes to the United States, doesn't pick up passengers,8 then it's possible that the -- that the ADA would not9 apply.10 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but we're not necessarily11 thinking of a cruise ship, just the transatlantic liner12 that goes from Liverpool to Miami or something. That13 would be covered.14 MR. GOLDSTEIN: It would in -- in U.S.15 territory. That's right.16 JUSTICE BREYER: But there's no way they can17 change the ship structurally when it's in New York and not18 have it changed structurally when it's in Europe. So the19 mystery to me at this moment is what is the universe of20 ships that I would not say fit the ordinary word cruise.21 What they are are ships that go between Asia and San22 Francisco, Los Angeles, or New York and Europe, or maybe23 through the Suez Canal. They're only here a little bit of24 the time. Their passengers are mostly not American.25 Now, is that something I should worry about? If151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that were your case, I would be very worried. If that's2 just a little bit of -- of added significance, then I want3 to know what to do about it.4 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Let me tell you what I know, and5 that is that the other side has not identified any6 problems of this -- this type. My research has not7 revealed some situation where we have a lot of these8 ships. I did carefully study the -- the itineraries of9 the major cruise lines, and 95 percent-plus of all of10 their trips go out from the United States and come back to11 the United States.12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you told me -- and I want13 to make sure this is your answer -- that it doesn't14 matter, that as long as the ship comes to a U.S. port as15 part of this overall journey, you -- you answered that16 question and I thought that was your candid answer, that17 it doesn't matter that these -- these particular cruise18 ships ply mostly U.S. waters and U.S. trade and are19 centered, even have their principal place of business in20 the United States. You're not concentrating on that21 category. You are saying that the ADA applies so long as22 the ship puts in at -- at a U.S. port, picks up23 passengers. It applies not only while it's in the port,24 but practically for every other place the ship goes.25 That's why I asked isn't this the United States rules the161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 world on what -- your argument you made.2 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Ginsburg, here I think3 is the difference, and that is, that while U.S. law may4 have an extraterritorial consequence, just like our5 maritime tort law and the like, you cannot in Europe6 enforce the ADA. The fact that the structural changes --7 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you can enforce the --8 the discrimination provisions, but the structural9 provisions don't have to be enforced. Once the step is10 changed, they're not going to change it when they get 311 miles out.12 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's right. But Justice --13 Justice Ginsburg's point -- I take it to be a more14 particular one. It's true that our law will have15 consequences abroad, but it is not the case that the U.S.16 rules the world.17 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it rules the world unless18 the world does not want to use the United States ports as19 ports of call.20 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice -- Justice Souter, I --21 I simply disagree, and that is, when you talk about the22 U.S. ruling the world, in a -- in the context, say, of23 ARAMCO, we talked about the enforceability of U.S. law24 abroad. When the United States has tort standards or25 vehicle manufacturing standards and the like, all of those171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 have consequences abroad for how devices are made and2 brought into the country. But that doesn't mean that --3 what's going on is the plenary authority of the United4 States to enforce its laws in its ports and in its5 internal waters. That very rule always will have6 extraterritorial consequences.7 JUSTICE SCALIA: We're not questioning the8 authority. We're questioning whether Congress intended9 that to be the case. We have a rule that -- that requires10 a clear statement when it has effects of this sort.11 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Scalia, we disagree, and12 let me just take you to your cases. I did that, I think,13 in the Jones Act and the NLRA context. But let's just14 state the rule, and that is, from the Wildenhus's Case and15 that's at page 12. Foreign law governs matters of16 discipline and all things done on board which affected17 only the vessel and those belonging to her and did not18 involve the peace or dignity of the country or the19 tranquility of the port. And what we're talking --20 JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Goldstein, there's21 another aspect that troubles me. Your view, as I22 understand, only applies while the ship is in American23 waters so that if, for example, you complain about the24 training for a safety drill, if they conducted those after25 they'd gone out 20 miles to sea, there would be -- there181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425would be no violation of the -- the statue.  Would there?          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That is -- that is a difficultquestion.  We have not -- we have not pleaded such aclaim.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  In other words, I'm trying tounderstand.  You don't know what your position is --          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- with respect to what wouldotherwise be violations of the statute that occur on thehigh seas.          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  We do believe it would becovered because the accommodation was purchased here,although we haven't raised the claim in this Court.          If I could reserve the remainder --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes, but I think we should --the cruise ships are entitled to know whether they mayfreely discriminate against people in the casinos and soforth when they're on the high seas.          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  We --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  You don't know the answer tothat.          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Stevens, our position isthat because of the definition of commerce in the ADA,when you purchase a public accommodation in the UnitedStates, that is an agreement to provide a public191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425accommodation and it doesn't --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  So your view is not limited towhat happens in the territorial waters.          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That is right, although we have-- we would win the case on the internal waters and theterritorial waters, and we haven't asserted in this Courta claim relating to the high seas.          If I could reserve the remainder of my time.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Salmons, may I ask beforeyou begin whether the United States agrees that thestatute would apply to the activities of these ships whenthey're on the high seas?             ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS              ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,       AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS          MR. SALMONS:  Justice Stevens, and may it pleasethe Court:          We do not think that title III of the ADA wasintended to apply extraterritorially.  That said, we thinkthere is a question that would need to be resolved as towhether applying the ADA to a public accommodation thatwas entered into in the United States, that began in theUnited States, a necessary term of which we believe wouldbe nondiscrimination, would in fact be an extraterritorialapplication of U.S. law.201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SCALIA:  When -- when the ship is out onthe high seas?          MR. SALMONS:  That's correct, Justice Scalia.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You think that's a hardquestion --          MR. SALMONS:  No.  We think the better view --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- whether that's anextraterritorial application of U.S. law?          MR. SALMONS:  No.  We think the better view, infact, Justice Scalia, is that that would not be anextraterritorial application of U.S. law.  But if theCourt were to disagree, then we would say title III doesnot apply at that time.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know whatextraterritorial application means if it doesn't meanthat, that a ship that is not in the United States isbound by United States law.  What -- why isn't thatextraterritorial application?          MR. SALMONS:  The reason, Justice Scalia, wouldbe because the accommodation that was offered, that wasentered into, and that began in the United States -- and-- and I would point out -- I think this is important tokeep in mind --JUSTICE SOUTER: What you're saying is it would 211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425-- I thought you were saying that it would be theenforcement of the domestic contract of which the -- thestatutory provisions would be an implied term.  Isn't thatit?          MR. SALMONS:  Yes.  Yes, that's correct.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  It does not apply of its ownforce.  It applies because two parties in the UnitedStates contracted that it would apply.  Is that it?          MR. SALMONS:  That's correct.  Now -- now, I --I would just add that I think it -- you could characterizea public accommodation, you know, five nights lodging, forexample.  If that's entered into in the United States and-- and that begins in the United States, that a necessaryterm of that is nondiscrimination, and --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, then if you --          MR. SALMONS:  -- if you have an ADA claim thatgoverns that even if the discrimination occurred abroad,that would only relate to those things tied into theaccommodation.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But if you're on a round tripticket from Liverpool to Miami and back, it would dependon where you bought the ticket.          MR. SALMONS:  Well, again, we -- we think thatif accommodation begins here in the United States, that --that a necessary term of that is nondiscrimination.  Now,221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425whether you characterize that as a contract claim or as asubstantive application of the ADA, I'm not sure there'smuch of a difference.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes, but Justice Stevens'question is you buy the ticket in Liverpool.  Is the ADA-- an -- an American buys the ticket in Liverpool to cometo the United States.          MR. SALMONS:  To come to the United States.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Is the ADA an applied term ofthat contract?          MR. SALMONS:  I would -- I would assume not,although the question then would be whether or not it's apublic accommodation that's been offered in the UnitedStates.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Don't -- don't all --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Even in U.S. waters?  Thatwouldn't make sense.  An American buys a ticket in -- inLiverpool.  He's disabled.  He goes to New York, Miami,New Orleans, and he's discriminated at -- at each step.No -- no coverage just because of where he bought theticket?          MR. SALMONS:  No, no, Justice Kennedy, that'snot our position.  Let me -- let me try and be clear.  Wethink that any vessel that comes into the internal watersand ports of the United States and offers a public231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425accommodation or a specified public transportation serviceto our residents is subject to the ADA.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, that means --          MR. SALMONS:  If -- if you had a situation --I'm sorry.          JUSTICE BREYER:  No, go ahead.          MR. SALMONS:  If you had a situation where youhad a ship that -- let's say, that began in -- in GreatBritain and came here, it didn't pick up passengers herein the United States, I think that the better view wouldbe, sure, United States law could apply to it because it'sin our internal waters, but that as a substantive matter,with regard to the ADA, I don't know why that would be apublic accommodation within the meaning of the ADA becauseit's not an accommodation that's offered --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But do you --          MR. SALMONS:   -- or available to United Statesresidents.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you agree with Mr.Goldstein that nothing turns on -- one might characterizethis kind of cruise as U.S.-centered, but his answer wasas long as they put in, a regular cruise stop, they pickup, they unload passengers, they take them back again onthe ship, so long as they touch base at a U.S. port,241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 letting off and picking up passengers, the ADA applies?2 Do you agree with that interpretation?3 MR. SALMONS: As I understand what Your Honor4 just said, I think that I would. Let me just clarify,5 though. We think the relevant question is whether that6 ship would -- has offered a public accommodation or a7 specified public transportation service --8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is my --9 MR. SALMONS: -- in the United States, and if10 the answer is yes --11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let -- let me ask you the12 same question that I asked Mr. Goldstein. Even in the13 Cunard case, the prohibition case, they couldn't have14 liquor in the U.S. port, but when they leave and they go15 to Jamaica, they could pick up rum there. They could have16 liquor all the rest of the time so long as, when they17 enter and leave the U.S. port, they didn't have the liquor18 aboard.19 Here what you're saying is what goes in the --20 for the New York port goes for every other place where21 this ship2223 of -- not24 U.S. law,25 accommodation1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400puts in.MR. SALMONS:  Well, again, I -- not as a matteras a matter of extraterritorial application ofbutthat is our position with regard to a publicthat begins in the United States.  I -- I25 Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 think the -- the important --2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose it doesn't begin in3 the United States in that it -- it starts in, say, The4 Bahamas, and stops at --5 MR. SALMONS: I should probably should not have6 said begin, Your Honor. What I mean is if it -- if the7 public accommodation is provided for in the United States,8 that would be covered by the terms of the ADA, we think9 the ADA applies.10 JUSTICE BREYER: Then you're saying exactly what11 everybody is worried about. I take it there is no way12 really for a ship to -- they either have the right door or13 they don't have the right door. And we're interested in14 the set of cases in which they're going to have to change15 their doors. And what I came in here thinking was we're16 talking about ships that pick up people and sail in17 Florida and sail around the Caribbean. That's the -- now,18 I've heard nothing but we're not talking just about those.19 We are talking about ships like I'm the last human being20 alive that went on a Swiss ship to Europe. Okay?21 (Laughter.)22 JUSTICE BREYER: 50 years ago. And -- and we're23 talking about those ships, or we're talking about merchant24 ships that also say to the public, come as a passenger.25 Now, I would like to -- not what you're arguing.261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 You're going to say, yes, we are arguing it. I want to2 know -- say something to relieve my concern about that3 set, which was Justice Ginsburg's concern. We are trying4 to rule the world in respect to those ships that only come5 here occasionally or it isn't a big part of their6 business, but they want to come to pick up American7 passengers.8 MR. SALMONS: Sure. Sure. And what I would say9 with regard to that is that you're right that our broad10 view is that the ADA applies if that -- if they're11 offering public accommodation here in the United States.12 But if you reject that, I think there are13 several ways you could approach that. One would be to14 apply traditional choice-of-law factors that are -- that15 are applicable in maritime, and you could conclude, you16 know, based on sort of whether or not there are sufficient17 contacts here and whether or not --18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you're saying that this19 is your position, but don't worry about it because we'll20 reject your position?21 MR. SALMONS: No, no. He asked me to say22 something that -- that would -- would help his concerns.23 What I'm trying to say --24 JUSTICE BREYER: One thing might be true, what25 you're not saying, is there really aren't very many of271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 those ships, or another thing you might say, which you're2 not saying because maybe isn't true, is almost all of3 those ships that there are are already subject to tougher4 -- tougher rules, say, in Europe. But you don't say5 either of 678 of those, 9those.MR. SALMONS:  No.  No --JUSTICE BREYER:  Since you don't you say eitherI think neither may be true.MR. SALMONS:  Well, I don't know the specific10 number. I would think that there are not many that the --11 that this -- what you're concerned with primarily here are12 cruise ships that are in the business of providing public13 accommodations.14 But I would add as well -- and I think this is15 very important that the Court keep in mind -- that the16 clear statement rule, as it's -- as it's posited by17 respondent here, would not just apply to the ADA. It18 would apply to all U.S. laws, and that would include title19 II of the Civil Rights Act20 racial discrimination, and21 a remarkable construction.22 JUSTICE SCALIA:23 of laws you're talking about. Laws that require the crew24 to be treated differently are -- are quite different from25 law -- laws that -- that require a passenger to be treated281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-of 1964 in its prohibition ofI would find that that would beIt depends on what -- what kind￼1 a certain way in the United States.2 MR. SALMONS: Justice Scalia, you're correct,3 and that's precisely why they have --4 JUSTICE SCALIA: And laws -- laws that require5 structural alteration of a ship are quite different from6 laws that say while you're in United States waters, you7 won't discriminate on the basis of race.8 MR. SALMONS: If -- two -- two responses, if I9 may, Your Honor. And that is, if you -- if that is the10 conclusion you reach, then you still need to remand this11 case because there are an awful number of claims that are12 precisely13 would not1415 the scope16 requirement that you have to have a clear statement to17 apply a U.S. law to a foreign vessel. There is only a18 requirement that you need a clear statement if the conduct19 at issue would relate only to the internal matters of that20 vessel. And here you're dealing with publicthose kinds of claims that the Fifth Circuitallow.Secondly, I think you're wrong with regard toof the clear statement requirement.  There is no21 accommodation --22 JUSTICE SCALIA: If we haven't expressed it yet,23 we ought to express it then.24 MR. SALMONS: Well, I disagree, Your Honor. And25 what I would point you to is -- is that the long -- every291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 time this Court has spoken with regard to the clear2 statement requirement relating to foreign-flagged ships,3 it has referred to the internal order doctrine. And that4 is embodied in a number of bilateral agreements that go5 back for centuries. The -- the treaty that was at issue6 in the Wildenhus's Case expressly said that if the -- if7 the conduct did not relate to members of the crew but to8 passengers or other members of the port state or otherwise9 affected the interests of the port state, that the port10 state law would apply. And that is the general rule.11 The international regime that governs this area12 by its terms provide minimum standards and leaves it13 available to port states and to flag states to add14 additional requirements. That would mean --15 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Salmons, one of the16 alternatives you threw out, not as a response to clear17 statement, but as a -- a response to the issue that was18 being raised by it, was the provision of the statute that19 it was intended to exercise the -- the fullest extent of20 the -- of the commerce power. And The -- The Bahamas21 respond to that by saying you could have said exactly --22 or argued exactly the same thing in McCulloch. What is23 your response24 MR.25 that on -- on1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400to that?SALMONS:  Well, I -- I would disagree witha couple of respects.  The first is that the30 Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425definition of commerce here is broader than it was andspecifically refers to travel between the United Statesand foreign countries.  The only other statute we're awareof that says that is title II of the Civil Rights Act of1964.          In addition --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, may I just ask you a -- afactual question?  I didn't go back to the text to checkthis.  Does the text of this statute say in these wordsbasically we are exercising the fullest possible extent ofthe commerce power?          MR. SALMONS:  Absolutely, Justice Souter.  What-- what the text of the statute says --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  And it's not in McCulloch.          MR. SALMONS:  That's correct.  What the text ofthis statute says is that -- in fact, this is thedefinition of commerce that relates only to title III ofADA.  And it says precisely that it includes travelbetween foreign countries and the United States and thatCongress was intending to -- to reach the full sweep ofits -- its constitutional authority.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Mr. Salmons.          Mr. Frederick.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. FREDERICK:  Thank you, Justice Stevens, andmay it please the Court:          This case is about congressional intent notcongressional power.  Congress undoubtedly has thepower --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Could you address the lastpoint?          MR. FREDERICK:  Yes.  It was not the fullestextent of the commerce power.  That statute was at issuein this Court's case concerning the Lanham Act where theCourt said that a violation of the Lanham Act thatoccurred in Mexico but had an effect in the United Stateswas intended to be covered by Congress because thatcommerce clause, Justice Souter, did state to the fullestextent of Congress' power under the Commerce Clause of theConstitution.          This statute does not say that.  This statutetalks about commerce in and between States andterritories, and it is much closer to the statute languagethat this Court addressed in the ARAMCO case where --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  So it -- it doesn't have thefullest extent language then.          MR. FREDERICK:  That's correct.  That's correct.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How does it compare to titleII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964?321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. FREDERICK: Well, there are slight2 differences in the language, but I don't think that's3 dispositive because title VII of the Civil Rights Act,4 which this Court addressed in the ARAMCO case, the Court5 -- the Chief Justice's opinion there said that that6 language was not enough to express the intent.7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that would be the same for8 title II, which is the public accommodations part of the9 Civil Rights Act of 1964. So I take it that you are10 saying that on these foreign-flagged vessels, just as the11 ADA would be inapplicable, so title II, the public12 accommodations part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, would13 be inapplicable.14 MR. FREDERICK: It's all a question of15 congressional intent, Justice Ginsburg, and there's no16 indication of an intent that Congress needed to address17 any problem that arose with respect to that form of18 discrimination.1920 is, there21 at a U.S.22 passengers on the basis of race.23 MR. FREDERICK: Well, there would be no U.S.24 congressional statute that would address that, Justice25 Ginsburg. There would be a violation of the Bahamian331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So your -- but your answerbeing no such indication, that a ship putting inport was free to discriminate among its￼1 constitution which prohibits --2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm asking about the U.S. law3 and policy which says no segregation, no discrimination in4 places of 56 there has7 industry.8 about foreign ships here.9 And I want to get back to the structuralpublic accommodation.MR. FREDERICK:  As I said, I'm not aware thatever been an instance of that in the cruiseCongress has not addressed that.  We're talking10 features of the ship because the ADA fundamentally --1112 question,13 engage in14 selling of tickets and the provision of accommodations15 while in U.S. ports and within the 3 --16 MR. FREDERICK: Justice O'Connor, our position17 is that Congress has not spoken to the question, and so18 there is no congressional statute that is on point.19 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then your answer, I take it, is20 yes, it can discriminate and it can discriminate because21 Congress has not told it not to. Is that it?22 MR. FREDERICK: No. No. Our position is that23 it can't discriminate because a different law proscribes24 that --25JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, but this is a goodand what is your position?  That the ship couldracial discrimination while in U.S. ports on theJUSTICE SOUTER: So far as United States law is 341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425concerned, it could.          MR. FREDERICK:  Yes.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And the same answer for 1981?          MR. FREDERICK:  Justice Ginsburg, as I said,Congress has not extended its laws to the full reach ofU.S. territorial power, and this Court has maintained thatposition ever since the Charming Betsy case 200 years ago,The Schooner Exchange case, and Brown v. Duchesne.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, let's put it this way.So my understanding of your answer is that we could writean opinion ruling for you but leaving these otherquestions open?  I don't see how we can do that.          MR. FREDERICK:  What you say, Justice Kennedy,is that the clear statement canon requires Congress to saywhen it intends to apply a law to a foreign vessel.Congress didn't do that.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But if I'm writing the opinionand I put that down and rule for you, it seems to me thatI then answered necessarily Justice Ginsburg's question inthe negative.          MR. FREDERICK:  You do, Justice Kennedy.  Andjust as this Court in the ARAMCO case said that title VIIdoesn't apply to the foreign -- work in a foreign land byan American company of an American --JUSTICE KENNEDY: But these -- 351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. FREDERICK:  Justice Kennedy, Congress hasn'textended criminal laws of the United States to the fullreach of U.S. power.  It is only proscribed 15 offensesthat will apply in the special maritime jurisdiction.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Frederick, this is --this is what concerns me about your answer.  I know thatMr. Goldstein took the position that it doesn't matterwhat kind of operation this is, but the operation thatwe're dealing with, it sells tickets mainly to -- whatpercentage of its passengers are from the USA?          MR. FREDERICK:  Approximately two-thirds tothree-quarters in any given year.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And does it normally startthe voyage and end it in U.S. ports?          MR. FREDERICK:  The majority of them do.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And how much of itsadvertising budget is pitched at U.S. customers?          MR. FREDERICK:  Justice Ginsburg, there -- allof those questions are going to be answered as apredominant marketing effort, et cetera is directed to theU.S. market.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, this is the anomaly.You're asking us to buy an interpretation.  An enterpriseis U.S.-centered in terms of where it gets its businessand that enterprise, nonetheless, is not bound by what is361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 our bedrock anti-discrimination law both with regard to2 customers, passengers, and employment.3 MR. FREDERICK: And the reason, Justice4 Ginsburg, is that that law imposes structural changes on5 vessels that go to other ports.6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why don't you -- why don't you7 try to draw that line? Why don't you say that just as the8 applicability or not may depend upon whether you're9 dealing with a crew of a foreign ship or whether you're10 dealing with an American who happens to be injured on11 board that ship, so also it may depend upon whether the12 anti-discrimination law in question is one that at least13 in some of its applications requires structural changes or14 not? That would enable you to say the ADA doesn't apply,15 but would16 apply.17 18not compel you to say that title II doesn'tMR. FREDERICK:  We are talking --JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're not willing to take suchposition.MR. FREDERICK:  Well, Justice Scalia, I thinkcould certainly carve out in its clear --19 a limited 2021 the Court22 articulation of the clear statement principle some of23 these lines. It becomes very --24 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, the ADA itself makes an25 exception for things that aren't readily achievable. I371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 mean, you could certainly lean on that because a2 structural change probably isn't readily achievable.34 it talked5 cost. It6 of other nations or --7 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there -- is there -- I mean,8 you're giving me the answer I thought the other side9 would give me. All right? And I appreciate it actually.MR. FREDERICK:  Justice O'Connor, Congress, whenabout readily achievable, did so in terms ofdidn't do so in terms of conflict with the laws10 (Laughter.)11 JUSTICE BREYER: You say that two-thirds of12 these people, the customers, are American. So we're13 dealing with a business that is primarily American, not a14 business like the Swiss ship except with the exceptional15 cases. Then you say, all right, still it's a problem16 because of structural changes we'll have to make. What17 changes? That is to say, I would have thought I could18 have read, but I haven't, that other countries like Europe19 also have discrimination laws against disabled people, and20 therefore, given that fact and given the document that Mr.21 Goldstein produced, it is highly unlikely that your22 clients will have to make any significant structural23 change that they wouldn't have had to make anyway.24 MR. FREDERICK: That's --25 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what's the response to381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that?2 MR. FREDERICK: Well, that's completely false.3 In -- in the year 2000, the United States Government4 issued a report that contained an extensive appendix,5 which we've cited in our brief, that details in laborious6 detail the conflicts between land-based ADA standards and7 SOLAS.8 Now, I can give you some specifics, if you would9 -- that are fairly practical, such as the ADA requires10 under the interpretation advanced by the petitioners that11 there be a disabled access cabin on every level of the12 ship, but SOLAS requires that passengers with disabilities13 be placed near evacuation points.14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why -- why can't you just15 fight that battle by battle on what's reasonably16 achievable? Because in order to avoid that problem, what17 you're telling us is that a cruise line can charge a -- a18 disabled person double the price --19 MR. FREDERICK: As a matter of fact --20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- because they're a nuisance.21 And that's your position.22 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Kennedy, as a matter of23 fact, we categorically deny the claims of discrimination24 here. We're having to fight this on the basis of assuming25 the -- the allegations are true, but they are391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 categorically false. And --2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it doesn't matter what3 you want to do as a matter of good will. The question is4 what the law requires you to do, and you're saying it's up5 to us, we govern. You're not governed by U.S. anti-6 discrimination law.7 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Ginsburg, what the other8 side wants is a case-by-case method of decision-making in9 which a district judge becomes the special master of the10 cruise industry so that each claim of discrimination that11 would require some modification to the ship --12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That happens to every employer13 under -- in the United States under the reasonably14 achievable standard.15 MR. FREDERICK: And that's why, Justice Kennedy,16 it's a question of congressional intent. The very same17 Congress debated extensively about whether to impose18 design requirements on foreign ships in the Oil Pollution19 Act of 1990, and it decided to buck the international20 system knowingly by imposing a design requirement that21 double hulls be imposed on oil tankers, foreign oil22 tankers.23 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick, that brings up24 a question I've been meaning to ask you. To what extent25 was this whole problem of the application of this statute401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425to the foreign vessels discussed in the legislativehistory of these statutes?          MR. FREDERICK:  Zero.  There is not one wordabout vessel --          JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  If -- if that's soand if you look at the earlier cases -- but all I couldget out it is that those earlier cases -- the Court triesto do what it really would have thought Congress wouldhave intended in the circumstances.  And if that's so, whywouldn't Congress really have intended that a businessthat's two-thirds American has to abide by American law?          MR. FREDERICK:  Because it was encroaching on anarea of foreign sovereignty.  Foreign ships are governedby foreign laws.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Does -- does Britain -- or doesBritain or does the European Union, for example, forbidyou to charge this double price?          MR. FREDERICK:  I don't --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Does European law -- I'd besurprised if it doesn't forbid it, but do you know?          MR. FREDERICK:  I -- I don't know the answer toEuropean law on charging of an additional price, but Iwould point out that pricing,do go to the structure of thehere fundamentally in the ADA41like evacuation procedures,vessel.  And we're talkingabout structural changes1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that they want to impose that go -- when ships travel,2 they can't dismantle those structural changes when they3 leave U.S. waters.4 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. -- may I ask this question5 to you? What about a -- an American-flagged ship? Does6 the statute apply or not?7 MR. FREDERICK: Well, the Fifth Circuit reserved8 that question.9 JUSTICE STEVENS: What is your view?10 MR. FREDERICK: Our view is that there are11 arguments that can be made that it does not because12 Congress didn't --13               JUSTICE STEVENS:  What is your view?  Not what               can be made.  What is your view?               MR. FREDERICK:  Well, I think --               (Laughter.)               MR. FREDERICK:  No.  I think our view is that it18 doesn't. 192021 Congress didn't express the intent.22 JUSTICE STEVENS: So really, we're not concerned23 with the fact this is a foreign-flagged ship. You're24 concerned with the fact it's a ship.25 MR. FREDERICK: The -- there's a difference and421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-14 arguments 151617JUSTICE STEVENS:  It does not apply.MR. FREDERICK:  It does not apply because￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425-- and there are about 1,000 U.S.-flagged ships that carrypassengers, so that if Congress had given any thought tothe question, it is reasonable to suppose it might havedistinguished between U.S. ships for which U.S. lawdirectly governs and foreign ships that are governed by adifferent law.  The fact --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do we need -- do we need aclear statement for United States ships?  I thought yourcase rested on a clear statement requirement.  Is thereany clear statement requirement for U.S. ships?          MR. FREDERICK:  No, no,          JUSTICE SCALIA:  So whyclear difference between the two?          MR. FREDERICK:  Becausein the statute that go to ships.a catchall phrase at the end of bus, rail, and any othermeans of conveyance.it?JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's pretty good, isn'tMR. FREDERICK:  Well, it's not --(Laughter.)JUSTICE SCALIA:  If you don't require a clearstatement, that's -- that's good enough, it seems to me.          MR. FREDERICK:  Well --JUSTICE SCALIA: Your -- your case hangs on the 431111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-Justice Scalia.-- why isn't there athere aren't any wordsThe best they can do is￼1 fact that, you know, when Congress wants to -- to rule the2 world and say all ships in the -- in the world that touch3 at our ports have to have this kind of a thing, it says so4 clearly. It doesn't have to say so with perfect clarity5 with respect to American ships.6 MR. FREDERICK: With respect to foreign ships,7 there is a clear statement rule and that clear statement8 rule is embodied in the fact that a foreign ship is9 governed by the law of the flag state where it is10 registered. That's been the rule for 200 years.11 And the other side's position --12 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, is that limited,13 though, just to things that affect the internal order of14 the ship? Is that the context in which we've articulated15 that rule?16 MR. FREDERICK: Well, it's been articulated in17 several different contexts. In the Brown v. Duchesne18 case, the Court 150 years ago articulated in a patent case19 where the Court said that a patented device on the ship,20 which was the French ship in Boston Harbor infringing an21 American patent-holder, would not apply U.S. patent law.22 And the Court said, because we can't conceive that23 Congress would have imagined this general language to24 encroach on the sovereignty of a foreign ship.25 Now, the other side has exactly two sentences to441111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 say about that case, but that is the case that is directly2 on point because that case says that when you are dealing3 with American laws that are generally written, you would4 not ordinarily apply them to a foreign ship unless5 Congress said so specifically.6 JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but in that case, there7 was -- as I understand it, there was no legal relationship8 of any sort between the supplier of the patent-infringing9 object and the ship in the United States. So it at least10 made sense to classify that with internal order as opposed11 to external relationships arguably involving -- or12 implicating American law. You've got exactly the opposite13 situation here. You've got contracts made in the United14 States with the foreign cruise line. You didn't have that15 in your patent case.16 MR. FREDERICK: Well, Justice Souter, you have a17 foreign ship owned by a foreign corporation built in a18 foreign country under foreign engineering standards --19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: With its principal place of20 business in the United States.21 MR. FREDERICK: For a time before that ship22 moves into another market.23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But --24 JUSTICE SOUTER: But its significant external --25 its significant commercial relationships are in the United451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 States with people in the United States performed2 partially in the United States.3 MR. FREDERICK: In just the same way that4 McCulloch the Court said that labor standards for a course5 of business that is regular between Honduras and the6 United States is not going to be sufficient to apply --7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The crew members were8 Honduran in that case.9 MR. FREDERICK: They were.10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This -- if you just look at11 it, suppose you were not a lawyer and you look at this12 operation. You'd say that's got USA written all over it.13 The passengers are from the USA. The company is centered14 in Florida. And then you have this flag of convenience15 that it flies which can legitimately govern the16 relationship with its crew. But to say that it governs17 the relationship with passengers, it seems to me very18 strange.19 And also the ticket says, passenger, if you're20 going to sue us, it's got to be in the United States and21 under U.S. law to boot.22 MR. FREDERICK: But a choice-of-law clause,23 Justice Ginsburg, has never been held to incorporate law24 in the sense that laws that don't apply are going to be25 incorporated. I'm not aware of any choice-of-law clause461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that -- that simply takes in every domestic statute.2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Just -- it's just one other3 indicia that one looks at this operation and says this4 belongs to the USA. A practical judgment, I think, would5 come down there.6 MR. FREDERICK: And -- and you would have --7 under their theory, you would have the Consumer Products8 Safety Act, the Food and Drug Act, OSHA, all sorts of9 other statutes of general application that are now going10 to be imposed on foreign vessels simply because they do a11 lot of business in the United States.12 The problem here, as a matter of congressional13 intent, is we don't know what Congress thought about this,14 and because Congress --15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we -- we do -- we do16 have the rule if it -- if it applies to the internal17 operations of the ship, and so far as the crew is18 concerned, the Jones Act and OSHA, it seems to me, may19 well be governed by the law of the flag.20 MR. FREDERICK: And the internal operations of21 the ship, Justice Kennedy, is part and parcel of how it is22 designed, what are the evacuation points, how are the23 cabins laid out, what ramps are placed where, how --24 everything about the ship's design --25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's a part of the case I'm471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 not sure about, and it seems to me, again, it can be2 fought out under the reasonably achievable --3 MR. FREDERICK: It doesn't -- Justice Kennedy,4 the problem with that theory is it just doesn't comport5 with the language of -- of the statute. Congress didn't6 think in terms of -- as it did in the Oil Pollution Act,7 it said, if there's a conflict with international law,8 work it out. Get the Coast Guard with the foreign nations9 and work out the conflict. It didn't put anything like10 that in this statute, which is a further indication that11 if Congress wants to extend this kind of disability12 protection, it can do that, but it ought to do so13 willingly.14 And the Government has had 13 years to come up15 with rules that would govern cruise ships, and the best16 they've done, a few days before the top-side briefs in17 this case were filed, is to issue proposed draft18 guidelines for ferries, not cruise ships. Most of the19 regulations that they are pointing to wouldn't have an20 application to a large passenger cruise ship. If Congress21 wants to change this, it certainly has the power, but this22 Court need not open up a Pandora's box of domestic23 legislation to apply to foreign ships where Congress has24 not expressed the intent to do that.25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Could you go back to Justice481111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 Breyer's question about the number of foreign ships? Once2 we get beyond cruise lines, does it -- would -- would the3 -- the application on your view cover the -- the dozen4 passengers who decide they want to take a trip on a -- on5 a cargo boat?6 MR. FREDERICK: Yes. I don't perceive a7 limiting principle to the other side's position. In fact,8 there's an amicus brief written where there's only one or9 two stops in the United States a year, and under their10 view, that ship would be governed by the ADA as well.11 If -- if Congress wants to enact these limits,12 it's certainly free to do so, but this is a highly complex13 area and ships are different from land-based14 accommodations because you have to be able to evacuate15 people within 30 minutes. And so when we train people, we16 have --17 JUSTICE STEVENS: But doesn't it -- on the other18 -- on the other side of the coin, apart from the19 structural problem -- and I understand the arguments on20 both sides there. With respect to things like safety21 drills and access to gambling tables and all that, it22 seems to me that your answer to that would be, well, we'll23 just do that once we're on the high seas so there's no24 conflict with25 MR.1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400the statute when we're out there.FREDERICK:  As a matter of fact, Justice49 Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Stevens, we give evacuation drills to the disabled in adifferent way.  We have special access and assistancesquads that go to persons with physical challenges to getthem off the vessel in an event of a -- a need forevacuation.  That's a different procedure than mostpassengers, but it's -- it is one that is in place.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Mr. Frederick.          Mr. Garre.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE                 ON BEHALF OF THE BAHAMAS,        AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT          MR. GARRE:  Thank you, Justice Stevens, and mayit please the Court:          Applying title III of the Americans WithDisabilities Act to foreign-flagged vessels would inviteprecisely the sort of international discord, conflict, andconfusion that Congress presumably seeks to avoid when itwrites American laws.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you agree with Mr.Frederick's answer about title II of the Civil Rights Actof 1964?  I mean, a lot of countries don't prohibitdiscrimination.          MR. GARRE:  Justice Ginsburg, first let me makeclear that the Bahamian Government does and all of itscruise vessels are governed by that prohibition.501111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm asking about the2 application of U.S. law.3 MR. GARRE: We think that that question can be4 resolved along the lines that Justice Scalia suggested,5 which is that when you're dealing with a matter that goes6 to the internal affairs of the ship -- and there -- we7 would suggest that there is more central to the internal8 affairs of the ship than its construction and design.9 Under international law, article 94 of the Law of -- Law10 of the Sea Convention, which the Bahamian Government has11 ratified -- and by the way, the United States has not, and12 that's an important principle for this Court to keep in13 mind -- foreign-flagged states may be bound by different14 international treaties than the United States. So simply15 trying to draw some conflict resolution device that would16 deal with treaties that the United States has entered17 into, international nations have not will not address that18 problem.19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So before you go on to that,20 I want to be clear on your answer to title II of the Civil21 Rights Act of '64. There's -- you say, well, that's22 easier to comply with. But that's not the principle under23 which you're operating.24 MR.25 our principle1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400GARRE:  No.  With respect, Justice Ginsburg,is that when it comes to the matters that51 Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 under international law have been traditionally governed2 by the flag state, then when Congress writes its laws, we3 presume that unless Congress clearly indicates an4 affirmative intention to address those matters, it did not5 intend to. When Congress wrote the ADA, not a word of the6 statute indicates that it considered the international7 repercussions of applying that law to foreign-flagged8 vessels. Not a word --9 JUSTICE SOUTER: What about the -- what about10 the full sweep argument? Let's sort of come full circle11 on that. You -- you say the full sweep argument is no12 good because the same thing could have been made in13 McCulloch. The response was there is a textual difference --14 JUSTICE SCALIA: What's -- what's the full sweep15 argument? I don't --16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Full sweep of the commerce17 power.18 MR. GARRE: Justice Souter, first of all, it's19 -- it -- the statute doesn't say full sweep. It says20 sweep, and that's in the findings of the ADA. It's21 reprinted on page 32 of petitioners' brief.22 And second of all, the definition of Congress,23 which doesn't contain that sweep language, is almost24 identical to the definition of commerce in McCulloch,25 which is on page 15, note 3 of that decision, and that521111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 definition, the United States argued in the McCulloch2 case, was not sufficient to extend U.S. labor laws to3 foreign-flagged vessels.4 It's important to understand the -- the5 potential international conflicts that extending the ADA6 to foreign-flagged vessels could create. There are more7 than 40 nations that have adopted anti-discrimination laws8 for the disabled. Three nations have -- have adopted laws9 for domestic vessels: Britain, Canada, and Australia. If10 a country like the United States extended its laws to11 foreign vessels that entered its ports, then other nations12 may well follow suit.13 And if you take a simple hypothetical example,14 the Queen Mary II traveling from South Hampton to New15 York, if you look at the guidelines that Britain has16 adopted for domestic vessels, those guidelines contain17 different structural and design requirements than the18 draft guidelines that the United States have promulgated.19 There are different requirements for door widths. There20 are different requirements for sloping. There's different21 requirements for the watertight compartments. There are22 different requirements about whether vessels have to be --23 have accessible cabins all throughout the ship.24 JUSTICE SCALIA: When you say different, you25 mean you cannot comply with both.531111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. GARRE: Well --2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that what you mean? Or --3 or are those just minimums and -- and the United States4 would -- would comply with those minimums?56 could and7 important89 -- are --MR. GARRE:  Justice Scalia, I think in some youin others you couldn't.  And -- and that's an-- important point.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And incidentally just for thethis ship has -- these are regulations that help10 the disabled?11 MR. GARRE: Yes, Your -- yes, Your Honor. And12 -- and in many cases, it's not going to be clear which13 regulation is going to be more accommodating to the14 disabled and which is not.15 JUSTICE BREYER: Could they work that out? That16 is, if two-thirds of our universe really is American-17 based, in terms of customers, and we're now only talking18 about conflicts in -- real conflicts that -- that affect,19 say, one-third of the universe, that's also true in areas20 like antitrust or others where the enforcement authorities21 get together and they try to write memoranda that -- that22 work this out in a reasonable way. Could -- could the23 same thing happen here if such real conflicts did emerge?24 MR. GARRE: We don't think so, Justice Breyer.25 JUSTICE BREYER: Because?541111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. GARRE: We would take the same approach that2 this Court emphasized in -- in the McCulloch case, which3 is that kind of ad hoc balancing analysis would wreak4 havoc for the question whether a significant regulation5 like the ADA would apply to a vessel. How would foreign6 vessels know, when they enter U.S. ports, whether they7 have to undertake the extraordinary changes --8 JUSTICE BREYER: The answer would be yes, you9 do. You do have to, and then if there's some other10 authority that wants to get involved in this, the two11 authorities would work it out.12 MR. GARRE: Justice Breyer, the way that those13 issues are worked out in the international shipping14 context is through the International Maritime15 Organization. This organization has been responsible for16 crafting scores of conventions, hundreds of shipping17 codes, and it's already begun to address the issue of18 accessibility on ships for the disabled and the elderly.19 We cite the 1996 guidelines in our brief. Those20 guidelines right now are -- are not binding guidelines,21 but they could well become binding guidelines. And when22 an organization like the IMO addresses this question, it23 resolves --24 JUSTICE BREYER: That's perfect because then the25 Government says that once it becomes a matter of binding551111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 international rule, anything that conflicts with that will2 be viewed as not reasonably achievable. So all you have3 to do is that and then there's no longer a problem with4 American law, according to them.5 MR. GARRE: Well, we don't think the readily6 achievable language in the first case in any way7 contemplates conflicts with international law. This Court8 has a separate canon that's almost as old as the country9 that it presumes Congress doesn't intend to interfere with10 international obligations or international laws, including11 customary international law, as you wrote for the Court12 last term in -- in the Empagran case. We presume that13 American legislatures give respect to the interests of14 sovereign nations when they write their laws, and we don't15 assume that Congress intends to intrude on the sovereign16 interests of other nations. And that's what extending the17 ADA to foreign-flagged ships would do.18 The Bahamian Government has a solemn19 responsibility under international law and under its own20 law to govern the construction and design of all flags of21 all ships that fly -- fly its flags. Article 10 of the22 Geneva Convention on the High Seas recognizes that flag23 states have responsibility for the construction and design24 of ships. Article 94 of the Law of the Sea Conventions25 specifies that flag states have responsibility over561111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 administrative, technical, and labor matters, including2 construction and design matters. These are precisely the3 sorts of matters that for centuries the flag state has4 been responsible for. And in5 this Court recognized that, a6 application of patent laws to7 of a foreign-flagged vessels.8 There are going to be conflicts within --9 between international law and the requirements of the ADA,10 but first of all, there's going to be confusion. It's11 been more than a decade since the ADA was passed, and we12 don't even have final regulations as to what rules apply.13 And in the meantime, foreign-flagged vessels are going to14 have to be reviewing the case law in the United States15 courts, determining on a vessel-by-vessel, design16 specification-by-design specification as to what standards17 apply. That's only going to create additional18 international discord and confusion.19 Petitioners proposed solution to this problem we20 think is telling. They urge this Court in their reply21 brief if there is a problem after the ADA is extended to22 foreign-flagged ships and other nations begin to follow23 suit and you have a crazy made -- maze of different24 regulations applying to construction and design, then at25 that point, the United States can go to the IMO and ask it571111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-the Brown v. Duchesne case,case that dealt with thethe construction and design￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425to clean up the mess.          With respect, we think they have it backwards.The purpose of the IMO and the international frameworkthat exists for governing regulation of shipping is toestablish a uniform set of rules in the first instance.The IMO has already begun to address the problem at issuein this case, accessibility for the disabled.  They areavailable to address that in a multilateral fashion.          And Congress, in enacting the ADA, gave noindication that it weighed any of the internationalrepercussions of the action that petitioners urges thecase -- petitioners urge the Court to take in this case.And we would urge this Court to return this matter toCongress.  Congress is in the position to weigh the riskof international confusion, to weigh the potential forinternational discord and to address those matters as itsees -- sees fit.          If there are no further questions.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Mr. Garre.          Mr. Goldstein, you have about 40 seconds.         REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Breyer and JusticeGinsburg, our position is the one that can accommodateyour concerns.  Theirs cannot.
