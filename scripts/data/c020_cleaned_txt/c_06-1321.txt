Potter.            Mr. Guerra.              ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH R. GUERRA                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER            MR. GUERRA:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it - Subject to Final Reviewplease the Court:            The government claims in this case that101112131415161718192021222324   statute itself.  By its plain terms, Section 633a(a)25   bars retaliation against covered workers who have3Congress decided to treat retaliation against Federalworkers who complain of age discrimination differentlythan every other species of retaliatory conduct, thatfor age-based retaliation alone Congress created afour-part patchwork scheme in which a small cadre ofFederal employees have a full judicial remedy, but tensof thousands of others who suffer retaliatory conducthave absolutely no remedies at all.            This scheme is inconsistent with over threedecades of administrative interpretations by theagencies charged with administering and enforcing thestatute and it is flatly inconsistent, most importantly,with the plain language and historical origins of the￼1234 terms? 5 - Subject to Final Reviewcomplained that have they suffered age discrimination.Such retaliation is directed at persons over --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  By its plainMR. GUERRA:  Yes, Justice Scalia.JUSTICE SCALIA:  Read it to me, would you?MR. GUERRA:  The provision is:  "AllJUSTICE SCALIA:  Is retaliation6 7 8 9101112   discrimination based on age?  I can see your argument13   that it ought to be covered, but to say that the plain14   language covers it, I mean that's extraordinary.  The15   plain language doesn't cover it.16               MR. GUERRA:  With respect, Justice Scalia, I17   submit it does cover it for at least three reasons.18   First of all discrimination -- retaliatory conduct aimed19   at a 40-year-old or someone over age 40 because he or20   she is asserting rights she possesses by virtue of being21   age 40 or older is discrimination based on age.22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, it's not.  I23   mean, a company could have a policy of firing everybody24   who complains about anything and the fact that a worker25   is over the age of 40 and is fired does not mean that hepersonnel actions shall be made" -- "affecting coveredemployees shall be made free from any discriminationbased on age."4￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   is being fired because of age. 2               MR. GUERRA:  Mr. Chief Justice, the issue in 3   this case is whether plaintiff is entitled to allege and 4   ultimately prove that she was -- she suffered adverse 5   personnel actions because she complained of age 6   discrimination.  It may be that in some, that in a 7   certain case the employer could demonstrate that in fact 8   the retaliatory conduct was not triggered by the nature 9   of the complaint, and in fact there have been Title VII10   cases where the courts have found that it was the manner11   in which a complaint was lodged, that there was, that12   there was false statements or it was too inflammatory,13   and so the employer prevailed.14               But if -- the issue here is whether, if15   Ms. Gomez can prove ultimately that the retaliatory16   conduct was a function of the fact that as a 40-year-old17   she was asserting her rights to be free from age18   discrimination, we submit that is covered by the plain19   language of the statute.  And that is confirmed by this20   court's interpretation of Title IX in the Jackson case21   because there the Court --22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Of course the23   statute that covers age discrimination in the private24   sector does have an express provision addressing25   retaliation.  The one that governs Federal employees5￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   does not, and that's the government's main argument, 2   that it's expressed in the private sector, it's not 3   there in the public sector and so you shouldn't imply 4   one.  What's your answer to that? 5               MR. GUERRA:  Mr. Chief Justice, three 6   responses to that.  First of you, as this Court 7   explained in Jackson itself, it's improper to narrow the 8   scope of a stand-alone general discrimination ban that 9   does not identify any discriminatory practices based on10   a comparison with an enumeration ban that sets forth a11   detailed series of prohibitions.  And that's preciselythe comparison that the Court rejected in Jackson andthe government is asking the court to draw here.12131415161718   Justice Scalia, for two reasons.  First of all,19   subsection (f) of section 633a effectively deems the20   private sector and the Federal sector provisions of the21   Age Act to be the functional equivalents of two separate22   statutes.  So I think that distinction is refuted by23   that provision.  But more fundamentally, the24   government's argument --25               JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm not familiar with that6            JUSTICE SCALIA:  But in Jackson it was in adifferent statute and here it's in the same statute.Surely that makes a big difference.MR. GUERRA:  It doesn't in this case,￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   provision.  What does that provision say? 2               MR. GUERRA:  That is the provision that the 3   government cites in its brief and it provides that: 4   "Any personnel action of any department, agency, or 5   other entity referred to in subsection (a) of this 6   section shall not be subject to or affected by any 7   provision of this chapter other than the provisions of 8   Section 631b of this title."  And the government's 9   position is that that provision makes these statutory10   schemes utterly distinct from one another.11               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, no.  I mean, they're12   all in the same, in the same statute, and what that13   provision says is that just because we give certain14   relief in, in the portion applicable to private15   discrimination, does not mean that we give that relief16   in the section applicable to government discrimination,17   where it is explicitly withheld -- it can't be18   explicitly withheld -- where it is withheld, although19   it's explicitly included for private discrimination.  I20   think that's the only sensible way to read that21   provision.  It surely doesn't make two statutes out of,22   out of one.  It is simply one statute.23               MR. GUERRA:  Justice Scalia, if I may, two24   points.  One is it's clear that the scope of the25   language of 633a(a) is broader in its own right than7￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   623a, which is the -- or 623a and 623b operate in 2   conjunction with each other.  So we know that the 3   stand-alone prohibition in the Federal sector side is 4   intended to be broader than the -- the discrimination 5   ban of 623(a).  So it's not anomalous at all to conclude 6   that because it sweeps more broadly and because it's not 7   limited by any other provision that operates in 8   conjunction with it, that there's no basis for drawing a 9   negative inference.10               JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, why would Congress11   have taken this drafting approach?  The private sector12   provisions were already in existence when it made the13   statute applicable to Federal workers and there was a14   specific provision prohibiting retaliation in the15   private sector.  If Congress wanted to carry that over16   to the Federal sector, why wouldn't they have either17   copied that or incorporated it?  And they did neither,18   and in fact they enacted a provision that says that the19   private sector provisions are not incorporated unless20   they're specifically noted.  And this isn't one of the21222324   Scalia I think answers this, this point.  Congress did25   the exact same thing in Title VII two years earlier.  Itones that's noted.            MR. GUERRA:  Justice Alito, if I could --the second point I was going to address to Justice8￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   could have added Federal employers to the definition of 2   employer and subjected them to the private sector regime 3   there, but instead it created a stand-alone prohibition. 4   If you take the government's logic in this case and 5   apply it to Title VII, it would lead to the conclusion 6   that the Federal sector ban in Title VII, which is 7   717(a), does not bar retaliation either, and yet we know 8   that's not true.  Because -- 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why?  This Court hasn't10   so held.  We haven't had that issue before us.11               MR. GUERRA:  You -- that's correct, Your12   Honor.  It's not true because of this Court's holdings,13   but it's true because of the structure of the statute,14   the consistent interpretations of the lower courts and15   the administrative agency.  The structure of the statute16   is, in 717(a), the language, the prohibition there is17   virtually identical to the prohibition here except it18   proscribes race discrimination, et cetera, instead of19   age discrimination.20                Then, in the remedy section Congress21   explicitly made a remedy for retaliation available for22   violations of 717(a)'s substantive norm.  The only23   reason to do that was because Congress understood that24   substantive norm to prohibit retaliation.  Congress then25   copied that very same language into 633a(a), thereby9￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   giving it the same breadth. 2               And so the negative inference theory the 3   government puts forward with respect to Title VII fails 4   on that statute because of the incorporation of the 5   remedies, we know that that prohibition bars 6   retaliation.  And because the norm at issue here was 7   copied from that Federal sector prohibition in Title 8   VII, the same reasoning dictates that the argument fail 9   here as well.10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The Federal11   employee, though, has all of the remedies under the12   Civil Service Reform Act for any type of employment13   practice.  Those remedies are elaborately reticulated14   and almost impenetrable, and yet this would add15   complication.  In other words, despite all the remedies16   under the CSRA that says in some cases you go here, in17   other cases you go here, and you get different types of18   review depending on the facts, all of that would be19   wiped away if you can bring a direct action under the20   age discrimination statute.21               MR. GUERRA:  Three points, Mr. Chief22   Justice:  First of all, everything you just said would23   be equally true of discrimination under Title VII, and24   yet the government acknowledges that retaliatory conduct25   for race discrimination claims, sex discrimination10￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   claims, can all be brought directly in court, 2   notwithstanding the existence of the CSRA. 3               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did the government -- 4   well, we'll ask the government, but I thought they kind 5   of qualified that in their brief.  The brief says that 6   the case -- this case presents no occasion to consider 7   whether Title VII's ban on discrimination against 8   Federal sector employees incorporates that Act's private 9   sector retaliation ban.  So they haven't made a10   concession.11               MR. GUERRA:  Well, I -- Justice Ginsburg, I12   read them to be conceding for purposes of this case and13   the analysis of this case, and if they're willing to14   acknowledge, at least for purposes of this case, that15   all these other retaliatory claims can be brought16   outside of the CSRA regime, it makes no sense, I submit,17   to single out retaliation based on age discrimination18   claims.  And, in fact, Congress --19               JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think you're saying even20   if, even if that were the case, they would still urge21   the Court to come out the way they do.  I don't think22   they're conceding that that's the case.23               MR. GUERRA:  But, Justice Scalia, even if --24   if -- even if taken on the "even if" premise, you still25   are in the situation where you have an irrational11￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   distinction by saying the CSRA is the exclusive remedy 2   for retaliation for age complaints and yet not for 3   retaliation under Title VII. 4               Also, Mr. Chief Justice, the CSRA itself 5   explicitly carves out claims under the ADEA and Title 6   VII.  So, Congress did not view it as the exclusive -- 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But not retaliation 8   claims.  In other words, although the direct claims, as 9   you put it, may or may not be carved out, a retaliation10   claim fits under the employment practices provisions of11   the CSRA, regardless of the basis for retaliation.  In12   other words, you took personnel action against me for an13   impermissible basis and therefore I'm entitled to the14   various civil service remedies.15               MR. GUERRA:  That's -- that's correct,16   Mr. Chief Justice.  And of course, the CSRA covers17   retaliation that has nothing to do with complaints of18   employment discrimination as well.  So it would not be1920212223   action.  No, and in fact putting that aside --24               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  She could complain; it's25   just that she couldn't go very far with the complaint.12rendered a dead letter by recognizing our position.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Does it cover your client?            MR. GUERRA:  I don't believe it would,Justice Souter, because she did not suffer an adverse￼ - Subject to Final Review 1               MR. GUERRA:  Well, more fundamentally, 2   Justice Ginsburg, she's not covered at all by the CSRA. 3   And that was the third point I wanted to make.  The CSRA 4   excludes thousands of employees. 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But it does that for 6   a reason.  We have a lot of cases in the Federal Circuit 7   and the D.C. Circuit that addresses a lot of these 8   problems say that when the CSRA excludes certain types 9   of claims of employees, they do it for a reason.  In10   other words, it's not simply that they didn't cover them11   or inadvertence, but they make the decision that the12   remedies that they've provided don't apply in a13   particular case.  And to say that those people who are14   excluded under the CSRA nonetheless have remedies for15   employment practices seems to me to undermine that --16   that judgment.17               MR. GUERRA:  Mr. Chief Justice, with18   respect, the problem with the government's reliance on19   the statute is that it doesn't -- on their view, White20   House employees and congressional employees have a full21   judicial remedy for retaliation suffered for raising age22   discrimination complaints.  And our argument is it makes23   no sense to permit that one band of employees, many24   high-level policy employee -- policymakers, to bring25   retaliation claims in Federal court, while excluding13￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   Postal Service workers who have only collective 2   bargaining rights and tens of thousands of other 3   employees for -- 4               JUSTICE BREYER:  The answer is that it 5   doesn't exclude them, that they have all these 6   collective bargaining rights; they have the civil 7   service rights; they can go and bring their same claim 8   with other remedies.  You could make the opposite claim: 9   Why should they have two rights?  Everybody else has10   one.  I mean, that seems to me what they're argument is11   underlying this.12               Then when you go to Title VII -- and this I13   don't understand fully.  Look at Title VII and Title VII14   in 16(e) has a basic ban.  Is that right?15161718   against the Federal Government.  Then it incorporates19   some provisions.  And it says that you get that certain20   relief against the Federal Government where there is21   discrimination on account of race, color, religion, sex,22   or national origin.  Then it says "or in violation of23   3(a)."  And then 3(a) refers to retaliation.24               So it looks like Title VII does give you a25   remedy, in 3(a), for retaliation.  And it's rather14MR. GUERRA:  That's correct, Justice Breyer.            JUSTICE BREYER:  And then, in 16(d) it sayscertain of those things govern Federal suits, suits￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   specific, and that suggests that those other words don't 2   pick up retaliation.  It's rather that specific thing. 3   Now, what have I missed? 4               MR. GUERRA:  Justice Breyer, the -- you are 5   right to focus on these remedies, but the remedies 6   themselves are not incorporated as substantive bans. 7   They are simply remedies, and our point is by making a 8   retaliation remedy available for a violation of the ban 9   that you identified in subsection 717(a), Congress10   necessarily understood that substantive ban, 717(a), to11   prohibit retaliation.  Otherwise there would be no12   reason to provide a remedy for retaliation as one of the13   remedies for a violation of --14               JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, you could say that,15   but you could also say, well, look here in Title VII16   Congress has some words, and these words give you a17   specific -- if you're a Federal employee and somebody's18   retaliating against you because you went and complained19   about race or something, just read those words; you can20   bring a lawsuit, right?  Am I right about that?21 22 23 24 25            MR. GUERRA:  I don't think so --            JUSTICE BREYER:  No?            MR. GUERRA:  -- Justice Breyer.  You canbring a lawsuit under section --            JUSTICE BREYER:  You go to the EEOC?15￼ - Subject to Final Review123456789   It's not in the appendix.  So I don't know what you're            MR. GUERRA:  Well, you can bring a lawsuitunder Title VII if you are a person, an employee orapplicant aggrieved.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where is this stuff?  Whereis this text that we're talking about?            MR. GUERRA:  I apologize, Justice Scalia.It is not in --JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's not in your brief.1011121314   now.  I guess I can ask --15               JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I'm not totally16   certain what I'm talking about either.  So we could go17   on.18               (Laughter.)19               MR. GUERRA:  I'd like to think I -- I can20   illuminate the -- the language that authorizes Federal21   employees to bring suits for violations of Title VII22   says that if they are aggrieved by final disposition of23   the complaint, they may bring a civil action under Title24   VII, and aggrieved -- they can bring complaints for25   violations of subsection (a), which like subsection (a)16talking about.            MR. GUERRA:  I am talking about subsection(c) of 717a, the Federal sector provisions of Title VII.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which we don't have here￼ - Subject to Final Review1234567   Justice Breyer.  The prohibition of subsection (a) of8   717a in substantive terms is identical, except itin our statute says "all personnel actions affectingemployees or applicants for employment shall be madefree from any discrimination based on race, color,religion," et cetera.JUSTICE BREYER:  Or in violation of --MR. GUERRA:  No, it does not say that, 9   specifies a different protected status.  So this is a10   ban on discrimination based on race, color, religion,11   and you are authorized to bring a suit if you are12   aggrieved by a violation of that provision, and one of13   the remedies that's made available is a remedy that's14   available for violations of the private sector provision15   on retaliation.16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why is that so clear,17   because section 2000e, 16(d) says section, whatever it18   is, f through k of this title, as applicable, shall19   govern civil actions brought hereunder.  And if there is20   no right against retaliation, then the remedy wouldn't21   be applicable.22               MR. GUERRA:  Justice Ginsburg, the language23   "as applicable" I submit has to be referring to whether24   the case itself would implicate the need for that25   remedy.  In other words, it would not be applicable to17￼ - Subject to Final Review1   have a reinstatement remedy in a case where there was no2   discharge.3456   and was effectively saying:  Here are some remedies; we7   don't know whether they apply or not, but if they do, go8   ahead and use them.            But the reading that you have suggestedassumes that Congress didn't know what it was -- thescope of the prohibition it enacted in Section 717(a) 9               And I submit that is an improper assumption10   about congressional understanding of its own11   legislation.  The proper assumption is that Congress12   understood 717(a) to bar retaliation.  That's why it13   provided a retaliation remedy, and that assumption is14   buttressed by the fact that, as this Court explained in15   the Brown v. GSA case, Congress adopted Title VII16   precisely because it found that fear of reprisal had17   made the old scheme ineffective.18               So it makes perfect sense that it would want19   to prohibit retaliation under Title VII in the Federal20   sector because reprisals had rendered the old21   protections useless.22               JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, could you proceed23   with that?  That is, a very simple way of thinking of24   this as one possible way of reading it is that Congress25   says:  When private employers discriminate, there can be18￼ - Subject to Final Review1   whistleblower's, and they need protection; so let's put2   some in.  When State officials discriminate, say, on the3   basis of race, there can be some whistleblower's.  Maybe4   they protect them in some States; maybe they don't5   protect them in others.  We better put some in.  When6789   them.  And so let's just use that system and treat allFederal Government officials discriminate against on thebasis of race, whistleblower's should be protected.But we have a whole system here to protect10   whistleblower's alike, and that's the end of the matter.11   We don't need any special protection for whistleblower's12 here. 13Now, the answer to that is what?1415161718   in 1972.  That's what the Brown case canvasses; and, in19   fact --            MR. GUERRA:  That is the very system thatCongress had deemed ineffective to prevent retaliationfor the very claims you're talking about in -- andthat's why it chose to adopt the amendments to Title VIIJUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's sort of2021   begging the question.  I mean, you're saying it's not22   true because our interpretation of Title VII is true.23   But the point goes to how you ought to interpret Title24   VII.  That is, it makes more sense to say when it's25   retaliatory action you use your Federally prescribed19￼171819202122232425            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Then it's ineffective here.            MR. GUERRA:  And it is ineffective here.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  And if it's ineffectivehere and Congress has made it clear that the only way tocure the ineffectiveness is with a separate provisionand you don't have a separate provision, you're out.            MR. GUERRA:  That's correct.  And theineffectiveness here is because of the extraordinarilylimited nature of the types of conduct that would20 - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4   Title VII the way we want to interpret it.  His point 5   is:  One reason to interpret it the way you do want to 6   interpret it is that it makes more sense to have all of 7   the Federal remedies applied through the agency, through 8   the agency mechanism, rather than in court. 9               MR. GUERRA:  Justice Scalia, I apologize if10   I wasn't clear in my response, but what I'm saying is11   that in the Brown case this Court looked at the12   legislative history of Title VII -- excuse me -- yes, in13   1972 and 1977 -- and said that the reason Congress14   adopted these, this new prohibition, was because the15   very scheme that Justice Breyer is suggesting would have16   been a fix for whistle blowing was ineffective.  That --remedies within the agency.            I mean, it doesn't answer the point thatJustice Breyer made to say, because we want to interpret￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   trigger any rights that the employee could control under 2   the CSRA.  Retaliation rarely takes the form of a 3   removal from position or a suspension of more than 14 4   days.  The most typical things are poor performance 5   evaluations, what we have in this case, allegations of 6   groundless charges of misconduct. 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  When you qualified 8   your answer by saying that the employee can control, was 9   that a way to dismiss the collective bargaining rights?10               MR. GUERRA:  Well, I was talking about11   actually the -- the -- you can complain about12   non-adverse actions under the CSRA, but all you can do13   is ask the Office of Special Counsel to investigate.14   And then you have no right to compel any further action15   at any step of the process.  So if the counsel decides16   not to investigate, that's the end of the matter.  If17   they do and the agency refuses to take their advice,18   that's the end of the matter.  There's no judicial19202122232425remedy for the vast majority of retaliatory actions thata Federal employee could suffer under the CSRA.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about reviewunder -- by the Merit Systems Protection Board?            MR. GUERRA:  That is the remedy under theCSRA, Mr. Chief Justice.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So when you're21￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   talking about the Office of Special Counsel -- 2               MR. GUERRA:  If the Office of Special 3   Counsel doesn't pursue the case -- and the statistics in 4   the NTEU brief suggest that it rarely -- out of 5   thousands and thousands of complaints, it pursued only 6   in a small handful.  You have no right as the employee 7   to do anything, to go to the MSPB or to any Federal 8   court, if they decide not to pursue that claim.  And so 9   that is -- and, again, both because Title VII, I submit,10   clearly based on the remedial structure, would allow11   employees to bring all types of retaliation claims12   unrelated to age discrimination complaints in Federal13   court, it doesn't make sense for Congress to have14   relegated older workers who suffer age discrimination to15   this one scheme, especially because it excludes --16   Petitioner herself has no rights under the CSRA.17               JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Guerra, can you help18   me on a provision of the statute that I'm a little19   puzzled about?  Am I correct in believing that Section2021222324252000e-16, which is the provision under Title -- 42U.S.C. -- I'm using the code number -- that that is theprovision that makes the Federal Government liable forretaliation based on sex and race?            MR. GUERRA:  That is.            JUSTICE STEVENS:  Is there another provision22￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9that is necessary for there to be a remedy against theFederal Government?and sex?MR. GUERRA:  For retaliation based on raceJUSTICE STEVENS:  Under Title VII.MR. GUERRA:  No.  That's the remedy.JUSTICE STEVENS:  Then -- your argument, if - Subject to Final ReviewI understand it, is that precisely the same languagethat's found in 2000-16e is found in 233a.10111213141516   is our -- one of our central arguments.  Of course, we17   also realize --MR. GUERRA:  633a.JUSTICE STEVENS:  633a.MR. GUERRA:  Yes, Justice Stevens.JUSTICE STEVENS:  And, therefore, the twoshould be treated alike?            MR. GUERRA:  Precisely.  That is the -- that18               JUSTICE STEVENS:  In other words, that the19   language "shall be made free from any discrimination20   based on race, color, or religion," and so forth, covers21   retaliation.  And when you use the same language based22 23 24 25on age it also would cover retaliation.            MR. GUERRA:  Absolutely, Justice Stevens.            JUSTICE STEVENS:  It's just as simple asthose two provisions being exactly --23￼ - Subject to Final Review1234   retaliation.  If the Government -- we'll ask them --5   will make that concession, then the argument is very6   strong.  The words are identical.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It isn't that simplebecause the government hasn't conceded that, withrespect to Title VII, Federal employees are covered for 7               MR. GUERRA:  Justice Ginsburg, even if, as I 8   anticipate, they will not make that concession, the fact 9   of the matter is that the remedial structure of Title10   VII, the Federal sector provision, confirms that the11   substantive ban that Justice Stevens read necessarily12   covers retaliation.  Otherwise, Congress wouldn't have13   made a retaliation remedy available.14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, another reason15   it's not that simple is that under the Age16   Discrimination Act you have a private remedy that17   specifically provides for retaliation.  And that is18   noticeably absent from the Federal remedy.  And I19   thought that was the strongest argument on the20   government's side.21               MR. GUERRA:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, that22   is precisely the same -- the same is precisely true of23   Title VII.  Section 704a of Title VII is the analog to24   623(b) in our case.25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought there was24￼ - Subject to Final Review1   a more express incorporation in Title VII of the private2   anti-retaliation remedy, and you don't have that in this3   case.4               MR. GUERRA:  That is true, but our position5   --6 7   precisely the same situation. 8               MR. GUERRA:  Not precisely the same, 9   Mr. Chief Justice, but this Court's -- in that case, for10   example, this court said when you copy language verbatim11   into another statute, there must be some compelling12   evidence that you've intended to have given it a13   different meaning.14               If you look at the remedy section of Section15   633a(c), all you see there is not some dramatic16   difference, but what Congress did was it replicated the17   civil action provisions of the private sector in the18   Federal sector provision.  So it's not as though there's19   some stark evidence that Congress intended to have a20   drastically different regime.  It simply didn't --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So that makes it not21222324   time.25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.rather than incorporate subsection (c) of the privatesection, 626c, it simply replicated it.I would like to reserve the balance of my25￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9            Mr. Garre.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT            MR. GARRE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:            The Age Discrimination and Employment Actdoes not expressly prohibit retaliation in the Federalsector context and it should not be read to impliedlyprohibits such conduct either.1011121314   discrimination? - Subject to Final Review            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why not, given theJackson precedent, where there was a similarly generalban on discrimination and we defined discrimination toinclude retaliation for complaining about15161718   broadly.  And it specifically distinguished statutes19   like Title VII and the Age Discrimination Act which20   delineate different types of discrimination.            MR. GARRE:  Justice Ginsburg, the Court didso very, very focused on Title IX, the Court's casesinterpreting the language of discrimination in Title IX21               In fact, on page 175 of the Court's decision22   in Jackson, the Court said because Congress did not list23   any specific discriminatory practices when it wrote24   Title IX, its failure to mention one such practice does25   not tell us anything.  And then it pointed to the fact26￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   that Title VII had delineated certain types of 2   practices. 3               JUSTICE ALITO:  Would it be -- would it be 4   unkind to say that the government's position seems to be 5   that a general ban on discrimination includes a ban on 6   retaliation except when the government is being sued? 7   In Jackson the government argued that discrimination on 8   the basis of sex included retaliation.  Tomorrow the 9   government is going to argue that the prohibition of10   discrimination in section 1981 includes retaliation.11   And yet here you're arguing exactly, what seems to me12   exactly the opposite position.13               MR. GARRE:  I think that would be unfair,14   Justice Alito.  The government's position is that15   statutory context matters.  It made that clear in16   footnote 1 of its Jackson brief before this Court.  It's17   made it clear in this case.18               In this case, there are several indicia of19   statutory intent that are lacking where you have a20   general prohibition in the context of the inferred right21   that has -- that this Court has treated differently, as22   it did in Jackson and as it should in the did in the23   CBOCS case that you'll hear about tomorrow.24               In the Age Discrimination Act you have25   separate provisions of the Act which explicitly27￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   delineate different types of discrimination, including 2   retaliatory discrimination, and in the Federal sector 3   prohibition the Congress added in 1974, it added that at 4   a time where it decided to treat State employers like 5   Federal employers, specifically put the State employers 6   in the definition of employer for the Federal -- for the 7   private sector provision of the Age Discrimination Act, 8   and it created a stand-alone provision for Federal9 employers.10               And then it went even further.  It11   specifically said in subsection (f) of section 633a, the12   Federal sector provision, that the Federal sector13   provision should be unaffected by the private sector14   provision, the bootstrap to make clear that courts15   should not be reading into the Federal sector provision16   the additional protections or other provisions in the17   private sector provisions.  And this Court recognized18   the significance of that construction, that statutory19   scheme in the Lehman v. Nakshian case.20               In that case, the Court considered whether21   Federal employees were entitled to a right to a jury22   trial in an action for discrimination under the Federal23   sector prohibition.  Private sector employees were24   entitled to that.  And so the plaintiffs in that case25   made an argument very much similar to the argument made28￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   by Petitioners in this case:  Well, the private sector 2   provisions covered a jury trial right; it would make no 3   sense not to have a jury trial -- 4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that's -- Mr. Garre, 5   that's traditionally when you're suing the government, 6   you don't get a jury.  And so that's on one side. 7               Here, as I think you would recognize, 8   retaliation claims go hand in hand with discrimination 9   claims.  A person who is discriminated against will10   quite commonly say:  I was not promoted because that was11   discrimination and then because I complained about it12   all these bad things happened to me.  It's very common13   that those two go together.14               And yet, without any indication that15   Congress meant to send a Federal employee off to one16   forum to argue discrimination and another forum to argue17   retaliation, without any hint that that's what Congress18   had in mind, it would be rather strange.19               MR. GARRE:  Well, let me try to answer that20   question, Justice Ginsburg, but I just want to make one21   final point on Lehman and the statutory construction in22   that case.  The Court specifically said on page 162 of23   its decision that because Congress demonstrated that it24   knew how to provide a statutory right to a jury trial25   when it wished to do so elsewhere in the very29￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   legislation cited, but in section 633a it explicitly 2   failed to do so, and it said that that was the 3   conclusive point of statutory construction in that case. 4   So we do think the Lehman case is very on point here. 5               With respect to the general notion that it's 6   uncommon to provide -- not to provide an 7   anti-retaliation right when you do have an underlying 8   anti-discrimination prohibition, certainly we would 9   agree with you that it is uncommon, but we don't think10   that it is absurd.  It's certainly not absurd where11121314   it's not absurd.  But if there is ambiguity and one15   interpretation is, well, that in every other context16   retaliation goes together with discrimination, why would17   Congress leave out this one category of persons,18   especially when it might have said, well, the Supreme19   Court says discrimination includes retaliation?20               MR. GARRE:  Well, we know that Congress in21   the Civil Service Reform Act, as the Chief Justice22   noted, we know that it didn't think that additional23   anti-retaliation protections were necessary for some24   Federal employees.  So the fact that Congress wouldn't25   have a separate anti-retaliation -- anti-retaliation30Congress was aware that there was a separate set ofprotections available for Federal workers --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you -- I recognize￼89 10 11 12materially unlike the typical anti-retaliation right.            JUSTICE ALITO:  Can you say what thegovernment's position is on Title VII, whether there isa retaliation remedy against the Federal Government? - Subject to Final Review1234   provide an anti-retaliation right here.  Not only the5   contrast between the private sector and Federal sector6   provisions, but look at what Congress expressed inright in some situation in itself is not unprecedented.            We do think that the statute has severalindicia that make clear that Congress did not intend to7   section 633a.  In at least three respects this is                 MR. GARRE:  As we make clear in our brief,13   we have not conceded that, Justice Alito.  We don't14151617   position?  What does, for example, EEOC or whoever18   passes on these complaints, what is the government's19   position in practice with respect to a Federal employee20   who complains, A, I was discriminated against because of21   my race and then they retaliated against me for22   complaining?23               MR. GARRE:  I think in practice, Your Honor,24   we have not challenged the interpretation of the Federal25   courts that have found that Title VII does incorporate31think it's necessary for the courts to decide that inthis case --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What is the government's￼ - Subject to Final Review1   an anti-retaliation right.  But there are at least --2345   that has gone the other way on Title VII.  Certainly the6   Age Discrimination Act is different.  The First Circuit7   in this case explicitly recognized that the textual8   differences between Title VII and the Age Act call for a9   different result.  And there are at least two            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Has any Federal courtfound otherwise?MR. GARRE:  I'm not aware of a circuit courtdifferences that we do think call for a different resultunder the Age Act.101112131415161718192021   called Chandler v. Radabush.  It wasn't cited in the22   brief, but it is directly responsive to that question.23   And the cite there is 425 U.S. 840.  And in that case24   the Court said that the "as applicable" language just25   means that there are certain provisions of the private32            The first is the fact that, whereas TitleVII expressly incorporates the private sector provisionsof the Act and by reference the anti-retaliationprovision of the Act --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So you agree -- then youagree with Mr. Garre about the meaning of those words"as applicable"?            MR. GARRE:  Well, this Court actually hasinterpreted that phrase, "as applicable," in a case￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   sector remedies that are inherently incompatible in the 2   Federal sector context.  And it pointed to the 3   provisions in the private sector part of Title VII that 4   allowed EEOC or the attorney general to intervene in the 5   private action and take over the suit. 6               So the "as applicable" doesn't undermine the 7   express incorporation of private sector remedies and 8   anti-retaliation.  And that's a critical difference 9   between Title VII and the Age Act.  The Age Act not only10   does not include that express incorporation, it goes in11   just the opposite direction, and Congress went out of12   its way to say don't import the private sector13   provisions -- it did that in section 633a(f) -- don't14   incorporate those provisions, and that's what this Court15   recognized.16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do we know what Congress17   had in mind when it said don't incorporate private18 sector?19               MR. GARRE:  Well, this Court in the --20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There must be an21   explanation for that section.22               MR. GARRE:  I don't think there is any23   legislative history on point.  The Petitioners argue24   that it meant don't incorporate the more restrictive25   features.  But that argument is directly contradicted by33￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   this Court's decision in Lehman, where it pointed to 2   section, subsection (f) of that provision as a reason to 3   not import in the jury trial right that was not 4   recognized for private sector employees. 5               The other way -- 6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you agree with 7   your friend that this employee has no remedy under the 8   Civil Service Reform Act? 9               MR. GARRE:  Yes.  She is a10   nonpreference-eligible employee of the Postal Service.11   That means that she has to pursue her remedies under the12   collective bargaining arrangement, which gives her a13   remedy to complain about reprisal.  And it means that14   the union representative would present that grievance on15   her behalf.  But it also means that if for some reason16   she felt that her right of -- her obligation of fair17   representation was not carried through, she could go to18   court and complain about that.19               This Court in a case called Bowen v. United20   States Postal Service recognized that employees who21   don't get fair representation can go into court and22   complain about that.  So she is protected --23               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What could she get --24   what could she get by way of remedy?  And you recognize25   that this employee is not covered by the Civil Service34￼ - Subject to Final Review1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011   action, Justice Ginsburg.  There is no right -- unlike12   Title VII, there is no right to compensatory damages13   under the Age Act for things like pain and suffering or14   emotional distress; and so in that respect the Age Act15   is quite different.  What you typically get -- you get16   this under the Civil Service Reform Act and under the17   Age Act for discrimination claims -- is back pay, front18   pay and corrective action to -- to address the19   discrimination.20               The other way in which the Age Act, section21   663a, is different than Title VII -- and this is22   actually another thing that makes it inherently23   incompatible with an anti-retaliation right -- is that24   the prohibition in section 663a, the Federal sector25   provision of the Age Act, is limited to employees who35Act, but does have collective bargaining rights.Suppose there is a finding of reprisal in that forum.            MR. GARRE:  I believe the remedies arelargely co-extensive in that the principal remedy thatyou would get under the Age Act, under the Civil ServiceReform Act and I believe under the collective bargainingagreements, although I frankly am not certain aboutthat --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about --MR. GARRE -- is corrective -- is corrective￼10111213141516   age.  And further, in section 633 -- - Subject to Final Review1   fit within the protected class, employees over the age2   of 40.3 4 5 6 7 8 9            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why is that?  Imean, if you have the private -- the private sectorremedy is not so limited, right?            MR. GARRE:  Right.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if we imply orincorporate into the Federal anti-discrimination remedyan anti-retaliation provision, I assume it would be inthe same scope as the private anti -- the privateanti-retaliation provision.            MR. GARRE:  Well, then this Court would bedirectly disregarding the express intent in section663a, where it says affecting employees or applicants ofemployees -- for employment who are at least 40 years of17181920   40?  It doesn't get you out -- it doesn't get you where21   you want to go.  It's not retaliation right at all.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, Mr. Garre isn't themost that argument gets you that the only individualswho could complain against retaliation are those over22               MR. GARRE:  I think that's right, but if23   we're going to talk about anomalies then we have to24   recognize that that is an anomalous grant of retaliation25   protection right that only protects people within the36￼ - Subject to Final Review1234   age protection is simply for people over 40?  In otherprotected class with respect to discrimination.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, is it any moreanomalous than the fact that the only protection of the56789   the age.  So if it's an anomaly it's an anomaly acrosswords, Congress didn't care whether there are employersin the world who don't like youthful people.MR. GARRE:  If --JUSTICE SOUTER:  They're just worried about10   the board in the statute.11               MR. GARRE:  I think it's a great deal more12   anomalous, with respect, Justice Souter.  With both13   anti-retaliation provisions, whistleblower provisions,14   all the provisions that the government is aware of,15   including all the ones cited in Petitioners in its16   brief, protect all employees, all --17               JUSTICE STEVENS:  But the same anomaly18   applies to the private sector, because section 631a19   applies to the private sector and 631b to the public20   sector.212223242537            MR. GARRE:  Well, that's not the way thecourts have interpreted it, Justice --            JUSTICE STEVENS:  The language is the same.They both are limited to prohibitions to people who areover 40.￼ - Subject to Final Review 1               MR. GARRE:  What the courts have focused on 2   is the "any employee" language of section 623d of the 3   private sector provisions.  And that's the way -- 4               JUSTICE STEVENS:  But that's no reason why 5   that trumps -- any more reason why that trumps 631a than 6   631b. 7               MR. GARRE:  And that's the longstanding 8   interpretation of the EEOC and I don't think there's 9   been any doubt in the courts to date that under the10   private sector provision you can bring claims for11   retaliation if you're an employee, and of course that's12   the way it is under Title VII.13               We do think that it would be anomalous to14   say that employees who complain about age discrimination15   or who testify about age discrimination in a case are16   not entitled to protection if there is an17   anti-retaliation right, and if they are under the age of18   40; and there is at least two other respects in which --19               JUSTICE STEVENS:  I don't think it says that20   -- the protection doesn't apply.  The word is21 22 23 24 25prohibition -- but that --            MR. GARRE:  Well, I think that that's right.But it's odd to say that this prohibition in 663a, whichis clearly limited to people -- and I think by --            JUSTICE STEVENS:  That's the explanation why38￼ - Subject to Final Review1   the problem doesn't arise in the private sector.  The2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9same explanation would apply to the public sector, ifyou choose the word prohibition as talking about thesepeople who are protected by the --            MR. GARRE:  That's not -- that's not the waythe courts have interpreted for more than 20 years underthe statute.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I though we are talkinghere a prohibition against taking retaliatory action.Isn't that a prohibition?10111213141516171819   anti-discrimination claims?  And I gather -- I think it20   would take a particularly incompetent lawyer that21   couldn't phrase retaliation in those cases as underlying22   discrimination.23               MR. GARRE:  I wouldn't disagree with that,24   Mr. Chief Justice.  I'm not sure it's unusual to have25   retaliation claims piggyback on discrimination claims,39MR. GARRE:  It is a prohibition.JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.MR. GARRE:  Right, and then that would be --their argument is that 663a contains that prohibition,and so therefore it is limited by 631b.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Isn't this anunusual retaliation case in that the person allegedlyretaliated against also has substantive￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   but I think you're right. 2               JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't it quite the contrary, 3   Mr. Garre, that most -- if you did a statistical 4   analysis of all the cases in which there was a 5   retaliation claim, you doubt that you would find that a 6   very high percentage of those are cases in which the 7   person claiming retaliation is also the person who 8   claimed the underlying discrimination? 9               MR. GARRE:  I wouldn't doubt that.  I think10   in most cases you do have discrimination claims.  I1112131415161718192021222324   question.25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Isn't the typicalwould say, though, that our research indicated that inthe Age Discrimination Act context, at least the privatesector context, only 14 percent of the claims involve --cases involve retaliation claims, which is lower thanother statutes.I wanted to point out two respects --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Are those, are thosemostly witness cases?MR. GARRE:  I don't know.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In other words, it'sa witness saying I think so and so was fired because ofhis age.MR. GARRE:  I don't know the answer to that40￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   retaliations claim, though, like the one in this case, 2   whether it's under Title VII or the Age Discrimination 3   Act?  That is, I think I have a solid claim of 4   discrimination, but maybe not.  Nevertheless, once I 5   filed that complaint, this unit doesn't like people who 6   complain about sex discrimination, age discrimination. 7   Therefore, I was retaliated against. 8               In this case, isn't it the fact that the age 9   discrimination claim, the claim of direct10   discrimination, was rejected and the question is but11   nonetheless, was there a retaliation claim?12               MR. GARRE:  She abandoned that claim at the13   summary judgment stage.  That's my understanding,14   Justice Ginsburg, and of course we are here today15   because she is still pursuing her anti-retaliation16   claim; and certainly if there is an anti-retaliation17   right, we've agreed that you could pursue that18   independent of whether you complained about the19   underlying discrimination, but we do think that in at20   least three respects the prohibition in 663a is21   incompatible with an anti-retaliation right.22               One, we think it is limited only to the23   people within the protected class, people 40 years old.24   Two, it's limited to personnel actions, which means if25   you think about it in the context of this Court's41￼ - Subject to Final Review1   decision in the Burlington Northern case and the Oregon2   case, it's limited to workplace-related things that3   happened to you, and in Burlington Northern the Court4   specifically said, in holding that Title VII's5   anti-retaliatory provision was broader than that, was6   that it would defeat or at least limit the purpose of7   achieving the purpose of an anti-retaliation provision,8   to limit it workplace-related harm. 9               And then third, of course, the10   discrimination that's expressed in section 633 is11   discrimination based on age, not discrimination based on12   conduct -- the conduct of complaining about or13   exercising your rights under Federal law.  And that,14   that --1516   Justice Alito's point.  I mean, tomorrow you're going toCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That does bring up1718192021222324   box.  But where you've got the three indicia that you25   have here, which indicate that this provision is42argue the exact opposite, right?            MR. GARRE:  With respect --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Or else thatdistinction between conduct and status would require youto lose.            MR. GARRE:  I think if we have the conductand status alone, then I think you're in the Jackson￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   incompatible with the typical anti-retaliatory 2   provision, and you couple that with other indicia of 3   statutory intent -- you have the competing schemes in 4   the statute between private sector where Congress 5   specifically delineated an anti-retaliation right, with 6   the fact that it didn't delineate that right in the 7   Federal sector scheme; the evolution of the statute -- 8   where you have Congress specifically deciding not to put 9   in Federal employers with private employers, as it did10   for States having the separate provision; and the11   distinctions between 663a and 623 of the Act -- 623 of12   the Act is the main private sector prohibition; 663a,13   the Federal sector provision, doesn't have all the other14   types of practices that are prohibited by 623.15               For example, pensions -- pensions are16   specifically addressed by 623.  Congress didn't address17   that in 663a of this Act.  It presumably understood that18192021   retaliation.  Congress knew how to express an22   anti-retaliation right.  It did so forcibly in the23   private sector provisions of the Act; and that language24   which you find in 623d of the Act is simply completely25   absent in 663a of the Act.43it either would address it through other means if therewere other protections out there.Similarly we think with respect to￼ - Subject to Final Review 1               JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think it's plausible 2   that Congress intended to treat the issue of retaliation 3   in the Federal sector differently under the various 4   Federal anti-discrimination statutes? 5               MR. GARRE:  I do think that, Justice Alito. 6   There certainly are several differences between Title 7   VII and the Age Act, and I'm not sure that Congress has 8   explained each difference, but nevertheless they exist 9   and this Court has recognized them, most recently in the10   Smith v. City of Jackson case, where the Court noted11   that because of textual differences between acts, there12   is less protection with disparate impacts of13   discrimination under the Age Act and Title VII.14               It's also the case that Congress has15   provided for compensatory damages in Title VII and not16   in the Age Act.  It's also the case that there is a17   right, a Federal right to a jury trial in Federal sector18   actions in Title VII but not in the age act.  And this19   Court has recognized, in Smith v. City of Jackson, that20   Congress has treated age discrimination as if it's21   qualitatively different and presumably accorded22   different protections taking that into account.23               So, the notion that this -- that the Age Act24   is different than Title VII or different than other25   Federal statutes in itself with respect to retaliation44￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   in itself is not unusual, and it's especially not 2   unusual when you take into account that there is this 3   back-stop protection that's -- 4               JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Garre, can I go back 5   to the authority you're pointing out for a moment?  Is 6   it your reading of 631a, the private sector section, 7   that says "the prohibitions in this chapter shall be 8   limited to individuals who are at least 40 years of 9   age," that it's correctly read as the prohibitions in10   this chapter, except those contained in 623a, shall be11   limited?  That's the way you read it?12               MR. GARRE:  Well, we -- no, Justice Stevens.13   I think that the textual argument that the courts have14   embraced with respect to 623d, the anti-retaliation15   provision, is because in 623d the Congress specifically16   said "with respect to any employees or applicants."  It17   couldn't have meant with respect to only 40, only18   employees who are over 40.  And, again, that's the way19   it's been interpreted consistently for decades under the20   statute.  And we think, though, that giving effect to21   the language in 633a, you have express prohibition22   limited to people over 40 years old, and that it is23   anomaly, and we're not aware of any other situation that24   --25               JUSTICE STEVENS:  But the effect of giving45￼34567   effect?8MR. GARRE:  I think --JUSTICE STEVENS:  Do you --MR.GARRE:  I think --JUSTICE STEVENS:  That's the practical - Subject to Final Review1   the effect to the word "any" in this section is in2   effect to read in this exception.                MR. GARRE:  I think that is the practical9   effect.  This Court has recognized, in Bush -- in the10   Bush v. Lucas case, which dealt with the question of11   whether to infer a retaliation remedy for constitutional12   claims by a Federal employee -- that Federal employment13   practices present different questions.  It's an area in14   which this Court uniquely defers to the policy judgments15   of Congress, recognizing that Congress has greater16   resources to police Federal employment, that there are a17   number of balances that have to be struck between18   government efficiency and the rights of Federal19   employees.20               JUSTICE BREYER:  Am I right now in thinking,21   just as a matter of practice, where there is22   retaliation, a claim of retaliation in respect to race23   discrimination, Federal Government, that the person24   making that claim can go to the EEOC and then to court?25   That's right?46￼19202122232425the other that one of these two systems -- the civilservice plus collective bargaining, on the other hand;or EEOC plus the court, on the other -- works better,works the same, works worse?            MR. GARRE:  I don't have any evidence.            JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  So we don't know.            MR. GARRE:  I wasn't --47 - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   complaint.  They could bring that to the --10               JUSTICE BREYER:  No, not what they do if11   their claim is a retaliation claim.12               MR. GARRE:  If it's purely --13               JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.14               MR. GARRE:  -- a retaliation claim, they'd15   have to bring it under the protections afforded by the16   Civil Service Reform Act.17               JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  And now, do you have18   -- two things:  A, do you have any evidence one way orMR. GARRE:  That's true --            JUSTICE BREYER:  The same thing in respectto age, they can't, and what they have to do is they gothrough the civil service system or the collectivebargaining agreement; is that right?            MR. GARRE:  Well, what would happen, if youhad an employee alleging discrimination on the basis ofage and retaliation, that would be a so-called mixed￼23 24 25mentioned earlier --            JUSTICE BREYER:  For the people whocomplained about race.48 - Subject to Final Review1               JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  Now what reason --2   okay.  So we don't know.3               MR. GARRE:  Well, I guess, if I could just4   add though, I don't think there's any reason to doubt5   that certainly Congress had any concerns about whether6   the system under the Civil Service Reform Act is working7 properly.8               JUSTICE BREYER:  But that's drawing9   something from where you don't know.  Okay.  So that's10111213   this distinction?  What are the best two or three14   reasons?  If you were just starting with a blank slate,15   why would Congress have wanted to send the one to the16   one route and the other to the other route.17               MR. GARRE:  My assumption is that Congress18   felt that the back-stop protections that were available19   for Federal workers at the time it passed the Age20   Discrimination Act and that were subsequently codified21   by Congress in the Civil Service Reform Act were22   appropriate for people who complained about age.  As Ifair enough.            But is there any -- what is the best reason,in your opinion, that Congress would have wanted to make￼ - Subject to Final Review 1               MR. GARRE:  I don't know the -- Congress 2   didn't tell us the answer to that. 3               JUSTICE BREYER:  But I'm asking you, and if 4   you were sitting there writing it, my -- my thought -- 5   the conclusion that I would reach from what you're 6   saying is you can't think of any reason why you'd treat 7   them differently. 8               MR. GARRE:  Well, I think the reason would 9   be that Congress viewed age discrimination as materially10   different than other types of discrimination, and it --11   either it felt that the risk of retaliation wasn't as12   great or that the protections -- that it didn't need to13   add protections.  And as I mentioned --14               JUSTICE SOUTER:  But why would it have15   thought that?  In other words, if -- I can understand16   why you say -- if you're going to put a rational gloss17   on it, that must be what they were thinking, but why18   would they think such a thing?19               MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, again, Congress20   didn't say -- I'm not -- I think you can make the same21   argument with respect to why it gave Federal employees a22   jury trial right under Title VII but not under the Age23   Act, why it gave Federal employees compensatory damages24   under Title VII but not under the Age Act.25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Garre, I just want to49￼1011121314151617   court?18 - Subject to Final Review1   make sure I understood something you said before, rather2   pleadingly.  One is if one could imagine a claim just3   for reprisal, but you called something a "mixed claim"4   if you're suing, as she started out to sue, for both.5   So if you're suing for both, on your theory you still6   must split them up?  You cannot bring the reprisal claim7   together with the discrimination claim?8               MR. GARRE:  Well, you can bring them9   together.  What you would do is you would bring adiscrimination claim under the Age Act and you'd bring areprisal claim under the Civil Service Reform Act.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there's a differentadministrative mechanism.            MR. GARRE:  You can bring them both togetherbefore the Merit Systems Protection Board, if you're --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Oh, oh, but how about            MR. GARRE:  Well, in -- what would happenthere is you would have your proceeding in the MeritSystems Protection Board, which would decide the192021   discrimination claim and the retaliation claim.  At that22   point, the employee could decide to go to the EEOC to23   try to fight on discrimination, or the employee could go24   to Federal court, and in Federal court he would get a de25   novo trial on his -- on his discrimination claim and a50￼ - Subject to Final Review123456   a clear difference.  There are several types of mixed7   claims that can be brought in this fashion.  Once you8   get to Federal court on your Age Act discrimination9   claim, you get a trial de novo on that claim.  You justrecord review --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But then you -- you wouldbe putting everything under the civil service umbrellaand nothing under the --101112131415161718   court.19MR. GARRE:  No, I don't think so.  And it'sonly get record review of the Civil Service Reform Actclaim because that's what Congress deemed appropriate.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But if it didn't amountto an adverse action under the Civil Service Act --            MR. GARRE:  If it doesn't amount to anadverse action, then you have to go the route thatCongress thought appropriate for --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And you wouldn't get to            MR. GARRE:  Well, you would have -- youwould -- it would be investigated by the Office ofSpecial Counsel.20212223   within your control.  It would not be up to the --24               MR. GARRE:  It would not, and that's what25   Congress deemed appropriate for those types of actions.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, but it would not be51￼ - Subject to Final Review 1               JUSTICE STEVENS:  But it seems to me, 2   Mr. Garre, that, following up on Justice Breyer's 3   question of what's the reason for it, the most striking 4   thing to me is that Congress used precisely the same 5   language in the two sections:  "All personnel actions 6   shall be made free from any discrimination based on 7   race, color" and so forth.  That clearly includes 8   retaliation.  But "all personnel actions shall be made 9   free from discrimination on account of age" does not10   include retaliation seems to me rather anomalous.11               MR. GARRE:  But there are at least two12   material textual differences between Title VII and the13   ADA -- and the Age Act.  The first is that the Title --14151617   same.18the Title VII --            JUSTICE STEVENS:  In the key sectiondescribing the prohibition, the language is exactly the            MR. GARRE:  Well, to understand the meaningof that section you have to understand the meaning ofthe whole section itself including this express192021   incorporation.  And, secondly --22               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Garre, are we going to23   have to decide the Title VII question in this case?  We24   don't even have the materials in front of us.  They25   haven't been put in the appendix to the briefs.  And in52￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7   would be:  This is an unusual situation where you have 8   the employer writing the law about what the employees 9   can do, and Congress realized, perhaps unlike the10   situation in Title VII, everybody over 40 would be11   covered; and every time somebody over 40 was fired or12   disciplined or didn't get a raise, they could claim that13   it was age discrimination; and Congress decided that14   they as the employer didn't want to face that15   disturbance, particularly since they have the Civil16   Service Reform Act already.17               MR. GARRE:  I think that that's right,18   Mr. Chief Justice, and I think this Court recognized19   similar considerations in the Bush versus Lucas case.20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Wasn't there -- there was21   something that was said about this -- that doesn't apply22   to congressional employees or White House employees,23   that they would have a claim of retaliation.24               MR. GARRE:  Well -- and that's because25   Congress gave them one, and this is --53order to decide this case, we're going to have to decidea Title VII case that hasn't even been presented?            MR. GARRE:  The Court does not have todecide the --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, I wouldhave thought the answer to Justice Breyer's question￼202122232425retaliation, it passes an express anti-retaliationprovisionMr. Garre.Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,Mr. Guerra, you have four minutes remaining.   REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH R. GUERRA54 - Subject to Final Review 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So why would Congress say 2   when you -- when it's Congress that's doing the 3   reprisal, we're going to give you a suit, but not if 4   some other -- 5               MR. GARRE:  I think, at least with respect 6   to congressional employees, I'm not sure that they would 7   have been protected by the Civil Service Reform Act 8   protections that existed for executive agency employees, 9   but -- but look at the statutes -- and we cite them at10   page 36 in the appendix and our brief -- in those two11   statutes, Congress used the same substantive prohibition12   that is in section 633(a):  "All personnel actions13   affecting these employees shall be made free from14   discrimination based on age."  But they explicitly15   included a separate anti-retaliation provision, which,16   again -- that's a subsequent statute, but that's --17   again, that's another indication that Congress doesn't18   think that this kind of general prohibition in section19   633(a) covers discrimination.

GUERRA:  Our argument is that it makesno sense to give some people remedies under one schemeand leave some -- congressional employees getting fullremedial relief, people under the CSRA getting a limitedremedial relief, others getting remedies under thecollective bargaining rights and thousands of othershave no remedies only with respect --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is that because theymay not engage in collective bargaining, or because theyhave chosen not to?101112131415   to.

GUERRA:  They are excluded from theCivil Service Reform Act.            JUSTICE BREYER:  So they are outside theCivil Service, and they don't have unions?MR. GUERRA:  They don't have bargaining1112   discrimination if they suffer age discrimination13   directly, but if they complain about age discrimination14   and then get fired in retaliation, they have nothing.15   And -- and just --16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I suppose that's17   consistent with whatever prohibition it is that18   precludes them from engaging in collective bargaining.19               MR. GUERRA:  But it's not consistent with20   their rights under Title VII, Mr. Chief Justice, because21   as the EEOC has -- an -- is entitled to deference, it22   has said, for three decades.23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you think we do24   have to decide the Title VII question if you are to25 prevail.57MR.

GUERRA:  I recognize that, Justice 8   Scalia, and I apologize. 9               I would also like to note that there was a10   suggestion that perhaps Congress didn't care as much11   about age discrimination.  That's refuted by the House12   report that accompanied this very statute.13               It's quoted at page 23 of the AARP brief14   where the Congress said age is as great an evil in our15   society as discrimination based on race and religion.16   Whether or not this Court agrees with that assessment as17   an objective matter, that's the view of the Congress18   that adopted this statute.19               And, as Justice Stevens noted, they have --20   they adopted the statute by incorporating the language21   from Title VII, the exact same language where Title22   VII's remedial scheme makes clear, and the EEOC's23   consistent interpretation confirms, that that then24   prohibits retaliation for complaints of race or gender25   discrimination.58￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            By incorporating that same language in theADEA's federal sector provision, Congress necessarilygave it the same scope; and, by doing so, eliminated thevarious anomalies, to put it mildly, that theGovernment's position leads to.            If the Court has no further questions --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you counsel.The case is submitted.            (Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.) -
