The Board of Chosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington.Mr. Goldstein.ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEINON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, may itplease the Court:We ask this Court to hold that a jail maystrip search an arrestee in cases of reasonable suspicion. That is the rule that was applied throughout almost the entire country in the three decades after Bell v. Wolfish, without either administrative difficulty or any apparent increase in smuggling. We're here today, of course, because both the Burlington Jail and the Essex County Jail require every arrestee to stand 2 feet in front of a correctional officer and strip naked.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you apply the reasonable suspicion rule to all arrestees? I thought you were making a distinction between felons and less serious offenders.3￼5 commit more serious crimes might be inclined to6 criminality. But our rule is one of reasonable7 suspicion. Our question presented draws a line8 offenders because this class definition is only9 who were arrested for minor offenses.greaterat minor people1 MR. GOLDSTEIN: We do apply it to all2 arrestees. The Respondents and the U.S. Bureau of3 Prisons do draw a line at major versus minor offenders.4 I think they do that because they think that people who10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the reasonable11 suspicion test more easily met if it's a felon detained12 for a serious felony?1314 courts that15 In our view16 17 1819 on a case-by-case basis based on the offense.20 MR. GOLDSTEIN: The category -- there is a21 categorical rule, and that is -- that was adopted byMR. GOLDSTEIN: It is in the view of the have considered this question, absolutely. -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: In your -- in your view? MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Yes, and, in fact -­ JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then you are going￼22 these Respondents, by the Bureau of Prisons, and23 court of appeals, that says if you were arrested24 more serious offense, categorically there exists25 reasonable suspicion.4four for a1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Our case-by-case rule, it's true, applies with respect to minor offenders. And, again, that's the class that was defined here.JUSTICE ALITO: Well, how would this work with respect to individuals who have been arrested for serious offenses? Let's say someone has been arrested for -- for assault. Say it's a case of domestic violence, assault. Would that be enough to justify a search?MR. GOLDSTEIN: I think you will have toask -- I know you want me to answer the question. Let me just be very clear. This is their rule. The Respondents draw the major/minor offense line. The Respondents apply a reasonable suspicion standard. Now, in my view -­JUSTICE ALITO: No, I understand. You say that you don't want to draw that line; you want to apply itto-­MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.JUSTICE ALITO: -- to everybody, and I'm asking you whether the mere fact that someone has been arrested for a violent offense would in your judgment be sufficient to provide reasonable suspicion.MR. GOLDSTEIN: If the jail made that judgment, we would think that a court would not overturn5￼1 that judgment. We think that illustrates that, by2 contrast to when someone is arrested for not paying a3 fine, that there is no justification whatsoever, because4 the logic of their own policy5 who's inclined to violence -­6 JUSTICE KENNEDY:7 what we're trying to do is to8 dignity of the detainee. But9 risk compromising that individual dignity if you say we10 have reasonable suspicion as to you, but not as to you.11 You're just setting us up, and you're setting the12 detainee up for a classification that may be questioned13 at the time and will be seen as an affront based on the14 person's race, based on what he said or she said to the15 officers coming in.16 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Right.17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And so, it seems to me18 that your rule imperils individual dignity in a way that19 the blanket rule does not.20 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, a couple of points,21 Justice Kennedy. I think it's an incredibly important22 issue. They don't have a blanket rule. Remember, the23 Respondents apply a reasonable suspicion standard. They24 do strip everyone naked, but if they're going to look25 for contraband -- that is, look at the person's mouth,6is that this is a personButItakeit--Itakeit protect the individualit seems to me that you￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425look at their anus -- they apply a reasonable suspicion standard.Now, to your very serious concern that maybe we are inviting discrimination or at least an appearance of discrimination, remember that their rule is going to produce more of that problem than ours, because their rule is not that they have to strip search -- they have to strip search everyone for contraband, but their rule is they can. They can make a choice.This Court in the Fourth -- they say we -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not sure if it's their rule or our rule. Ultimately, it's going to be our rule.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, okay. Well, then -­ (Laughter.)MR. GOLDSTEIN: First let me say I hope not.I hope that your rule is that there has to be a reasonable suspicion standard, which is the rule that was applied almost everywhere in the wake ofBell v. Wolfish, without -­JUSTICE GINSBURG: To do -- to do what?MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.JUSTICE GINSBURG: You just said that stripnaked is different from a strip search. MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, exactly.7￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, what is permitted? There are various things.

This is different.JUSTICE GINSBURG: They -- they can be inspected without their clothes; just nothing more than that?MR. GOLDSTEIN: There are two different scenarios. One is a common room where everyone is standing around, and for jail security purposes -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: A common?MR. GOLDSTEIN: A common room, a common shower area. And, of course, for security purposes.This is different, Justice Ginsburg. You asked what's prohibited in the absence of reasonable suspicion.

GOLDSTEIN: Yes, what is permitted is2 anything -- what is not subject to a reasonable3 suspicion standard is anything other than looking at -­4 a close inspection of the person at arm's length. What5 the courts of appeals have uniformly recognized, in the6 lower Federal courts, what the literature recognizes and7 really what I think concerned this Court in the Safford8 case is that when you are standing so close to the9 person inspecting their genitals, looking directly at10 their most private parts of their bodies, that is a11 direct intrusion on their individual privacy -­12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Are you13 --are you suggesting three different levels? Stripping14 naked: It's okay to stand 5 feet away, but not 2?15 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I don't think that the16 courts have had to confront 5 feet versus 2 feet. What17 they have confronted is they acknowledge that jails are18 places that require security. And so, if you're just19 observing a shower room, that does not implicate a20 reasonable expectation of privacy.21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So, are you22 -- are you taking the position that it's the purpose of23 the search -­24 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, I'm taking -­25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that's at issue?9￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, it's the closeness of it. There is not a problem, I think, with the question of 2, 3, 4, or 5 feet. These searches all occur in the same way, and that is the officer stands directly in front of you. The testimony here is 2 feet away. Thatseems to beto shower -­the common -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm still -­MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- unsure if it's okayMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and have an officer watch you shower naked.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What is -- the greater intrusion is that you're standing 2 as opposed to 5 feet away?MR. GOLDSTEIN: Two versus 10 feet away or just generally observing the room. This is exactly -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. If that's a line, that doesn't make much sense to me.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then let's go to the next line, which is -- that's one kind of search.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.10￼678 that that's 9MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you make an argument different than just a visual search?MR. GOLDSTEIN: You can. So, let me just10 say -- let me just try and close off my answer to the1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The second is I think2 what some have called a visual cavity search.3 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Whether you're going to5 have the individual open or expose private parts.11 question of12 immediately1314 that this is a reprise of the argument in the Safford15 case, where the schools there argued that, well, there's16 an observation of these students in gym class, theythe 5 versus 10 feet and then turnto this visual body cavity search. Remember, this is -- the Court will recall￼17 shower together naked, they undress naked. And the18 Court said it's quite different when you're standing19 right there looking over the student. Now, as to -- and20 said that's what implicates a Fourth Amendment right of21 privacy, and the distinction did make sense.22 As to your question, yes, there is a23 material difference, we think, although we think both24 should be covered by our rule. But a visual body cavity25 inspection as occurred in the Essex facility here, where111 you require someone to bend over and cough, which is2 what the testimony is in this case -­3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: One, not the other?4 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's correct.5 That -- the second jail had a slightly6 different search protocol, in which the testimony is7 that he was required to bend over and cough and expose8 his anus for inspection. And the Respondents themselves9 regard that as a more significant intrusion, and they10 apply a reasonable suspicion standard themselves to11 that.12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Goldstein, what -- what13 you propose is reasonable enough, I suppose, and some14 States could adopt that kind of a protocol instead of15 what they have. But what you're asserting is that the16 Fourth Amendment prohibits them from adopting it, and17 the obstacle I see is that at the time the Fourth18 Amendment was adopted, this -- this was standard19 practice, to strip search people who were admitted to20 prisons. So, how could it be deemed an unreasonable21 invasion of privacy when it -- when it was done all the22 time and nobody thought it was unconstitutional?23 MR. GOLDSTEIN: We don't believe that the24 premise is correct. If you read history differently25 than me, I'm not going to be able to persuade you. But12￼1 our understanding of the history is that the closest2 they can come to is two things: First, that people were3 strip searched upon arrest, and that's certainly not the4 rule under the Fourth Amendment; and that in certain5 jails at the time of the founding, other inmates in a6 process of ablution, what is almost kind of a ritual7 cleansing, would strip search new inmates. It had8 nothing to do with the jail officials themselves or9 trying to intercept contraband.10 JUSTICE SCALIA: That is somehow less of an11 intrusion -­12 MR. GOLDSTEIN: It's just a -­13 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- on your privacy, to be14 naked in front of a whole bunch of inmates, rather than15 one jail official inspecting?￼16 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, first, it wasn't a17 nearly -- the nearly uniform practice that I think your18 question assumes. And it's just a different kettle of19 fish entirely, that -- we don't believe, obviously, that20 that historical lesson obtains today, that the prisoners21 can strip search new inmates as they -- new arrestees as22 they come in.23 I24 question that25 hey, I've got13do agree with the basic premise of your it's -- our position can't just be that, a reasonable rule. I do have to, in1 either under the terms of Bell v. Wolfish or2 Turner v. Safley, establish that this is an exaggerated3 response, that this is much more, materially more than4 is necessary to accomplish their goals.5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But less intrusive than6 the one -- the search in Bell v. Wolfish, which involved7 pretrial detainees?8 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, Justice Ginsburg, we9 disagree with that. At least as to the second search,10 we think that there is no difference between the degree11 of intrusion here and in Bell. But there is another12 significant reason that this -- not just in the nature13 of the search, but a big difference between this case14 and Bell is that the inmates in that case made a15 voluntary choice. They decided to have the contact16 visits that was -­17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we know if the18 pretrial detainees in Bell were also inspected on entry19 into the facility?20 MR. GOLDSTEIN: We do not. I tried21 everything I could to check the record of that case, and22 there was no record of an admission strip search at the23 MCC at the time.24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, is there -­25 there is a distinction between the simple strip search14￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425and the visual body cavity search. You say that they apply reasonable suspicion standard to the visual body cavity search.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, is the visual cavity search therefore off the table?MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, it is not. We contend that the Fourth Amendment prohibited the visual body cavity search at the Essex facility. So -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, right. But you would say that they had to have a reasonable articulable suspicion before they could do that?MR. GOLDSTEIN: We say that under their written policy, they should have, but they didn't. The Burlington County -- the only evidence about a conclusion of the jail about reasonable suspicion is that the Burlington County intake officer filled out a form saying there is no reasonable suspicion here. And Essex I don't believe contends that there was reasonable suspicion to engage in a visual body cavity search.They deny, as a matter of fact, that it happened.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so, you see a distinction between what they actually do and the written policy.MR. GOLDSTEIN: I do with respect to the15￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Essex -- I apologize -- no. What happened here is that Essex, after this search occurred -- and this is described in the Essex brief in opposition, in case you want to look at it later, at 3 in note 1. Essex, after the search in this case, changed its policy.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.MR. GOLDSTEIN: We were denied an injunction going forward under L.A. v. Lyons. So, we -- it's just a question of damages for the search that occurred at the time under their old policy.JUSTICE ALITO: I'm confused about your -­ JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I -­JUSTICE ALITO: -- your position. Suppose ajurisdiction has the policy of requiring every inmate who is arrested and is going to be held in custody to disrobe and take a shower and apply medication for the prevention of the spread of lice and is observed while this is taking place from some distance by a corrections officer, let's say 10 feet away. Is that -- does that require reasonable suspicion?and -­MR. GOLDSTEIN:It does not. The -- and -­And so, your -- your only further than that.That's exactly right. TheJUSTICE ALITO: concern is searches that goMR. GOLDSTEIN:16￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425very close inspection of the individual's genitals, which can occur absolutely so long as there is someminimalconcern drawinglevel of suspicion that's created.I do want to return to Justice Kennedy'sabout dignitary interests here and whether any sort -­JUSTICE ALITO: Is there -- could I just follow up on that? Is there a dispute of fact as to whether anything beyond that occurred in Burlington County?MR. GOLDSTEIN: In Burlington County, there is a dispute about the so-called genital lift, whether Mr. Florence was required to lift his genitals or not. There is no dispute that he was required directly in front of an officer to strip naked, despite the officer having made a finding, which is on page 390 of the joint appendix, that there was no reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search. That is the only factual dispute -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -­MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- in the entire case. JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you clarify twopoints for me? The first is, was he admitted into the general population at Burlington?MR. GOLDSTEIN: The record is not entirely17￼1 clear. What the record says is that for the first few2 days of his stay -- remember, he inexplicably was kept3 for 6 days. For the first several days, he was kept in4 a cell with only one other inmate, or possibly two, and5 one time he had lunch with other people. In Essex, he6 was admitted to the general population.7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The prior charge against8 your client was the use -- involved the use of a deadly9 weapon. Assuming the prison knew this, wouldn't that10 provide the reasonable suspicion that you argue was11 missing?12 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, because it depends -­13 because of the breadth of the phrase "possession of a14 deadly weapon," as this case illustrates. The record15 shows that the possession of the deadly weapon -- and16 that's why this charge was not pursued by the State -­17 is -- was that he was pulled over at a traffic stop and18 he drove away. The deadly weapon is the car in this -­19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, now you're feeding20 into your adversaries' arguments that what you're asking21 the police to do on intake, or the corrections facility22 on intake, is to investigate in that fine detail. They23 can't even look at the rap sheet -­24 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No -­25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and see use of a18￼1 deadly weapon and say, ah, this guy could be dangerous?2 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, Justice Sotomayor. The3 rap sheet does not contain that charge. What the rap4 sheet does show -- and we are perfectly fine with them5 looking at the rap sheet. The rap sheet -- and it's in6 the joint appendix. The rap sheet says that he had a7 single charge, he pleaded guilty, he got a term of8 probation. There is nothing about that the jail would9 have had any information suggesting that he had some10 charge involving a deadly weapon. And that's why they11 themselves certified that there was no reasonable12 suspicion.13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is the rap sheet14 always available immediately? I thought it was rather15 common -- correct me if I'm wrong -- just based on16 practice some years ago, that it -- it would take maybe17 24 hours, 48 hours for the wiretap -- for the wire18 services and the Internet to -- to report that he was19 wanted for questioning for some very, very serious crime20 in some other State.21 I mean, in my practice at least, county22 jails were much more dangerous than penitentiaries,23 because you don't know who these people are. You arrest24 them for traffic, and it may be some serial killer. You25 do not know.19￼4 find any5 Marshals6 offense.7concern in their own policies, neither does the Service, ICE, with this prospect of some prior8 and whetherAs to what the rule is and how common it is this works in practice, the jail here did in the New Jersey Criminal JusticeSystem.

They filled20 Justice Kennedy, in which the jail does have enough21 information. When -- our point is this: If the jail22 has the facts, as it did here, to affirmatively23 determine that there is no reasonable suspicion, which24 is what they decided about Mr. Florence, then it is an25 extraordinary intrusion on dignity and autonomy to strip201 him naked -­2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel -­3 MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- when they have no reason4 to do so.5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, my6 understanding of the statistics -- and correct me if I'm7 wrong -- is that they get about 70 new people going8 through this process a day. Is there anything in the9 record about how much additional time it would require10 to look at each one, to look at their record, to11 determine which category they should fall into, to strip12 search or not, as opposed to having a blanket rule?13 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure. There is because they14 do this already. They -- it is not an administrative15 problem. They apply our rule today. Remember,16 Mr. Chief Justice, when he arrived at the Burlington17 County Jail, they did an assessment of him and18 determined that there was no reasonable suspicion. The19 jails in this case did pull up his prior criminal20 history, and they have no problem doing that. They21 apply our standard today. It is not a difficult one.22 But -­23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Goldstein, you -- YOU24 have acknowledged that we have held that when you have25 visitors, you may be strip -- strip searched after the21￼1 visit and the same kind of close examination that you2 object to here. Now, your explanation why that is okay3 is that that is voluntary.4 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I have two explanations.5 JUSTICE SCALIA: That you don't have to have6 visitors. Can you really condition your -- your having7 visitors on 89 you have noyour waiver of your Fourth Amendment rights? MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Block establishes that right whatsoever to have contact visits.10 So, under Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, of course, you can11 say I voluntarily relinquish my Fourth Amendment right12 in exchange 131415 that?for this privilege.But I have a second -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Are -- are you sure about￼MR. GOLDSTEIN: I -­JUSTICE SCALIA: You can -- you can16 1718 condition certain -- certain privileges upon a waiver19 of constitutional privileges?2021 that's -- I 2223 is that the24 Bell v. Wolfish's holding that those searches were25 reasonable is that it was essential to deter smuggling,MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, I believe thatthink that's a fair statement of the law. I do have a second point, though, and that principal reason underlying221 and that deterrence rationale has much more of an2 attenuated relationship to this case.3 Remember that the inmate in that case was4 having a planned meeting with someone, and the5 representation of the government is that our problem is6 if you plan to have somebody come visit you and you're7 going to have a contact visit, you can plan for them to8 try and sneak something to you. This Court has set -­9 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Goldstein, there, of10 course, were guards there who were watching the visits.11 And, as I understand that case, there was really no12 empirical evidence that smuggling came about as a result13 of these visits.14 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, can I just read to you15 what the Court said about that? Just so -- the Court16 did have a slightly different take, I think. And this17 is from page 559 of the Court's opinion: "That there￼18 has been only one instance where an MCC inmate was19 discovered attempting to smuggle contraband into the20 institution on his person may be more a testament to the21 effectiveness of the search technique as a deterrent22 than to any lack of interest on the part of the inmate23 to secrete and import such items when the opportunity24 arises."2523And our point is that that -- when you have1 an unexpected arrest here -- remember, Mr. Florence2 showed the paperwork that he was not wanted for arrest.3 And that's going to be generally true in all kinds of4 traffic stops and the like -­5 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, which is it you're6 doing? I mean, I imagine -- I thought you were saying7 you always need reasonable suspicion. So, I imagine a8 case where the person is going to be arrested, put into9 the general prison population. There is a warrant out10 against him for second-degree murder, and the policeman11 stopping him for a traffic offense arrests him because12 he knows he is wanted on a warrant in another place.13 And the jail has a policy that says when you're -- come14 in here because of second-degree murder, we strip search15 you. Okay? Can they do that under your rule or not?16 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.17 JUSTICE BREYER: That's all they know.18 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. That's reasonable19 suspicion.20 JUSTICE BREYER: Then you do not want to -­21 then you are not saying it always has to be reasonable22 suspicion.23 MR. GOLDSTEIN: It's just a debate about24 words. We think that is reasonable suspicion.25 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, all right. Well, that24￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425isn't helping me.MR. GOLDSTEIN: I'm sorry.JUSTICE BREYER: What helps me is to know what the category of things is that the jail in your opinion is going to have to look into the characteristics of this individual person, and when I look at the ABA, they talk about minor arrests.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.JUSTICE BREYER: And when I look at some of the cases, there's a long list, like violence, drugs, and so forth, where you don't have to, where you can just use a general -- the fact that he was arrested -­MR. GOLDSTEIN: Right.JUSTICE BREYER: -- for the thing. But there are other ones, minor ones, where you do. So, what's your rule on that?MR. GOLDSTEIN: Our rule that we would accept is that, with respect to minor offenders, that's when you assess -­JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Then the next question which we'll get -­MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.JUSTICE BREYER: -- who is a minor offender and how do you administer that rule?MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. I think that is a25￼1 great question for them, because that's their rule.2 They have a rule that says for minor offenders that you3 have to have reasonable suspicion to search for4 contraband.5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are trying to6 state the constitutional rule, and you keep talking7 about what is their rule, and we're trying to find out8 what are the limits -­9 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- of the rule, and I11 think you've already qualified what you said opening.12 Opening, you said reasonable suspicion is the rule for13 everyone, the felon as well as the minor offenders. Now14 you seem to be saying, well, this case involves only15 minor offenders; so, let's limit it to that. That's16 what I thought you were saying now.17 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, that's right. Because18 this case only involves minor offenders, we have￼19 articulated 2021 I'm -­222324 you and not 25a rule with respect to minor offenders. JUSTICE BREYER: All right. That's whatMR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay.JUSTICE BREYER: Unfortunately, I'm asking them, and it's the same question.MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. Sure.261 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE BREYER: How do you want us to write this so that jail personnel all over the country -­MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.JUSTICE BREYER: -- have to be able to follow it and know exactly what they're supposed to do.MR. GOLDSTEIN: For three decades the rule that was articulated by the Federal courts and applied without difficulty is one that says for minor offenses. When that was applied in practice it was basically done at a felony versus misdemeanor line. The court accepted that if you are -- the courts accepted that if you are suspected of a more serious offense, then for administrative reasons and because we just think you might be engaged in more criminality, then you don't have to have any individualized inquiry whatsoever.JUSTICE SCALIA: I can understand that -- I can understand that for cavity searches, but -- but why for the search to see that -- if the person has any fleas or cooties or, you know, any -- any other communicable disease before he's put into the general population? Are -- are felons more likely to have those than non-felons?MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, they are not.JUSTICE SCALIA: So, that line makes no sense for that aspect of the search which is -- is just27￼20 21 22 2324 in custody,25 personnel could come. Do you have 24-hour medical1 we want to make sure that we have a clean prison.2 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That is not correct. That3 aspect -- what the testimony in this case establishes is4 that the jail guards allow any sort of medical rationale5 for the search to be conducted by medical personnel, not6 by the guards themselves. All these inmates are7 examined by a medical person, a nurse or the like, and8 they are responsible for -- for -­9 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that -- that's where10 the Fourth Amendment invasion of privacy line is to be11 drawn? If you're examined close up by someone who has a12 medical degree, it's okay? And, on the other hand, if13 it's someone who does not have a medical degree, it's14 not okay?15 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That is -­16 JUSTICE SCALIA: That can't be the line as17 to whether your privacy is being invaded.18 MR. GOLDSTEIN: It -- it can be the line,19 and it is the line that's been accepted for decades.￼JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even for -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you -- you would -­ JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- body lice?JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- have to keep the person say, for 24 or 48 hours until the medical281 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425personnel for intakes that are at 2 in the morning? MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. The intake process,the testimony is that -­JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they are -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're telling every county jail in -- in the United States personnel on duty 24 hours a day ready to dosearch?us thathas medical a--aMR. GOLDSTEIN: No, I apologize,Justice Kennedy. I'm telling you what's in the record in this case. And that is -­JUSTICE BREYER: You said before was 2 feet is too close, but 5 feet is okay. Are you sticking with that?MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Breyer, I'm saying that a close inspection which is intended to examine the person's individual -­JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- genitals, and whether it's at 2 feet or 4 feet I don't think is the relevant line.If I could make one point, and then reserve the remainder of my time, that that -­JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I just ask, on your medical personnel, children in school get inspected for29￼1 -- for head lice, prisoners for body lice. You don't2 need a doctor to do that?3 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, that's right,4 that is right, what happens is that medical5 professionals are the people who are assigned6 responsibility. That's the testimony in this7 only last point that I wanted to make is -­8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's notbut ifthatcase. The9 constitutionally required.10 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I -- I agree. That -­11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, that's another thing12 that -- that you don't need to -- they can inspect for13 body lice, and that's -- that's okay?14 MR. GOLDSTEIN: If that's what they're15 doing, I think that that is okay. The courts have said16 that that is not itself a -- because of the prospect of17 handling that problem with shampoo, which is what these18 jails do, that that's not a sufficient -- a sufficient19 justification to require the person to strip naked.20 The only other point that I did want to make21 is that this is the rule, not just at Burlington and22 Essex, but also of the U.S. Marshals Service, which has23 the intake of 220,000 inmates every year, and also of24 the Bureau of Immigration Customs Enforcement, which25 intakes 384,000 a year.30￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Government tells us that that's true only if they don't put the arrestee in the general population.MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's not correct. That is only the policy of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, which has an intake of minor offenders of only a few thousand people a year. For the Marshals Service and for ICE, which have a combined 600,000 people every year, they do not have that separate housing rule.If I could reserve the remainder of my time.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll give you rebuttal time, but maybe just to be clear -­MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- you don't -- do you or do you not have an objection to the superseding ECCF policy?MR. GOLDSTEIN: We -- if the -- we do, because they still have to stand naked directly in front of the correctional officer under the superseding policy. What the superseding policy is, which is Burlington's policy throughout this, is that they will not search the person for contraband, which is their supposed interest here, for contraband, in the absence of reasonable suspicion.Both jails at the time of this search and31￼1 also now will still require the person to strip naked,2 supposedly for contraband, even though their own policy3 says we won't search for -- we won't engage in the depth4 of search that's required, we won't look at the anus, we5 won't look in the person's mouth, in the absence of6 reasonable suspicion.7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the current8 policy?9 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That is the current policy.10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you have no11 problem with that.12 MR. GOLDSTEIN: We do have -- I -­13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, you have no14 problem with the reasonable, articulable suspicion￼15 aspect of the body cavity search.16 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:18 respect to the simple strip search19 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:21 objection is that the guard is too22 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:24 Mr. Phillips.25 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER32correct.Okay. And with-­-- your onlyclose to the inmate? right.Okay. Thank you. G. PHILLIPS1 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS2 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,3 and may it please the Court:4 I actually appreciate the clarification that5 your questions brought to this case, because I think6 there's a bit of confusion that I'd like to try to clear7 up, although my -- my colleague's movement in terms of8 answering some of the questions left me a little bit9 perplexed as to exactly what the nature of their claims10 are.11 The -- the first question that it seems to12 me the Court should focus on is what policy is at issue13 here. And, obviously, since the class certification14 deals with one set of issues and the plaintiff's claims15 deal with another set of issues, I think you have to be16 careful.17 I think you have to focus on the policies18 that existed in 2005. That was the basis on which he19 was in fact searched under these circumstances. And the20 policy in Burlington was that -- was primarily aimed,21 frankly, at health and tattoos, and the policy at Essex22 was aimed primarily at contraband and then secondarily23 at tattoos and health.24 And the policy at Burlington was largely25 a -- you come into prison, you give up your clothes,33￼1 they look through your clothes, you take a shower, they2 examine you fairly cursorily, but look at you, and then3 -- then give you prison garb and move along your way.4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Is the5 shower and look at you cursorily -- are those separate6 things? Or789 places a lot of significance on how close -­is it during the shower?MR. PHILLIPS: It -- it's before or during. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because your friend10 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the examination12 is. So, under that policy, how close was the13 examination?14 MR. PHILLIPS: It almost certainly would15 have been about an arm's length, because at that -- I16 mean, the problem is if you're exchanging clothes with17 somebody, you're handing them clothes to change into,18 it's sort of hard to be longer than arm's length and19 actually get the clothes into his hand. So that -­20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Two arms' lengths. I mean,21 he could reach out, right?22 MR. PHILLIPS: Okay. Two arms' lengths.23 (Laughter.)24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's not25 right. They could take -­34￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. PHILLIPS: But I'm not -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not right. You could take the clothes off, put them in a bin -­MR. PHILLIPS: Right.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The person examinesthe bin.MR. PHILLIPS: Right. And that's actually what they do in Essex. In Essex, they do it that way. The difference between Essex is that Essex, in fact, does have -- I mean, part of the problem is terminological, all right?CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.MR. PHILLIPS: You know, Burlington is basically a body visual observation, and the district court said that's unconstitutional, that just observing at all is unconstitutional.To some extent, it seems to me my -- my friend here has given up that part of the district court's decision, which -- then clearly the court of￼appeals, to be affirmedmore than 2 was not thethe extent it reversed that part, ought to on that ground alone.JUSTICE BREYER: Visual observation from feet, or less than 2 feet?MR. PHILLIPS: Right, although that -- that district court's theory. The district court351 didn't say 2 to 3 feet.2 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. What happened? Do3 we know? Was the search within 2 feet or not within 24 feet?5 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it depends on whose6 version of it.7 JUSTICE BREYER: We don't know.8 MR. PHILLIPS: You have to remember, the9 district court granted summary judgment to the plaintiff10 in this case. So, you would have to -- you would11 to interpret -- you'd have to give us the benefit12 interpretation, which was that it was more than 213 But the court of appeals reversed, of14 course, without regard to that, because the court15 appeals said, look, if you -- if you apply this Court's16 decision in Bell v. Wolfish, it doesn't matter, because17 you can engage in a much more intrusive true body cavity18 search, which frankly is more intrusive than even what19 Essex County asks -- has -- does in this case, because20 he wasn't asked to bend over and to -- and to have a21 body cavity anal search. What he was asked to do was to22 squat and cough, in the event that -- because ordinarily23 that will cause the contraband then to fall out, and you24 can -- and you can catch it under those circumstances.25 So, this is -- that's sort of the context in36have of the feet.￼of1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425which this issue comes up.JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Phillips, if I couldunderstand your position, you think that there's no reasonable suspicion even for that more intrusive body cavity search; is that right?MR. PHILLIPS: That's correct. That's my -­ that's the rule of law I'm asking for.JUSTICE KAGAN: And does it matter to you whether the person is being introduced into the general prison population, or would you also say that if the person is not being introduced into the general prison population? Do you still think that there's no reasonable suspicion requirement?MR. PHILLIPS: I would say, from my perspective, I think even -- even if they weren't going to be admitted into the general prison population, because the risks remain too substantial. But the truth is I don't have to defend that argument, because both -­ both of these jails admit the -- their inmates into the -- into the general population 99.9 percent of the time.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would a manual search -­ MR. PHILLIPS: So, that's not a line wedraw.JUSTICE ALITO: Would you say that regardless of the offense for which the person is37￼1 arrested? There have been some stories in the news2 recently about cities that have taken to arresting3 people for traffic citations. So, suppose someone is4 just arrested because they have a lot of tickets for5 being caught on speed cameras, let's say. That person6 can be subjected to the searches that you're describing?7 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, Justice Alito. I think8 the basic principle we're asking for is that deference9 to the jails and -- and to the administrators of the10 jails requires that this Court respect their judgment11 that you can't make a distinction based on that specific12 individual; that whether somebody is a minor offender or13 a major offender, one, is never all that clear in the14 first place, and, two, isn't a basis on which to15 distinguish the risks that it poses to the -­16 JUSTICE BREYER: Try the ABA. The ABA is17 minor offenses, not drugs, not violence, and there you18 have to have reasonable suspicion. Now, I've read19 through the briefs, and I can't find a lot of20 contrabanders that were caught in that category. In21 fact, my law clerk thinks it's one out of 64,000 or22 less. So -- so, what is the justification for a rule to23 avoid reasonable suspicion in that category?24 MR. PHILLIPS: If -- if you look at the25 expert testimony that was before the court, in the38￼8 Our experts9 more likely10said misdemeanants can be more dangerous and to bring in contraband -­JUSTICE BREYER: It's a conclusion -­MR. PHILLIPS: Yes.19 look at20 reading21 2223 isa-­ 2425 Bell v.to show that my initial reaction from a quick is wrong.MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean -­JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, do I just say thisMR. PHILLIPS: -- I think you can go back to Wolfish, where this Court said that the fact391 district court in this case, both the expert testimony2 of the plaintiff and the expert testimony of the3 defendant -- this is at 348a of the joint appendix. It4 says "a greater presence of contraband amongst those5 individuals that have minor offenses." That's his -­6 that's their expert's characterization, that minor7 offenders bring in more contraband than major offenders.11 1213 practical experience because different States have14 different rules, and San Francisco came in with I think15 the toughest on your side, for your side. I just say,16 looking through that, it's very hard to find somebody17 who really was in this minor offender category, who18 really was found to have contraband. So, what should IJUSTICE BREYER: -- and we have a lot of￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that there is not a lot of contraband being found may be a testament to the effectiveness of the deterrent.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, why do we change the policy? In Bell, we found that the policy wassuccessful. Even though there were searches, contraband still got in. So, virtually every circuit -- in practice, the Federal system -- have been following this reasonable suspicion for minor crimes, and they've been fairly successful. So, why do we change the constitutional rule to let them do more?MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think that -­ JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: To invade more.MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, I think, firstof all, anybody who thinks that the problems of contraband are less serious today than they were in 1978 is -- is ignoring reality.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I understand contraband is serious, but most of the studies point to it not being on intake, but coming in through guards, coming in through contact visits.MR. PHILLIPS: Yes.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The great cause today is that from corrupt correction officials.MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, we can debate that. But, Justice Sotomayor, it seems to me that the40￼1 -- that the fundamental principle that ought to2 undergird the entirety of the Court's analysis here3 comes out of Turner v. Safley and that line of cases,4 where -­5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, could I ask you6 something just in terms of your rule? I think your7 brief says your rule is you're not entitled8 constitutionally to any right of privacy in prison.9 MR. PHILLIPS: No.10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If that's the case, are11 you saying that if the prisons decide on a manual12 search, every prisoner who comes in, correction officers13 can manually check their cavities, is that -­14 MR. PHILLIPS: No, Justice Sotomayor. No.15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, there is some16 privacy right?17 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, I can be clear about18 this. It seems to me that Hudson v. Palmer and the -­19 and the history of the Fourth Amendment clearly suggest20 that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy of21 being viewed naked in a prison. And, therefore, the22 ordinary Burlington approach of having somebody take a23 shower and looking at him or her naked for tattoos and24 health and incidental contraband, clearly25 constitutional, clearly doesn't even raise a Fourth41￼1 Amendment issue.2 When you get beyond that point and start to3 begin the -- what Essex does, which is not a true anal4 cavity search but simply an anal-focused and5 genital-focused search, I think that is subject to the6 Turner v. Safley and/or the Bell v. Wolfish standard.7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can we go back to8 Justice Alito's question? Isn't one of the factors that9 we look at under the Fourth Amendment reasonableness?10 And should we be thinking about the fact that many of11 these people who are now being arrested are being put12 into general populations or into jails, sometimes not13 just overnight but for longer periods of time, like this14 gentleman, for 6 days before he sees a magistrate?15 Should we be considering a rule that basically says your16 right to search someone depends on whether that17 individual has in fact been arrested for a crime that's18 going to lead to jail time or not, whether that person's19 been presented to a magistrate to see whether there is20 in fact probable cause for the arrest and detention of21 this individual? I mean, there is something unsettling22 about permitting the police to arrest people for things,23 like kids who are staying out after curfew with no24 other -- based on probably nothing else.25 MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Sotomayor, I think42￼1 what is disturbing about -- about this case is, in fact,2 the -- that he was arrested under circumstances in which3 he candidly shouldn't have been arrested as a matter of4 State law. I understand that. But I think to change5 the constitutional rule and to change the6 Turner v. Safley and Bell v. Wolfish standards and7 ignore what the underlying inquiry should be here, which8 is these policies which apply across the board impinge9 constitutional protections, but nevertheless10 represent -­11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what -­12 MR. PHILLIPS: -- the good-faith13 our jailers.14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what are15 with the presumption of innocence? That's also a16 constitutional right. And so, shouldn't the degree to17 which a search is permitted be conditioned in some way18 on whether or not this person has been presented to a19 magistrate?20 MR. PHILLIPS: I -- if you ask me the way I21 would analyze it, I would -- if you want to adopt a22 different set of standards about who ought to be23 arrested and who ought to be taken to jail, that's fine.24 I understand that.25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I mean -­43judgment of we doing￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. PHILLIPS: But I think once you're talking about actually bringing someone into the jail to be admitted into the general population and what is without question one of the most dangerous, most risky environments, in that context I would hope that this Court, rather than asking individual jailers to make decisions on the basis of -- where they clearly will not have the kind of information you're asking them to make and where if they make a judgment wrong in either direction, all it means is litigation. Either they -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought -- I thought your friend said that is exactly what you do with respect to the visual body cavity search, reasonable articulable suspicion, under the new policy.MR. PHILLIPS: That's what we do with a true anal body cavity search. What we -- I mean, we changed the policy, to be sure.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.MR. PHILLIPS: We changed the policy because of litigation concerns.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, now, as I understand it, with respect to -­MR. PHILLIPS: Liability concerns.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- with respect to visual body cavity searches, you require a particular44￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425individual reason, right? MR. PHILLIPS: CHIEF JUSTICE require that with respect MR. PHILLIPS: CHIEF JUSTICE with your friend that theYes.ROBERTS: Okay. And you don't to simple strip search?Right.ROBERTS: Okay. So, you agree only thing at issue here ishow close the guard is going to be to the individual who you have no reasonable suspicion to think is different than anybody else during a simple strip search?MR. PHILLIPS: Well -- no -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You want -- he says 2 feet is too close; 5 feet or whatever is okay. You want to go to 2 feet. You don't want to have to stand back to 6 feet. That's all the case comes down to?MR. PHILLIPS: I don't -- well, I mean, you can characterize it that way. I mean, I think the better way to think about it is that what Essex wants, what -- you know, what Essex policy permitted it to do was to examine the -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not interested in what Essex policy permitted it to do in the past.I'm looking at the new policy, all right? Under the new policy, you have reasonable articulable suspicion -­MR. PHILLIPS: Right.45￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- for everything2 except simple strip search and observation.3 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, see, that's the4 problem, is that the language there is different.5 Because the -- the truth is that the line that the new6 policy draws is between a true -- what I -- what I think7 Bell v. Wolfish was describing, where you ask the inmate8 to bend over and expose his or her anus for a cavity9 search. On that score, that's what -- we don't do that.10 But we do, in fact, ask -­11 JUSTICE KAGAN: And, Mr. Phillips -­12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Could I13 finish and find out what you do? You said: We don't do14 that. We do -- what?15 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. What we do is ask the16 individual to lift his genitals and to squat and cough.￼1718 more than a 1920 simple strip search.21 JUSTICE SCALIA: But, Mr. Phillips, there -­22 there -­23 MR. PHILLIPS: But I don't think that's the24 line to draw. I think -­25 JUSTICE SCALIA: There is still an issue in46CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So, you do simple strip search.MR. PHILLIPS: Right, slightly more than a1 the case beyond the ordinary visual inspection, and that2 is this: Even though you have changed your policy3 now-­4 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, we're still liable.5 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the question remains6 whether that change in policy was constitutionally7 required, so that when -- when you treated the -- the8 plaintiff in a different fashion under the old policy,9 that was a violation of the Constitution.10 Doesn't -- doesn't that question remain in11 the case?12 MR. PHILLIPS: That question clearly remains13 in the case. I'm not -­14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So, there are two15 questions.16 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.17 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, we have to consider18 both, the pure visual and also the inspection for19 contraband.20 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. And all I'm -- all I21 -- the only point I've been trying to make here is that22 if you -- if you look at the way the district court23 analyzed the case, the district court split it up, and24 it's the basis of the class distinction versus the -­25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the record or common47￼1 experience justify an argument that if you have the2 person who's stopped just for a traffic ticket, but that3 person is going to be in custody for 5 or 6 days, that4 person might well prefer an institution where everyone5 has been searched before he or she is put into the6 population with -­78 actually is9 saying thatMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Kennedy, there testimony in the record from the warden in order to ensure everybody's safety, we10 are better off with a blanket policy that says that11 we're going to engage in -- in some form of the search.12 Essex has a slightly more intrusive one. But it is all13 designed to accomplish the same thing. It's not just14 designed to ensure against contraband and -- and that.15 It's designed to ensure that there isn't somebody like16 Mr. Florence who's going to end up being poked or17 otherwise -­18 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any evidence -- I19 count seven or eight States anyway that have some20 variation of the reasonable suspicion rule like what21 they want, roughly. Is there any evidence at all that22 in those seven or eight States, there is more contraband23 being smuggled in?24 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, there is the testimony25 in the record from their expert, who said that in48￼1 Kentucky, there is today -- the single biggest problem2 in Kentucky prisons and the biggest cause of death is3 drug overdose, which suggests that there's a serious4 contraband issue in Kentucky. Kentucky is in one of5 those -- is one of those -- is inside one of the6 circuits that has had a reasonable suspicion requirement7 as a constitutional matter forever.8 So, I would say there -- yes, there is some9 evidence from which you could infer that it's worse now10 than it was. But I would also ask the Court to rely on11 its common sense and its own -- and what it essentially12 took judicial notice of in Bell v. Wolfish and13 Rutherford v. Black, which is this is a serious problem,14 and it is no less a serious problem today than it was15 more than 30 years ago, when the Court addressed -­16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there any limits -­17 are there any constitutional limits, in your view? You18 say you didn't attempt the kind of search that was done19 in Bell v. Wolfish. Is there any constitutional20 impediment to your doing so?￼2122 my position23 impediment,24 25MR. PHILLIPS: I -- I don't believe that -­ would be, no, there isn't a constitutional but -­JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, there's no -­MR. PHILLIPS: -- the balance would tip in491 favor of the -- of the institution under those2 circumstances. I do think -- obviously, there is a3 limit between a manual physical body cavity search, and4 that it seems to me, yes, I -- that would -- that would5 be a very different balance of the equation, and I -- I6 suspect I would be very hard pressed to just -- to7 convince five members of this Court that that's the -­8 JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you want us to write9 an opinion that applies only to squatting and coughing.10 Is that it?1112 it slightly 1314 1516 what -- but17 recognizes that deference to the prisons and to their18 judgment is what's appropriate under these19 circumstances, and that extends all the way to the20 Bell v. Wolfish line. The only difference being that I21 would like for the Court to analyze it under Turner22 v. Safley, in which -- in which the analysis is -- is23 this -- you know, is there a logical nexus between the24 rule that the -- that the prisons have and preventing a25 problem?

I10 think that's exactly the holding of Bell v. Wolfish.11 Bell v. Wolfish was not tied in its opinion itself to12 the fact that they -­13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they did -- they did14 stress that there was a visitor who could -- who could15 give the inmate contraband.

Wolfish doesn't -­16 and I asked Mr. Goldstein whether we know whether the17 pretrial detainees in New York were searched that way on18 entry, and he said there's nothing that shows one way or19 the other.20 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. I think that's -- I21 think that's correct. We don't know. And, of course,22 part of the -- and part of the empirical problem in -­23 in that is that that facility had only been open for 424 months anyway. So, it was really going to be difficult,25 if you were going to adopt the policy they adopted in51￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Bell, to insist on some sort of empirical proof. JUSTICE KAGAN: The one significantdifference between Bell and this case is that in Bell, there was a real opportunity for people to plan, to conspire together to bring in contraband. Here, you're talking about somebody who's arrested on the spot, there's no opportunity for planning, for conspiracy with respect to contraband, is there?MR. PHILLIPS: No, but the policy itself -­ may I answer the question?The policy is aimed at all people, not just at Mr. Florence, and if you aim it at all people, there are people who self-report who've obviously got an opportunity to bring in contraband, and there are a lot of people who just get arrested and happen to have drugs or something on them and, rather than show those when they're being stopped for a speeding ticket, will likelystick it in their pocket or put it Thank you, Your Honor. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:Ms. Saharsky.ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLEsomewhere else. Thank you, counsel.￼A. SAHARSKYON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAESUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTSMS. SAHARSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it521 please the Court:2 The searches at issue in Bell are very3 similar to the searches at issue in this case, and they4 should be upheld. I want to start with Justice Kagan's5 question. It is true that contact visits in Bell are6 different from a person coming into the -- to the jail7 for the first time in that there might be a greater8 opportunity for planning, but as one of the Justices9 pointed out, there was less of an opportunity to10 actually get contraband, the person coming in was going11 to be searched, the inmate, as Justice Marshall pointed12 out, was wearing a one-piece zip-up jumper, and he's13 being watched the entire time.14 The visit -- the contraband situation in15 this case at intake, the person does have an16 opportunity, even if they are not self-reporting,17 knowing that they're going to be arrested. Protesters,18 for example, who decide deliberately to get arrested.19 They might be stopped by the police, they see the squad20 car behind them. They might have a gun or contraband in21 their car and think, hey, I'm going to put that on my22 person; I just need to get it somewhere that's not going23 to be found during a pat-down search. And then24 potentially they have the contraband with them.25 Also, the process of going from the53￼1 arrest -- point of arrest to the general jail population2 is not a quick one. The person typically goes, for3 example, to a metropolitan police department -- that's4 what happens here -- and the person would mix5 potentially there in a holding cell with other6 offenders.7 If this Court, for example, adopted a rule8 saying that minor offenders would not be searched in a9 way that other offenders would, I have no doubt that10 there are some offenders in those circumstances, all on11 the bus together to go to the general jail population,12 who would give the stuff to the minor offenders -­13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then how does that -­14 MS. SAHARSKY: -- to try to get them to15 bring it in.16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's not the Federal17 rule. And, by the way, the brief was really confusing.18 When what -- when I read page 1, page 1 tells me that19 the BOP policy requires all incoming pretrial detainees20 to be subject to visual body cavity inspections. And21 then it isn't until page 30 that I learn there is an22 exception for the very category of arrestee that we're23 talking about here, that they are not subject to body24 cavity inspections unless there's reasonable suspicion25 that they're concealing contraband. That the54￼1 misdemeanor or civil contempt offender is not subject.2 MS. SAHARSKY: I'm sorry if that was3 confusing. The Bureau of Prisons' policy is that a4 person will not be put in the general population, being5 allowed to mix with other offenders, unless he or she6 has undergone the strip search.7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but I want to know8 how people in this category are treated in the Federal9 system. And you -- you -­10 MS. SAHARSKY: The people -­11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You reversed it. They -­12 those people are not subject to this visual body cavity13 search.14 MS. SAHARSKY: Those people, when they go15 into the jail, would be asked whether they're willing to16 consent to this type of search. In most cases, they do17 consent. If they don't consent and there is not18 reasonable suspicion, then they are not placed in the19 general jail population; they are kept separate from the20 other offenders. So, it is the case, the rule that the21 Third Circuit identified, which is a blanket policy that22 anyone that's going to go into the general jail23 population and mix with everyone else has to be strip24 searched. That is the Federal Bureau of Prisons'25 policy. I should note that -­55￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. I'm sure2 I missed something. You say when they go in they're3 asked: Will you consent to a more intrusive body cavity4 search and be put into the general population; or if you5 don't, you don't have to be searched and we put you in6 some place else. Who consents to that?7 (Laughter.)8 MS. SAHARSKY: Well, the general jail9 population has certain facilities, you know, computer10 facilities and others that you don't get when you're in11 a cell by yourselves. As a practical matter, this12 arises very, very infrequently in the Federal system.13 We're talking about fewer than 1 percent of offenders.14 And the question before the Court at this15 point really is you have before you a blanket policy16 saying we need to strip search everyone, and is that17 something that's unreasonable or irrational in the way18 that the Court has considered its normal deference to19 prison officials? And I just -- I would like to -­20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I understand most of the21 general propositions that your side is advancing, but I22 have to say I was somewhat surprised at the evidence of23 the amount of contraband that was discovered, the amount24 of weapons that was discovered that's in the literature25 and that's in the citations, of course, was somewhat56￼1 skimpy. I thought there would be a stronger showing2 than I -- than I found in the briefs.3 MS. SAHARSKY: Well, there -- there are not4 empirical studies of this type of information.5 Typically it arises when there are incidents at a6 facility, and incident reports are written up. They're7 not published regularly. There's not some kind of8 laboratory study that you can do. The facilities have9 an incident that they try to deal with. Sometimes it10 makes the news. Those are some of the things that we11 reported. And I would hate for the Court to think that12 there is not evidence of people who've committed -­13 minor offenders in the record bringing in very serious14 things into prisons and jails.15 I'd point you to footnote 15 in the16 Government's brief, which talks about people being17 arrested for traffic offenses and smuggling crack pipes18 in body cavities. I'd point the Court to both experts19 in this case cited by Mr. Phillips. I'd point the Court20 to the record in Bull, the San Francisco case.21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The issue has to be22 certainly some misdemeanor. Some people charged with23 misdemeanor crimes will try to smuggle things in. The24 issue is how many of them would not have been found on a25 reasonable suspicion standard? I think Justice Breyer57￼1 said, in the San Francisco study, it appears only one.2 MS. SAHARSKY: I think that that's a very3 hazardous thing for courts to do with 20/20 hindsight.4 You know, the Court could look back at individual5 offenders and might have information -­6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But we don't have 20/20.7 We have how many years? Fifteen years since Bell -­8 MS. SAHARSKY: What I -­9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- where prisons have10 been applying the reasonable suspicion standard. And11 the most you can muster under that standard is one12 example of a case where someone has entered? At some13 point, empirical evidence has to mean something in terms14 of us judging the question of reasonableness.15 MS. SAHARSKY: I agree with you, but what16 I'm saying is that the individuals who are doing the17 searches at issue have very limited information about18 people. This is when you have people who are coming19 into the first -- the system for the first time. They20 have had the most contact with the outside world. You21 have the least amount of information about them. In the22 Federal system, you don't know -­23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I -- I do have a24 question about that today. I know that when -- it's bad25 to base your judgments on your own personal experiences.58￼1 When I was a prosecutor, it took sometimes days to get a2 rap sheet. I understand that that's no longer the case3 today, that they're virtually almost always accessible4 by computers today.5 MS. SAHARSKY: That may be true, but it's6 not the information that the people who do intake and7 are doing the searches have. They do not have that8 information at their fingertips in the Federal system.9 They have name, date of birth, and they have the offense10 that the person was charged with. They don't know11 anything else.12 And the question before the Court, if I may,13 is whether there are reasons for a blanket rule that14 this Court should defer to. And I would say there are15 several.16 First of all you cannot say that there are17 some minor offenders that don't pose a contraband risk.18 They are documented in the record. Second, you have19 individuals who are making very quick determinations.20 They're -- they have large numbers of people to -- to21 get through -- into the general prison population. They22 have very little time, and if they guess wrong, those23 mistakes can be deadly. Third, the rule needs to be -­24 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose we accept the25 Petitioner's concession that it is permissible to59￼1 require everybody who is arrested to disrobe and shower2 under the observation of the corrections officer from a3 certain distance. Now the question would become: How4 many people who do that will still be able to smuggle in5 contraband?6 MS. SAHARSKY: Well, there would be7 contraband found in -- that would be in body cavities.8 And we have documented in this record and other records9 in our brief that there are folks who do that, and that10 contraband is not found until they do these squat and11 cough procedures.12 JUSTICE BREYER: That's my -- that's my13 problem. I don't -- I overstated the -- the strength of14 your evidence. I was just trying to throw it out -- or15 I understated it. San Francisco's point is really that16 30 to 60 percent or some very high percentage of people17 who come in for minor crimes are high on drugs or have18 been -- and there is just that footnote really which has19 a few examples. Definitely, they're there in this20 category. So, would it be helpful if you included in21 the excluded part people who are high on drugs? You22 see? So, we give you the high on drugs people. It's￼23 the drug offense, and those24 those -- I mean, is there a25 that we can even catch most60who are high on drugs and way of drawing this rule of the people in footnote1 50-­2 MS. SAHARSKY: I think the fundamental3 question for the Court is who is supposed to be doing4 this line drawing. And you've said case after case5 after case that you're going to defer to the prison and6 jail officials who are seeing this stuff on the ground7 day to day.8 JUSTICE BREYER: But it's obvious that the9 simplest thing for any prison official is say do it for10 everybody.11 MS. SAHARSKY: That's -­12 JUSTICE BREYER: And so, the fact they do it13 for everybody and don't try to make some exclusion for14 traffic violators or something might be consistent with15 little or no evidence; it might be consistent with some.16 That's why I keep looking for it.17 MS. SAHARSKY: There are many good reasons,18 though, to have a policy to do it for everyone. It is19 easily -- easy to administer when you have lots of20 people. It is done for the protection of people like21 Petitioner who don't want to be knifed in the shower -­22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the reason? If23 there's so much sense to that policy, why isn't it the24 Federal policy? Before you said because there aren't25 that many offenders. If there were more, then would61￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425there be -- would the Federal policy change so that even people who are in on a contempt charge or a minorcrime -­MS. SAHARSKY: Yes. The Federal Government thinks that that blanket policy is a good one. It made one modification to its policy in 2003 when the weight of the circuits was against it. But, again, this is a policy that is done for everyone's protection. A point that Justice Kennedy made earlier is that there -­JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm sorry, I didn't understand. You think the Feds think it's a good policy to inspect everyone?MS. SAHARSKY: Yes, to inspect everyone who would be put in the general jail population. That is the Third Circuit's holding, and that's what we're defending in this case. That's -- because when you have a rule that treats everyone the same, you don't have folks that are singled out. You don't have any security gaps. We urge you to affirm the judgment of the court below.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.Mr. Goldstein, take 4 minutes. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEINON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER MR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, sir.62￼1 I have three points to make: The first is2 that my friend from the United States says defer to the3 experts. But the point that the United States4 consistently omits is that there are 600,000 offenders5 that go into the Federal system every year. I don't6 understand the claim that -- this only involves 17 percent of Federal offenders.8 The Marshals Service and ICE admit 600,0009 offenders every year under our standard. They are not10 kept in separate housing. These are cited in our brief.11 Six hundred thousand people, is their expert judgment,12 are subject to a reasonable suspicion standard when13 they're admitted to jail.14 The second point, about numbers,15 Justice Breyer, there is a significant empirical study,16 and that is the County of Orange case. The district17 judge there did an unbelievably detailed job going18 through the record of 26,000 admissions into the system19 and was able to identify only a single instance where20 contraband would have gotten in under a reasonable21 suspicion standard.22 There is also evidence in this case, and it23 is the evidence, to my surprise, that my friends keep24 pointing to. There's a memorandum from the Essex jail25 system. It's at page 70a to 71a of the joint appendix.63￼1 And it tells you two really relevant things. It says2 every year they admit 25,175 people into this jail, and3 that they only found 14 instances of contraband. And4 they don't even make the claim that those 14 instances5 out of 25,000 would not have been found under a6 reasonable suspicion standard. So, you have evidence in7 this record about this particular case.8 Third, a couple of points have been made9 about whether -- Justice Breyer, you asked whether10 someone who's high on drugs. The uniform rule -- and11 this is not just the ABA but the expert standard of the12 American Correctional Association. What they say is13 that essentially almost anything will do. What will not14 amount to reasonable suspicion is when you have a minor15 offender -- and we do have -- there are 700,000 people16 in jail in the United States every year for misdemeanor17 offenses. This is -- this is a lot of people who are18 having a very significant intrusion on privacy.19 And the expert standard, the rule that was20 applied under Bell v. Wolfish, is that when you have21 people who come in on a minor offense -- they don't have22 any drug history. They are not high on drugs. There23 was no opportunity to hide a weapon. I'm not sure where24 they think the gun is going to be hidden that's not25 going to show up in the very close manual pat down that64￼1 they do of every one of these people that isn't going to2 show up in -­3 JUSTICE ALITO: I don't think you're really4 arguing for a -- an individualized reasonable suspicion5 standard. I think you're arguing for a rule that draws6 distinctions based on categories that correspond only7 perhaps very roughly to reasonable suspicion.8 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, first, there are real9 categories that are overinclusive in favor of the jails,10 like if it's a serious offense or if they have any drug11 history. And then on top of that, if there's any12 individualized basis that the jails can articulate, that13 will do as well.14 We are not saying that categorically people15 will be excluded from being searched. We're saying that16 there are entire categories that will automatically be17 searchable. We're just saying don't throw the baby out18 with the bath water.19 When somebody is pulled over like Mr.20 Florence, and there's just -- it's laugh-out-loud funny21 to think he's smuggling in -- something into this jail;22 that it's too much of an intrusion to put him under the23 direct, you know, 2 feet away, I'm going to look at your24 genitals, as opposed to the ordinary intrusion of saying25 we're going to oversee the showers.65￼910 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 111213141516171819202122232425661 There is no evidence when it comes to that2 group of people, and there are a lot of them, that they3 represent anything like a material threat of smuggling.4 And this is5 privacy and6 78a very significant intrusion on individual individual dignity.Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
