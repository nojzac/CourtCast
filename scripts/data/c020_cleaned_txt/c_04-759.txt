Olson.            Ms. Maynard.              ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD                  ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER            MS. MAYNARD:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:            The Federal Tort Claims Act waives the sovereignimmunity of the United States for the torts of Federalemployees when private persons in like circumstances wouldbe liable.  But instead of applying private-personprinciples of liability, the Ninth Circuit looked to theState and governmental-entity principles of liability.  Itconcluded that the United States could be liable here,because Arizona has decided to hold its governmentalentities liable when State employees are negligent.            That decision is wrong, for two reasons.  First,it is contrary to the plain text of the Federal TortClaims Act.  The Federal Tort Claims Act makes clear thatthe liability of the United States is to be judged by theprinciples of private-person liability in the place wherethe tort occurred.  In section 1346(b)(1), the FederalTort Claims Act allows jurisdiction and waives the31111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 sovereign immunity of the United States under2 circumstances where the United States, if a private3 person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with4 the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do I understand that you would6 accept the rule that if Arizona held a private inspector7 liable to third persons for their injuries, then the8 Government of the United States would be liable? It's not9 quite the Good Samaritan -- not quite the Good Samaritan10 type, but you would accept that as the proper measure of11 your liability in a case like this?12 MS. MAYNARD: As long as Arizona applied that13 principle of liability to private persons in Arizona.14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.15 MS. MAYNARD: Yes, Justice Kennedy. So, it will16 depend on what the particular State's law is. Here, the17 only private-person law that was argued below was the Good18 Samaritan doctrine, and -- as a possible analogy to the19 conduct of the mine inspectors here. But it might --20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It gets ahead of the argument21 just a little bit, but you had a footnote about police22 officers. You have a park ranger, Federal employer. Is23 the analog there that we look to -- what the duties of a24 private security guard would be -- what do you do with25 those cases?41111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MS. MAYNARD: Well, those cases, as we note, do2 present, often, special circumstances not present in this3 case, Justice Kennedy. But the answer to the question4 that's presented here is the same. You still would look5 to whether or not there is private -- a private-person6 analog. And, if there is, then you would look to the7 liability of private persons in that circumstance.8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, even with the police9 officer, I have to find a private analog.10 MS. MAYNARD: Yes, you do. For example, if11 someone brought a trespass action against a Federal law12 enforcement officer for entering upon their land, you13 would apply the same State law as it relates to trespass14 claims against private persons. Those claims may, for15 example, have a defense of lawful authority to enter.16 When looking at whether or not a police officer had -- a17 Federal officer had lawful authority to enter, one might18 then look to Federal law to determine whether or not the19 officer had authority to enter, but you would still be20 applying the principles of private-person liability.21 If one concluded that there was no private-22 person analog, then the only answer under the Federal Tort23 Claims Act would be that the United States cannot be24 liable.25CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I mean, that's 51111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 kind of a $64,000 question here. Give me an example where2 you think there's no private-person analog.3 MS. MAYNARD: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we think4 it's often rare that there is no private-person analog,5 given this Court's decision in Indian Towing, which6 stresses --7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.8 MS. MAYNARD: -- that one should look to a9 private person in like circumstances. I think this Court,10 in Feres, although that decision has been -- has been11 limited -- did determine that there was, in that12 situation, no private-party analog --13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't there always a14 private -- I mean, we're talking about tort law -- isn't15 there always a private analog, which is, you know,16 exercising reasonable care under the circumstances toward17 people to whom you owe some duty, and you just apply that18 general principle?19 MS. MAYNARD: To the extent you're suggesting20 that we just look to general theories of tort law, I think21 that would be incorrect. The -- because the Tort Claims22 Act -- the language of the Tort Claims Act makes the23 United States liable only where a private party in like24 circumstances would be liable. And in Indian Towing, this25 Court defines "in like circumstances" as looking to the61111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 same character of conduct of the -- of the person. So,2 you would have to find a private person who's engaged in3 the same character of conduct, and then ask the question,4 What principles of liability does the State apply to those5 persons? Here, the --6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, all right, so if7 it's a police officer stopping somebody on a highway, it's8 the same as a private security guard stopping somebody at9 a -- you know, the driveway at a plant or something.10 MS. MAYNARD: That may be the closest private-11 person analog. In that situation, however, when one goes12 to apply the defense, it's just as one would if talking13 about a private security guard. One would ask the14 questions whether the guard had the requisite authority.15 And the State would look to what that guard's authority16 was. And often States would look -- if the guard happened17 to be a Federal officer, would look to Federal law. And18 that can be appropriate, I think, for -- under,19 potentially, three different -- for, potentially, three20 different reasons. One, the language of the defense in21 2680(a), which provides the United States with a defense22 to liability in circumstances where , with due care, you're23 carrying out a Federal statute or regulation. It --24 another source of authority might be the State-law25 principles simply look to what the authority of the person71111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 doing the conduct is, and then you would look to Federal2 law for the source of that authority. And that could be3 right, under this Court's suggestion in Muniz, that4 Federal regulations -- once an actionable duty is5 established under State tort principles, one can look to6 Federal regulations to determine whether or not -- what7 the applicable standard of --8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you back --9 MS. MAYNARD: -- care was.10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- up in Muniz a little bit?11 Because that was a prison administration. And so, what12 is the private-party analog to that?13 MS. MAYNARD: I think this Court suggested, in14 Muniz, that perhaps there could be private persons15 operating prisons, or one would look --16 17 1819 phrase from20 was repeated, but I don't remember any discussion of what21 that private party would be, in Muniz.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I don't recall --MS. MAYNARD:  -- in that --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- that in the decision.  Thethe Tort Claims Act about "as a private party"22 MS. MAYNARD: You may be right, Justice23 Ginsburg. I think the important point to take away from24 Muniz is that the Court stressed that, whatever the25 measure of the United States' liability would be for the81111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 claims at issue in that case, it could not be the State2 law as it related to governmental entities; that one would3 have to, as the text requires, look to State law as it4 relates to private persons. The point that I --5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because in those days the6 Government was arguing it should be like State officials.7 MS. MAYNARD: For purposes of obtaining8 immunity, we were arguing that -- which I think is a9 different argument than we're making here today -- we were10 arguing that the Federal Tort Claims Act was not meant to11 waive our sovereign immunity at all with respect to12 certain types of governmental activities. But that's not13 the argument that we're making today. Today, we are14 arguing simply that one must, as the Court held in Indian15 Towing and Rayonier, one should look to the -- to the --16 to the text of the statute, and that that must be the17 measure of our liability.18 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you, what would you19 do if Arizona had a statute that said that any company20 that contracts privately to do mine inspections must obey21 the standards in the Federal guidelines? What would the22 standard be?23 MS. MAYNARD: That presents a difficult24 question, Justice Stevens, as I'm sure you know.25 [Laughter.]91111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MS. MAYNARD: And that would, obviously, be a2 harder case than the one that we have here, and -- which I3 would like to --4 JUSTICE STEVENS: But you say --5 MS. MAYNARD: -- address how you6 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- and I think7 right --8 MS. MAYNARD: If --apply it here.you're probably9 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- that you can't just make a10 Federal -- implied Federal cause of action under the11 Federal standards, from what we know. But then I was12 wondering, What if the Arizona statute said that's what13 the private 1415 Federal law16 when one talks about "negligence per se" type principles,17 which is what you're suggesting -- some States look to18 statutes and regulations solely to establish a standard of19 care once a separate duty has been established. And some20 States, as respondents claim Arizona does, look to it21 establish both duty and a standard of care.firm should do?MS. MAYNARD:  If a State statute looked toas the source -- I think one has to be careful2223 directly to24 statute and25 be most of the way home in getting Federal Tort Claims ActBut, putting that aside, if -- to respondyour question -- if a State adopted a Federalused it to apply to private persons, you would101111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 -- at least the creation of potential liability against2 the United States. However, I think in that instance,3 there would still be a question as to the intent of4 Congress, in the Federal statute itself that was used, as5 to whether Congress intended to foreclose any private6 action, any private enforcement, such that the States --7 if the State has misinterpreted, in other words, a Federal8 law, that presents, I think, a Federal question.9 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, I'm assuming they just did10 it independently. They said, "We want a regulation on the11 private mine inspectors, and let's just adopt the -- a12 standard that shall, in all respects, be the same as the13 Federal standard."14 MS. MAYNARD: If they're just simply borrowing15 it, and don't feel compelled to borrow it, and are,16 indeed, applying it to private persons who perform safety17 inspections, then the United States could potentially be18 liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act. As I mentioned19 here, though, that is definitely not this case, because --20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but it seems to me that21 that's quite a foreseeable possibility. If there is such22 a thing as private safety inspectors in Arizona -- I'm not23 sure, but if there are, I assume that what they do is,24 when they go into a particular industrial area, they look25 at the safety standards for that industry, including111111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Federal and State regulations. So, if you have a mine2 inspector, then it seems to me that his liability might3 very well be measured by whether or not he's inspected the4 mine in accordance to Federal safety standards.5 MS. MAYNARD: Well, I have several answers to6 that question, Justice Kennedy. First, your use of7 "standards" there appears not to be one to create an8 actual duty in the first instance, which is really the9 question before this Court. Is there any duty between the10 United States and the private miners? Secondly --11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I thought we said,12 at the outset -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- if Arizona13 imposes liability on private safety inspectors for14 injuries to third persons, then the United States would be15 liable here.16 MS. MAYNARD: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize17 you were still operating --18 19 20 2122 Arizona has23 imposed -- that it's willing to impose upon its private24 citizens who perform safety inspections, to all persons25 who work at places where they perform safety inspections,121111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That was the --MS. MAYNARD:  -- under Justice --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- hypothetical.MS. MAYNARD:  -- Stevens' hypothetical.  Ifcreated an actionable tort duty that it￼1 that would be a different case. Then that would be2 applying the law as it relates to private persons in like3 circumstances.4 Here, though, it's clear from the cases we5 discuss in our brief, including Easter and Papastathis,6 that Arizona -- when private parties perform safety7 inspections on the property of another, Arizona applies8 its Good Samaritan doctrine. That is not -- in order to9 determine, at the outset, whether there's any actionable10 duty between the inspectors and the injured party. That's11 the step that the Ninth Circuit did not engage in here.12 The Ninth Circuit, instead, decided --13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I understand.14 MS. MAYNARD: Okay. So, the -- and the reason15 that you can't, in this case, follow Justice Stevens'16 reasoning is because the only provisions of law to which17 the respondents point to set the negligence per se18 principles are policy manuals and procedures of the coal19 -- Federal Mine Act that apply only to Federal employees.20 So, they point to no case or law where these provisions,21 upon which they rely, would impose either a duty or a22 standard of care upon private persons in Arizona. Now,23 in that -- to distinguish it -- I'm sorry.24 JUSTICE STEVENS: In your view -- even though25 the Federal standard would not be controlling, in your131111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425view, if you applied a general reasonable-person test,would the Federal standards be admissible so that theplaintiff could argue that there was a failure here whichis evidence of negligence?MS. MAYNARD: In many States, one would look to Federal standards for setting the standard of care. And we think that it could be relevant here what the -- but you must get over the duty hurdle. And that, respondents cannot do by looking to State and governmental-entity liability.JUSTICE SOUTER: When you say that it may be relevant, are you thinking of 2680(a)? Because 2680(a) says, you know, if you exercise due care, any act that you take in the -- in -- well, let's use the exact language -- "any act or omission in the execution of a statute or regulation will not be a ground of liability," with -- at least leaving open the door that any failure to take steps that would have been reasonable in executing it might be.Is that why you answered Justice Stevens as you did?MS. MAYNARD: Well, just to take your question,and then maybe clarify what you mean by what -- JUSTICE SOUTER: Let me -- let me --MS. MAYNARD: I can --JUSTICE SOUTER: -- ask it --MS. MAYNARD: -- I can -- I can answer it the141111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314151617181920212223242526- --reference --JUSTICE SOUTER:  Look, I don't have to cross-MS. MAYNARD:  Good.JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- it to Justice Stevens.MS. MAYNARD:  Okay.JUSTICE SOUTER:  Give me an example of the -- ofthe function of 2680(a).  When would there be liability,but for that provision?            MS. MAYNARD:  Well, I think -- obviously, youdon't get to 2680(a) unless you've gotten through thefirst part and established --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Right.            MS. MAYNARD:  -- that there's some actionableduty on private persons in like circumstances and that wemight be liable.  If you do get over that hurdle -- say,for example, the State standard of care with -- inrelation to private parties is higher than that requiredby Federal statute -- imagine a Federal regulation thatrequires VA doctors to --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Oh, I could -- I could --            MS. MAYNARD:  -- take care of their patientsonce a day.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- I could understand that ifthey -- it would be an easier question for me if the151111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 statute said, "Even if you violate the statute, if you2 otherwise use reasonable care, no liability." But here,3 it talks about reasonable care when you are -- when you4 are, in the statutory phrase, in the execution of the5 statute, which suggests to me you're not violating the6 statute, you're not violating any standard. So, what7 function does it serve?8 MS. MAYNARD: Well, it can serve functions in9 other instances; for example, if someone alleges that you10 were following the statute, but the statute was11 But I think in terms of a -- because it goes on12 whether or not the -- the regulation --13 JUSTICE SOUTER: So, it's really --14 MS. MAYNARD: -- is valid.invalid.to say15 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- the validity is16 the nub of the provision.17 MS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor. I was just saying18 it has that other function. I think, here, the short19 answer to your question is, if this -- if, when you're20 talking about the -- what's an appropriate standard of21 care once one's established an actionable duty -- if the22 State law, as it relates to private persons, set a more23 stringent standard of care than the Federal regulation,24 for example, and the Federal employee were complying with25 the standard of care set forth in the Federal regulation161111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005the -- is￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425--JUSTICE SOUTER:  Of the Federal -- I -- okay.            MS. MAYNARD:  -- this could potentially providea defense, even though, once you went through the firstpart of the statute --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I really don't understand the-- are you sure that a failure to execute a statute doesnot come within the language, "an act or omission," in theexecution of a statute?  I would think a total failureto execute is an omission in the execution of the statute.            MS. MAYNARD:  I'm not sure I --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  You mean if you executed 90percent and omit 10 percent of what you're supposed to do,it comes within that language, but if you don't execute atall, it doesn't?  That seems to me most unlikely.  I meanit seems to me --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  She's saying "execution" is notsynonymous with "performance," which may well be correct.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes. Well, you --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  I had assumed that --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- you accepted, it seemed tome, the premise of --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- Justice Souter's question,which is that (a) -- 2680(a) only applies to a failed171111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 execution. There has to be at least an attempted2 execution. I'm not sure that's true. It says "an act or3 omission" in the execution. And I think a total -- I just4 don't do the thing at all. I think that's an omission in5 the execution.6 MS. MAYNARD: I must be missing the thread of7 the question somewhere. I was just --8 JUSTICE SCALIA: I --9 MS. MAYNARD: -- I was trying to make just --10 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you've --11 MS. MAYNARD: -- a simple, modest point that --12 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- you've still answered my13 question. I mean, you're -- you have said, "Assuming that14 the individual is executing the statute, there is no15 deficiency in the performance of executing the statute.16 There is still this function." And I think I understand17 your answer. But, I mean, I think Justice Scalia's point18 is correct, it may apply in cases in which you are19 purporting to act under the statute, but you omit actions20 that you should take. In other words, your performance is21 deficient. And there, the answer is easier, because it22 says as long as you're exercising due care, no liability.23 MS. MAYNARD: We may still have a defense in --24 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.25 MS. MAYNARD: -- that situation. I think --181111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.2 MS. MAYNARD: -- that's correct. It's an3 important point --4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was an argument that5 was made in your brief, and I didn't fully grasp the6 thrust of it, in the -- that is, you said that the Mine7 Safety and Health Administration has a duty to the8 Secretary of Labor, but not to the mine operator and not9 to the miner. If that were true, then would there be --10 you wouldn't even get to the Good Samaritan doctrine,11 would you, if the only duty is to the Secretary of Labor?12 MS. MAYNARD: Well, I think that, in fact, would13 be an application of the Good Samaritan doctrine, Justice14 Ginsburg. In other words, I think you're referring to the15 first part of the -- we have an -- we believe we have an16 argument. And the Daggett case, which we cite, addresses17 whether -- I think this is an open question in Arizona law18 under their interpretation of the Good Samaritan doctrine19 -- whether someone in the position of the United States20 here is -- has undertaken to render services to another.21 Because that's the argument to which you're referring, I22 believe. And we think there is an argument that we are23 not rendering services to another. But that is not the24 same as saying25 an application1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400that the Good Samaritan doctrine -- that isof the Good Samaritan doctrine.  In other191- Washington, DC 20005￼1 words, courts, when they -- these are all factors that2 take into account whether someone will have a duty,3 pursuant to the Good Samaritan doctrine -- one of the4 factors is that you must have undertaken to render5 services to another. Another factor, which we think is6 also relevant here, is whether or not the injured party7 justifiably and detrimentally relied. And we don't think8 -- you know, they have asked you to decide this question9 -- we think this is more appropriate a question for10 remand, but the United States does not believe that the11 respondents can make out either of those elements of the12 Good Samaritan doctrine, and that the United States,13 therefore, cannot ultimately be liable only -- under the14 only available private-person analogy.15 But the important point is, you -- that is an16 application of the Good Samaritan doctrine.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're not sure that the18 Good Samaritan doctrine is the -- is necessarily what the19 Arizona law would be -- what the analog would be.20 MS. MAYNARD: In our view, it's the only21 private-person law that respondents argued to the Ninth22 Circuit. Respondents have submitted a new argument to23 this court contending that governmental-entity law and24 private-party law in Arizona is equivalent in this25 situation. But that is wrong. It is clear that the State201111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 of Arizona, as a public-policy matter, has decided to2 create broader, actionable tort duties on its own3 governmental employees, and to expose itself and open its4 own coffers to -- when -- to claims when its employees5 have injured its citizens.6 that they apply to private7 the Daggett case, which we8 page 6 of our reply brief.9 In the Daggett But that is not the same lawpersons, and we know that fromdiscuss -- I believe it's oncase, that was a case involving 10 an inspection by a county of a swimming recreation area,11 pursuant to mandatory State and county regulations that12 required such inspections. The Arizona Court of Appeals13 there held that there was a duty by the county to a person14 who had -- who dove into the swimming pool and was injured15 as a result of hitting the bottom, that there was an16 actionable duty running against the county there as a17 matter of the State of Arizona's decision to create tort18 duties when its employees and governmental entities violate19 mandatory obligations or perform them negligently.20 JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Maynard, may I interrupt21 and just ask this? Do we have to decide what the Arizona22 rule is in order to decide the main question presented --23 namely, whether the analogy to Arizona public officials is24 sufficient?25MS. MAYNARD: Not necessarily, Justice Stevens. 211111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 We think it's perfectly clear, from the text of the2 statute and the language of the Ninth Circuit's decision,3 that what they did is improper.4 JUSTICE STEVENS: But I'm just wondering if5 you're not discussing a State-law issue that has not been6 decided by either court below or really fully argued here.7 MS. MAYNARD: Well, it has not -- the -- whether8 or not there's an equivalency, whether or not private9 persons are liable in the same instances as State and10 governmental entities, was not argued by the respondents11 below.12 JUSTICE STEVENS: Right.13 MS. MAYNARD: And, therefore, it was not14 decided. We do not think -- it is a question of State15 law, but we think the answer is very clear, because16 respondent -- the only thing respondents point to here to17 assert that there is an equivalent are cases making State18 and county and governmental entities liable. They point19 to nothing, as they concede, cases involving private20 persons.21 So, there -- if -- we don't think the Court22 should remand, which would be an invitation to the Ninth23 Circuit to essentially do, under another guise, what it24 has already done, which is essentially25 entity liability to the United States,221111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-apply governmental-in contradiction toWashington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I wouldn't do that.MS. MAYNARD:  -- text of the statute.If I can finish my Daggett answer, though,Justice Stevens, I think that'll make clear why the twoare distinct and why it isn't a difficult question ofArizona law.            The Daggett court went on to decide that thecounty, although it had a duty to the injured partypursuant to governmental entity law, similar to what theNinth Circuit applied to us here, there would be noactionable duty if one applied the Good Samaritandoctrine.  It found that none of the second three prongsof the Good Samaritan doctrine were met, and it alsoraised the question as to whether or not someone in theposition of the county would even be rendering servicesinto another sufficient to meet that part of the GoodSamaritan doctrine.            So, we think it is very clear that the two arenot the same.  The -- so, we would ask that the Court notremand, and leave that question open, Justice Stevens.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's just a backgroundquestion.  I'm curious, was ASARCO sued here, or -- and isits liability capped by workmen's comp laws, or?MS. MAYNARD: I do not know whether they were 231111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 actually sued. There are -- their -- I do believe their2 liability, though, is that workers' comp is an exclusive3 remedy here. And, although it's not in the record in this4 case, the State of Arizona was also sued, and, according5 to news reports, settled for substantial sums with both of6 the respondents.7 If there are no further questions at this time,8 I would like to reserve my time. 9101112131415CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Ms. Maynard.Mr. Cotter. ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. COTTER     ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTSMR. COTTER:  Thank you, Your Honor.Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:I'd like to begin by addressing the last pointOffice of the Solicitor General, which is the16 made by the17 Daggett case. And I address that merely to highlight that18 this is a State law issue. It -- the Daggett case did not19 as the Solicitor General maintains, that under Arizona law20 there would be no duty under the restatement sections 32321 or 324. In fact, what the Court says in remanding the22 case because they found a duty under the county23 regulations, is, "We assume, without deciding, that there24 is a claim under 324 and -- 323 and 324, and note simply25 that there are no allegations in the plaintiff's complainthold,241111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 that would satisfy those issues." So, they simply say,2 because there's additional litigation coming, they were3 giving heads up to the party that he needs to amend the4 complain to assert the Good Samaritan elements.5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you a question that6 Justice Kennedy just brought up? Did this -- did Mr.7 Olson collect, under the State workers' compensation8 statute, from the mine operators?9 MR. COTTER: Your Honor, Mr. Olson did collect,10 under the State workers' compensation statute, from the11 mine operator, that is correct, as did Mr. Vargas. And,12 in fact, the State of Arizona was sued -- the State mine13 inspector -- alleging that they were negligent, and that14 case was resolved. That -- a point of interest in that15 case is that in that case, the State -- because Arizona is16 a pure comparative-negligence State -- alleged that the17 Federal mine inspector was partially at fault and that,18 therefore, Mr. Olson and Mr. Vargas' damages should be19 reduced, just as, in our case, if we had proceeded beyond20 the motion-to-dismiss phase, we could have anticipated, as21 is common, that the Federal Government would have22 identified the State of Arizona and the mine operator to23 be non-parties at fault, as well, so that those24 individuals -- the negligence of those25 reduce the plaintiff's damages against251111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-individuals wouldthe FederalWashington, DC 20005￼1 Government.2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- but the mine3 operator -- the Compensation Act is the exclusive remedy4 under Arizona law, so the -- nobody could5 more from the mine operator. Is that so?6 MR. COTTER: That is correct.7 of candor, I have to tell Your Honor that8 parent company to the mine operator, which is Grupo9 Mexico, in an attempt to assert a claim, and that case was10 resolved only by some -- by making some concessions on the11 workers' compensation lien issues that the workers'12 compensation carrier had back against the claimants for13 their recovery from the State of Arizona.14 I hope that's clear. But, generally, workers'15 compensation carriers have a right to get repaid if16 there's some private settlement, and concessions were made17 on that right, because of the -- suing the parent company,18 and that case was never resolved on the merits.19 To begin, Your Honor, this came to the Ninth20 Circuit from a motion to dismiss. And that has21 significance to this -- to this question, because the22 plaintiffs were not able to develop the factual record23 which goes to the issues of whether or not there would be24 liability under the State law -- the Good Samaritan law or25 under -- issues about assumption of duty under State law.261111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005get anything In the interestwe sued the￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that goes to the remand2 question raised --34567 whether the 8MR. COTTER:  It --JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- earlier.MR. COTTER:  -- it does --JUSTICE SCALIA:  It doesn't -- it doesn't go toNinth Circuit was correct here.MR. COTTER:  Well, in a roundabout way, it does,9 Justice Scalia, because what happened was, the Ninth10 Circuit was faced with the task, under the Federal Tort11 Claim Act, of deciding whether -- if the Federal12 Government -- the Federal mine inspectors, if you would --13 were private people under like circumstances, would they14 be liable? So, the Ninth Circuit was essentially asked a15 hypothetical question by the Federal Tort Claim, and it16 was asked to resolve that question on a motion to dismiss17 for failure to state a claim, which the standard is, of18 course, that we can set -- we can prove no facts which19 would -- which would establish a cause of action. And20 what the court really did, because the court applied a21 body of law -- the Ninth Circuit -- that began with the22 Louie doctrine -- is, the court looked at Arizona mine-23 inspector law as a predictor to what Arizona private-24 person law would be.25 And from Justice Roberts' questions about police271111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 officers, in the Louie case, the State of Washington, like2 the State of Arizona, had waived sovereign immunity.3 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean, that might have4 -- you might have won if they had said, "We're going to5 look to see what the law is in Arizona governing a private6 person who performs a similar kind of inspection. And we7 decide that it's the same." You would have won that, I8 guess. But you didn't, because they didn't. That isn't9 what they said.10 MR. COTTER: That --11 JUSTICE BREYER: That is, we're not looking to12 the law governing private persons, we are just looking at13 law governing municipalities, and they're -- it seems to14 me they are pretty clearly wrong about that, unless you15 give me a reason why they're right.16 MR. COTTER: Well, Your Honor, what -- our17 position is that, although they applied the law of18 municipalities and the State, what they were really doing19 is applying the Louie doctrine, which says that when you20 cannot identify a private actor, then the best evidence of21 what the State's law is, with respect to the actions of a22 party in the same circumstances, is to look at the State23 liability, and that --24 JUSTICE BREYER: That's a good question.25 Suppose you really had a person who -- there's just no281111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 comparable private person in like circumstances. I can't2 even imagine what that could be. Maybe you could imagine.3 But I was trying to think of some secret research on4 turning people invisible or something for military5 purposes. I mean, I -- it's just hard -- I mean, hard6 here, obviously. There is such a person. There are7 private mine inspectors.8 MR. COTTER: Well, actually, I'm not aware of9 any private mine inspectors, but if we want to take that10 thought --11 JUSTICE BREYER: Maybe there are not --12 MR. COTTER: If the private mine inspector had13 the -- assumed the same duties, so it's under like14 circumstances, that the Federal mine inspector had here,15 which was to inspect the mine in its entirety four times16 per year and to respond to all safety-related complaints17 and determine whether they present imminent hazards, and18 to remove the miners from the area -- if those are the19 characteristics of the private individual under like20 circumstances, then I concede that would be a better21 predictor of State -- and if we knew what Arizona would22 decide in that context, I --23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Cotter, I don't -- I don't24 see, in the opinion, any indication that the Ninth Circuit25 was doing what you -- what you assert it was trying to do291111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 -- namely, to predict what future California law -- locked2 deep in the bosom of the California Supreme Court, but not3 yet disclosed to the public -- will hold. It didn't4 proceed that way at all. It says, generally, the United5 States can be held liable only when liability was attached6 to a private actor. However, the United States may be liable,7 quoting from one of the Ninth Circuit's earlier cases, for the8 performance of some activities that private persons do not9 perform when a State or municipal entity would be held liable10 under the law where the activity occurred. I don't see they are11 saying, "We are trying to predict what California would do12 in a private situation." They have set forth a rule that,13 where there's no cause of action against a private person,14 we look to whether there would be a cause of action under15 -- against a State or subdivision of the State.16 MR. COTTER: Justice Scalia, I concede that the17 Court has accurately characterized the opinion. If I18 remember the cases cited by the opinion, they're Concrete19 Tie and Hines, which lead directly back to the Louie20 opinion, which was the decided at the behest of the21 Government, because, in Louie, there was a law enforcement22 operator who -- a law enforcement official who failed to23 stop a drunk driver, and they said, "There is" -- the24 Government said, "There is no private person here." And,25 therefore, if you look to Washington State law, which does301111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425not impose liability in these circumstances, you get agood idea of what Washington law would rule if there werea private person.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  How long ago was that -- wasLouie decided?            MR. COTTER:  Your Honor, I believe it was about20 years ago.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Twenty years ago.  AndWashington still has not yet made this prediction cometrue, I gather.            MR. COTTER:  You mean it has not ruled on --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Exactly.            MR. COTTER:  -- the subject?            JUSTICE SCALIA:  It has not extended itsGovernment Tort Claims Act to private citizens.            MR. COTTER:  I think -- I think that the FederalTort Claim Act does not apply to private citizens inWashington.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, I'm saying the predictionthat Louie made had not yet come true.  There is still noWashington decision that has done what Louie said it would--            MR. COTTER:  Would not do.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- would be done.            MR. COTTER:  Louie predicted that there would be311111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 no liability. And, in fact, I think that that remains the2 law.3 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but Louie, according to4 the SG, says, "We say here that this person is not liable5 -- the Government is not liable, because, in Washington,6 Washington would not make a municipality liable," while7 adding that the law of Washington is that a municipality8 is liable only if a private person in Washington is9 liable. So, I wouldn't think Louie is very good authority10 that the Ninth Circuit thought it was for the proposition11 that you look not to the private person, but you look to12 only the municipality.13 MR. COTTER: If I understand Your Honor's --14 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'm just --15 MR. COTTER: -- point --16 JUSTICE BREYER: -- reading from their brief.17 What they say is, the court stressed that the equivalence18 is important. The equivalence of what? Under Washington19 law, State and municipal government entities are liable20 only to the same extent as a private person. And they21 cite page 825. And they stress this equivalence, because22 a finding of immunity for State employees under State law23 does not determine the scope of the U.S. liability, etcetera.24 MR. COTTER: And, in fact, Your Honor, the25 equivalence factor in Louie is present in this case.321111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, anyway, if Louie helpssomething other than that, it's wrong, too, isn't it?Because what the statute says is, it's a question oflooking to the --MR. COTTER: We --JUSTICE BREYER: -- private person.MR. COTTER: The respondents concede that thequestion is "private person under like circumstances."  Weconcede that point.  Our point is simply that, on a motionto dismiss, the Ninth Circuit was faced with trying todecide:  What would Arizona law be with a private personunder like circumstances?            JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it didn't try to do that.It made no effort to do that.  It just said -- it justsaid the United States may be liable when a State ormunicipal entity would be held liable.  It made no effortto figure out what Washington would do with a privateindividual.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In the -- in the face ofa district court opinion that applied the Good Samaritanstatute and threw the case out because no allegation couldbe made to come within the Good Samaritan statute.  So, itseems pretty clear that they're doing something quite differentfrom what you're suggesting.MR. COTTER: Well, Justice Roberts, our 331111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 contention is that the genesis of the doctrine that they2 applied, and that the Fifth Circuit applies, and that the3 D.C. circuit applies, is to predict State law, that its4 purpose is not to expand liability where State law doesn't5 exist. In fact, if you read the opinion of the Ninth6 Circuit in this case, it acknowledges that private person7 is the test. But then it says that when we cannot find a8 private person, this is what we do. We go look to the9 State law. And the Crider case says, basically, that when10 you do that -- from the Fifth Circuit -- what you're doing11 is looking at the legal principles that are -- you're12 looking at a factual situation that best articulates the13 State-law legal principles --14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But, doesn't that15 approach -- it doesn't make any sense, because you're only16 looking at half of the equation. Presumably, if you have17 a special set of principles for governmental actors, they18 include immunities and defenses and all that. And you19 just want the benefit of the liability, but you don't20 want, I take it, the immunities and defenses that go along21 with it.22 MR. COTTER: Well, that issue was actually23 raised in the Henzel case, in the D.C. circuit, where the24 -- there was a high-speed chase and the officer caused a25 collision, and what happened was, the Government argued341111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 that you can't apply the standard applicable defined duty2 of the Government, but you can apply the Government -- or3 the D.C. regulations as to standard of care. And the D.C.4 Circuit found, no, it would follow Louie and Crider, and5 say that the best predictor of the State law, when you6 can't find an analogous private person, is the liability7 statutes that concern the law enforcement, but, following8 Indian Towing, it would not apply the gross-negligence9 standard that the D.C. Circuit had adopted that concerned10 the officers.11 JUSTICE BREYER: That's actually a rather12 interesting question I don't really know the answer to.13 The idea is that you can't find an analogous private14 person. We might have to write something about that. You15 could say -- you -- there always is an analogous private16 person. It's impossible to think of an example.17 The other extreme, you have the Ninth Circuit,18 which could -- which says as long as the Government was19 involved in regulation, there is no analogous private20 person, because private people don't regulate. I would21 think that was almost certainly wrong.22 But what is the right way to go about it? Are23 there such people, or aren't there?24 MR. COTTER: Well, Your Honor, what I would say25 in this case is, the absolute wrong way to go about it is351111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 on a motion to dismiss, because, unfortunately, the record2 wasn't developed, which may, in fact, speak to issues that3 may, in fact, address Arizona law on Good Samaritan, for4 instance -- the issue of whether, under Arizona law, a5 duty was assumed, the issue of whether reliance exists.6 And I have to correct the Solicitor General.7 The reliance does not merely come from the injured party.8 The restatement section, section three- -- or the9 restatement section 324 says reliance is from the other10 for the injured party. So, in this case --11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, doesn't that make12 it a contract case? If you're talking about the party13 who's contracted with, say, a private inspector -- I mean,14 I have a contract, somebody comes and inspects the house15 for termites, and I assume, if they don't do a good job16 and the house is damaged, they're liable. But that's17 under contract, and this is a question of tort liability.18 MR. COTTER: Well, if I may answer with a19 hypothetical, Your Honor, because we did not get to20 develop the record, what happened in this case is, the21 mine method changed. They went from taking the floor to22 the taking the back. And they ripped out the ground23 support. So, people were working under unsupported ground.24 We, because there was a motion to dismiss, never got the25 opportunity to take the mine operator and said, "Why on361111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Earth" -- the deposition of the mine operator -- "did youthink you could do this?"JUSTICE SCALIA: What --MR. COTTER: "Why on Earth did" --JUSTICE SCALIA: What was your response to themotion to dismiss?  The Government said that you didn'traise, in response to the motion to dismiss, any assertionthat private individuals would be liable --MR. COTTER: Oh --JUSTICE SCALIA: -- under State law in this -- in this situation.MR. COTTER: Justice Scalia, I did not understand the Government to be saying that --JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I -- that's how I understood it.--MR. COTTER: -- and it is not true, if that wasJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.MR. COTTER: -- what they said.JUSTICE SCALIA: What was your response?MR. COTTER: Our response was that the law --first, our response was that, under the motion to dismiss,our factual allegations in the complaint have to beaccepted, and we alleged all the elements of the GoodSamaritan doctrine, and all the elements of the uniquely371111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 governmental --2 JUSTICE SCALIA: You said that? You said that,3 "And we have a -- we have asserted all the elements of4 Good Samaritan"?5 MR. COTTER: Yes.6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.7 MR. COTTER: And what happened was, frankly,8 Judge Browning dismissed, relying, I think, on the -- more9 on the discretionary function exception, and then the10 Myers case, out of the Sixth Circuit, saying, as a matter11 of law, this -- as a matter of Federal law, MSHA is not an12 assumption of duty by the Government. And I don't know13 whether this Court is inclined to address that issue or14 not, but I'd just like to point out on that issue, the15 Federal Tort Claim Act makes the issue of whether the16 Government's liable a question of State law. The question17 is, as we have conceded, whether the mine inspector would18 be liable if he were a private person, and -- which I19 think goes to the prior question about, "What if there is20 no" --21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But we can remand for that.22 What's here is, the Ninth Circuit held that there's23 liability based on what the liability of a State agent24 would be, and that's just not the rule.25 MR. COTTER: Well, Your Honor, if the Court is -381111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1- 23 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So, we have to give someinstructions as to how the -- as to whether or not theNinth Circuit is right about that.            MR. COTTER:  If the Court --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And that's why you're here.            MR. COTTER:  -- if the Court is convinced thatwhat the Ninth Circuit did was not try to predict whatprivate law would -- that -- what private law in Arizonawould be, if the Federal mine inspector was a privatecitizen, then we would concede that that's not the law.But we believe that is what the Ninth Circuit didfollowing those cases -- the Louie case, the Crider case,and all of the cases that were --            JUSTICE BREYER:  See, that's exactly what'sconcerning me, and I don't quite see my way to an answer. Suppose we do send it back because we think just what yousaid wasn't so is so, they have to now into this.  They'llhave to go into it.  Should we suggest, "Look, you tryharder to find a private analogy, because there's almostalways a private analogy."  Every Government official hassome similarities to private people, and some differences. So, we could emphasize that, or we could suggest, "No,actually, there are quite a few differences."  I don'thave much of a feeling for which way to go on that.391111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            MR. COTTER:  Your Honor, if you do decide toremand -- which if the issue of the Good Samaritandoctrine or assumption of duty under Arizona law is goingto be addressed, we recommend that there is a remand -- wewould urge the Court, as a matter of first -- the firstrule is to instruct the Ninth Circuit that these are badly-- these are cases that are badly decided on motions todismiss for failure to state a claim.  Because the Arizonalaw on when someone cites a -- adopts a duty -- theDaggett case or the Papastathis case -- are all fact-intensive.            JUSTICE BREYER:  No, that's not -- that's notwhat I've been asking.            MR. COTTER:  And --            JUSTICE BREYER:  And to expose everything I was-- perhaps the better thing is to say, "There's always aprivate analogy," or try very hard, because if you reallyfound an instance there was no private analogy to, maybethere would be no recovery, because the statute simplyspeaks about private party.            MR. COTTER:  With all due respect, Your Honor --            JUSTICE BREYER:  And this is a statute designedto give people recovery --            MR. COTTER:  Sure.            JUSTICE BREYER:  -- when people commit torts.401111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            MR. COTTER:  It's a -- it's a statute where --with a broad waiver intended.  But I actually think if the-- if the rule were "If there's no private analogy,there's no recovery," it sort of reverses the statute.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  It does.            JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, it does, but that --would we end up there, because of the way the statute'swritten?  You avoid the whole matter if you say, "Look forthe closest private person, no matter what."  And maybethat's --            MR. COTTER:  I concede that point, Your Honor.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay, who's your -- what's yourbest analog?            MR. COTTER:  My best analogy here is a privatemine inspector who has the same duties as a Federal mineinspector, which, in this case, who -- you could saysomeone who contracted --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Whom does he work for?  Domines hire these people, or does he work for the liabilitycarrier, which I would have expected?  I mean, if we'regoing to make the kind of suggestion that Justice Breyersays maybe we ought to make, we ought to have something inmind.  And is it -- is it the -- is it an inspector whoworks for the liability carrier who would be the closestanalog in your case?411111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            MR. COTTER:  Well, earlier, the suggestion wasmade, "What happens if the Government" -- I thought thesuggestion was, "What if the Government outsources mineinspections?  What if, instead of" --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but this -- that's allhypothetical.  You're litigating this case.  You must havesomething in mind.  Whom do you have in mind as your bestanalog?The --MR. COTTER:  The Arizona State mine inspector.JUSTICE SOUTER:  What's your second-best analog?[Laughter.]MR. COTTER:  Well, my second-best analog, Iguess, would be a workers' comp carrier, an insurer, or --            JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  But I thought you had assumedthat, under the Arizona law, you could rely on the GoodSamaritan doctrine --            MR. COTTER:  I believe we can rely --            JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  And I thought that, at least,would be open on remand.            MR. COTTER:  I --            JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Is it necessary that we gofurther than that?            MR. COTTER:  Well, I don't think it's necessary,if the Court doesn't want to address whether the421111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Government always needs to -- or the courts always need tofind a private person.  The Good --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Aren't there, in all kinds ofsituations, private inspectors?  One of them that wasmentioned in the briefs, I think, is an elevator operator.            MR. COTTER:  Sure.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Elevator operation inspector. So, there's lots of private inspectors.  There may not beprivate mine inspectors.  I don't know about that.  Butthis would be inspector liability.            MR. COTTER:  Well, in the restatement, section324, under "Assumption of a Duty," gives an example.  Andthe example is, if a private company hires a scaffoldinginspector, and the scaffolding inspector does a negligentinspection, and a worker falls and is injured, the workerhas a claim against the scaffolding inspector.  And then,under the reliance component is --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but only --presumably, only if they meet the requirements of the GoodSamaritan law.            MR. COTTER:  I believe --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Which -- they would haveto show that there was an increase in the risk of harm,which I think it would not be true in your hypothetical,or that there was a duty owed to the third party -- the431111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 scaffolding2 contractor,34 Honor, although I'd like to read a quote from Papastathis,5 which is -- the court relied on. The quote is just this,6 "Numerous cases have held that once a party gratuitously7 agrees to inspect and the third party is subsequentlyinspector is presumably hired by thenot by the employees -- or there was reliance.MR. COTTER:  I think that that's true, Your8 injured, that party can be held liable for its negligent9 inspection." There is a host of Arizona case law on10 assumed duties. And the case I would refer to is Martinez11 versus State, which is simply a case where a road washes12 out, and the Government reroutes the road for a -- for a13 period of time across a private land, and, for a period of14 time, grades it, and then stops grading it. And, in that15 circumstance, the Government was held liable simply for16 having, for that period of the time, assumed a duty. And17 there wasn't an analysis in the Martinez case of whether18 or not the elements of section 324(a) were met or not.19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, we're just debating20 now whether or not you've satisfied the requirements of21 the Good Samaritan statute.2223 theories of 2425 you lost inMR. COTTER:  Or whether there are alternativeliability available under Arizona State law.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Did you argue -- I mean,the district court on the Good Samaritan441111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 statute.2 MR. COTTER: Yes.3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: On your appeal, did you4 argue that that was wrong?5 MR. COTTER: Yes. And the Ninth Circuit simply6 didn't reach that issue.7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you said the district8 court went off on discretionary function?9 MR. COTTER: It went off primarily under10 discretionary function, but then in addressing the Arizona11 -- the Good Samaritan doctrine under Arizona, it relied on12 the Myers case, which is a case in which -- the Sixth13 Circuit said that when you have the case -- or safety14 inspections like the Federal -- like MSHA, that court15 would adopt a actor, slash, monitor dichotomy so that16 there could never be an assumption of duty under --17 because the Government was only in a monitor function.18 And, to the extent that that's at issue, Your Honor, I19 would think that that would be a question, under State20 law, of whether the Government had assumed the duty. And21 if not under State law, it would be a question under the22 Federal Tort Claim of whether an -- there is an exception23 that has been met. And there is no exception. I think24 that this Court, in Berkovitz, said that regulatory25 conduct can be actionable under the Federal Tort Claim if 451111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425it -- the discretion isn't met -- or the discretionaryexception isn't met.  And in this case there was anabsolute obligation to make these inspections and anabsolute failure to do so.MR. COTTER: Your Honor, if there are -- or the Court -- if there's no further questions, I'd like to --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Cotter.            Ms. Maynard, you have five minutes left.           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARDON BEHALF OF PETITIONERMS. MAYNARD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.If I may just start where he ended. Just to beclear, Justice Scalia, the point that I was making is, theonly private-person law to which respondents pointed belowwas that of the Good Samaritan doctrine.  That -- whetheror not respondents can make out a claim under the GoodSamaritan doctrine would require meeting all of theelements of that doctrine.  That would be primarily aState-law question, but we do think there's an ingredientof a Federal question there, especially, for example, indeciding whether or not they reasonably and detrimentallyrelied.  Other courts of appeals, including the SixthCircuit, in Myers and Raymer, have said that the languageof the Mine Act is relevant to whether or not a party cansimply rely on the very -- just the bare existence of the461111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MSHA -- of MSHA's existence and its inspections, and held2 that, given the language in the Mine Act that expressly3 leaves the safety of the mine to the -- primarily to the4 mine operators through the assistance of the miners, that5 it would be unreasonable to rely.6 Here, it -- this was completely appropriately7 decided by the district court on a motion to dismiss,8 because they came forward with affidavits that say nothing9 more than that they relied upon the existence of the MSHA10 scheme. And that, under Arizona's Good Samaritan law in -11 - taking into account the Federal scheme, is insufficient,12 because it is insufficient under Arizona law.13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You consider affidavits14 on a motion to dismiss?15 MS. MAYNARD: This is a 12(b)(1) and a 12(b)(6)16 motion to dismiss, Mr. Chief Justice, because it's also a17 jurisdictional issue, so it is possible. They came18 forward with these reliance affidavits, and I think it's19 significant how little they say. The reliance affidavits20 would obviously not require any discovery on their part to21 indicate what their actions were, in terms of --22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what --23 MS. MAYNARD: -- upon which they were relying.24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- what argument do you25 have to avoid a remand for consideration of liability471111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425under the Good Samaritan law?            MS. MAYNARD:  I think that's -- that's one ofour arguments, that they can't meet the Good Samaritan law--            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But they didn't have achance to argue that before the court of appeals, right?            MS. MAYNARD:  Oh, no, Your Honor, they arguedthat before the --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But court of appealsdidn't decide that.            MS. MAYNARD:  The court of appeals didn't decidethat.  But, tellingly, I think, as Justice Breyersuggested, the court of appeals -- and I think yourquestion has suggested -- it seems that they think thereis no liability there.  The premise of the court ofappeals' holding was that there is no private-partyanalog.            Justice Breyer, if there is no private-partyanalog, if you conclude that this type of regulatoryactivity has no private-party analog, the only appropriateanswer under the Federal Tort Claims Act is that theUnited States cannot be liable.  You cannot --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you think there is aprivate-party analog.MS. MAYNARD: We think that the Good Samaritan 481111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 doctrine affords an -- under this Court's interpretation,2 in Indian Towing, of the "like circumstances" doctrine, we3 think one could look to the Good Samaritan principles,4 under which we think we would prevail.5 If I may, Justice Ginsburg, return --6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Saying that there is no7 private-party analog is not quite the same thing as saying8 you lose under what we consider to be the proper private-9 party analog -- namely, Good Samaritan.10 MS. MAYNARD: We believe that once -- I'm not11 sure I get the vein of your question, but I'll -- the --12 if there is no private-party analog, so there's no13 private-person in like circumstances, the United States14 cannot be held liable. If there is a private-party in15 like circumstances, one then must apply that law to the16 facts and the claims and determine whether or not the United17 States is liable.18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which the court of appeals19 hasn't done.20 MS. MAYNARD: But the district court did here,21 Your Honor, and held that we weren't liable. If the22 Court's going to decide this on the record, we think the23 Court can decide on this record that there could not be24 Good Samaritan law under Arizona law.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But we didn't bring cert491111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 on that question.2 MS. MAYNARD: That was -- I think it's fairly3 encompassed. The -- it -- the question presented is4 whether or not the court applied -- should have looked to5 private-person law. I think if you say yes, you could6 look to that law and conclude on this record that there7 can't be liability.8 Justice Ginsburg, if I may turn back to your9 point about Muniz, I think you're correct that they didn't10 specifically -- the court in that case didn't specifically11 suggest what the private analog might be on remand,12 although it did suggest perhaps it would be personal-13 injury law as it relates to private persons in like14 circumstances. But I think the important point in Muniz15 on that point is akin to what I was just making to Justice16 Scalia, which is that the court said there is consent to17 sue here, so the prisoners may sue. Whether or not18 they're going to be able to ultimately make out a claim19 under private-person law is a different question.20 So, the Federal Tort Claims Act is not a21 guarantee of monetary compensation from the United States.22 And one cannot do what the Ninth Circuit did, which is to23 keep looking for possible analogies in -- under which the24 result would be that the United States is held liable.25 Sometimes, just like with private-party analogs, just like501111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112131415161718192021222324251111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400with private safety inspectors, the answer will be: theprivate party can't be held liable under the applicableprivate-person law.  And in -- the private-person law inArizona, I think it's clear, is the Good --I'm sorry. My Time is up.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. Maynard. The case is submitted.[Whereupon, at 11:59 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.]51 1-Washington, DC 20005
