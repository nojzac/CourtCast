King. Mr. Farley.ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA D. FARLEY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. FARLEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:The issue before you today, of whether or not police can impermissibly create exigentcircumstances, arises from the improper suppression of reasonably seized evidence after a reasonable warrantless entry. The test set forth by the Kentucky Supreme Court is improper for several reasons, the first of which is that this Court has routinely held that the subjective intent of police officers when effecting a warrantless entry is irrelevant.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where did the -- where did the Kentucky Supreme Court -- where did the Kentucky Supreme Court say that it was looking to a subjective state of mind on the part of the police?MR. FARLEY: Well, the Kentucky SupremeCourt's first prong of their test -- and I believe it'sin our petition appendix on page 26 -- I'm sorry. - Subject to Final Review3￼ - Subject to Final Review41 Their -- their discussion starts on page 44a and carries2 over to 46a. The first question of their test is3 whether or not the officers acted in bad faith in an4 attempt to purposefully evade the warrant requirements.5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That didn't -- that6 didn't apply in this case?7 MR. FARLEY: That is correct.8 The second prong of the Kentucky Supreme9 Court's test is whether or not the actions of the10 Respondent in this case or the occupant of the home11 would have been foreseeable by the police officers12 before they knocked and announced their presence.13 Now, the problem with the foreseeability14 test -­15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why is -- why is that16 subjective? Why isn't that -- would it be foreseeable17 to a reasonable police officer similarly situated?18 MR. FARLEY: Well, Justice Ginsburg, it -­19 it isn't directly a subjective inquiry. However, police20 officers are trained to expect and foresee illegal21 activity so that they may carry out the duties of their22 job in protecting the citizens. So under a23 foreseeability test, a reasonable officer will always24 foresee illegal activity in response to his actions, be25 it walking down the street or knocking on your door. A￼ - Subject to Final Review51 reasonable officer will always foresee illegal activity,2 and for that reason, the Kentucky Supreme Court's test3 is completely unworkable.4 Several of the other circuits and the lower5 courts have adopted tests that also attempt to add an6 extra exception, an unwarranted closure of the exigent7 circumstances exception that narrows the use of that8 exception by police officers. The test that the9 Commonwealth would propose is a simple lawfulness test.10 Now, under this test, as long as an officer11 behaves lawfully, there should be no suppression of12 evidence seized after an otherwise reasonable search.13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, you have an14 apartment building where the police know from experience15 there's a lot of illegal activity, a lot of drugs, drug16 transactions. Every 2 weeks, they walk through and17 knock on every door and wait for evidence of the18 destruction of -- of drugs. Is that all right?19 MR. FARLEY: Well, there's -- I would say20 "yes," if there's probable cause as well as exigent21 circumstances.22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the probable23 cause, of course, comes when they hear the, you know,24 flushing and the, you know, hiding or whatever behind25 the door.￼ - Subject to Final Review61 MR. FARLEY: Well, I would assert that there2 are -- there are two separate issues here. You must3 have probable cause separate from the existence of4 exigent circumstances. In this case, there was probable5 cause due to the smell of marijuana.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: They go to the apartment7 building, and they sniff at every door, and when they8 sniff, when a strong smell of marijuana emanates from9 the door, then they go through this routine, but they do10 it as a matter of every 2 weeks, as the Chief said, as a11 routine matter. They don't just knock on every door,12 but they knock on the doors where they smell marijuana,13 and they do that just as a routine, in all the buildings14 where they suspect there may be drug -- drugs being15 stashed.16 MR. FARLEY: Justice Ginsburg, under a17 simple lawfulness test, since the officers have not18 violated the Fourth Amendment prior to the exigency19 arising, there would be no need to suppress any20 evidence. That would be perfectly fine for the officers21 to do that. It may not be the most -­22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to the Chief Justice23 when he said -- and I think this was the Solicitor24 General's position -- that the police can routinely25 knock at a door and wait to see if they hear a toilet￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425flushing. I -- because I don't would be "yes"?MR. exists, becauseneed the probable cause inquiry? What does it have to do with anything?MR. FARLEY: Well, under the Fourth Amendment, for a reasonable warrantless search to occur, a police officer must have -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Before they can go in -­ MR. FARLEY: Yes. The police officer musthave -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- because they've just heard the toilet flushing?MR. FARLEY: They must have probable cause coupled with exigent circumstances.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. I think I've got two different probable causes that's caused -­ causing me some confusion. I understand their requirement of probable cause, and that they hear sound of evidence being destroyed and therefore enter. Isthat -- or are you talking about the probable cause to - Subject to Final ReviewI've taken it out of this case but -­ know what noise means. But your answerFARLEY: Yes, if -- if probable cause-­JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's what -­ JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, why -- why do you7￼ - Subject to Final Review81 think there's something going on in the first place?2 MR. FARLEY: There are two separate issues3 here. They must have probable cause aside from exigent4 circumstances. Then they must also have -­5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: To knock on the door?6 MR. FARLEY: -- a reasonable belief -­7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: They must have probable8 cause to knock on the door?9 MR. FARLEY: No, Justice Kennedy.10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. All right.11 MR. FARLEY: They can -- just as citizen12 could -­13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay. Take us -­14 MR. FARLEY: -- they could knock on the15 door. However -­16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Take us through it -- take17 us through it chronologically. The policeman is walking￼18 through the19 he-­20 2122 2324 door. When25 it arise?hallway. He has no probable cause. He -­MR. FARLEY: He could knock on the door. JUSTICE KENNEDY: He smells marijuana -­ MR. FARLEY: The smell of -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- then he knocks on the did the probable cause arise and when must - Subject to Final Review91 MR. FARLEY: Well, the smell of marijuana2 would give probable cause to obtain a search warrant.3 Once he knocks on the door and hears noises consistent4 with the destruction of physical evidence, then an5 exigency has arised. Now the officer has both probable6 cause and an exigent circumstance. And under the -­7 JUSTICE KAGAN: But I don't understand why8 the smell of marijuana is necessary. This goes back to9 what Justice Sotomayor was saying, you don't need10 probable cause to knock on a door. Knocking on a door11 is perfectly lawful. So, if there's just a lawfulness12 test, the knock is fine. And then when you hear13 whatever it is that you hear that you think creates14 exigent circumstances, whether it's a toilet flushing or15 whether it's just noise, that, too, gives you the16 ability to go right in.17 So -- so if it's just lawfulness, you don't18 need the marijuana smell even, do you?19 MR. FARLEY: Well, I think -- I think we're20 confused. In order to enter with exigent circumstances,21 you must also have separate probable cause, and it's22 that you could have gotten -­23 JUSTICE KAGAN: Probable cause beyond24 thinking that the evidence -­25 MR. FARLEY: Beyond the reasonable belief -- ￼5 JUSTICE SCALIA:6 going to the toilet, right?7 (Laughter.)8 MR. FARLEY: It9 could very well be.It might just be somebodycould be. It could be. It - Subject to Final Review1 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- is being destroyed?2 MR. FARLEY: Yes. Correct.3 JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay.4 MR. FARLEY: That is correct.10 JUSTICE SCALIA:11 that the reason the toilet is flushing is somebody is12 trying to get rid of evidence. And in order for that to13 be the case, you have to have smelled the marijuana?14 MR. FARLEY: Yes, Justice Scalia, you're15 absolutely correct.16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there's only one17 probable cause, right?18 MR. FARLEY: Yes.19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.20 MR. FARLEY: Yes. The exigent circumstances21 is a reasonable belief based upon the totality of the22 surrounding circumstances. Here, given that the23 officers had a reasonable belief that they were chasing24 a fleeing felon, they had a reasonable belief that this25 was the doorway he had entered, then you couple that So, you have to suspect10￼ - Subject to Final Review111 with the noises that they heard, they testified were2 based on their training -­3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May -­4 MR. FARLEY: -- and experience -­5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May we just go back6 over -- you're putting in the fleeing felon, but as far7 as I understand from this record, it was never shown8 that the dealer that the police were following was aware9 that he was following and that he was fleeing from them.10 This is the -- it's not part of the question you11 presented, because we granted only on the exigent12 circumstances, but I didn't think that there was -- the13 dealer wasn't called, and he wasn't asked did you even14 know that the police were following you?15 MR. FARLEY: That -- that's correct, Justice16 Ginsburg. However -- and we cannot divorce the17 officers' chase of this suspect, regardless of whether18 he knew of their hot pursuit or not, we cannot divorce19 those facts from what the officers knew when they20 knocked on the door.21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure, you can.22 There's nothing illegal about walking down the hall and23 knocking on somebody's door. And if as a police officer24 you say I smell marijuana, and then you hear the25 flushing, then there's probable cause. You don't need ￼ - Subject to Final Review121 any business about the dealer and the breezeway and all2 that at all.3 MR. FARLEY: Certainly. Certainly, Mr.4 Chief Justice. You're absolutely correct. I was -- I5 was just speaking in terms of this case, saying that6 there were -- there was ample evidence that exigent7 circumstances existed here, coupled with the probable8 cause.9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask a question -­10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And in your view -­11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask a question that12 goes back to what you said? You have clarified very13 nicely that there has to be probable cause to think that14 there's something wrong going on in the -- the15 apartment. And you said that is, at that point when16 they -- the marijuana -- a strong smell comes from the17 door, at that point the police could go and get a18 warrant. Then they don't have to, because then they19 knock on the door.20 We start out with a strong presumption that21 the Fourth Amendment requires a warrant, a strong22 preference for getting the warrant. So why in this23 situation wouldn't the first response of the police24 be -- instead of knocking, because once they knock they25 alert the people in there: Let's get a warrant; we'll ￼ - Subject to Final Review1 come back. 23 under these4 were in hot5 were at the6 apartment and was aware of their presence and was7 destroying evidence of his deal of crack cocaine, so8 this is a fluid, evolving -­MR. FARLEY: Well, the officers testified circumstances that they believed that they pursuit of this felon. So at the time they door, they believed he had entered this910 -- how does11 warrantless12 knock on the door, suspect doesn't answer it, gets up13 and moves to their bedroom. Because there's no noise14 that was described by this police officer. It was15 simply not answering the door and moving. So if that's16 all it takes, any police officer will come in and say:17 In my experience, most drug dealers destroy the evidence18 when we knock.19 MR. FARLEY: Well -­20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Aren't we just doing21 away with Johnson? And aren't we just simply saying22 they can just walk in whenever they smell marijuana,23 whenever they think there's drugs on the other side?24 Why do we even bother giving them a -- a warrant?25 MR. FARLEY: Well, I would disagree with JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, how does this this holding by us not become a simple entry in any drug case? Meaning: Police13￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425you. I think that when determining whether an exigent circumstance exists, you look at the totality of the circumstances. So -- and there would be a myriad of cases in which a court would determine that, simply based upon the testimony or the noises that were heard, with no surrounding circumstances, that exigent circumstances may not have existed.JUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if the defendants here had not flushed the evidence down but had answered the door and said "Yes?"?(Laughter.)JUSTICE SCALIA: Would the policemen have been able to do anything just because they had smelled marijuana?MR. FARLEY: They could have sought a consensual encounter with the occupant.JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, yes, but they'd say: Oh, heck, no, you can't come in -­MR. FARLEY: Well, then -­JUSTICE SCALIA: -- do you have a warrant? MR. FARLEY: Then the officers would nothave been able to force entry.JUSTICE SCALIA: So basically the -- thepolice were taking advantage of the stupidity of thecriminals; is that right? - Subject to Final Review14￼ - Subject to Final Review151 MR. FARLEY: Well, I don't know about -­2 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's terrible. That's3 not fair, is it?4 MR. FARLEY: I don't know that I would5 phrase it -- there is no -- there is not a requirement6 to inform an occupant of a right to denial. However,7 the officers could not have forced their way into the8 home. That would have made this a case like Johnson.910 simply knocked, said "We're going to kick the door in if11 you don't open it"?12 MR. FARLEY: I believe that's still fine13 under a lawfulness test, unless the occupant of the home14 submits to that show of authority and comes to the door15 and allows entry. Now, if that -­16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, after -- after17 they've heard the -- the movement inside or the flushing18 or whatever. You can't just kick it in because you've19 smelled marijuana. You -- can you do it, because you -­20 you knock on the door because you smell marijuana,21 nobody answers, and you kick the door in?22 MR. FARLEY: Well, I believe that the noises23 that they heard were consistent with destruction of24 physical evidence based upon their training and25 experience.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What if the officers had￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but without that noise. Just -­MR. FARLEY: Then, no. No.JUSTICE SCALIA: No, of course not.MR. FARLEY: No, of course not. They wouldhave to obtain a warrant at that point. If the person came to the door and denied them consent, they would have to obtain a warrant. If the person did not come to the door and made -- no exigency arose, then the officers would still have to go and obtain a warrant -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- this may be a bit rudimentary, but can you tell me why isn't the evidence always being destroyed when the marijuana is being smoked? Isn't it being burnt up?(Laughter.)MR. FARLEY: I -- Justice Kennedy, I -- I would tend to -- I would tend to agree with you.However, I know this Court in Johnson stated that the smell of burning opium was not the destruction of evidence, and the only thing they could have obtained would have been the fumes or the vapors. I tend to agree -- disagree with that personally. However, from a legal viewpoint, the simple smell of burning marijuana is not -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: So the distinction is - Subject to Final Review16￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425being destroyed as opposed to being consumed?MR. FARLEY: Correct, that is -- that iscorrect.JUSTICE GINSBURG: And how is it -- you mention Johnson.MR. FARLEY: Yes.JUSTICE GINSBURG: And I think the other side says it was the same thing except it was a hotel room instead of an apartment building. The police smell -- in that case, it was -- what was it?MR. FARLEY: Well, what occurred in Johnson, I believe, is -- is completely different than what occurred here. What occurred in Johnson was the officers forced their way into the occupant's apartment -- the occupant's hotel room and then said: Consider yourself under arrest.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Didn't they smell marijuana or opium or something?MR. FARLEY: Well, they did, and they knocked on the door, and she came to the door andthey -- they forced their way in. There was no -- there was no "let us in," there was no demand for entry, there was no even ask-for consent to enter. They then said: Consider yourself under arrest. They searched, and thenheld her under arrest based upon the evidence that they - Subject to Final Review17￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425obtained.JUSTICE GINSBURG: You left out one thing. I thought they heard ruffling noises before theyattempted to get into the apartment -- into the hotel room. There was something about noises.MR. FARLEY: Well, I believe they heard sounds when they knocked on the door. But she actually came to the door, and then the officers forced entry. Here we don't have that. We have no forced entry. These are two different circumstances. In Johnson, an exigency did not exist. Here an exigency does exist.If there are no further questions, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time. - Subject to Final Review18￼Farley.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.MR.

Although securing a warrant -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you -- does a ruling in this case that any lawful conduct by the police mean that the police knock, somebody gets up on the other side and walks through a closed door, and closes a door in the back, and police say, "In my experience it's -- it's consistent with the destruction of property that drug dealers will go into a closed room to get rid of it" -- is that enough?MS. O'CONNELL: I don't think so, Justice Sotomayor. I think that in any case -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why not? I mean people -- you know, when there's a knock on -- on the door, is the normal human reaction to walk into the other room and shut the door?MS. O'CONNELL: Well, a person might not -­JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that's peculiar behavior, isn't it?MS. O'CONNELL: A person doesn't have to answer the door. A person might come to the door; they might also ignore whoever is at the door. Both of those options are fine.JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that a common - Subject to Final Review19￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314151617181920212223242520experience, that you knock on a door and all you hear is somebody walking out of the room and shutting a door?MS. O'CONNELL: I mean, I -- I guess that a person is entitled to do that.JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't recall it ever happening to me, but maybe -- maybe I'm a likable fellow and people open the door.(Laughter.)MS. O'CONNELL: I mean, I think that that -­ that's certainly a lawful option that somebody has when the police officers knock at their door. And, certainly, in this case -­JUSTICE SCALIA: They could say "Go away." They could do a lot of stuff. But walk in the other room and shut the door?MS. O'CONNELL: That's -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Strange.MS. O'CONNELL: I guess some people might dothat if they don't want to give consent to police entry. I think that in order to go in, based on an exigent circumstance, the police would have to be able to articulate to a court that they objectively, reasonably believed that there was destruction of evidence occurring inside.JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what was that here? - Subject to Final Review￼ - Subject to Final Review211 Because it was kind of vague. They heard movement.2 What kind -- what kind of movement? It didn't -- it3 said nothing about a toilet flushing -­4 MS. O'CONNELL: Justice Ginsburg, it's our5 position that the Court should assume that there was an6 exigency in 78 argued that9 The Court nonetheless granted cert on the question ofthis case.In the Respondent's brief in opposition, he there was insufficient evidence of exigency.10 whether a police-created exigency would be okay under11 the Fourth Amendment. The Solicitor General believes12 that the Court should assume there was an exigency, and13 if it agrees with Kentucky on the question presented and14 then reverses, it should remand to the Kentucky Supreme15 Court for a determination of whether an exigency16 existed.17 The trial court in this case certainly found18 that the movement inside of the apartment was enough for19 the officer to reasonably conclude that somebody inside20 was destroying evidence. The Kentucky Supreme Court21 assumed that that was so in order to reach the question22 presented in this case that the Court granted cert on.23 JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. O'Connell, if I could24 ask you about the government's proposed standard: You25 say that as long as each step in the police conduct is ￼ - Subject to Final Review221 lawful, that's sufficient. And each step would -- the2 way the Fourth Amendment works, each step -- we're3 asking, essentially, whether each step is reasonable.4 What some courts have done, in addition to5 that -- and this was not the approach of the court6 below -- but what some courts have done is to say we7 also ask a more holistic reasonableness question. We8 say: Is the whole process by which the police operated9 with respect to this person reasonable? So, for10 example, we might say, you know, was there time to get a11 warrant, or did it look like the police were just -­12 they preferred not to have to deal with a magistrate?13 So what's wrong with that sort of standard?14 In addition to asking whether each step is reasonable,15 to say, look, is the whole pattern here of what the16 police did to come up with this evidence reasonable?17 MS. O'CONNELL: I think the problem with18 that test, Justice Kagan, is that police officers have19 options of how they can conduct searches and seizures.20 Getting a warrant is one way that they could do that.21 Getting consent to conduct a search or a seizure is22 another way. There's no justification in this Court's23 precedents for requiring police officers to choose one24 of those options over another if both options are25 lawful.￼ - Subject to Final Review231 In this case, the police officers knocked on2 the door, not sure which apartment the person that they3 were pursuing fled into, in order to determine whether4 that was the correct apartment. There's no reason why5 they needed to get a warrant before knocking on the door6 and seeking cooperation of the people inside.7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it your position that8 the police can do anything that's lawful, even if the9 purpose of doing so is to create exigent circumstances?10 MS. O'CONNELL: Yes, I think that under this11 Court -- the way that this Court has interpreted Fourth12 Amendment warrant exceptions, as long as there is no13 violation of the Fourth Amendment, that is okay. The14 police officers can rely on any ensuing exigency.15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the question16 presented in the blue brief used the word17 "impermissible," and we're talking about "unlawful." I18 take it that there is a difference in those -- or no19 difference?20 MS. O'CONNELL: Well, yes, there is a21 difference. I think that that comes up in Respondent's22 argument that if there was an impermissible demand for23 entry -- for example, if the police officer said "I have24 a warrant, let me in," even though he didn't, as in25 Bumper v. North Carolina -- that that could still be￼ - Subject to Final Review241 okay under a lawfulness test as long as the suspect2 reacted by destroying evidence instead of by coming to3 the door, like in Bumper or Johnson, and going about4 with a -­5 JUSTICE BREYER: What are the objections to6 adding in the alternative "or in bad faith"?7 MS. O'CONNELL: Justice Breyer, the8 objection to that is simply that in all cases that are9 founded upon probable cause that are not programmatic10 searches that are conducted without any individualized11 suspicion, this Court has repeatedly rejected prongs of12 a Fourth Amendment test that -- that rely on the13 subjective assessment -­14 JUSTICE BREYER: Objectively? I mean, what15 we're trying to rule out is they -- they hitch -- they16 get this bright idea, the police: We'll go knock at17 every door. You know. So what about that, objectively18 determined bad faith?19 MS. O'CONNELL: I'm sorry. I don't -­20 JUSTICE BREYER: My point is a solely21 unlawfulness test would allow the police to get into the22 habit of just knocking at every door, but if you say23 that also it has to survive a bad-faith test, where bad24 faith is objectively, not subjectively, determined, then25 you will rule out the possibility of the police ￼ - Subject to Final Review1 hatching -- which I don't know if they would, but2 hatching such a plan.3 MS. O'CONNELL: I guess that it's not4 totally clear what bad faith would mean in this5 context -­6 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, there are circuits7 who have adopted a bad-faith test in the alternative8 with other things than the word "unlawful." The Second9 Circuit uses only the word "unlawful," and I thought we10 took this case to iron out that discrepancy. And if we11 did, I'd like to know your objection to ironing it out12 by taking the Second Circuit test but adding on an13 objectively determined bad-faith rule.14 MS. O'CONNELL: Justice Breyer, I don't -- I15 don't know what it means to act in bad faith in a case16 like this as a police officer.17 JUSTICE ALITO: Maybe it could mean having18 no reason for knocking on the door other than to create19 exigent circumstances.20 MS. O'CONNELL: Well, Justice Alito, I think21 that it would be difficult to determine objectively22 whether that was the case. Certainly -­23 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the police say: Oh,24 I don't want to get a warrant. It's such a bore. We25 have other things to do. I have a great idea; let's25￼ - Subject to Final Review261 knock at the door, and then as soon as he starts moving2 around, I know what his going to the -- going into the3 bathroom means, and we'll hear that, and we'll be able4 to get in.5 MS. O'CONNELL: I think that -­6 JUSTICE BREYER: Hey, great idea.7 Okay? Now suppose that's the record.8 MS. O'CONNELL: I think that there's already9 a significant risk built into the Fourth Amendment that10 police officers, if they knock on the door and they11 don't hear somebody destroying evidence inside, they're12 going to have to leave and get a warrant. I think13 that's enough of a deterrent.14 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't know that they're15 destroying evidence unless you have reason to believe16 that there is contraband inside. I mean, the -- the17 hypothetical is an unrealistic one. They knock on the18 door, and somebody moves inside -- that doesn't give19 them any exigency -­20 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I mean to add:21 And, in fact, there's probable cause.22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. They -­23 JUSTICE BREYER: In addition, he smelled the24 marijuana.

All right. Add that to the hypothetical.JUSTICE SCALIA: There's a hypothetical in which they knock on every door under which they smell marijuana.That's what Iokay? - Subject to Final ReviewJUSTICE BREYER: Correct. mean, and I don't always spell it out. JUSTICE SCALIA: Perfectly MS. O'CONNELL: Right, andI think that there's -- the Court shouldn't be concerned, and27￼certainly shouldn't be concerned enough to adopt a bad-faith or a subjective motivation prong to a test that it creates which is -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what makes that different than knocking on the door and saying "Open the door or I'm going to kick it in"? You're saying that's lawful because until the person submits, you're suggesting there's no coercion in that whatsoever.MS. O'CONNELL: That's true, and, Justice Sotomayor, to be clear -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why wouldn't thatobjectively be bad faith if what we find out is thatthey now have a tactic which is they go through this1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314151617181920212223242528building, and every time they smell marijuana, hash, or -- I don't know if crack cocaine smells or not when they're smoking it -- but whenever they smell something, they just do that.MS. O'CONNELL: I think the -- the fact that if the person actually does what the police officer says and answers the door will mean that the evidence would be excluded as a coerced consent search is enough of a deterrent to that sort of conduct.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So there's no bad-faith measure whatsoever in your analysis -­MS. O'CONNELL: I don't think it'snecessary.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and lawfulness is defined by actual physical seizure.

DRAKEON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT - Subject to Final Review￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MS. DRAKE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:The odor of burnt marijuana, coupled with Officer Cobb's cursory and equivocal testimony about the sounds of movement he couldn't discern exactly and that his training and experience led him only possibly to conclude was consistent with the destruction of evidence, is insufficient to establish exigent circumstances.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Although you're -­ JUSTICE SCALIA: The -- I'm sorry.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're describingwhat you think the evidence was to support exigency, and the suggestion we've heard on the other side is that that's an issue that can be addressed on remand once we, according to the other side, correct the State court's error in that this -- you -- the police cannot create exigent circumstances.So I -- I don't know that it's terribly relevant what the underlying facts about what they heard was. That will be relevant depending, or not -­ depending on what our opinion says.MS. DRAKE: It's relevant because it goes towhether exigent circumstances existed. And as to thequestion of whether a remand would be appropriate in - Subject to Final Review29￼ - Subject to Final Review301 this case, the question of whether exigent circumstances2 existed is logically antecedent in any created exigency3 case.4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, it's -- it's not5 at all. The court said: I don't care whether exigent6 circumstances existed; you cannot create exigent7 circumstances; so I don't care whether they were or not.8 The legal standard is antecedent to the9 application of the facts.10 MS. DRAKE: There's no point in delving into11 whether an exigency was created by the police if there12 is no exigency to begin with.13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I think the14 Court is interested in taking the case on the question15 whether or not the police may create exigent16 circumstances and use those exigent circumstances to17 enter. Now, whether or not there were exigent18 circumstances here because of the sound is -- is, it19 seems to me, a subsidiary question.20 MS. DRAKE: The other problem with remanding21 this case for further determination on this issue is, as22 this Court is aware, the procedural posture of this case23 is troubling. The case has already been dismissed.24 There is no potential for further proceedings here.25 There is no --￼ - Subject to Final Review311 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, sure, there is.2 It was dismissed because the State supreme court held3 you can't bring this evidence in. If we say, oh, yes,4 you can, then the issue becomes live again.5 MS. DRAKE: That conclusion is dependent on6 the notion that an indictment is merged with the7 judgment such that a decision in the Commonwealth's8 favor in this case would vacate the decision of the9 Kentucky Supreme Court, which in turn vacates the10 underlying suppression order. But there is no authority11 for the notion that an indictment and a judgment merge12 as a matter of Kentucky law, and so a decision -­13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is the argument14 you presented to us in the letter, right?￼151617 nonetheless 181920 be -- it's your case, but maybe it would be best to move21 on to the legal issue.22 MS. DRAKE: If we move to the question of23 whether the police have created exigent circumstances,24 it's important that we're all operating on the sameMS. DRAKE: Yes, Your Honor.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And yet, we decided to have argument.MS. DRAKE: Yes, Your Honor.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So maybe it would25 understanding, the facts in this case. This case does - Subject to Final Review321 not involve a simple knock at the door, and -- and the2 distinction is important. In this case, at 9:50 p.m.,3 the officers banged on the door as loudly as they could.4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did the trial court make5 those findings? I know that you said it in your brief,6 and I thought I read the trial court record. I know7 they knocked loudly.8910 do? 1112 appendix to13 carrying on14 Maynard, who was accompanying Officer Cobb in the15 breezeway attempting to locate and arrest the suspect in16 question, banged on the door of the apartment on the17 back left of the breezeway, identifying themselves as18 police officers and demanding that the door be opened by19 persons inside.20 Officer Cobb testified at the suppression21 hearing -- and this is at page 22 of the joint appendix:22 Detective Maynard made contact with the door, announced23 our presence, banged on the door as loud as we could,24 announced "Police, police, police."25 This is not the case where -- MS. DRAKE: Yes.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what else did theyMS. DRAKE: Yes. And this is located at the the petition in the bottom of page 3ato 4a. The trial court found: Detective￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where's -- no "Open up." I thought you said earlier they said "Open up." MS. DRAKE: Yes. Then Officer Cobb latergoes on to explain -- and this is on page 24 of the joint appendix: Detective Maynard with Sergeant Simmons, we explained to them -- referring to the occupants of the apartment -- we were going to make entry inside the apartment.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that after -­ after the exigent circumstances or the alleged exigent circumstances were presented? And that's after they heard what they thought -- and I know you disagree -­ was the destruction of evidence.MS. DRAKE: It's -- it's unclear from the trial court's factual finding what the order of events was. The trial court found: Banged on the door of the apartment, identified themselves as police officers, and -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Loudly. Is any of that unlawful? Is -- is knocking loudly on the doorunlawful?MS. DRAKE: It's unreasonable conduct.JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it -- is it unlawful? Is -- is saying "Open up, police" -- is that unlawful?MS. DRAKE: Well, it's certainly not - Subject to Final Review33￼ - Subject to Final Review341 unlawful in the sense that it violates any provision of2 the penal code. But this is a Fourth Amendment case, so3 the question is whether it's reasonable.4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Drake, the problem I5 have is there are a lot of constraints on -- on law6 enforcement, and the one thing that -- that it has going7 for it is that criminals are stupid.8 (Laughter.)9 JUSTICE SCALIA: And we had a case some10 years ago in which the issue was whether the Washington11 police could enter buses arriving from -- from the south12 and -- and randomly ask passengers, do you mind if we13 look in your luggage? And the -- the -- the mules who14 were carrying marijuana were stupid enough to say, oh,15 of course. Just to show that they had nothing to fear.16 And an enormous number of arrests were -- were effected17 in that fashion.18 We didn't say that's not fair because you're19 taking advantage of the -- of the ignorance of these -­20 these poor criminals. We said that's perfectly okay.21 And it seems to me the same thing is going on here.22 These people could have answered the door -­23 there's a policeman knocking on the door; all he's24 saying is "Open the door, open the door" -- and say25 "Yes, what do you want?" Say -- you know, blah, blah,￼ - Subject to Final Review351 blah. They say "Well, get a warrant." Shut the door.2 They didn't do that. But everything done3 was perfectly lawful. It's unfair to the criminal? Is4 that -- is that the problem? I really don't understand5 the problem.6 MS. DRAKE: I have two responses to Your7 Honor's question. The first is that -- and along with8 this notion that criminals are stupid and so that's why9 we get all these criminal cases, there is no difference10 between what happened in this case and how an innocent11 person would respond.12 Recall Officer Cobb's testimony is simply13 that, after banging, he heard movement. Any innocent14 person at 10:00 at night would have to move in order -­15 JUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you this? It16 might -- it might make a difference to me whether the17 police demanded entry prior to the time when the alleged18 exigent circumstances arose. And the only testimony on19 this point that I am aware of is on pages 22 and 23 of20 the appendix, when police banged on the door as loud as21 they could and announced "Police, police, police," and22 then Detective Maynard banged on the door and said "This23 is the police."24 Now, is there any -- anything more in the25 record? Any evidence that they -- prior to the time ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425when they heard what they allegedly said "Open the door"?MS. DRAKE: The portion Appendix that I quoted to the Court them we were going to make entry --JUSTICE ALITO: Right. MS. DRAKE: So, if Yourreading -­JUSTICE ALITO: It starts -- it says: We knew that there was possibly something that was going to be destroyed inside the apartment. At that point Detective Maynard -- this is after they heard the sounds, after they claim to have heard the sounds.MS. DRAKE: Yes. Officer Cobb's testimony suggests that the demand came after they heard the sound of movement. The finding by the trial court, however, is that this was all happening simultaneously and in very quick fashion.JUSTICE ALITO: Is there any -- is there any evidence of that? Did anybody else testify to what happened?MS. DRAKE: No, Your Honor. Officer Cobb's testimony was -- was all the Commonwealth offered.But the chronology of the demand is notdispositive in this case because the demand itself is - Subject to Final Reviewheard, that theyof the Joint-- we explained to appears on page 24.Honor keeps36￼ - Subject to Final Review371 not dispositive. The demand removes any doubt that the2 officers were not seeking a consensual encounter, but3 you still have the behavior of banging on the door.4 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, does it -- does it5 turn on how loudly they knocked? If they just knock on6 the door and say "This is the police," is -- is that -­7 is there anything wrong with that?8 MS. DRAKE: It -- it depends entirely on9 whether a reasonable person would interpret that10 behavior as the officer conveying the impression that11 entry was imminent and inevitable. And this feeds back12 to Justice Scalia's question, which is, well, what -­13 what is unreasonable about what the officers did here?14 JUSTICE ALITO: What was there here to make15 a reasonable person believe that -- that entry was16 imminent and inevitable, if -- if all that's done is a17 knock on the door and they say "Police, police, police,18 this is the police"? Maybe it turns on how loudly they19 spoke or how loudly they -- they knocked; is that the20 point?21 MS. DRAKE: That is the point. Those are22 all relevant criteria because, in every Fourth Amendment23 case, we're considering the totality of the24 circumstances.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me that ￼ - Subject to Final Review381 you're trying to change the case. I mean, this is not a2 case where they come in and, in effect, demand entry.3 My understanding is that the issue in the case is4 whether or not, after a request for entry, they can then5 base probable cause in dispensing with the warrant based6 on what they hear from behind the door.7 Now, I know you think that they -- whatever8 they hear is perfectly innocent; but the issue is9 whenever they knock on the door, "Police" or "Can we10 come in" or whatever, and then they hear that, the11 activity behind the door, they have reason and can -­12 can enter.13 Now, what you're -- it seems to me what14 you're arguing is, well, they did something else. They15 banged on the door, they yelled "Police"; it wasn't16 simply knocking on the door and seeking entry. And you17 may be right, again, on the facts, but it seems to me18 that's for -- for later on.19 I want to know what your position is on20 whether they can assume, at least for me, they knock and21 say "Can we come in" or knock and say "Police" -- no22 demand to get in.23 MS. DRAKE: If I understand Your Honor's24 question, the officers are engaging in what we would25 call a true "knock and talk." They're seeking -- ￼ - Subject to Final Review391 they're on -- the scenario is such that no one would2 doubt they're attempting a consensual encounter.3 Our position is because that behavior is4 reasonable, it is not made unreasonable by the fact that5 evidence may be destroyed, and so suppression would not6 be the remedy. Well, then, here -­7 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So you agree8 that -- that the court below is wrong because what they9 say, as I read it, is irrespective of how reasonably the10 police behave, if it is reasonably foreseeable that11 their tactic will create exigent circumstances -- and I12 would think it's reasonably foreseeable, when you knock13 on the door very politely and say "The police," that14 somebody might shout out "Hide the pot"; all right?15 (Laughter.)16 JUSTICE BREYER: That if that's reasonable17 foreseeable, says the court, then that violates the18 Fourth Amendment. But we have the Second Circuit that19 says as long as the police behaved unlawfully, it -­20 lawfully, lawfully -- it does not violate the Fourth21 Amendment; and we have the First Circuit that has some22 kind of bad-faith test plus an unreasonable or improper23 test; and we have the Fourth and Eighth circuits that24 yet have some different kind of test.25 And one of the things I'd be interested in ￼ - Subject to Final Review401 hearing your view on at some point is just what the2 Chief Justice said, that assuming from your point of3 view this is a hypothetical case, nonetheless we would4 like your view on which of those tests or some other5 test is the appropriate test and why. That was the6 question he started with and Justice Kennedy started7 with, and I'd also be interested in your view on that.8 MS. DRAKE: The appropriate test is the test9 that we propose. Under our test, the police act10 unreasonably when they convey the impression to an -- to11 a reasonable person that entry is imminent and12 inevitable. Our test follows directly from the Fourth13 Amendment requirement that people in their homes deserve14 precision.15 By conveying the impression that entry is16 imminent and inevitable, the police are -- and they17 don't have judicial authority for doing that -- there -­18 there's no warrant -- they are engaging in behavior that￼19 would confuse an ordinary citizen and make him20 uncertain about whether the assertion of right21 privacy and security in the home -­22 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Ms. Drake if23 the case, in some way you're agreeing with the24 Government. You, too, are saying that -- thator her tothat's there's a25 lawfulness test. You're just disagreeing about what's  - Subject to Final Review411 lawful.2 MS. DRAKE: And to the extent that "lawful"3 is defined as a synonym for "unreasonable" and to the4 extent that there does not need to be a completed5 antecedent Fourth Amendment violation, we would agree.6 There is area of agreement between the Commonwealth and7 I, and it is on the issue of this "knock and talk." Of8 course, police officers need to have the investigative9 tool of a knock and talk. There's nothing wrong with an10 officer attempting to gain consensual entry. And our11 position is that that's not made unreasonable by factors12 outside the officer's control, no matter how13 foreseeable.14 JUSTICE ALITO: So what took this outside of15 the category of the ordinary knock and talk?16 MS. DRAKE: This is not a knock and a -­17 knock and talk case; this is a knock and announce case18 or a knock and demand case, which is how the trial court19 characterized it. And the staff -­￼2021 labels, but22 went beyond23 understanding of a pure knock and talk? It's -- it's24 the volume of the -- of the knocking?JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I don't know about the what did they -- what did the police do that what would be permitted under your25 MS. DRAKE: Yes, it's the -- it's the 6 person, or that you would expect7 attempting to gain consensual -­8 JUSTICE SCALIA: But9 have considerable support on thefrom an officerI -- you -- you might - Subject to Final Review1 banging, not knocking. It's announcement -­2 JUSTICE ALITO: Banging, not knocking?3 MS. DRAKE: Banging, not a soft -- not the4 knock that you would expect a reasonable person to5 engage in, in the ordinary discourse with anotherCourt for the10 proposition that if the exigent circumstance is created11 by unlawful activity by the police, which would include12 conveying the impression that they are about to kick the13 door in, then -- then you have a different case. But -­14 but I thought the case we had before us is what if the15 police officers are behaving perfectly lawfully and16 they're not threatening to kick down the door, and they17 smelled the marijuana and then they hear the motion18 inside, does that justify their going in?19 And that's what I thought we took the case20 for, and that's a different question. You're trying to21 -- you're trying to make the police officers' actions22 unlawful, and I will stipulate that if their actions23 were unlawful you have a different case, and probably24 the evidence would have to be suppressed, but I didn't25 think we were here to decide that, whether they knocked 42￼ - Subject to Final Review431 too loud, whether they threatened to kick in the door.2 The opinion below says if they created the exigent3 circumstances, whether they did so lawfully or4 unlawfully,5 issue.67 case is the8 to kick in the door." Now, I wouldn't go that -- that9 far, but it -- it's the functional equivalent of a knock10 and announce, which is exactly the behavior the police11 engage in when they are executing a warrant. And it is12 that behavior that conveys the impression that an13 occupant has no authority to keep the officers at arm's14 length.15 JUSTICE SCALIA: That wasn't the basis for16 the decision below, though. The court below didn't say17 these police officers were behaving as though they had a18 warrant and were about to kick in the door. The opinion19 below just said, yes, there were exigent circumstances,20 but they were the result of the police knocking on the21 door and saying "We're the police."22 MS. DRAKE: I don't disagree that the lower23 court did not analyze the problem in this fashion, did24 not analyze the question in this fashion, but it's a25 legal question that calls for an examination of how athey cannot go in. And that's, that's theMS. DRAKE: What the officers did in this functional equivalent of saying "We're going￼ - Subject to Final Review441 reasonable person would interpret the behavior, and2 so-­3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what does that have4 to do with the -- the police officers' lawfulness? Now,5 I -- I grant you that attempting -- that there is6 something troubling about the police attempting to7 coerce entry as opposed to requesting entry, but as my8 colleagues have pointed out, it's not clear from this9 record which of the two the police did, in a loud voice10 or not.11 You're saying just a loud knock, a scream,12 "Police," that that would be coercive? That's how I'm13 reading you.14 MS. DRAKE: I -­15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or -- or are you going16 further and trying to say that, as a matter of fact, the17 testimony's critically clear that they knocked loudly,18 said "Police," and said "Let us in or we're going to19 bust it"?20 MS. DRAKE: The factual record is clear.21 The -- Officer Cobb testified he banged as loud as22 possible. This is -- this not the normal knock that an23 officer engages in when he's seeking consensual -­24 consent, you know, consent to search, and this is at25 10:00 at night. He's saying we announced "Police, ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425police, police!" -- exclamation point. That -- that's how it appears in the record. Again -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So just assume, for my sake, that the police comes to the door. It's not 10:00 at night; it's, you know, 6:00 at night. Knocks quietly on the door and says "We're the police. Can we talk?" And then there was the smell of marijuana. And then he hears the sounds that do convey to a reasonable police officer that evidence is being destroyed. At that point can they enter without a warrant?MS. DRAKE: Yes.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.JUSTICE BREYER: But you said -- just add onto that. Look, the question presented that they raised: Which of the five tests currently being used by the U.S. court of appeals is proper? Now, you've said something about your view on that, but I'd like you to say anything else you'd like to say about that, which of the five tests, or some sixth test if you like, and you tell me the words that you would like us to use when we answer that question.MS. DRAKE: I would like this Court to adopt the test that we have proposed.JUSTICE BREYER: Which is?MS. DRAKE: Which is that an officer acts - Subject to Final Review45￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425unreasonably when he or she conveys the impression that entry into a home is imminent and inevitable.JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. But the test you're using there, the key word is "unreasonable."MS. DRAKE: Yes, Your Honor.JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. And the reason you choose the word "unreasonable" rather than the Second Circuit's test of "unlawful" is?MS. DRAKE: Because, frankly, I'm not sure what that means, and I think that's become clear in the context of this briefing. Does "unlawful" mean the police have had to violate a portion of the penal code? Does "unlawful" mean, as the Commonwealth is contending, that there has to be a completed Fourth Amendment violation -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You know -- you don't know what -­MS. DRAKE: -- the seizure went forward.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't know what "unlawful" means, but you know what "unreasonable" means.MS. DRAKE: Yes. Unreasonable is the touchstone of every, you know, Fourth Amendment case, and so we're saying there does not have to be anantecedent completed Fourth Amendment violation. The - Subject to Final Review46￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425question is, as is the case in every Fourth Amendment case, did the officers act -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have any doubt that it's unlawful for a police officer to threaten to burst into a home?MS. DRAKE: No, Your Honor.JUSTICE SCALIA: So why do you need unreasonable? If, indeed, there -- there was a threat of imminent entry -- we're going to bust down the -- if that was the threat, then it's unlawful, surely.MS. DRAKE: Yes, and that's why my answer to Justice Kagan's question was to the extent that"unlawful" and "unreasonable" are synonyms, we would agree.Now, if the Court is not terribly -- does not find our test convincing, the next-best test, we believe, is a foreseeability test.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is your test is something novel? I mean, Justice Breyer mentioned that there are some five tests in the different circuits, and the foreseeability test is the one that the Kentucky Supreme Court used, but is your -- does your test coincide with the tests of any other circuits, or is it different?MS. DRAKE: Our test is a novel test. Ithas not been, to my knowledge, considered by any of the - Subject to Final Review47￼ - Subject to Final Review481 other circuits.2 JUSTICE BREYER: But your test is -- I mean,3 it's not wild. It just says it says "unreasonable" in4 the Fourth Amendment. Probably when they act lawfully,5 they are acting reasonably and not unreasonably, but it6 could be sometimes they're not. That's your view?7 MS. DRAKE: That's correct, and by the8 way-­9 JUSTICE BREYER: No test. All right.10 MS. DRAKE: -- we're not saying that -­11 we're essentially saying the police shouldn't act as12 though they have a warrant when they don't have one,13 which is exactly what they did in this case. And that14 proposition is not new. In Bumper, this Court made15 clear that if the police act as though they have a16 warrant when they don't have one, any consent would be17 coerced.18 So reviewing courts are already making these19 determinations about how loud was the knock and how20 aggressive was the demand, simply in another context.21 And by the other -- on the other hand, police officers22 are already receiving the same instruction that they23 would need in order to apply our rule, which is, don't24 act as though you have a warrant. Don't engage in the25 functional equivalent of a knock and announce if you do ￼ - Subject to Final Review491 not have prior judicial authority.2 And what is appealing about our test, unlike3 the foreseeability test, which we believe it's a4 refinement of, is it allows for conduct by the police5 that's reasonable at its inception to remain reasonable6 regardless of the suspect's response, no matter how7 foreseeable.8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is -- what is9 an example of conduct that you would consider10 unreasonable resulting in suppression of the evidence11 that would not be unlawful?12 MS. DRAKE: Well, it's very hard -- it's13 very hard to conceive of where the daylight would be -­14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.15 MS. DRAKE: -- between those terms,16 "reasonable" and "unlawful," so long as "unlawful"17 doesn't mean violation of a penal code provision and so18 long as it doesn't mean, as the Commonwealth is19 suggesting, that there has to be -- that the defendant20 would have to first demonstrate that the police were21 seized in order to be able to convincingly argue that22 the search was unreasonable.23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you can't -­24 can't give me one example of some conduct that's25 unreasonable under your test that would not be unlawful? ￼ - Subject to Final Review501 MS. DRAKE: I can't -- I can't think of one,2 Your Honor.3 JUSTICE SCALIA: The problem is that as4 reasonable as the test is, it's not the test that was5 used by the court below, and you want us to affirm the6 decision below, which simply said if the exigent7 circumstances are -- are the consequence of the police8 action, whatever the police action was -- lawful,9 reasonable, whatever -- the evidence has to be excluded.10 How can we affirm that decision as you want11 us to do, even -- even applying your test?12 MS. DRAKE: Well, the factual record in this13 case is fully developed, and how a reasonable person14 would interpret the scenario is a mixed question of law15 and fact, which -- this Court would review the decision16 of the Kentucky Supreme Court in that regard de novo17 anyway. In that regard, it's no different than any18 other case that makes its way to this Court where this19 Court is asked to review the record, make a20 determination of how an ordinary person would interpret21 the officers' conduct.22 It is simply unreasonable and unlawful for23 purposes of the Fourth Amendment for an officer to24 convey the impression that he has the authority of a25 warrant when he doesn't have one and when that prompts,￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314151617181920212223242551as it obviously would, an occupant of a home to move, and then that movement is used as evidence that exigent circumstances exist and warrantless search is justified. If this Court were to, you know, adopt the framework the Commonwealth is arguing for, the exception to the warrant requirement would be the rule.So we would ask this Court to affirm the decision of the Kentucky Supreme Court.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.Mr. Farley, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA D. FARLEYON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. FARLEY: My time is short, so I wouldjust like to make a few quick points.I believe Mr. Chief Justice and JusticeKennedy were absolutely, absolutely correct. The question before this Court is: Can lawful police action impermissibly create exigent circumstances? And the answer to that question is no.There is never a circumstance in which lawful police behavior under a Fourth Amendment analysis can impermissibly create an exigency. I would point the Court to Hodari D., which I believe Justice Scalia wrote for the Court, that we should not punish police officersfor attempted Fourth Amendment violations or Fourth - Subject to Final Review￼ - Subject to Final Review521 Amendment violations that do not reach fruition, because2 it does not serve the point of the exclusionary rule.3 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Farley, one of the4 points of the Fourth Amendment is to ensure that when5 people search your home, they have a warrant. And, of6 course, there are exceptions to that. But if there is7 one place where the warrant requirement has real force,8 it's in the home.9 And I think that the concern here -- and you10 have some strong arguments on your side, but the concern11 here is that your test is going to enable the police to12 penetrate the home, to search the home, without a13 warrant, without going to see a magistrate, in a very14 wide variety of cases, that all the police really have15 to say is: We saw pot, we heard noise. Or: We think16 there was some criminal activity going on for whatever17 reason, and we heard noise.18 How do you prevent that from happening? How19 do you prevent your test from essentially eviscerating20 the warrant requirement in the context of the one place21 that the Fourth Amendment was most concerned about?22 MR. FARLEY: Well, Justice Kagan, I would23 disagree with you. I don't think that it would. I24 believe that what the Commonwealth is asking for is no25 more or no less than reviewing courts have done for￼ - Subject to Final Review531 generations. You look to determine whether there was a2 Fourth Amendment violation, whether there was an3 unlawful entry, whether there was an unlawful seizure,4 or whether there was a coercion that then they gained5 consent for entry.6 If those things occurred, they are clearly7 Fourth Amendment violations. There should be a8 suppression of the evidence. The exigent9 circumstances -­10 JUSTICE SCALIA: It wouldn't technically be11 a Fourth Amendment violation, would it, if the police12 gave the impression that they had a warrant and were13 about to kick in the door? Is that a Fourth Amendment14 violation in and of itself?15 MR. FARLEY: I don't believe so.16 JUSTICE SCALIA: So your -- the -- the17 unlawfulness test would not prevent that then?18 MR. FARLEY: No, Justice Scalia, it would19 not.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: It would not prevent it?21 MR. FARLEY: It would not prevent -­22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, whoa. Maybe we have to23 come up with an unreasonable test, then.24 MR. FARLEY: Well, I believe, under25 Hodari D., if the officers demand entry and there is no ￼ - Subject to Final Review1 response to that demand, there is no -- been no2 completion of the Fourth Amendment violation. The3 officers could stand outside the door -­45 officers to6 warrant and7 that's perfectly okay?8 MR. FARLEY: Well, I believe that there are9 -- there are large restrictions and prohibitions to10 that, that officers are well aware of, because if the11 person does answer the door, the officers know, well,12 everything is going to be suppressed. Or if the13 officers do -­14 JUSTICE SCALIA: But why? You say that what15 they've done is not unlawful. Why would it be16 suppressed?17 MR. FARLEY: Well, if they demand entry and18 entry is given, that is then a Fourth Amendment19 violation, because they've demanded entry without a20 warrant. And in that case, suppression -- once they21 have entry, the evidence would be suppressed.22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they can't gain23 entry by deception. They can't knock on the door and24 say "Pizza"; right?25 (Laughter.)JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, it's perfectly okay for do that? To pretend that they have a"Open the door or we'll kick it in" -­54￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314151617181920212223242555MR. FARLEY: No.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no? Okay.MR. FARLEY: We would just assert that underthe lawfulness test, we aren't asking for anything more or less than this Court has done or other reviewing courts have done for generations, and this is a simple Fourth Amendment analysis.There was no demand in this case. This was a simple knock-and-announce case, regardless of the time of day. There was no coercion. There was no seizure. There was no consent given. Officers should not be held accountable for unlawful reactions by suspects.Thank you very much.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. You will have noticed that Justice Kennedyleft the bench a few minutes early. He is going to Tucson to represent the Court as the Circuit Justice for the Ninth Circuit at the memorial service there. He will review the tapes and transcripts of the rest of the argument and fully participate in the decision.This case is submitted.(Whereupon, at 11:58 a.m., the case in the above-entitled matter was submitted.) -
