KASNER                 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER          MR. KASNER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          In an effort to limit State-law securitiesclass-actions which undermine the market for nationallytraded securities, Congress enacted SLUSA, a statute ofbroad preemption.  SLUSA, which is reprinted at page 8(a)of Petitioner's blue brief, preempts, subject to threespecific statutory extensions, all State-law-covered classactions, quote, "by any private party who allegesmisrepresentations, omissions, or fraudulent behavior inconnection with the purchase or sale of a coveredsecurity."  The Second Circuit erred in implying anexception, that nowhere appears in the statutory language,and is wholly at odds with the purpose in the enactment ofthe statute for holders claims, a type of claim in which aplaintiff alleges, "I did not purchase" or "I did notsell, but would have, had I known the allegedly false31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 information," a type of claim which this Court, in Blue2 Chip Stamps, over 30 years ago, recognized as the most3 vexatious and abusive type of securities class-action4 claims.5 The court below erred, for a number of different6 reasons. First and foremost, it completely violated the7 natural meaning of the statute. As I have mentioned, an8 examination of SLUSA, beginning at page 8(a), reflects9 that no covered class action may be maintained, quote, "by10 any private party," a clause that this Court, time and11 again, has interpreted as perhaps the broadest way of12 phrasing "any and all private parties" making certain13 types of allegations. Those allegations appear in (a) or14 (b), focusing on the conduct of the defendant in15 connection with the purchase or sale of a covered16 security.17 Now, Congress could have -- had it intended to18 inject a purchaser/seller limitation, consistent with what19 the court below concluded, Congress could have phrased20 that language differently. As the Court is aware, in the21 both the 1933 and 1934 acts, Congress has made express22 causes of action, subject to an explicit purchase or23 seller requirement. For example, section 11 of the '3324 act affords a private right of action to purchasers of25 securities in registered offerings. Section 12 affords a41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 private right of action to persons from whom an offer or2 sale of securities. Section 9(e) of the '34 act,3 similarly, affords a purchase or seller requirement.4 Significantly, SLUSA nowhere speaks in terms of5 a purchase or sale. And it could have. For example,6 Congress could have provided that no covered class action7 by any private party alleging "his or her sale" of a8 covered security is preempted. It could have said, "Any9 private party alleging a misrepresentation or omission of10 a material fact in connection with the plaintiff or that11 party's purchase or sale." It did not.12 The decision of the court below is also at odds13 with this Court's teaching in United States versus14 O'Hagan, which was decided 1 year before SLUSA was enacted15 by Congress. In United States versus O'Hagan, this Court16 concluded that the so-called "misappropriation theory"17 stated a viable claim in a criminal case brought by the18 United States Government. In responding to an argument by19 the defendant that no one involved that had been defrauded20 purchased or --21 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just ask you this22 question about the plain language? If the word in23 1(f)(1)(A) had not been "in connection with the purchase24 of sale -- sale of security," had been "in connection with25 his or her purchase or sale," then it would have been51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 covered, would it not?2 MR. KASNER:3 her," it's referencing4 with that. That would5 JUSTICE STEVENS: So, the question is whether we6 should construe the word "the" to be the functional7 equivalent of "his or her."89 1011 that that12 number of13 versus O'Hagan, this Court concluded that the "in14 connection with the purchase or sale of a security" does15 not mean "in connection with the purchase or sale by16 another party to the securities transaction," but, rather,17 means "in connection with the purchase or sale by anyone."18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kasner, the -- does the19 Securities and Exchange Commission have enforcement20 authority in this -- in this area?21 MR. KASNER: It does, Justice Scalia.22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Have they issued any rules or23 regulations on this -- on this point?24 MR. KASNER: The point being, Your Honor,25 whether --61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-Justice Stevens, if, by "his or"any private party," I would agreebe a different case in --MR. KASNER:  In essence, Justice Stevens --JUSTICE STEVENS:  Is that true?MR. KASNER:  -- that's correct.  And I thinkquestion has been answered by this Court, on adifferent occasions.  Again, in United States￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: On the point that you're2 arguing, whether the critical language means the person's3 own sale, or not --4 MR. KASNER: Yes, Your Honor. In adjudicatory5 proceedings referenced in our brief, the SEC has6 unanimously, and uniformly, taken the position that it7 does not. In briefs to this Court in criminal8 prosecutions, in civil prosecutions, the Government has9 consistently taken the position, as it has in this case,10 as an amicus, and as it did in the court below.11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it your position that we owe12 deference to the interpretation of the SEC?13 MR. KASNER: That is our position, Your Honor.14 We do take the position that this Court should defer to15 the views of the SEC on that issue. What that deference16 is, should it be Chevron or Skidmore, is not a question17 Your Honor has asked. I'm happy to say that we believe,18 vis-a-vis 10(b)(5) --19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if it's just Skidmore,20 forget about it.21 22 2324 carefully25 discussed71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-[Laughter.]JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, that's --MR. KASNER:  Well, Your Honor, I actuallystudied yesterday's opinion, where this Courtthe Skidmore deference, and, either way, we￼1 think that this is -- the statute is so clear that,2 deference or none, there really is no other way to read3 the language of the statute.4 As I say, this Court, in United States versus5 O'Hagan, concluded squarely that this language does not6 mean the purchase or sale of the plaintiff's securities.7 Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion, joined in by8 Justice Stevens, in the Holmes case makes that same point.9 Significantly, Your Honors, the "in connection with"10 language, as a statutory matter, has consistently been11 construed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and12 by this Court, as one of incredible breadth. Most13 recently, in United States versus Zandford, this Court14 concluded that the "in connection with the purchase or15 sale" language means anything that coincides with a16 securities transaction. And what is significant in this17 case -- it is conceded by the Respondent at page 8 of his18 brief -- that the conduct alleged by the plaintiff below19 is in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.20 There really can be no other conclusion. At myriad21 paragraphs in the pleadings, appearing, among others, at22 joint appendix 53, paragraph 4; joint appendix 53(a),23 paragraph 2425 interrupt5; joint appendix 59 to 60 --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Kasner, may I justthose references to ask you -- one could agree81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that, for SEC-enforcement purposes, for prosecutorial2 purposes, the "in connection with" is as broad as you3 suggest. But for purposes of private actions, it isn't4 that broad; it is limited, as this Court said in Blue Chip5 Stamps. It is possible for the same words, even in the6 same statute, in difference contexts, to mean different7 things.8 MR. KASNER: Justice Ginsburg, I believe that9 this Court has answered Your Honor's question in the Blue10 Chip Stamp case, where it specifically rejected that sort11 of an approach, and the one that was consistent with the12 court below. What the Court, in Blue Chip Stamp -- which,13 of course, was a civil case involving an alleged holder's14 claim was a class action -- what this Court said, for15 purposes of a civil proceeding, is, "purchase or seller16 requirement nowhere appears in the statutory language."17 The statute clearly says "in connection with the purchase18 or sale of securities." But, as a statutory matter, this19 Court concluded, Your Honor, that a violation of 10(b)(5)20 had been alleged, notwithstanding going on to conclude21 that the plaintiff could not recover, as a matter of22 private cause of action.23 So, we understand -- we believe, Your Honor,24 that it -- and it is undisputed on this record -- that all25 parties agree, as the court below concluded, that this --91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 Congress intended to impart 10(b)(5) interpretation as a2 statutory matter into SLUSA. We also think, Justice3 Ginsburg, that, were Your Honors to conclude that somehow4 "in connection with" means something different in a civil5 context, a narrower reading than in the broader context,6 that would, of course, violate, in our view, the rule of7 lenity that is applied by this Court. It would also mark8 what we believe to be the first time, insofar as we have9 been able to determine -- and Respondent cites no10 authority to the contrary -- in which the same provisions11 in a statute that have civil and criminal --12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you explain the rule13 of lenity? Because, on criminal, it is as broad as can14 be. I didn't know that there was a rule of lenity that15 applied strictly to civil liability.16 MR. KASNER: Your Honor, we -- and we have cited17 authority, including the Leocal decision of this Court,18 last year, in which, for statutory construction purposes,19 where you have a civil and a criminal statute that has20 both elements to it, the rule of lenity would dictate that21 the narrower reading be the one that is written. So, in22 other words, if this Court were to have concluded, in Blue23 Chip -- excuse me -- in United States versus O'Hagan,24 that, as a criminal matter, the "in connection with"25 language is not tethered to the purchase or sale by a101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 particular party in the case, that is a broader reading2 than the reading that the court below adopted in a civil3 case. And so, what we're urging is that the rule of4 lenity would suggest that, if this Court, in U.S. v.5 O'Hagan, took the view that the "purchase or sale"6 requirement does not apply in a criminal context, that7 should also apply in a civil context,8 reading should not be imparted into a9 you would find in a criminal context.that a narrowercivil context than10 We also --11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But12 want to adopt a narrower reading, though, is, we're13 dealing here with the preemption provision. It's one14 thing to say that, when you're talking about the SEC's15 enforcement powers, you adopt a broad reading; but it's16 quite another thing, when you're talking about displacing17 State law, that you would necessarily adopt the same broad18 reading.19 MR. KASNER: Mr. Chief Justice, I think, in this20 case, there is no other purpose to be served by this21 statute than to preempt. To the extent that embedded in22 Your Honor's question is a question with respect to the23 so-called presumption against preemption, we don't think24 that those concerns, or the concerns to which Your Honor25 just referred, apply in this case, because the statute is111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-one reason you might￼1 clear; there is no ambiguity in the language that Congress2 used, and hence -- and it would have made no sense, Mr.3 Chief Justice, for Congress to have --4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But there's a lot of --5 I think our cases establish that a phrase like "in6 connection with" carries with it a lot of ambiguity. You7 don't know exactly how rigorous the connection has to be.8 I mean, a auto accident by a broker who's leaving his9 office -- he wouldn't be in the office if he weren't10 buying and selling securities. I mean, is that auto11 accident "in connection with the purchase and sales of12 securities"? No. And yet, you know, theoretically it13 could be. It's a -- there's a lot of ambiguity in14 determining how much breadth to give that phrase.15 MR. KASNER: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I16 agree with you that, in terms of deciding, for --17 substantive matter, for purposes of 10(b)(5), "in18 connection with," such as in SEC versus Zandford,19 the outer reaches of the "in connection with" language go20 may well be susceptible of differences of opinion. There21 is no difference of opinion to which there can be any22 disagreement, in this case, about the plain language of23 the preemption, because the conduct -- no matter what the24 conduct is that is involved "in connection with the25 purchase or sale of securities," one thing that is totally121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-would as ahow far￼1 crystal clear, based on this Court's cases and2 congressional purpose, is that the "in connection with the3 purchase or sale" language, as used here, does not4 restrict its application to the purchase or sale by the5 plaintiff such that --6 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but that's a normal7 reading of the words, wouldn't you -- when you say a8 purchase or -- it normally would be "in connection with9 the purchase or sale of securities by the party to the10 litigation." That would be your first take on it. But11 then you say, "Well, we have cases out there that construe12 it a little more narrowly." And is it not somewhat13 unusual -- and I know it's not totally unusual -- for14 Congress to preempt a State cause of action that without15 -- where there is no parallel Federal remedy.16 MR. KASNER: Justice Stevens, one misimpression17 I believe that the court below was under, and I believe is18 perpetuated by Respondent in his amici, this statute does19 not preempt a State-law claim. This is not like the20 cases, for example --21 JUSTICE STEVENS: It just preempts class22 actions.23 MR. KASNER: It preempts class actions. And24 it's significant, because Congress made a policy judgment.25 Originally, as originally introduced in the House, SLUSA131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 would have preempted all State-law securities cases. All2 of them. As the statute wound its way through the House3 and the Senate, it -- and principally in response to4 testimony by the SEC Commissioner5 Hill three separate times on this6 statutory exemptions were put in.7 But it -- getting back,8 behind --Levitt, who went to thelegislation -- specificthough, to the purpose9 JUSTICE STEVENS: In going through that10 legislative history, did you find any evidence that they11 intended to preempt any State-law claims that were not --12 did not have a parallel Federal claim?13 MR. KASNER: Justice Stevens, the --14 JUSTICE STEVENS: Other than the language of the15 statute?16 MR. KASNER: Well, we believe that the --17 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.18 MR. KASNER: -- this inquiry --19 JUSTICE STEVENS: But you --20 MR. KASNER: -- begins and ends --21 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- you brought up the22 legislative history.23 MR. KASNER: Yes.24 JUSTICE STEVENS: So, you're an expert on that25 subject.141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 34 reference5 referenced by the Respondent. And, in that instance, a6 professor from Cornell, Professor Painter, went to the7 Hill, and he said, "If you enact this statute, you are8 going to be closing off claims of people who are not[Laughter.]JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes.MR. KASNER:  Your -- Justice Stevens, the onlyto the purchaser-or-seller issue is one that is9 purchasers or sellers, because those cannot be bought in10 the Federal court."11 But back for a moment, though, to the issue of12 what is not preempted in the policy behind this statute,13 there was another component that Congress was seeking to14 remedy here, and that was the so-called "safe harbor." In15 1995, when Congress enacted the Private Securities16 Litigation Reform Act, one piece of that was an effort to17 encourage public companies to make predictive statements18 publicly. There had been a rash of litigation, at the19 time, against public companies whose predictive statements20 proved false. And so, Congress said, "Wait a minute. We21 will allow you an insulation from liability, if your22 forward statements prove false, if the plaintiff cannot23 allege either that they were made with actual knowledge or24 not accompanied by meaningful cautionary language."25 Another purpose of this statute was to --151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SOUTER: May I interrupt? Because I'm -- MR. KASNER: Yes.JUSTICE SOUTER: -- your time is running out. MR. KASNER: Yes.JUSTICE SOUTER: Is my understanding correct that, on your reading, State class actions of less than 50 parties are also left unpreempted?MR. KASNER: Justice Souter, the definition -- yes. The answer to --JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.MR. KASNER: -- your question is, yes.JUSTICE SOUTER: So --MR. KASNER: The definition --JUSTICE SOUTER: -- individual actions and smallState class actions.MR. KASNER: Individual actions, less than 50people, arbitrations, public enforcement.          And, with that, Mr. Chief Justice, I would liketo reserve the balance of my time.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Kasner. Mr. Hungar.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR        FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERMR. HUNGAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 may it please the Court:2 The fundamental flaw in the Court of Appeals3 analysis is that it requires the phrase "in connection4 with" to be given two different and irreconcilable5 interpretations, depending on the identity of the plaintiff.6 Nothing in the text or history of the securities laws7 justifies that implausible interpretation.8 The Securities and Exchange Commission --9 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Hungar, I just wonder if10 that's correct. Is -- am I not right to say that the word11 "the" had12 would not1314 Stevens, but --15 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, then you don't16 have differing interpretations of "in connection17 You just have to know what the word "the" means.18 MR. HUNGAR: Well, the "in connection"19 not the approach that the Court of Appeals took,20 course, but -- and also, as Mr. Kasner indicated, that21 issue has been dispositively resolved by this Court and22 the Commission in concluding that the purchaser/seller23 rule is not a limitation on the scope of the prohibition24 in section 10(b). And if your interpretation were the one25 that were adopted, that would not be the case.171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-been read to mean "his or her," that argumentapply?MR. HUNGAR:  I think that's correct, Justicehave towith."-- that's of￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: I always thought "the" meant2 "the."3 [Laughter.]4 MR. HUNGAR: Certainly, that would be our5 submission.6 JUSTICE SCALIA: And "his or her" means "his or7 her."8 MR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. And, again --9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but you --10 MR. HUNGAR: -- if it --11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- think it means "any."12 MR. HUNGAR: I'm sorry?13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You think it means14 "any," right? You're reading "the" to mean "any."15 MR. HUNGAR: Right, it's "the" -- well, it's16 "the," in the sense of "the activity of purchasing and17 selling securities," yes. It's -- and that's how this18 Court has interpreted, in the O'Hagan case, for -- if that19 interpretation -- if "the" were read as "his or her," then20 it's impossible to see how the SEC could bring an21 enforcement action, or the Justice Department could bring22 a prosecution, in a case like O'Hagan, where the -- where23 the Court specifically said that the purchaser or seller24 was not defrauded. It's not that -- it's not true that25 section 10(b) requires that the purchaser or seller be181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425defrauded.  And so, we submit that this would be --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, it certainly doesn'trequire the Commission to be a purchaser or seller,either.  You know --          MR. HUNGAR:  Well, we certainly would agree withthat, Your Honor, that --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes.          MR. HUNGAR:  But, more generally, it doesn'trequire that there be a purchaser or seller who'sdefrauded, and yet the purchaser/seller rule, for thepurpose of implied actions, does require that.          Justice Stevens, you asked about whether thereis any indication in the legislative history that Congressintended this act to preempt class-action claims wherethere would be no Federal remedy.  The answer to that is,absolutely yes.  It is perfectly clear from thelegislative history that Congress knew, and expected, thatclaims that could be brought under State law as classactions, such as aiding-and-abetting claims or negligent-misrepresentation claims, claims that would not satisfythe Federal --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Right.          MR. HUNGAR:  -- scienter requirements for --and, of course, the claims that would not satisfy therequirements of the PSLRA.  None of those could be brought191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425in Federal court, because they're barred by the variousprovisions of Federal law.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  No, but they would be at --adjudged under a different standard, you're dead right.As far as the parties involved, the -- that's what I wasreally asking.          MR. HUNGAR:  Well, in cases where the -- wherethe only claim is against aiders and abetters, thoseparties would be -- would be out of court; or, likewise,cases where parties could not satisfy the scienterrequirement, those parties would be out of court.  So,Congress knew that it would be foreclosing remedies forcertain categories of claims, and that was part of thepoint of the act, as the conference committee report makesclear.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the --          MR. HUNGAR:  Congress was --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- the claim that's madehere, the second claim, where the broker said, "We lostclients, so -- as a result of this deception -- and wewant to be compensated for that," nothing about theinflated price of the security --          MR. HUNGAR:  Your --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- just that "our clientsdon't trust us anymore, because we gave them such bad201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425advice."          MR. HUNGAR:  Your Honor, the -- that issue isnot before this Court --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I know, but I --          MR. HUNGAR:  -- because it was not --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- wanted to know what theGovernment's position was on that claim.  Could that bebrought in a State court --          MR. HUNGAR:  The --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- even as a class action?          MR. HUNGAR:  The Commission addressed thatquestion in its amicus brief in the Court of Appeals, andtook the position that that claim was not in connectionwith the purchase or sale of securities, because theinjury occurs after the fraud has been completed, and is -- and has to do with the lost future relationship, ratherthan fraud in connection with the purchase or sale ofsecurities.  And so, we didn't address that in our briefhere, obviously, but the Commission took the position,below, that that would not be preempted, because it's notin connection with the purchase or sale of securities.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How do you deal with theCourt's -- the footnote in the Blue Chip Stamp -- thatthe court says -- in the Federal court -- "these 10(b)actions have to be limited to actual purchasers and211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 sellers," but that limitation is attenuated, because2 deserving claims by nontraders would lie under State law,3 including the very suit that was involved in Blue Chip4 Stamps and in the Second Circuit case that paved the way5 for Blue Chip?6 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, that was an accurate7 description of the state of the law, as it existed at the8 time, at least in theory, although, as a practical matter,9 Respondents have not been able to point to a single10 reported case a -- of a holder class action in State court11 prior to the adoption of the Uniform Standards Act. So,12 while it was true, as a theoretical matter, that such13 claims could be brought under the law of some States,14 there are -- there is no history of State class actions in15 this area, which is one of the reasons why we think the16 reliance on the assumption of nonpreemption makes no sense17 here. Securities class actions prior to the PSLRA were18 brought in Federal court, and it was only the PSLRA that19 resulted in cases, such as the type of case at issue here,20 being brought in State courts. And Congress -- once it21 saw that problem, Congress was concerned that the22 requirements of the PSLRA were being evaded, and it was23 also concerned, as the conference committee report makes24 clear, that, now that these securities class actions were25 being brought in State court, there was the potential221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 danger of 50 varying State standards being applied, as2 this very case suggests, and Congress acted to remedy both3 of those problems, as the conference committee report4 makes clear, both the risk of nonuniformity in securities5 class actions that are targeted by the act, and the risk6 of evasion of the PSLRA.7 Respondent's position would frustrate both of8 those objectives, because it would -- it would permit the9 most abusive category of lawsuits to proceed in State10 court, and it would permit such holder claims to be11 brought -- for instance, based on negligence, if State law12 permitted that; based on conduct that would be protected13 by the Federal safe harbor for forward-looking statements14 under the PSLRA. So, the PSLRA protections would be15 frustrated by their interpretation.16 So, the very goals that Congress explicitly17 sought to achieve, stated in the -- in the text of the18 statute, in the purposes section and also in the19 conference committee report, would be frustrated. And,20 again, that approach requires the Court to accept an21 inconsistent interpretation of the text of the "in22 connection with" requirement, depending on the identity of23 the plaintiff, which would be an extraordinary way to24 construe a statute, particularly when there's nothing in25 the legislative history that provides even a hint of a231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 suggestion that Congress would have intended that result.2 And with respect to Blue Chip, Your Honor, it's3 important to remember what Blue Chip was doing. Blue Chip4 was not a case about the scope of the "in connection with"5 requirement or the section 10(b) prohibition. Instead, it6 was a case about what to infer about what Congress would7 have wanted to authorize as an -- as a right of action, if8 it had addressed the question. And that's why the Blue9 Chip court made very clear that the conduct at issue there10 involving injuries to holders can be a violation of11 section 10(b) -- i.e., it can be in connection with the12 purchase or sale of securities -- it's just that they did13 not think that Congress would have wanted to authorize a14 private right of action.15 So, again, when we're talking about the scope of16 the "in connection with" requirement, which is what is at17 issue here, that approach is the same approach that should18 be followed here, the same approach that was in --19 followed in O'Hagan and in Zandford, and compels the20 conclusion that, since the conduct at issue here is21 unquestionably "in connection with the purchase and sale22 of securities," as this Court has construed that phrase,23 it is preempted by the Uniform Standards Act.24 If the Court has no further questions, I thank25 the Court.241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. Hungar.          Mr. Frederick.           ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK                 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT          MR. FREDERICK:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:          Our position is that SLUSA does not preemptclass actions asserting holder claims.  Congressincorporated this Court's interpretation of "in connectionwith" from Blue Chip Stamps when it enacted SLUSA.  SLUSArechanneled State suits to Federal court.  It was notdesigned to eliminate State remedies that could not bepursued as Federal 10(b)(5) claims.  That interpretationis the better reading of the text, the context, and thehistory of SLUSA's handling of private securities actions.          If I could start with the text --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can you tell me, do you agreethat a holder action falls within 10(b)(5), generally?          MR. FREDERICK:  No, because this Court, in theBlue Chip Stamps case, said that it did not.  In footnote5, Justice Rehnquist --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But what about enforcementactions taken by the --          MR. FREDERICK:  In enforcement --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- SEC?251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. FREDERICK:  -- actions, the SEC can bringenforcement authority, pursuant to 10(b)(5).  And so, tothat extent, misconduct that would be connected to what,in a private context, would be deemed a holder claim, doesfall within the SEC's --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But then, the --          MR. FREDERICK:  -- jurisdiction.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- then it does fall within --holder actions do fall within 10(b)(5), for some purposes.          MR. FREDERICK:  They do, for enforcementpurposes; they do not, for private civil-action purposes.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So, you want us to interpretthe text two ways, depending on the purpose.          MR. FREDERICK:  No.  What I want you to do is tounderstand what Congress intended.  And what Congressintended, in SLUSA, I think is quite clear if you start atthe beginning of the statute and you just start readingyour way through it, because what Congress did in SLUSAwas attempt to stop a flight of cases that had beenbrought in Federal court heretofore, but were migrating toState court, Congress perceived, as a result of theenactment of the PSLRA.          Section 2 of SLUSA -- and it is very important,Your Honors, that you look carefully at section 2 ofSLUSA, because it has five congressional findings.  They261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 are not adequately briefed, or even discussed, by the2 Second Circuit, but one of them says that the PSLRA sought3 to prevent abuses. The second one says, since an4 enactment of that, Congress perceives that a number of5 securities class-action lawsuits have shifted from Federal6 to State courts. The third one says, that shift has7 prevented the act from achieving its objectives. The next8 one says, State securities regulation is of continuing9 importance. And the then, the fifth one says, in order to10 prevent certain State private securities class actions11 alleging fraud from being used to frustrate the objectives12 of the PSLRA, it is appropriate to enact these national13 standards.14 JUSTICE SCALIA: The Government doesn't say that15 "all" are covered. The Government acknowledges that there16 are some actions that could still be brought in State17 court.18 MR. FREDERICK: The point, though, Justice19 Scalia, is that what Congress, in the PSLRA, was doing was20 attempting to ratchet up the pleading requirements for21 Federal-law claims.22 JUSTICE SCALIA: So -- it's so23 counterintuitive. As the Government points out, these24 holder claims lend themselves to abuse much more than do25 the narrow purchase-and-sale claims.271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. FREDERICK:  Absolutely --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And why --          MR. FREDERICK:  -- not.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- why the Government wouldwant to police the one, and let the other, you know,proliferate, seems very strange to me.          MR. FREDERICK:  That's not correct, JusticeScalia.  And it's important to emphasize this.  What theCourt addressed in the Blue Chip Stamps case was a verydifferent kind of case.  It involved nonpurchasers.  Andthe Court reasoned that it would be speculative forsomebody out there to say, "Well, I would have purchasedthe security, had I known."  A holder claim, as recognizedfor a century in various State courts, involves a claim bysomebody who holds a security and is induced by fraud notto sell that security.  The restatement set of torts,section 525, recognizes that the fraud by forebearance of-- to cause you not to take an action is just as much afraud as one that --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But the --          MR. FREDERICK:  -- induces you.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But the fraud is caused-- the fraud causes other people to want to buy thesecurity.  They do so at a higher price.  It causes theprice to go up.  It's "in connection with a purchase or281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 sale," maybe not of the holder's securities. But it's2 certainly3 purchases45 correct, Mr. Chief Justice. But that, I don't think is6 material. The level of damages that a holder sustains7 should not determine what the elements of the liability8 are. And what is striking about the Government and-- the holder's claim wouldn't exist, but forand sales that caused the price to go up.MR. FREDERICK:  In most circumstance, that's9 Merrill Lynch's position here is that intentional fraud is10 going to be given a pass because of those persons who are11 uniquely harmed, because, for 20 years --12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what your clients13 want to do is cash in on the fraud. They don't -- their14 claim is that they didn't get to sell the stock at an15 inflated price to somebody who didn't know about the16 fraud. That's the damages that they want to collect. And17 that seems to be an odd claim to recognize.18 MR. FREDERICK: That's the same kind of claim19 that in -- to get back to Justice Scalia's question --20 arises in the purchaser/seller context. The only21 difference is that the measure of damages is computed by22 when you purchase or sell, as opposed to when you bought23 it, before the fraud occurred. I mean, Wall Street has24 been telling investors, for two or more decades, "Buy and25 hold. Rest your retirement, hold your securities."291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: In that --2 MR. FREDERICK: In --3 JUSTICE BREYER: -- in -- suppose a person4 bought the stock at price 30 before any fraud took place,5 and then he holds it, and then the fraud, and then,6 subsequently, the word of the fraud gets out, the price7 falls a lot, and he sells it. Does he have a claim, under8 Federal -- ordinary -- you know, does he -- can he go into9 Federal court?10 MR. FREDERICK: No.11 JUSTICE BREYER: No.12 MR. FREDERICK: Blue Chip --13 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.14 MR. FREDERICK: -- Stamps said no.15 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.16 MR. FREDERICK: In State courts, in the17 Weinberger case that we cite, they -- they very carefully18 say this was not a State-court class action, but what19 Judge Friendly, in the Weinberger case, addressed was a20 State-law holder --21 JUSTICE BREYER: All right, then --22 MR. FREDERICK: -- class action --23 JUSTICE BREYER: -- then -- I see that -- then24 what's worrying me is this, that -- one thing worrying me25 is that -- let's take an ordinary buyer case. All right?301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 And what happened is that the -- some buyers would like to2 bring a fraud suit in Federal court. They have to go to3 Federal court now. They can't go into State court. But4 they have a little brainstorm, or the lawyers do, and they5 say, "Well, in any case where a buyer would have a claim,6 and we don't want to go into Federal court, there surely7 are going to be a class of holders that would also have8 the kind of claim you say." So, there we are, same9 actions, all in the State court, just happens to have10 found a different class of claimant. And there always11 will be such a class.12 MR. FREDERICK: There will be, in most13 circumstances. There are some circumstances where harms14 are unique to holders. But, Justice Breyer, can I point15 out to you that, in the antitrust context, there is, under16 Illinois Brick, a requirement that you must be in the17 direct chain, in a direct purchaser, but there are some 3018 States that have allowed standing for people --19 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's fine. And I --20 MR. FREDERICK: -- that are indirect purchasers.21 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and what I'm not facing, in22 the antitrust area, is what, it seems to me, on your23 interpretation now, would be, Congress passes a law, which24 becomes a futile act, because what they're anxious is --25 to do is to get the cases in the class actions -- not all311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the cases -- but the class actions in the Federal court.And then, in every single case, or 99.999 percent, wherewe've kept this action out of Federal court, there's goingto be a comparable action, with holders as the plaintiff,in a State court.          MR. FREDERICK:  Well --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, what -- that's a -- myconcern.  What do you --          MR. FREDERICK:way.  What court -- whatlegislative debates, was And let me address that this-- Congress was very clear in the-- it did not want to cut offmeritorious claims.  It simply wanted to rechannel them.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Can you -- can you ease myconcern there?  Is there anything you can say that couldease my concern that we'll have the same set, that they'lljust be in State court with a different class?          MR. FREDERICK:  Many States doesn't recognizeholder claims as a matter of State law, and they have thesame kinds of heightened pleading requirements that wereimposed under the PSLRA.          JUSTICE BREYER:  And, by the way, my concern isnot that it's a "bad thing," in quotes.  My concern isthat it's hard for me to think Congress would have donesomething that wouldn't have had much effect.MR. FREDERICK: I think your concern should be, 321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425What did Congress intend?  And --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, what do you make of --          MR. FREDERICK:  And --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Right.  That's just --          MR. FREDERICK:  And I don't think Congressintended to eliminate a swath of class actions concerninga type of claim that this Court had said could not bebrought under --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, then --          MR. FREDERICK:  -- Federal law.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- what do you make of thelegislative history?  I mean, your friend on the otherside pointed out that there was very clear testimony tothe effect that if the statute passed, with the text thatwe're dealing with, that it would, indeed, cut out aseries of claims.          MR. FREDERICK:  I don't think that that was --if you read that in context, I don't think that it was astatement by the speaker, in that instance, of Congress'sintent to go beyond those claims that were cognizableunder Federal law, and to cut off a whole category ofclaims that were unique to State law.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Frederick, you mentionedcutting off a whole category of claims.  And, earlier, yousaid they didn't want to give a pass to this kind of a331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 claim. But this is not a pass, because there are all2 sorts of remedies retained -- derivative suits, 49-person3 actions, and so forth. And are you aware -- you mentioned4 the 100 years of State precedent -- is there any precedent5 in the State law for class actions for holder claims?6 MR. FREDERICK: Well, we think the Weinberger7 case recognized that class actions could be brought, under8 New York law. It was a Federal case --9 JUSTICE STEVENS: But this --10 MR. FREDERICK: -- but it was --11 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- is not a case where we have12 a 100-year body of law of class action after class action13 brought on State-law grounds for this type of claim.14 MR. FREDERICK: True. But, in the '90s, you had15 a unique form of fraud that was being perpetrated on Wall16 Street that did affect holders in a unique way. And we've17 highlighted market timing in our briefs. In that18 circumstance, it would be futile for 49 holders to get19 together and assert that they had been harmed by market20 timing, because the aggregate of their harm is so small21 that you really have to look at it in a large context.22 John Vogel, the head of Vanguard for many years,23 and one of most respected mutual-fund advisors, says that24 there are as many as $5 billion lost by people who buy and25 hold, as we've been taught to do by Wall Street, but whose341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 aggregate losses accrete every year by virtue of market2 timing. That is a unique harm caused to holders, which,3 under their theory, would not be cognizable, because it4 would be preempted, and it would be impossible, as a5 practical matter, for someone to get together with 48 of6 his or her fellow victims and try to bring a claim to7 redress that. There's --8 JUSTICE STEVENS: But you're --9 MR. FREDERICK: -- no evidence --10 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- you're describing the11 present importance of the -- that. But I don't think12 you've answered my question about historic -- as a matter13 of history, we don't have a history of timer claims.14 MR. FREDERICK: We don't have a history of timer15 claims, but what we also don't have, Justice Stevens, is16 an indication by Congress, throughout the entire17 legislative debate or the conference reports or anything,18 where holder claims which had been brought were perceived19 to be a problem and were perceived to be within the ambit20 of what Congress was doing. Because, remember --21 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, because they -- I mean, the22 argument made by the Government: "Of course not, because23 the only reason they're brought is precisely to evade this24 congressional legislation." They didn't exist, before;25 and they've become common, afterwards. Now -- you know, I351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425-- you can say --          MR. FREDERICK:  They could --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that they          MR. FREDERICK:  -- they couldunder Federal law, before.  And I would--not be broughtacknowledge that,because of a series of this Court's decisions, it iseasier to prove a purchaser/seller claim, where the factswarrant that, under 10(b) prior to the PSLRA than it wasto prove a holder claim.  Judge Friendly, in theWeinberger opinion, makes very clear that the value to beattributed to the class-action settlement there has to bediminished because of the difficulty of proof of suchclaims.  But that          JUSTICEwell, never mind.          JUSTICE--SCALIA:  I thought that there were --        STEVENS:  There would --MR. FREDERICK:  I'd like to address the pointthat the Government makes about how this would supposedlyaffect the SEC's enforcement authority --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Before --          MR. FREDERICK:  -- because --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- you get to that, just --Mr. Frederick, the logic of it -- but -- here, Congress istightening the requirements for class actions, but thenthere is this class, which -- Blue Chip did say there's a361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 lot -- room for a lot of abuse in holder classes -- would2 be left to the State courts for whatever strict or lenient3 rules. So, why would Congress, with respect to this4 category, want there to be a more plaintiff-friendly rule5 than the rule that Congress has just put in place for the6 purchaser/seller 10(b) actions?7 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Ginsburg, I don't think8 that it's correct to characterize it as more plaintiff-9 friendly. If you're in Minnesota, you can't bring one of10 these claims, because State law doesn't recognize it.11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, at least in some12 States.13 MR. FREDERICK: In some States, you -- where the14 common law or the State statutes recognize these claims,15 all that we're arguing is that Congress didn't focus on16 these. In the normal presumption against preemption, you17 don't, you know, cut through a wide swath of claims where18 Congress hasn't expressed an intent specifically to19 preempt them. That's our position, and particularly where20 the congressional findings --21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- you're admitting22 that an -- that anomaly could be part of the scene, that23 you'd have a State that allows you to sue for negligence,24 and doesn't have heightened pleading requirements for25 holder claims; and so, those claims would be treated more 371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 -- in a more plaintiff-friendly way than Federal claims.2 MR. FREDERICK: Yes. Certainly, just as "breach3 of fiduciary duty" and "breach of the covenant of good4 faith and fair dealing" are State-law claims, negligence5 is a State-law claim, all of those give rise to6 variations, State by State. But what Congress was getting7 at were fraud claims that were Federal-law fraud claims.8 And, when it did so, it was heightening the pleading9 requirements and, seeing what people were doing was taking10 what were Federal-law claims and migrating them to State11 court under, ostensibly, more lenient standards --12 JUSTICE BREYER: But why, in your theory --13 suppose you're right. You're right. I assume that.14 You can have these holder claims. But why couldn't15 any buyer, who's -- has to go to Federal court because he16 has a buyer claim, just say, "I'll bring the holder claim"?17 MR. FREDERICK: He can't do that under the --18 JUSTICE BREYER: Because?19 MR. FREDERICK: -- under the Second Circuit's20 test, because --21 JUSTICE BREYER: I know. But what I'm asking22 is, What's the logic of that? I mean, you're either right23 or you're wrong. If Congress didn't want to cut off the24 holder claim, they didn't. So, what's to show that they25 wanted to cut it off for some people, but not other381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 people?2 MR. FREDERICK: The logic is that, for the3 buyers of those claims, they are meeting the Federal4 standard of "in connection with" --5 6 7 8 9JUSTICE BREYER:  Not in this suit.MR. FREDERICK:  -- "purchase or sale."JUSTICE BREYER:  Not --MR. FREDERICK:  Yes.JUSTICE BREYER:  -- in this suit.MR. FREDERICK:  Yes, they are, because they'rethe reason why these people have -- under the1011 buying --12 Second Circuit's standard, which we think is correct, is13 that you had to have bought the stock before the fraud,14 and you were holding it throughout that period of fraud;15 and so, your purchase is not "in connection with" the16 fraud, the misrepresentation. But somebody who sees the17 prospectus, who sees what Mr. Blodget was saying, which18 was that there were stocks that were, quote, "a piece of19 crap," but they were giving them the highest buy20 recommendation -- those people are making their purchase21 "in connection with" --22 JUSTICE BREYER: So, if I'm both --23 MR. FREDERICK: -- "a fraud."24 JUSTICE BREYER: -- I bought it in May, in25 reliance on this ridiculous thing. "Buggy whips make391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 gold." I believed it. I bought buggy whips. Now --2 we're now in December. And every month, they kept3 repeating it. And my claim is, "Yes, I know, I bought it4 in May, in reliance, but I kept it in July,because I keptunder the5 seeing it 678repeated and repeated."  Do I --MR. FREDERICK:  I think --JUSTICE BREYER:  -- have a claim?MR. FREDERICK:  I think, actually9 Second Circuit's standard, that --10 JUSTICE BREYER: In the Second Circuit, I do11 not. But I want to know why not.12 MR. FREDERICK: Well, I think that the reason13 why not is that if the fraud is affecting the plaintiff's14 decision to purchase, then that falls within SLUSA, and15 that is preempted, although it allow -- you are allowed to16 have a Federal remedy under that standard. You're17 rechanneled to Federal court. But if you buy -- to use18 your hypothetical, you buy in January, but the fraudulent19 misrepresentations are not made until May or June, you're20 precluded from bringing a Federal-law claim.21 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if I choose not to22 complain about my buying, I just choose to complain about23 my holding? It's true, I was harmed because I jumped in.24 And that's one harm. But it's an entirely separate harm25 that I was induced to hold it --401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR.

I -- andthere's nothing in my complaint about my buying the stock.I say --MR. FREDERICK:  Your --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- "I was induced to hold thestock by these representations that occurred in February,421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 March, April, and May. I bought, in January, also in2 reliance on fraud, but I'm not complaining about that."3 MR. FREDERICK: What the Second Circuit said,4 which I think is correct, is that -- is that your damages5 have to be totally and apart from the fraud as a6 purchaser, and that where --7 JUSTICE SCALIA: But they are --8 MR. FREDERICK: -- the reason why they set this9 timeframe for holder claims is that those kinds of claims10 that you're talking about, Justice Scalia, would be a11 classic purchaser/seller-type claim, and you can bring12 that in Federal court. And that's the point here, that,13 where you've got long-term holders, and you've got people14 who purchased in the '80s or in the '70s, and they're being15 induced to hold for decades, and they may want to make --16 they may suffer their damages as a result of collateral17 that they want to borrow against -- they have no practical18 means of recovery --19 JUSTICE SCALIA: As a practical matter, my20 damages from the holding may be much greater than my21 damages from the initial purchase. And you're saying,22 "Tough luck, Charlie. You bought a month too soon -- or a23 month too late. You should have brought -- bought before24 the fraud."25 MR. FREDERICK: What the Second Circuit said,431111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 which I think is correct, is that that becomes a level of2 line-drawing that we don't think Congress did intend to3 get into.4 JUSTICE BREYER: I agree with you. But that's5 the trouble. Because, in order to make the Second6 Circuit's argument, you have to say the following,7 "Congress couldn't have intended to allow people who have8 a buyer claim to make a totally separate holder claim,9 because that would gut the statute, and they wouldn't want10 to engage in a futile act." But now you're asking us to11 do about the same thing, when you talk about a person who12 doesn't have the buyer claim and you're trying to get us13 to say, "Congress thought -- Congress thought an14 individual action there, their own separate action in the15 State court, wasn't good enough; it would have wanted to16 preserve the holder claim for them." Now, that's17 possible, but it requires me to think Congress is going18 through quite a few hoops here.1920 and which21 findings,22 addressing in SLUSA -- this was a narrow -- you know, this23 was a narrowly framed preemption as to Federal-law claims,24 because a -- the PSLRA only governed Federal-law claims.25 And if you could not bring a holder claim under FederalMR. FREDERICK:  The hoops that Congress went to,I have articulated, in the congressionalare that the particular harm that Congress was441111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 law, because of Blue Chip Stamps, you were forced into2 State court. Okay? So, when Congress is debating the3 evasion of the PSLRA, it is only talking about Federal-law4 claims. And there's nothing in the legislative history5 that they've cited, or that we have found, to suggest that6 Congress gave any thought to preempting a class of holder7 claims. Now, certainly --8 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick, can I ask sort9 of a background question? Ever since Blue Chip -- it's10 been on the books for a long time -- has Congress ever11 considered legislation that would expand the 10(b)(5)12 private remedy to include holder claims?13 MR. FREDERICK: I'm not aware of legislation,14 Your Honor.15 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not, either. I -- just16 wondering if there was some we could --17 MR. FREDERICK: But what -- what this Court did18 say, in Blue Chip Stamps, was that, when the Birnbaum19 decision -- and it was an interpretation of "in connection20 with purchase or sale" by what one Justice on this Court21 described as the "Mother Court of the Court of Appeals" --22 it was Chief Judge Swan, Judge Augustus Hand, and Judge23 Learned Hand -- and they construed the words "in24 connection with purchase or sale" to mean the plaintiff's25 purchase --451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but Blue --2 MR. FREDERICK: -- or sale.3 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- but Blue Chip did not adopt4 the rationale of the Birnbaum case.5 MR. FREDERICK: Well, I think it -- it did adopt6 the rule, though, as a basis of the wording. And if you7 look at page 733 of the Court's opinion, it was adopting8 the rationale, in the sense that it saw Birnbaum as a9 construction of the language, and it adopted that. And10 then in note 5, when Justice Rehnquist's opinion says, "It11 would be odd to read 'in connection with purchase or sale'12 to give a," quote, "'cause of action to everybody in the13 world,'" I think it's clear that that was suggesting that14 State law could recognize something that this Court said15 was not recognized under Federal law.16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Frederick, it seems to me17 that the language "in connection with," you know, whether18 it means what Blue Chip meant or whether it means what the19 statute meant, is at least ambiguous. And, if that's the20 case, why shouldn't we be guided by the Securities and21 Exchange Commission's determination, under Chevron, Mead,22 you know, anything but --23 MR. FREDERICK: This statute is a -- about24 private civil actions, and it doesn't affect the SEC's25 enforcement authority or any action. In fact, the SEC461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 doesn't derive any greater power, or lesser power, as a2 result of the enactment of SLUSA. It is entirely3 legislated against private civil actions.4 JUSTICE SCALIA: The --5 MR. FREDERICK: So, the SEC --6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Have we not given any weight to7 SEC determinations, as to its interpretation, where civil8 actions are involved? I'm surprised at that.9 MR. FREDERICK: This is an act, Justice Scalia,10 where the SEC's enforcement authority isn't affected one11 jot. And so, I think it would be a strange application of12 Chevron, or even Skidmore, deference to say that the SEC13 gets some special weight because it's construing words in14 an enactment --15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.16 MR. FREDERICK: -- that's addressed to private --17 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you know --18 MR. FREDERICK: -- civil litigation.19 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- whether the SEC filed an20 amicus brief in Blue Chip?21 MR. FREDERICK: Yes. And it took the position22 there that "in connection with" did have a broad23 construction. And that position was rejected.24 JUSTICE STEVENS: It took the position that the25 Seventh Circuit took in Eason, didn't it?471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 45 think was6 deference7 private right of action that this Court had recognized,8 and that the lower courts had recognized.MR. FREDERICK:  That's correct.JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes.[Laughter.]MR. FREDERICK:  But the Court, there, I don't-- it said that it was not in -- giving anyto the SEC's position, because it was an implied9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Before you finish -- there's10 two questions I would like to ask him. One is -- we know11 about the holder claims. They are saved for State12 actions. They're not preempted. What else would fall in13 this category that is not -- that SLUSA doesn't affect,14 that can be brought as class actions in State court?15 MR. FREDERICK: Well, there are class actions16 that concern breaches of fiduciary duty, negligence. And17 the question of whether or not they are "in connection18 with purchase or sale" is going to have a profound impact19 on whether or not those claims are also preempted. I20 can't spell out for you what the necessary consequences21 are, but there are a lot of State-law claims brought under22 Blue Sky laws and other State remedies that traditionally23 have been observed and brought, even as State claims, but,24 under a -- you know, the all-encompassing parameter of "in25 connection with purchase or sale" advanced on the other481111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 side, a decision that would favor that could have unknown2 preemptive consequences, which I would submit would be3 contrary to the normal way you would put Congress to the4 test of determining, "Did it intend to preempt those5 claims?" before adopting a broad interpretation that would6 do so. And if I could point out --7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You --8 MR. FREDERICK: -- one of the strange things9 about this case and the SEC's position is that district10 courts are going to be put in the rather unusual position11 of paying a rather high cost, because if they are12 confronted with a removal of a case brought under State13 law, where the defendant asserts that it is preempted14 under SLUSA, and the SEC hasn't taken any action at all,15 and has expressed no interest in this particular area, the16 district court, to determine preemption, has to intuit17 whether or not this is within the SEC's enforcement18 authority. So, you have -- ordinarily, you would have19 private plaintiffs suing for wrongdoing on the same side20 of the case as the SEC, as the public enforcer. But,21 here, you have them at loggerheads. And the only way that22 the district court can properly figure that out, whether23 or not the private victim can get a private remedy, is to24 cut back on the SEC's enforcement authority, will -- if25 you will -- would exact an awfully high cost.491111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 I would submit that that kind of an anomaly is a2 rather unusual one, particularly where the SEC isn't a3 party in the case, and it is not being invited to submit a4 brief. And yet, district courts, in order to determine5 the preemption question here, are going to have to rule6 against the SEC in order to give a private remedy -- to7 recognize a private remedy under State law, or to cut back8 on a remedy under State law by holding that it is within9 the SEC's enforcement jurisdiction.10 Ultimately, what Merrill Lynch here is asserting11 is an immunity for a fraud that uniquely affects a certain12 class of holders who do not have a remedy under Federal13 law. And I would submit that, where any party is seeking14 to get an immunity from an intentional fraud, the party15 bears a heavy presumption that that is, in fact, what16 Congress intended. And I would submit to you that, both17 with the language of the statute, the findings that18 Congress made in the legislative history, Congress did not19 express an intent to eliminate holder class actions of20 greater than 49 persons.21 JUSTICE SCALIA: I agree with that presumption22 against preemption, where the question is, Does this23 Federal statute, which says nothing about preemption,24 accidentally preempt some State law? -- that there, the25 presumption makes sense. But here, you have a statute,501111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 the whole object of which is preemption. And I'm not sure2 that what you shouldn't do in that case is just give the3 language its most reasonable meaning, with no thumb on4 either side of the scale.5 MR. FREDERICK: But it's preemption to6 rechannel. And that's the important point, Justice7 Scalia. The point was not to allow State-law claims under8 State-court systems, but to rechannel those actions into9 Federal court. And if there are a category of victims of10 frauds who have no Federal remedy, it doesn't make sense11 to infer that Congress, without saying so, left those12 people without any remedy whatsoever.13 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick, I want to be14 sure of one question. I'm not sure I understood your15 argument about how the district court has to deny the16 right to the SEC. But the SEC wouldn't be bound by the17 district court's decision, would it?18 MR. FREDERICK: Well, it depends on how the19 courts would construe the SLUSA cases as affecting the "in20 connection with purchase or sale" in the SEC enforcement21 authority. If you were to accept the premise that the22 Court's Zandford and O'Hagan decisions are binding on the23 SLUSA preemption language, anytime a court is construing --24 May I finish, Mr. Chief Justice?25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Certainly.511111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. FREDERICK:  Anytime a court is construingthat language, in the SLUSA context, it would necessarilyhave a collateral impact on the SEC's enforcementauthority in 10(b).          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes, but the SEC couldrelitigate it, I would think.  It wouldn't be bound by thejudgment in a private suit.          MR. FREDERICK:  It could certainly relitigateit.  But the point of the persuasive authority of aconstruction of "in connection with purchase or sale," Ithink, would have effects that are inappropriate.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.          MR. FREDERICK:  Thank you.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Kasner, you have 3minutes remaining.            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAY B. KASNER                 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER          MR. KASNER:  Counsel referred to the findings inthe legislation.  And I know this Court will go back andreview those.  The -- finding number 5 does not use theword "certain" anywhere in it.  What finding number 5 doessay, however, "It is appropriate to enact nationalstandards for securities class-action lawsuits involvingnationally traded securities while preserving theappropriate enforcement powers of State securities521111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 regulators and not changing the current treatment of2 individual lawsuits," quote/unquote.3 Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg asked4 questions that I think illustrate that Congress could not5 have intended such an anomalous result by allowing6 holders' claims to proceed as nonpreempted.7 Justice Breyer, as a practical matter, you are8 100 percent right in the premise of your question. If9 this Court agrees with -- that the court below is correct,10 every single securities class action that is brought in11 Federal court from that day forward will have a companion12 claim brought with it, asserted by holders. And it's not13 simply holders in the fashion that Mr. Dabit appears,14 which is somebody who claims, "I would have sold, had I,15 essentially, known inside information," a proposition16 which Judge Friendly expounded on in the Levine case in17 the Second Circuit, but you will also have holders -- you18 will also have claims by people who come to court, in the19 State court, and say, "You know, I would have bought20 securities if you had not issued such unduly pessimistic21 projections," just as was the case in the Blue Chip Stamp22 case. And imagine the impact that that result would have23 on the safe harbor, which Congress enacted with the PSLRA24 to protect public companies in the United States and25 abroad, encouraging them to make forward-looking531111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 statements. If you allow a result which affords putative2 people, who would have bought and would have sold, in3 State court where the safe harbor doesn't apply, you will4 absolutely be gutting the statutory protections that5 Congress was seeking to protect.6 I'd like to just make one point about the7 Weinberger verse -- the Weinberger v. Kendrick case that8 is mentioned. That involved an approval of a Federal-9 court class action where State-law holders' claims were10 being released. In fact, the consideration that was11 approved there was less, because the claims were weaker.12 We've heard a lot, Your Honors, about why13 Congress didn't mention holders' claims by name. The14 reason they didn't mention holders' claims by name is that15 it wasn't until SLUSA was enacted and creative plaintiff16 strike-suit lawyers brought holders' claims, in an effort17 to avoid SLUSA, that this problem became exacerbated. But18 there is no doubt that the plain and natural meaning of19 SLUSA picks up all claims by any private party in20 connection with the purchase or sale of security.21 If there are no --22 JUSTICE STEVENS: It's surprising that the23 holder claims didn't respond to Blue Chip. I think your24 argument would suggest they should have responded to Blue25 Chip by bringing a whole host of holder claims in the541111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 State court.2 MR. KASNER: Yes, Your Honor.3 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.4 MR. KASNER: Thank you.5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.6 The case is submitted.7 [Whereupon, at 12:16 p.m., the case in the8 above-entitled matter was submitted.]9101112131415161718192021222324251111 14th Street, NW Suite 40055 1-Washington, DC 20005
