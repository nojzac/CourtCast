KNEEDLERON BEHALF OF PETITIONERSMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          The Court of Appeals decision in this casecarves out an exception to the categorical prohibition forthe Controlled Substances Act in order to permitrespondents to import, distribute, and use a Schedule 1controlled substance.  The Court of Appeals believed thisexception was justified by the Religious FreedomRestoration Act in order to enable respondents to usehoasca tea, which contains dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, inthe substance, for religious purposes.  The court ofappeals was wrong.  RFRA carries forward the compelling-interest test, as set forth in prior Federal courtdecisions.JUSTICE O'CONNOR: May I address a preliminary inquiry that I have? Are we reviewing here the issuance of the injunction by the trial court?31111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, a preliminary injunction.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  And we have to find that, forthe trial court to have issued it, it was an abuse ofdiscretion?          MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, with respect to certainaspects of the preliminary injunction question, yes.  Forexample, whether a preliminary injunction should -- is theproper remedy if all the other criteria are satisfied.JUSTICE O'CONNOR: You know --MR. KNEEDLER: But --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- the court found evidencein equipoise and so on and so forth, so I just wondered,at the bottom line, what our legal standard is here.MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. We believe that the Court of Appeals erred -- or District Court and Court of Appeals erred, as a matter of law, in entering the injunction --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Abused its discretion.          MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, abused -- a court alwaysabuses its discretion if it -- if it commits a legalerror.  So, that is basically our position here.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It seems to me your positionis that you must -- we must give controlling determinativeweight to the fact that it's listed in Schedule 1.  Andthe respondents say you don't give itit's all on a case-by-case basis.  Is4any weight at all,there a middleWashington, DC 20005 1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-￼1 ground that there -- which I think would allow you to2 prevail here -- that there is a presumption that there is3 a compelling governmental interest when it's in Schedule4 1? It's a rebuttable presumption, but it's a presumption5 that, when it's in Schedule 1, it's a compelling interest.6 MR. KNEEDLER: Well --7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The --8 MR. KNEEDLER: -- first of all, our principal9 submission is that Congress's designation in Schedule 1 is10 sufficient unto itself. But we also do include a further11 submission that, if the Court didn't disagree with that,12 that Congress's -- Congress, in Schedule 1, has said that13 any mixture containing any amount of a listed14 hallucinogenic substance is barred. And there's15 question that this substance contains that. But16 Court was going to look beyond that to the facts17 case, there's also no question in this case that18 respondents' use of the substance produces the very19 effects that led Congress to put the substance on Schedule20 1. So, to allow the -- to allow the substance to be used21 would be in direct derogation of Congress's judgment.22 The disagreement, such as there is, goes not to23 the -- not to that question. And that's on page 214(a) of24 the joint appendix -- or the petition appendix. The25 District Court specifically found that those effects are51111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005noif theof this￼1 produced. Respondents' argument in the lower courts was2 essentially that those effects shouldn't matter, or that3 those effects should be ignored. But we think that that's4 inconsistent with Congress's judgment. So, my point is,5 if you go beyond the text of the statute, it shouldn't be6 for anything more than to -- for the Court to assure7 itself that the effects that caused Congress to list the8 subject, in fact, occur, and --9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler --10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but part of the statute11 is Sherbert and Verner and the test that Congress says we12 have to apply to its acts here.13 MR. KNEEDLER: Right. But under -- the Act does14 say carry forward the prior Federal court decisions. But,15 prior to Smith, this Court, on a number of occasions, had16 recognized the compelling interest in uniform enforcement17 of important statutes that could not function under a18 system of 192021individualized religious --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. --MR. KNEEDLER: -- exemptions.JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- Mr. Kneedler, I think22 everyone would concede that there is a compelling23 interest, governmental interest, to have the Controlled24 Substances Act on that level, yes. But then, Congress has25 passed another statute that says all laws shall be subject61111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 to RFRA -- shall be subject to RFRA. So, we can't just2 look at "Is there a compelling State interest for the3 controlled Substances Act?" in a vacuum. We have to take4 what was a later statute, RFRA, to which the Controlled5 Substances Act is made subject by Congress. And I thought6 the argument was: Is there a compelling State interest in7 that context? How can there be, given the situation with8 peyote and, "We're just like the Native American Church in9 that regard"?10 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, the argument is not that11 the Controlled Substances Act is not subject to RFRA. It12 is subject to RFRA. But -- just as it was subject to the13 First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause -- and, in this14 Court's pre-Smith cases, in which the Court -- at least15 Congress understood the Court to have been applying a16 compelling-interest test, the Court was applying that17 compelling-interest test to particular statutes under18 which individualized religious exemptions would not be19 feasible, and held, as a categorical matter, that they20 were not required. The Social Security Act, the tax code,21 the laws against polygamy, the Sunday closing laws, all22 are -- all of those are ones in which the Court had23 previously concluded that individualized exceptions were24 not appropriate.25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I would understand that if71111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the Government had acted uniformly.  But we do have twosituations that seem to be like -- the peyote and thiscase.  And if the Government must accommodate to one, whynot to the other?MR. KNEEDLER: In the peyote exception, Congress was acting under its distinct constitutionally recognized authority with respect to Indian tribes. The Indian Commerce Clause specifically authorizes Congress to legislate with respect to Indian tribes --JUSTICE SCALIA: It's --MR. KNEEDLER: -- as --JUSTICE SCALIA: But it still shows -- whateverpower they were -- they were proceeding under, it still shows that it's not all that important that nobody be able to use a substance banned by category 1. I mean --MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- whatever power it was under,it's a demonstration that you can make an exceptionwithout the sky falling.MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I, in no way, think that Congress believed that by enacting the special provision for Indian tribes, it was thereby opening the Controlled Substances Act to individualized --JUSTICE SOUTER: Well --MR. KNEEDLER: -- religious exceptions.81111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- maybe Congress didn't assume2 that. They probably didn't think about it. But what's3 wrong with the argument?4 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think what's wrong with5 the argument is that what Congress did with respect to6 Indian tribes was take a look at that distinct context and7 conclude that, for a variety of reasons -- and,8 particularly, respecting the autonomous authority of an9 independent Indian tribe to control its internal affairs10 this exception applies only to members of recognized11 Indian tribes -- that, in that context, balancing all of12 the relevant considerations -- not the sort of balance13 under RFRA --14 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it --15 MR. KNEEDLER: -- but balancing all the16 considerations under the -- its Indian power, concluded17 there was --18 JUSTICE STEVENS: But Justice Scalia's point is,19 no matter what the legal theory, the evidence, historical20 evidence, seems to indicate that the sky didn't fall. And21 if it didn't fall for the larger number of Native22 Americans involved who use peyote, and the very small23 number using this drug, can't we, kind of, think that at24 least, "Well, maybe it's not all that compelling"?25 MR. KNEEDLER: But that was -- that was a91111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 specific judgment made by Congress itself, looking at --2 3 4 5 67 me if I'm8 allowing an exemption for peyote use by the Native9 American Church before Congress passed the law.JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Kneedler, may I -- MR. KNEEDLER: -- all the factors.JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- may I stop you --MR. KNEEDLER: Yes.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- there?  Because, correctwrong, but it was my impression that the DEA was10 MR. KNEEDLER: That -- that's correct, but that11 was understood at the -- at -- back in 1970, or back,12 actually, in '65, when that was first adopted, to have13 been consistent with Congress's original intent in passing14 the statute, and the Controlled Substances Act, which15 carried forward the schedules. But, in any event,16 Congress has now addressed the subject by statute,17 following the enactment of RFRA, following this Court's18 decision in Smith, and which has brought things into quite19 different focus.20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you take it that the21 Government was right -- before Congress passed the law,22 the Government was right to give the exemption to allow23 that ceremonial use of peyote, then I don't see how you24 get mileage from a congressional act that was passed later25 than Congress's is saying, "Executive, we agree with you,101111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 you did right." But it's not -- you -- I don't see how2 you can rely on the congressional statute when the3 Government was doing this even without a --4 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, and --5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- congressional statute.6 MR. KNEEDLER: -- the statute actually, you7 know, now gives some firm statutory basis for that8 exception, which may not really have existed so9 comfortably after this Court's decision in Smith. And10 there was, it's true, nothing specific in the statute11 before. The critical point, though, to bear in mind for12 the sort of claim that respondents are arguing for here is13 that it would turn over to 700 district judges a14 determination based on particular records, particular15 credibility determinations, the judgment as to whether --16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but --17 MR. KNEEDLER: -- an exception --18 JUSTICE SOUTER: --19 what the Act does? That's --2021222324 other way 25                    isn't that exactly the --MR. KNEEDLER: No --JUSTICE SOUTER: --MR. KNEEDLER: WithJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's why we came out the in Smith, by the way.MR. KNEEDLER: But -- 111111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005why they passed it. all respect --￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425[Laughter.]MR. KNEEDLER: -- but even when Congress went back to pre-Smith, again Congress recognized that there are certain statutes in -- that serve a compelling interest that would be undermined by individualized determinations, and the Controlled --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, it didn't --MR. KNEEDLER: -- Substances Act --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- say that, did it? I mean,it did seem to indicate, after the passage of RFRA, courtsare supposed to examine, in each case, whether there is acompelling State interest and whether it's closely enoughrelated. MR. KNEEDLER:  But it -- but that was the testCourt was applying, as Congress understood it,Smith, in which, I repeat, the Court said therethat theprior towere certain statutes that categorical judgments could be made about. And the Controlled Substances Act is such a statute, as this Court recognized in Raich and in Oakland Cannabis --JUSTICE KENNEDY: I want you --MR. KNEEDLER: -- where the Court -- JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- to stay on this point,because it's important, but if this were a Schedule 2substance, would your argument be the same?121111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. KNEEDLER: Our argument would be the same,2 but for an additional reason there, and that is that even3 where Congress has -- or even where a substance may be4 distributed and used, it is only for medical purposes,5 which is in furtherance of, not in derogation of, the6 health and safety purposes of the statute. And even then,7 it is done to very strict -- pursuant to very strict8 controls that are really incompatible with sacramental use9 of a substance. There is a requirement of prescription,10 or dispensing by a physician under physician control, with11 recordkeeping -- identifying the dosage, the amount of the12 sacrament -- recordkeeping of the person who takes it.13 There is -- there is an incompatibility and potential14 entanglement problem in how to -- in trying to apply a15 system like that, even under Schedule 2. But under16 Schedule 1, what you have is contraband, as this Court17 said --18 JUSTICE BREYER: But suppose we --19 MR. KNEEDLER: -- in Raich.20 JUSTICE BREYER: -- I grant you that21 administrative considerations are relevant. Of course22 they're relevant. But that's far from saying they're23 determinative. And then we're back to what Justice Souter24 said, absolutely relevant in deciding the compelling25 interest, but the fact that peyote seems to have been 131111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 administered without the sky falling in suggests that,2 here, they're not determinative. That's all.3 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, if I could go back to the4 way the Controlled Substances Act operates, it does not5 permit a rescheduling or use of a drug based on6 individualized determinations made by individual Federal7 District Courts making their own judgment about how8 serious the risk is. If a substance is going to be moved9 from Schedule 1 to Schedule 2, for example, to allow10 medical use, that is done through a centralized11 administrative determination involving coordination12 between the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the13 Attorney General, in which expert opinions are gotten and14 a judgment is made, but the judgment is made only if there15 is an accepted medical use. In other words, there has to16 be not -- a consensus, not simply an -- a determination by17 one religious group or one judge --18 19 20 21 2223 say there24 where someone makes a religious objection to compliance25 and, in the judgment of the court, there's not aJUSTICE SCALIA: But --MR. KNEEDLER: -- that something may be so. JUSTICE SCALIA: -- RFRA overrides all that. MR. KNEEDLER: No. I --JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand RFRA to be -- to can be an exception to all Federal statutes141111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 compelling State interest in the Government going ahead2 with the statute. So, you know, whatever the scheme was3 under the drug laws, it seems to me it's subject to this4 new legislation.5 MR. KNEEDLER: We're not saying it's not subject6 to the legislation, but in deciding how the compelling7 interest applies under the statute -- just as under the8 First Amendment itself, before RFRA was passed, and the9 one is to replicate the other -- the court -- there were10 certain statutes, when the court looked at the way they11 operated and what was necessary to their effectuation, the12 court said that individualized exceptions would not be13 feasible. And there's no reason to believe, and every14 reason to disbelieve --15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, when you talk16 about --17 MR. KNEEDLER: -- that Congress meant to put18 that to one side.19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- reasons to believe20 and disbelieve, we don't have to make a once-and-for-all21 determination, do we? A lot of your concerns talk about22 what's going to happen if this exception is granted. Now,23 if some of those things come true, can't this issue be24 revisited? I don't regard -- maybe I'm wrong, but, under25 RFRA, you're not saying it's a compelling-interest test.151111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 It may be -- may not be satisfied in this case, but if it2 turns out there's a lot of diversion of the hallucinogen3 or the membership of the church expands in a way that4 leads you to believe it's being abused, I mean, then you'd5 look at it again, right?6 MR. KNEEDLER: I have several responses to that.7 That sort of approach, putting to the test basically a8 congregation-by-congregation -- or denomination-by-9 denomination, to use familiar terms -- test about whether10 a -- an exception should be recognized for a particular11 religion, itself, presents difficult questions. If you --12 if you have a particular religious sect that believes that13 it is -- that it is important to invite everyone to the14 table -- not simply a closed group that has gone through15 screening, but a -- but everyone to their table --16 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that --17 MR. KNEEDLER: -- that would be -- but that18 would -- that -- the -- a court would be in a judgment19 about -- in saying that that --20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Couldn't have said it better.21 And that's what we said in Smith. But Congress didn't22 like Smith and has enacted this statute obviously to undo,23 to the extent it can, the effect of our judgment in24 Smith.25MR. KNEEDLER: No, what -- it did not seek 161111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 to undo the judgment in Smith. What the Court was -- what2 Congress was responding to was the -- what it understood3 to be the test. It reinstated the compelling-interest4 test, but specifically said it was not disagreeing with5 the outcome of any particular case under that prior test.6 And three of those cases -- Hernandez, concerning the tax7 code; Lee, concerning the Social Security Act; and8 Braunfeld, regarding the Sunday closing laws -- were all9 ones that adopted the approach that I have suggested.10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But your -- but your11 approach is totally categorical. If you had a group that12 had, once a year, one drop of the hallucinogen involved13 here, per member, and it was rigorously policed, your14 position would still be the same --15 MR. KNEEDLER: Our --16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- even applying RFRA,17 which sets forth a compelling-interest test.18 MR. KNEEDLER: -- our principal position would19 be the same. And I -- and I think that that approach is20 consistent with Justice O'Connor's opinion in Smith, which21 got a lot of prominence in the subsequent debate about22 RFRA, because, in that -- in that opinion, even though the23 compelling-interest test was applied, Justice O'Connor24 concluded that that test was satisfied because --25 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But Congress disagreed,171111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425ultimately.  They allowed the use of peyote.          MR. KNEEDLER:  And that's an importantpoint. Congress doing it does not open the Controlled Substances Act to the individualized determinations by 700 District Courts. It makes --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler --JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but in --MR. KNEEDLER: -- a specialized judgment. JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- may Congress, consistentwith the Establishment Clause, say that we will create anexception for peyote, but not for this other church, whichhas far fewer members, less risk of diversion, has beenfound to be a genuine religion?  The problem of preferringone religious group over another, it seems to me, arisesonce there is an exception for the Native American And I heard you say, "Well, the Indian tribes arespecial," but is that -- that's it.  It would have--Church.to be          MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, we think that -- wethat's critical, because what -- just as in this Court'sdecision in Laurel, what Congress has done is to act torespect the autonomous, independent institutions of thetribe.  That also meets certain law enforcement concerns,because you have the tribal government, you have triballaw enforcement personnel, you have tribal culture and181111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005think￼1 tradition that is independent simply of the religion. You2 have -- you have the entire tribal cultural structure that3 Congress could quite reasonably regard as being different.4 And respecting that distinct political attribute of5 tribes under this Court's decision in Morton versus6 Mancari, we don't think, creates an Establishment Clause7 problem. What --8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I -- may I ask you one9 question about the procedural posture of this case? This10 is an appeal from a preliminary injunction. That's how it11 got here. And we have been discussing, mostly, the case12 just as though it had been a permanent injunction. The --13 there are pieces of this case, like the Treaty and what it14 allows and doesn't allow, that -- where the record is so15 thin. Is there a way of dealing with this case so there16 is the full airing that it never got, without resolving,17 at this point, other issues --18 19 2021 the Court22 a preliminary injunction, I think that the Court could23 quite readily reverse the preliminary injunction here,24 because that requires a clear showing of a substantial25 likelihood of success on the merits, plus that the otherMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I --JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you've been debating?MR. KNEEDLER: -- I -- on that limited point, if applied the usual standards for the granting of191111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 factors be decided. And with respect to the application2 of the Convention, that's really a question of law. And3 the United States took the position before the District4 Court in this case, that the Convention applied to the5 tea. We think it's unquestionably a mixture, and,6 therefore, a preparation within the meaning of the -- of7 the Convention, and the -- and the District Court's8 injunction really puts the United States in violation of9 an international agreement that is critical to prohibiting10 trafficking --11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they were --12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do --13 MR. KNEEDLER: -- in drugs.14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- do your briefs --15 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well --16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- indicate, or does the17 record indicate, that the Government was foreclosed from18 presenting any evidence it wanted to present? If you, for19 some reason, go back, and this whole thing is done again,20 whether they -- is there important additional evidence for21 you to introduce, or do we essentially have the case in22 front of us, so far as you're concerned?23 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, in -- as far as our24 position is concerned on our submission so far, we don't25 think the Court needs any further evidence. On the201111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 question of the application of the Convention, as we say,2 we believe that is a question of law. This Court has long3 deferred to the position of the executive branch on the4 interpretation of Conventions. And --5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I was a little6 unclear about your position on the Convention. I thought,7 at some -- one point, you said that it didn't really add8 much to your argument under the Controlled Substances Act,9 which implemented the Convention. Is --10 MR. KNEEDLER: No, it --11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- there an independent12 --13 MR. KNEEDLER: No, it --14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- argument?15 MR. KNEEDLER: No, we believe that complying16 with an international Convention designed to prohibit17 trafficking in drugs is, itself, a compelling interest.18 And the -- under this Court's decisions in --19 JUSTICE SOUTER: How --20 MR. KNEEDLER: -- that would be incorporated in21 RFRA. And it -- a -- an order that puts the United States22 in violation of that -- and the Court of Appeals didn't23 really deny -- a majority of the judges, anyway -- deny24 that this injunction requires the United States to violate25 the Convention --211111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it --2 MR. KNEEDLER: -- by facilitating the3 importation of drugs from outside the country.4 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what do you -- here's the5 problem that I have, particularly at the stage of the6 preliminary injunction, with that argument. The --7 they're -- the Convention also includes that provision8 that its terms will be defined, enforced, and so on, in9 harmony, or conformity, with the domestic law of the10 signatory. Our domestic law includes RFRA. That would11 seem to open the door for, in effect, a RFRA exception.12 1314 finish my15 --16 17 18 1920 have with21 not necessarily that that particular argument should, for22 all times, be assessed correctly by the -- by the District23 Court. But it seems to me that if the District Court at24 least plausibly reads that exception to negate your25 argument, isn't that good enough, at the preliminary221111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MR. KNEEDLER: No, that exception is --JUSTICE SOUTER: Let me -- let me -- let me just -- let me get to my -- let me get to my questionMR. KNEEDLER:  Sorry.JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- before you answer it.[Laughter.]JUSTICE SOUTER:  My -- the particular concern Ithat, at the preliminary injunction stage, is￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425injunction stage, as a basis for the Court saying, "Look,you haven't -- you, the Government -- haven't carried yourburden to show the affirmative defense here"?          MR. KNEEDLER:  This is a -- the interpretationof the Convention is a legal question, not a factual one.And Article 22 refers --JUSTICE SOUTER: It is, there's no question.But we're still at the preliminary injunction stage.          MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.  But respondent would bearthe -- would bear the burden of --JUSTICE SOUTER: Why does the respondent bearthe burden? You have the burden --MR. KNEEDLER: Because this is to --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- under the statute.MR. KNEEDLER: -- this is a change of the status quo. And to require the Government to allow the importation of a substance that's prohibited by the Convention. But if I --JUSTICE SOUTER: Well --MR. KNEEDLER: -- if I could --JUSTICE SOUTER: -- no, but I realize that --could we pause on that for a second?  Because youapparently take the position -- the Government takes theposition that when -- under the governing law, theGovernment would have an affirmative burden, ultimately,231111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 to defend -- in this case, on compelling interest, least2 restrictive, et cetera -- that, at the preliminary3 injunction stage, the applicant for the injunction has the4 burden to negate the probability that the Government will5 carry its burden on the ultimate issue. And I don't see6 why that should be so at all.7 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, at least with respect to8 the interpretation of a Convention, where the -- where the9 Government has taken --10 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but let --11 MR. KNEEDLER: No, I --12 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- just --13 MR. KNEEDLER: -- I under- --14 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- go through --15 MR. KNEEDLER: -- I understand the --16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Get to the Convention --17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I understand the broader18 point, but --19 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- later. Get to the general20 -- first get to the general issue. Does the applicant for21 the injunction have the burden to negate the probability22 that the Government will prevail in its affirmative23 defense, ultimately?24 MR. KNEEDLER: We --25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is that your position?241111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, that is our position, and we2 cite cases in the -- in the brief that say that. But it3 is not critical to the outcome of this case with respect4 to the Convention issue and several other of the issues5 that --6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well --7 MR. KNEEDLER: -- that I -- that I was going to8 --9 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the Convention --10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So --11 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- issue goes directly to your12 affirmative defense.13 MR. KNEEDLER: It goes -- but it is a question14 of law. And the article of the Convention that you're15 referring to is -- concerns the penal provisions. In16 other words, Article 7 of the Convention requires each17 party to prohibit -- this is Article 7, on page 288(a) --18 requires that -- each State to prohibit these substances.19 Twenty-two simply goes to the criminal provisions that20 each party's State will adopt internally to carry that21 out. But it doesn't -- it doesn't detract from the --22 from the categorical obligation under Article 7, which --23 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the --24 MR. KNEEDLER: -- would prohibit it.25 JUSTICE BREYER: -- part of the Treaty question251111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 that I had is also -- this is a root that you are -- and2 it contains DMT. And the Treaty doesn't ban everything3 that contains DMT -- for example, pineapple and bananas.4 The question is the ratio of the DMT to the entire plant.5 MR. KNEEDLER: Well --6 JUSTICE BREYER: And that sounds like a factual7 question that ought to be developed.8 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think where you have a9 mixture that -- a mixture of two plants that are put10 together for the specific purpose of using them for the11 hallucinogenic purposes, that goes far beyond simply12 whether a 1314 those? 15particular substance --JUSTICE BREYER: Pineapples, we -- what aboutMR. KNEEDLER: Well --JUSTICE BREYER: I drank pineapple --MR. KNEEDLER: Plants --JUSTICE BREYER: -- juice this morning. [Laughter.]MR. KNEEDLER: -- as such, are not covered. But16 17 18 19 2021 when you make a mixture of something for the specific22 purpose of releasing its hallucinogenic purpose --23 qualities, we think that that's clearly covered by the24 Convention.25 If I may reserve the -- 261111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SOUTER:  What do you say -- I'm sorry.MR. KNEEDLER:  I was just going to reserve the--          JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, you want to reserve yourtime.  Okay.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.          Ms. Hollander.           ORAL ARGUMENT OF NANCY HOLLANDER               ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS          MS. HOLLANDER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          The Government's position here, that the Courtshould completely defer to Congress's generalized findingto wholly exempt Schedule 1 of Controlled Substances Actfrom RFRA's mandate is fundamentally and structurallyincompatible with RFRA.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you seem to give the factthat it's listed in Schedule 1 zero weight.  It seems tome, at the very least, there should be a presumption thatthis is a compelling interest.MS. HOLLANDER: Yes, Your Honor, and --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And when the -- and when theevidence is in equipoise, as the district judge thought itwould, that presumption, it seems to me, carries the dayfor the Government.271111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MS. HOLLANDER: Your Honor, the District Court2 -- we give it deference, as did the District Court. Judge3 Parker specifically found, contrary to what the Government4 says, that he began by looking at Schedule 1, and he5 specifically says -- I believe it's on page 212(a) of the6 petitioner's appendix -- that he had to begin there. And7 he said, "This Court must give due regard for the fact8 that Congress put DMT into Schedule 1." But then he9 applied RFRA. And in applying RFRA, he went on to apply10 RFRA and to specifically find that applying RFRA, which11 requires not only a compelling interest, but a compelling12 interest to the person, that the Government did not meet13 its burden in this case of showing harm, any risk of harm,14 to these members, or any risk of diversion.15 And I'd like to go back, for a moment, to the16 issue of peyote, because, first of all, if you look at the17 congressional record in 1965, for what that's worth,18 there's not one mention -- and it's on page -- starts on19 page 480 of the joint appendix -- there's no mention of20 Indian tribes, there's no mention of sovereign issues with21 the Indian tribes. There's a mention of the Native22 American Church and the First Amendment and why this23 exemption has to be made. And, in fact, our record is --24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do we know whether you can be a25 member of that church without being an Indian?281111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MS. HOLLANDER: Yes, sir, we do, Your Honor. We2 know that. And it is throughout our brief. There's many3 mentions of it, the fact that there have been non-Native-4 American members since the beginning of the Native5 American Church. I would direct the Court to the easiest6 one, which is at the joint appendix at page 500, which is7 a memo from a DEA legal counsel talking about this. And,8 in fact, at the hearing in our case, on the very last day9 -- it was on November 2nd, 2001, at page 1933 -- Mr. Adam10 Zubin, representing the Government, specifically said, and11 I quote, "The Federal Government places no restrictions on12 who can participate in the Native American Church."13 So, we have two things. We have the exemption14 in 1965 --15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, your theory would be16 if you had a religious group that -- whose doctrine was17 that you should proselytize through hoasca, and they want18 everybody to come, and they're aggressive in doing that,19 and distributing hoasca, that the Government should be in20 a position of saying, "This religious group can use it,21 but that religious group can't"?22 MS. HOLLANDER: Your Honor, it would depend,23 again, on the facts of that case.24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, they're the kind of25 the -- the ones I just gave you. In other words, if291111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 there's going to be a greater threat of diversion to --2 it's not limited to the members of a very cohesive and3 limited group, but it's -- they're -- they aggressively4 try to reach out, but it's all part of a sincere religious5 belief, that we should, in applying RFRA, draw6 distinctions between the group you represent and that7 hypothetical group?8 MS. HOLLANDER: The distinctions -- yes and no,9 and let me explain, Your Honor -- Mr. Chief Justice -- the10 distinction is that if the Government could meet a11 compelling interest and actually show a risk of diversion12 --1314 show -- 151617181920 different21 would mean that, in that case, the Government would win.22 Now, I'd like to point out, although I realize23 you've just presented me with a hypothetical -- however,24 there are 250,000 members of the Native American Church,25 and the record in our case is that there's never been any301111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I'm assuming theyMS. HOLLANDER: -- that they --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that there is -- MS. HOLLANDER: -- showed it --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.MS. HOLLANDER: -- then they would have facts. And the different facts in that case￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425evidence of any diversion. And, although the Government has --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, if we --JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- think that the Treaty --the Convention entered into in 1971 -- makes clear thathoasca is covered, then does that provide a compellinginterest for the Government, because it requires theGovernment to prohibit the importation?  If we think, as amatter of law, the Convention covers hoasca.MS. HOLLANDER: No, Your Honor, it doesn't, because, again, the Government has -- we have to look at the Treaty, just like we look at any other law -- RFRA clearly says --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, if we conclude, lookingat the Treaty, that it prohibits hoasca, covers it, andthat it provides that nations that enter into theConvention must avoid importation of it, then is that acompelling interest under RFRA?MS. HOLLANDER: It may -- yes, Your Honor -- JUSTICE O'CONNOR: It is?MS. HOLLANDER: -- it may be a compellinginterest, but it still may not satisfy RFRA, because RFRAspecifically requires that it be a compelling interest tothe person.  And we -- the Government would have to put on311111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 evidence. And even though this is a question of law, that2 doesn't preclude the District Court hearing evidence which3 he has not heard at -- to this point -- put on evidence4 showing that the -- that the compelling interest the5 Government has asserted in this case, which is that it6 would lose its leadership position in the international7 community, would really be a compelling interest, and that8 it could not be accommodating.9 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that isn't the compelling10 interest. The compelling interest is, we signed a Treaty,11 and you follow it. Now, how can you say that the12 Government wouldn't have a compelling interest in13 following a Treaty where they -- where they promised to14 ban the substance? I mean, they're not -- they're just15 saying RFRA doesn't apply where that's at stake. Now,16 what's the argument against that? You're saying the17 argument against that is, maybe it really isn't a18 compelling interest? Well, okay. Why not? I mean, it19 sounds to me as if it would be. They have a Treaty. They20 have to live up to their word, period. What's wrong with21 that?22 MS. HOLLANDER: There's nothing wrong with that,23 Your Honor. The -- what's wrong with that is that RFRA24 requires the Government to go further than that.25 JUSTICE BREYER: It does? All right. That's an321111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 issue, I guess. I'd have to decide: Is a compelling and2 -- does it require the Government to go further? But you3 concede that if it doesn't require the Government to go4 further, you lose.5 MS. HOLLANDER: If the Treaty does include6 hoasca, which we believe that it doesn't.7 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, that's a8 different issue. Why doesn't it?9 MS. HOLLANDER: Why doesn't it? It doesn't.10 And the -- and, interestingly, the executive took the11 reverse position that it's taking here throughout the12 history of this Treaty until this litigation, and it13 doesn't cover hoasca, because it doesn't cover plants, or14 infusions from plants. And that is the position. And the15 reason why the U.S. would not lose its leadership position16 is that that's the position of Brazil, which allows17 religious use --18 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't care whose position it19 is. The language does not admit of that exception.20 There's nothing in the language of it that would suggest21 that exception at all. What language do you rely upon for22 that exception?23 MS. HOLLANDER: The Treaty -- we have to rely,24 Your Honor, on the Treaty as a whole. And what --25 JUSTICE SCALIA: As a whole, anywhere in it --331111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 give me language anywhere in the whole Treaty that --2 MS. HOLLANDER: What the --3 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- suggests that exception.4 MS. HOLLANDER: The Treaty that the -- the5 language that suggests that exception is, first of all, in6 Article 32, that talks about the traditional use of7 plants. It is in the fact that plants are not covered.8 And so, a9 10 1112 substance13 it. Tea is a solution, and it includes DMT. Isn't that14 the end of the issue?15 MS. HOLLANDER: No, Your Honor, it isn't. And16 the reason it isn't is, if we look -- several places, one17 is the conduct of our Treaty partners, none of whom agree18 with that position -- we look at --19 JUSTICE SOUTER: What's wrong -- can you tell20 me, on the face of it, what's wrong with it? I mean, I --21 if I have tea at 5 o'clock, I think I'm drinking a22 solution that includes the little things that come out of23 the tea leaves. And that's what we've got involved here.24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe our Treaty partners are25 just violating the Treaty.341111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005--JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but a --MS. HOLLANDER: -- preparation --JUSTICE SOUTER: -- solution that includes the DMT is covered, by definition, as I understand￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MS. HOLLANDER: Well, Your Honor, if they are, then we are, also --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well --          MS. HOLLANDER:          JUSTICE SOUTER:analysis of the solution?          MS. HOLLANDER:-- because --Tell me what's wrong with theThe --I have specific language from          JUSTICE BREYER:the Treaty's commentary in front of me that supports you.Are you not going to read that?         [Laughter.]because IMS. HOLLANDER: I was --JUSTICE SCALIA: She's not going to read it, asked her for language in the --MS. HOLLANDER: In the Treaty.JUSTICE SCALIA: -- Treaty. In --MS. HOLLANDER: I was --JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the Treaty --MS. HOLLANDER: I --JUSTICE SCALIA: -- not in the legislativehistory of the Treaty.          [Laughter.]          MS. HOLLANDER:  I was -- I was trying to answerJustice Scalia's question.  But let me say this.  And ofcourse I would read the language of the commentary and the351111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425INCB and the opinion of our former ambassador, Herbert Okun, in Brazil and France. But let me also say, if I may, that the position of the executive, until this -- until this litigation, has been the same. And the reason we know that is precisely what you said, Your Honor. Mescaline is also covered by the Treaty. Peyote is not. The Native --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I --MS. HOLLANDER: -- American --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- thought that'sbecause we made a special reservation for peyote.          MS. HOLLANDER:  No, Mr. Chief Justice.  We didmake a special reservation, but it didn't matter yet, because it's never been covered. That reservation, if you go back and look at what the Senate said at the time, and what -- there are no plants. They're just not listed in the Treaty. The purpose of the reservation was, in an abundance of caution, in case it would be -- in case it would be added in the future, then plants, and solutions from plants, would be covered. But as it stands now, members of the Native American Church drink a tea containing peyote and --JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, are you --MS. HOLLANDER: -- mescaline.JUSTICE SOUTER: -- saying that there are --361111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 there's basically an ambiguity in the Treaty, that2 solutions derived from plants are not covered, but3 solutions that include DMT are covered, and there --4 therefore, there is a question?5 MS. HOLLANDER: The -- yes, the ambiguity arises6 because what the Treaty means is that if you were to7 extract the DMT and then add it to something, which can't8 be done here and could have no religious meaning for the9 UDV, and we're not even sure if -- chemically, if it's10 possible.11 you would1213 number of14 into the water? Is that --15 MS. HOLLANDER: Well --16 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- correct?17 MS. HOLLANDER: -- Your Honor, I didn't write18 this Treaty, and I -- and I must say --If you were to extract it and then add it, then have a solution containing DMT. And that's -- JUSTICE SOUTER: But solution is defined by the steps in the process that gets the substance19 [Laughter.]20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, I'm not21 MS. HOLLANDER: -- that it --22 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- for it --23 MS. HOLLANDER: -- that it --24 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- but I --25 MS. HOLLANDER: -- that it --371111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-blaming you --Washington, DC 20005￼1 [Laughter.]2 MS. HOLLANDER: It's not the clear -- the3 clearest writing, but we know -- we know what its meaning4 is, and we do have to look at the travaux, which goes into5 long detail about why they even mention plants, because of6 their fear, in the future, that plants might be covered.7 Now, other plants are covered --8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can --9 MS. HOLLANDER: -- in a different Treaty. But10 --11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I make a suggestion as to12 why, even if it is covered by the Treaty, it may not be a13 compelling State interest to comply with the Treaty?14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Say yes. Let me him make that15 --16 MS. HOLLANDER: Yes.17 [Laughter.]18 MS. HOLLANDER: I'm just waiting.19 [Laughter.]20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It was the right answer.21 MS. HOLLANDER: I'm just trying --22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Because I haven't --23 MS. HOLLANDER: -- to be polite.24 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- it made. I -- I mean, isn't25 it well-established that statutes trump treaties, that if381111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Congress decides, in a subsequent statute, to ignore a2 Treaty, it may do so? Now, if this RFRA can trump a3 statute, it would seem to me, a fortiori, it can trump a4 Treaty.56 trump the 789MS. HOLLANDER: Yes, it can, Your Honor. It can Treaty, and that -- and that is --JUSTICE SCALIA: So, compliance --MS. HOLLANDER: -- correct.JUSTICE SCALIA: -- with a Treaty is not 10 necessarily a compelling State interest.11 MS. HOLLANDER: It is not. And -- but we don't12 even have to go that far, because, if we do the RFRA13 analysis, the Government must show a compelling interest14 to the person and, in addition --15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But, surely --16 MS. HOLLANDER: -- the --17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- surely RFRA doesn't say18 that you disregard treaties or you disregard statutes in19 determining what's a compelling interest.20 MS. HOLLANDER: No. You don't disregard them,21 Your Honor, but --22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And getting back to the first23 question that Justice Breyer asked -- and then we got off24 on what the Treaty really means -- but assuming that the25 Treaty does prohibit the importation of this substance --391111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 assuming that -- is there any evidence that the District2 Court thought that this was a compelling interest?3 MS. HOLLANDER: Well, the -- no, the District4 Court --5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: None at all.6 MS. HOLLANDER: -- analyzed the Treaty7 differently, and analyzed the Treaty to not apply to8 hoasca, for all the reasons that are -- that are in his9 opinion in our brief. And, therefore --10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, if we disagree with you on11 the Treaty, then the appellate court's opinion doesn't12 really even address the point whether or not this and/or13 the statute, together, can be a compelling interest.14 MS. HOLLANDER: That's correct. If you disagree15 with the District Court on that, then the case should be16 remanded for it to -- for additional --17 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know if there isn't a18 factual question here. I mean, I thought Justice Scalia,19 if it were to be up to him, did take into account official20 commentaries to treaties. But maybe he doesn't. Anyway,21 I take them into account. And I -- and in respect to22 that, I read this as saying, specifically, that the plants23 -- it doesn't include the substance if it is a substance24 clearly distinguished from the substance constituting its25 active principal -- and the example they give is mimosa401111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425root, which contains DMT.MS. HOLLANDER: That's true. And --          JUSTICE BREYER:  And then, that's also true ofthe bananas and pineapples, et cetera.  And there's acourt holding that hoasca's out of it, in France and onein the Netherlands, all of which I think was relevant to aTreaty.  All right?  Now, the Government has come in witha counterargument and said it clearly does cover, I guess,even mimosa roots, where they are imported solely for thepurpose of extracting DMT.  Now, what's the response tothat?MS. HOLLANDER: The response to that, Your Honor, is that there is no DMT extracted in this case. Although the Government said that in their brief, there is no evidence of that, and it is contrary to the evidence --          CHIEF JUSTICEextracted at some pointhere -- to get into thepreparation of the tea.ROBERTS:  Well, it has to beto be -- to get into -- I'm righttea, right?  It's extracted by theMS. HOLLANDER: No, Mr. Chief --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The plants are not --the plants are not imported, right?  Just the tea.MS. HOLLANDER: The tea is imported. But the -- CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.MS. HOLLANDER: -- but the tea is made just like411111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425you would make tea if you mixed chamomile and mint, and then --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.MS. HOLLANDER: -- and then you took the leaves out. What you have --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.MS. HOLLANDER: -- in that tea is a collection of a tremendous number of alkaloids. And what the commentary is saying is that you would have to pull this alkaloid out. And that would be a chemical process. There's further -- there's further --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess I -- if I could just go back to the point. You're emphasizing that the Treaty doesn't cover the importation of plants. But you're not importing plants, you're --MS. HOLLANDER: That --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- importing a mixturethat must contain the covered hallucinogen or it doesn'thave its effect.          MS. HOLLANDER:  That's correct.  However, underthe Treaty, it's not -- it's not covered by the Treaty,because it is not separate.  If DMT were separated, thenit would be covered by the Treaty.  And, actually, if youlook at the 1988 Treaty, going even farther, and itscommentary, the commentary in the 1988 Treaty, which has421111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 to be read in connection with the 1971 Treaty,2 specifically defines preparation as the extraction --3456 tea would 7CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, under your --MS. HOLLANDER: -- of the drug.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- theory, a marijuana not be covered by the Treaty.MS. HOLLANDER: Not by this Treaty. But that -- 8 marijuana, coca leaves and poppies are specifically9 covered by the 1961 Treaty.10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but they're not11 being imported, they're transformed into this tea. And12 you -- saying the active substance isn't there13 independently, so it's not covered. And that seems to me14 to be a -- an erroneous reading of the Treaty.15 MS. HOLLANDER: Well, the difference, for16 example, with marijuana, is that if you look at the 196117 Treaty, it says "the plant, all parts of the plant,18 everything from the plant." It's all covered. What the19 1971 Treaty did was different. And if you read the 197120 Treaty and the 1988 Treaty and their commentaries, if I21 can rely on their commentaries, and the International22 Narcotics Control Board, what they are expressing is a23 concern for the traditional religious and mystical use of24 plants in religion, and that's what they were concerned25 about, and that's why they didn't put this in, and that's431111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 why they specifically have, in the commentary, that the2 example of mimosa -- and they also have an example of3 peyote in the same paragraph 12, where they --4 JUSTICE SCALIA: About commentary or travaux, I5 don't mind using them for treaties, so long as they don't6 contradict the Treaty. Do we have any case where we use7 the -- les travaux preparatoires to actually contradict8 the language of the Treaty?9 MS. HOLLANDER: Not to my --10 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's what, it seems to11 me, is going on here.12 MS. HOLLANDER: No, Your Honor, it's not13 contradicting the Treaty, because the Government is taking14 this one sentence preparation, and the Government has a15 definition of it, for this litigation only, that is16 contrary to the definition in the Treaty the way it is17 interpreted by the travaux and by the commentary, and by18 this executive, which means that the executive's position19 here is really entitled to no deference; because,20 otherwise, the tea drunk by the Native American Church,21 the peyote tea, would also be covered.22 JUSTICE BREYER: But, as -- I understand the23 Treaty. What the Treaty says is, you can't import24 substances listed in Schedule 1. Then you look at25 Schedule 1, and it doesn't say hoasca.441111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MS. HOLLANDER: That's --JUSTICE BREYER: It says "DMT." And then it has another -- and, interpreting that, it says the fact, if you look at that list and it says "DMT," means what it says: You can't import DMT. It's a drug importation statute, and it doesn't cover plants that contain the substance DMT. Otherwise, we'd have -- throw out bananas and -- or mimosa, anyway. And we're not looking to intent on that. Now, that's a possible interpretation that doesn't contradict anything. And --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, except that youdon't import the plants, right?MS. HOLLANDER: That's correct. And we don't import DMT. We import a tea that contains an enormous number of alkaloids. And it was clear in --JUSTICE BREYER: You're in trouble. That's harder, then, if it's --MS. HOLLANDER: It was -- it's clear --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But, of course, the reason youimport it is because it contains this particularsubstance.[Laughter.]          MS. HOLLANDER:  That's correct, Your Honor.That is correct.  However, the Treaty wanted to be -- theTreaty writers were very careful to not impinge on451111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425traditional religious use.  And RFRA -- and there's onemore thing that I've been trying to say, and that is thatRFRA requires not just a compelling interest, but acompelling interest to the person, and it requires least-restrictive means.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know what you mean bythat.  You said that before, too.You saidperson?MS. HOLLANDER: Least --JUSTICE STEVENS: Could you explain that again? a compelling interest to the -- what person? CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To the person. To whatMS. HOLLANDER: To the aggrieved person. To this particular --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Isn't the compelling interestin enforcing it against the aggrieved person.  Isn't thatwhat you mean?But --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.MS. HOLLANDER:  That's right.  That's correct.JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, okay.          MS. HOLLANDER:  -- but RFRA also requires thatthe Government prove, if it proves a compelling interest,to enforce it against the person, andalso must prove that it is furthering46if it gets there, itthat compellingWashington, DC 20005 1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-￼1 interest by the least restrictive means. Now --2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if the interest is3 defined, as Mr. Kneedler did -- that is, these drugs are4 "No, absolutely prohibited." -- then how can you have any5 less restrictive means? It seems to me that you can -- I6 understand your argument about a compelling State interest7 has to be judged in context -- to the person, to this8 church. But if Mr. Kneedler is correct that the9 compelling State interest is that this is a proscribed10 drug, then there can't be any least restrictive means.11 MS. HOLLANDER: Well, I disagree, Your Honor.12 For example, other countries that have domestic policies13 have found ways to accommodate that have not violated the14 Treaty. For example, Switzerland provides needles and15 heroin to its -- to its drug users. And the United States16 has not objected that this is a violation of the Treaty.17 JUSTICE SCALIA: What about --18 MS. HOLLANDER: And --19 JUSTICE SCALIA: I worry about the general20 proposition we would be adopting if we say, you know, one21 narrow exception is not a -- doesn't contravene a22 compelling State interest. What about -- I assume there23 is still a Federal law against bigamy that applies in24 Federal territories. Now, what if, you know, a small25 religious group comes forward and said, you know, "We --471111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 our religion requires bigamy. There are not a whole lot2 of us. We're just a little tiny group. So, we demand,3 under RFRA, an exemption from this absolute law. Why does4 it have to be absolute? It's just a little tiny5 exception, only a few of us."6 MS. HOLLANDER: Well --7 JUSTICE SCALIA: At least for now.8 [Laughter.]9 MS. HOLLANDER: Until they reproduce.10 [Laughter.]11 MS. HOLLANDER: Your Honor, the analysis would12 be the same. First, that religion would have to prove it13 was a sincere religion and meet that burden. And then the14 Government could come forward with a compelling interest15 that -- and the -- and perhaps find the same thing that16 was found in Reynolds, which was not a strict scrutiny17 case, but may come out the same way -- the sanctity of18 marriage, the other issues. And those would be issues of19 fact for a district judge to decide, under his discretion.20 And it -- all RFRA does is give every religious21 organization, the minority ones and the majority ones, the22 opportunity to go into court as an aggrieved person and23 make their claim and see whether the Government can meet24 its burden.25 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you a question? It's481111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425a bit tangential just a little bit, but going back to theChief Justice's question earlier about diversion?  And hissuggestion was, if they're -- proselyte the religion, youget all sorts of converts who will just use it in the sameway as the small number use it now.  Would that bediversion, or would it be diversion -- diverting it tosome people who are not members of the religion?MS. HOLLANDER: Well --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  What does the word "diversion"mean in this context?MS. HOLLANDER: "Diversion," Your Honor, is a term of art here. And I thought I answered it that way, but maybe I was unclear. It means diversion from licit use to illicit use. So, it's --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, but then, getting moremembers to -- converted to the religion would not bediversion.MS. HOLLANDER: No, it would not be diversion. There would only be a problem if the Government, for example, showed --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Okay.          MS. HOLLANDER:  -- that there was some diversionoutside.  And that's why I used the example of the NativeAmerican Church; there's never been any diversion.I'd like to go back to one other issue that 491111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 perhaps I didn't make clear. What the -- it's true that2 the UDV does not import the plants. But it's those plants3 that are sacred to the UDV. It can't substitute them.4 Not only is DMT in bananas and pineapple, but Phalaris5 grass, for example, that -- and there's a picture of one6 in our joint appendix at about page 518, I believe --7 grows in this country. A recreational user could just go8 and, you know, mix the Phalaris --9 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but --10 MS. HOLLANDER: -- grass.11 JUSTICE BREYER: -- I don't see -- I mean, I see12 I was not right. You do import drums of tea. And they13 say, in the Treaty, that a preparation is a solution or14 mixture containing a substance. And it would seem to be a15 solution or a mixture containing DMT. And the commentary16 that I thought helped you does concern plants, but you're17 not importing plants. So, now I'm rather troubled to see18 if there is any way that this Treaty is interpreted in a19 manner that allows you to win. What is it?20 MS. HOLLANDER: Well, the -- what the commentary21 says is that it is not a covered preparation, that an22 infusion or tea made from the roots of a plant is not a23 covered preparation, and that --24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Hollander, may I just, on25 this point -- it's the same question I raised with Mr.501111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Kneedler. We're talking about a preliminary injunction.2 Your side, I think, said, "Go for the permanent3 injunction. We have a lot more to put in." The4 presentation on the Treaty was rather thin, below. I take5 it from Mr. Kneedler's argument that he's saying the6 preliminary injunction, or not, is really the thing. If7 the Government wins, no preliminary injunction. There's8 not going to be any show for a permanent injunction. But,9 on your side of it, what more would you be putting in?10 Let's say you prevail at the preliminary injunction stage.11 Would you then say, "See, Judge, now you can enter a12 permanent injunction"? Or you -- would you be putting in13 more evidence? And if so, what kind?14 MS. HOLLANDER: Well, we certainly have a great15 deal of more evidence, Your Honor, that we can put in. We16 have substantial evidence on the Treaty, and evidence we17 haven't even talked about here, proving that this hoasca18 is not covered by the Treaty. We have additional health19 and safety evidence. We have additional evidence to show20 lack of diversion. We have additional evidence that Judge21 Parker talks about to show targeting of the religion and22 selective prosecution. We have a great deal more evidence23 we can put on. But, of course, it depends on what the24 Government puts on. Because, at this point, the25 Government has not met any of its burdens.511111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Now, you're correct about the Treaty. None of2 that has gone on. The Government resisted any evidence3 about the Treaty, resisted the very best evidence, which4 was the International Narcotics Control Board's opinion5 that hoasca is not covered by the Treaty. And we now have6 -- we now have more that we would put on.7 And, you know, what the church and its members8 seek is just the right to practice their religious faith,9 as Congress guaranteed them in RFRA. Because Congress10 guaranteed and recognized that religious liberty is a core11 value in this country. Two courts below found, on a12 lengthy factual record, that the Government had not met13 the burdens Congress imposed. This Court should do --14 even if this Court believes that it's a close question --15 should do then what it did in Ashcroft v. ACLU, affirm the16 preliminary injunction, remand this case for a trial on17 the merits.18 If this Court were to do anything less than19 that, it's really to deny Congress's intent and Congress's20 policy here, because Congress's policy is that religious21 freedom, religious liberty, shall not be burdened unless,22 and until, the Government meets its burdens. The District23 Court clearly found, and said, that the Government did not24 show a risk of harm, did not show a risk of diversion;25 and, therefore, he found that the Government did not meet521111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425its compelling interests in this case.  And we would askthe Court to affirm the preliminary injunction, remandthis case to the District Court.Thank you.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Ms.Hollander.          Mr. Kneedler, you have 4 minutes left.        REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER               ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS          MR. KNEEDLER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.          If I may focus first on the question ofimportation, no country in the world would permit theexportation and importation of preparations that contain asubstance listed under the Convention, because the expresswords of the -- of the Convention prohibit it.  And thecommentary that is cited does -- all it says it thatplants, as such, are not covered.  The plants themselvesare not included in the schedule.  It then has footnotesdescribing how the plants may be used, how -- in a mixtureor a solution that contain the DMT or some other subject.And that's precisely the sort of thing that the Convention was designed to prohibit. And --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But what -- but whatdoes that benefit you?  I mean -- I guess this is JusticeScalia's question he asked earlier -- the Treaty is -- it531111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425seems to me if you're willing to override a duly enactedstatute, the Treaty shouldn't have any greater status.          MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I don't think RFRA doesoverride it. What RFRA does is take the compelling interests that the Government already has in enacted laws or treaties, as they are, and then you apply -- you apply RFRA to them. And that's --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You think the Treatygives you a more compelling governmental interest than theControlled Substances Act?MR. KNEEDLER: I certainly do. And the two together, I think, are doubly compelling, because the Government -- the United States has a compelling interest in encouraging this, and section 801(a) --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  More than doubly.  It has to bedoubly, plus a little, if you said that one is even morethan the other.          [Laughter.]          JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that's okay.          MR. KNEEDLER:  But Congress itself, in thestatute implementing this Convention, said it is essentialto have international cooperation in the protection of the-- of thestatutorydrugs covered by the statute.  So, you have adetermination that this is critical, anyway.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, we have to agree541111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 with you, though, that our Treaty partners in this area2 have, sort of, a zero-tolerance approach to enforcing the3 Treaty.4 MR. KNEEDLER: No, not at all. First, the5 United -- as a general matter, of course, the United6 States has a compelling interest in living up to its7 treaties. But, under this Treaty, in particular, the8 United States has to be in a position to go to other9 countries, maybe countries that are dragging their feet10 about whether to take enforcement measures, and say, "You11 have an obligation to strictly construe this Convention."12 And if they are able to come back and say that you have -13 - you, yourselves, have not been doing that, that14 undermines the ability of the United States in enforcing a15 Treaty designed to prohibit international trafficking in16 controlled substances. And nothing in this Court's first17 amendment cases would have suggested that there is a free-18 exercise right --19 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's actually why I've20 been looking. I'm bothered by it, because it -- if the21 Treaty is absolute, we reserve for peyote, which would22 mean the religious use of peyote by the Native American23 tribes is exempt, but other people who have identical24 religions, use identical substances, they're stuck. And25 that, it seems to me, is a rather rough problem under the551111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425First Amendment.MR. KNEEDLER: Well --JUSTICE BREYER: One religion singled out. And, therefore, I'm looking for some way in this Treaty not to reach that conclusion --MR. KNEEDLER: Well, with --JUSTICE BREYER: -- for the constitutionalreason.          MR. KNEEDLER:  -- with respect to peyote, theConvention does not allow the importation or exportationor international trafficking in any substance that thereis a reservation taken for.  It is a reservation only forthe domestic use of plants that are native to thatcountry.  So, peyote cannot be exported or imported underthis -- under this Convention.  And so, the idea -- so,there's nothing inconsistent with respect to thefundamental threshold question of importation, but, evenso, we think, in Congress's specific Indian power, thatthat -- that that could be different.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. --MR. KNEEDLER: The --JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- Kneedler, if you prevail,would there be anything left over to be argued about inthe -- for permanent injunction?MR. KNEEDLER: No. In our view, on the -- on 561111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 the legal -- now, on our principal submission, no, there2 would not be anything further, because under -- in our3 view, there's a categorical prohibition against Schedule 14 substances. That is the compelling interest. The5 question, then, is whether -- as this Court said in Lee,6 and as Justice O'Connor said in her concurring opinion in7 Smith, the question is whether an exception would unduly8 interfere with carrying out that interest, or whether it9 would be a least effective -- less effective means, in10 terms of being less effective. And we think there's no11 question that any exception to a categorical bar would12 violate that standard.13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.14 The case is submitted.15 [Whereupon, at 12:04 p.m., the case in the16 above-entitled matter was submitted.]17 181920212223241111 14th Street, NW, Suite 40057 1-Washington, DC 20005
