WAXMAN: Well, it's -- Your Honor, I3, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005Mr. Waxman.ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMANON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it Court:Unlike the two cases in which you heard￼1 guess I have a two-fold answer. First of all, the --2 the constitutional right involved is the Sixth3 Amendment right, unlike in Miranda, the Fifth4 Amendment right of self-incrimination. And in -- in5 Oregon v. Elstad and Chavez v. Martinez, this Court6 recognized that although the Fifth Amendment7 self-incrimination right is not completed until the8 statement or its fruits are introduced at trial, the9 primary illegality, as this Court has used the10 phrase, is the coercion of the confession, and the11 Elstad rule doesn't apply where the primary12 illegality is constitutionally-proscribed conduct.13 And here, this Court has not formally14 decided whether the Sixth Amendment is violated at15 the time the uncounseled, post-indictment statement16 is deliberately elicited, or only when the statement17 or fruits are admitted, that briefs of both sides18 rehearse for the Court somewhat conflicting19 statements in different opinions.20 We rely on the cases cited in footnote 521 on page 8 of our reply brief, but for purposes of22 this case, Your Honor, it doesn't matter, because in23 Elstad, this Court made clear, and reiterated in24 Chavez, that although the Fifth Amendment violation25 is incomplete at the time a confession is coerced,4, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 nonetheless the fruits of that confession have to be2 suppressed under the derivative evidence rule, unless3 the Government carries its burden to prove sufficient4 attenuation of taint. And therefore, even if the5 conduct deliberately eliciting from Mr. Fellers his6 inculpatory statement at a time when the officers7 knew he had been indicted, and the prosecution knew8 that he had a right to the advice of counsel, the9 fruits of that statement under Nix and Wade have to10 be suppressed. That's a rule that this Court has11 applied in Fourth Amendment, Fifth Amendment, and12 Sixth Amendment cases.13 QUESTION: Do police officers generally14 know this distinction, that when an indictment has15 been handed down, suddenly the Sixth Amendment is in16 the case as well as the Fifth? There's an element of17 fiction to it in that the person doesn't have a18 lawyer yet. As a bright line rule, I guess, we need19 some point to know when proceedings have commenced,20 but I - I still think there's an element of fiction21 in it.22 MR. WAXMAN: Well, Justice Kennedy, I23 don't -- I don't think I would call it fiction. I'm24 no more able to -- to testify than the member of this25 Court would be as to exactly what training the police5, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 are told. But this Court has long established, long2 maintained that the Sixth Amendment cuts very bright3 lines. It is specific to the offense and it begins4 only when, but when, the state makes the unilateral5 determination to change its formal relationship with6 an individual from one in which the individual may or7 may not be under investigation, but the --8 QUESTION: Mr. Waxman, you -- you're9 making a -- a very technical distinction, if I10 understand you correctly. If we focus on the suspect11 in the case of no indictment yet, who has been12 arrested, and the person who has been indicted and13 then arrested, and they're both alone with the same14 police officers in the same jail cell, and they're15 both subjected to the same interrogation. Why should16 the derivative evidence rule apply to the one or not17 the other? If we're talking about constitutional18 rights, it seems to me that these two individuals are19 similarly situated.20 MR. WAXMAN: Well, they -- they aren't,21 Your Honor, and I don't think this is a matter of22 technicality or formality. It is a matter of23 formalism, but the two different amendments -- the24 Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination,25 and the Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of6, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 counsel throughout criminal prosecution, protect very2 different things. The first protects voluntariness,3 and the second protects the right of someone as to4 whom the Government has formally set its face and5 invoked a formal adversarial process.6 QUESTION: The point is why -- why should7 that make a difference other than the convenience of8 the bright line? As in Justice Ginsburg's9 hypothetical, it could be the same drug ring, the10 same investigation, just the grand jury has -- hasn't11 got around to indicting the second defendant until12 the next day and then their rights are different.13 MR. WAXMAN: Your -- Your Honor, it's --14 it is entirely true that if the Court agrees with --15 agrees with our submission here, that the Government16 can very easily conform its conduct simply by not17 conducting uncounseled interrogations or elicitations18 prior to changing its status. But the -- the -- we19 have to examine, this Court has exhorted counsel over20 and over again to be clear about what the underlying21 right is protected in determining what the22 appropriate remedy is.23 And the right here is not coercion. The24 right here is not just addressed at police. It's25 addressed at the prosecution. And there is a7, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 difference. You may call it technical, but it is in2 fact the hallmark of our adversary system that once3 the Government decides to invoke a formal adversary4 process, it proceeds on the supposition that each5 side deals with each other, A, at arm's length, and6 B, assisted by the advice of counsel, who will7 prevent each side, and in particularly the defendant,8 from, as this Court has explained in -- from9 conviction resulting from his own ignorance of his10 legal and constitutional rights, and that's what's11 being protected.12 The unindicted individual, as to whom the13 Government may be conducting an investigation,14 doesn't have that formal right, but once the15 Government invokes our adversarial system, it invokes16 a set of protections that protect, not an17 individual's right to be protected from coercion or18 involuntariness -- that's protected no matter when19 the custodial -20 QUESTION: Well, how -- how far does this21 right go, Mr. Waxman? Are you -- are you saying that22 police officers can't talk to someone who has been23 indicted?24 MR. WAXMAN: Oh no, of course not. Your25 Honor has made clear for the - in his opinion for the8, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Court in Patterson v. Illinois -- I believe it was2 Your Honor -- in any event, the Court made clear in3 Patterson v. Illinois that the Sixth Amendment right4 to the assistance of counsel doesn't prevent the5 Government from eliciting statements from an indicted6 defendant. It requires that the accused either have7 counsel or make a waiver of the right to counsel, and8 the Court --9 QUESTION: Well, but it's - it's - I'm -10 I'm talking about a situation where, say the police11 simply say12 There's no1314 a right, Your Honor, if what -- if the police15 statements and conduct amount to what this Court has16 deemed deliberate elicitation. That is, that what17 the Court has said in a half a dozen cases is that18 the Government may not do without counsel is19 deliberately elicit incriminating statements in the20 absence of his lawyer.21 QUESTION: And you think that's what22 happened here?23 MR. WAXMAN: I am -- I am absolutely24 certain that that's what happened here, and the --25 QUESTION: That was the finding of the9, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005something to a -- an indicted defendant. violation of a right there, is there?MR. WAXMAN: There only is a violation of￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425magistrate and the --MR. WAXMAN: Yes. The magistrate whoheard that police officers, Justice O'Connor, found specifically that officers --QUESTION: He found deliberate eliciting of the comments at the first statement?MR. WAXMAN: Yes. He said it was, quote, designed to elicit a response -- I'm quoting from page 103 of the joint appendix --QUESTION: Is that a factual finding or -- MR. WAXMAN: It is.QUESTION: -- or a legal conclusion? Imean,itseemstomehecan--hecanfindasafact what the officer said, but whether it constitutes deliberate elicitation within the meaning of our - of our opinion, it seems to me, is a legal question.MR. WAXMAN: Well, it's - I think, Your Honor, Justice Scalia, it's -- this is a mixed question of law and fact under Miller v. Fenton and Thompson v. Keohane. But because --QUESTION: And the Eighth -- the Eighth Circuit said, the Eighth Circuit is the closest court to this one, and I thought that the Eighth Circuit said, and that it's a threshold question in this case, that it wasn't anything like interrogation, and10, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that that's -- wasn't that the -- the -- MR. WAXMAN: The Eighth --QUESTION: -- prime ground of the EighthCircuit?MR. WAXMAN: Justice Ginsburg, the Eighth Circuit -- two judges, the majority, the panel in the Eighth Circuit, concluded that it wasn't interrogation. The concurring judge --QUESTION: But wouldn't we have to answerthat --MR. WAXMAN: -- pointed out, Judge Riley pointed out, that under the Sixth Amendment, unlike the Fifth, interrogation is not the standard. The standard is deliberate elicitation, or, as this Court has also phrased it, whether the prosecution, quote, intentionally creates a situation likely to induce the accused to make incriminating statements without the advise of counsel.QUESTION: I thought the Eighth Circuit's position was that all this was was the police informing the defendant that he had been charged with this and this crime.MR. WAXMAN: That is -- the -- the -- I don't believe the Eighth Circuit made any such finding, but the magistrate who heard the two11, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 officers testify and evaluated their credibility made2 a determination, Justice Scalia, that is a mixed3 question of fact and law. The inquiry under the4 Sixth Amendment, deliberate elicitation or5 intentional creation of a situation, or purposeful6 conduct, which are the words this Court has used,7 involve a determination, among other things, about8 the credibility of what the officers said.9 And when the magistrate concluded that10 they -- that their conduct was designed to elicit a11 response, and that it was not made for any purpose12 other than to get a response --13 QUESTION: Well, was - was there any14 debate or controversy about what they in fact said?15 MR. WAXMAN: There was no debate about16 what they said, but -- but there was a credibility17 finding made by the magistrate, because the --18 QUESTION: If there was -- if there was no19 factual dispute, why - why did -- why was credibility20 involved?21 MR. WAXMAN: Well, when you have -- when22 you -- because there is a subjective intent here, the23 subjective intent of whether Officer Bliemeister, he24 came to the house knowing that this man had been25 indicted, and said, we are here to discuss with you12, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 your involvement with methamphetamine and your2 involvement with four individuals.3 QUESTION: Well, why -- why should4 subjective intent make any difference here? I mean,5 the -- the effect on the -- on the accused is exactly6 the same.7 MR. WAXMAN: Your Honor, I'm -- I'm simply8 reciting back for -- for you the court's9 instructions, and -- and saying that if the standard10 is deliberate elicitation and intentionally creating11 a situation, it essentially, in terms of providing a12 line, it proscribes what the police may not13 deliberately do, and --14 QUESTION: Well --15 MR. WAXMAN: -- but deliberateness, I16 think, is a finding of the magistrate, which -- to17 which the Eighth Circuit and this Court owe18 deference.19 QUESTION: But deliberateness may refer to20 nothing more than intending the statement that was21 made, and whether it elicits or not, or whether it22 constitutes elicitation -- what a terrible word --23 whether it constitutes elicitation, it seems to me,24 can be judged objectively, can't it?25 MR. WAXMAN: Your Honor, perhaps, but13, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 designed to elicit, it strikes me as including a2 subjective component. But even if I'm wrong, I3 submit that the magistrate was correct as an a priori4 matter in saying, look, these people -- these5 officers -- these agents of the prosecution, came to6 this man's house. They not only knew he had been7 indicted, Officer Bliemeyer had been the witness --8 QUESTION: Bliemeister, I think.9 MR. WAXMAN: Bliemeister -- had been the10 witness before the grand jury, and he comes --11 QUESTION: Mr. -- Mr. Waxman, I -- I will12 assume that that is correct. I mean, I -- the record13 looks to me just as you're describing it. But14 assuming that, do you think there is any practical15 difference between what Deputy Bliemeister did here16 and what the officer did in Elstad?17 MR. WAXMAN: I don't remember what the18 officer did in Elstad.19 QUESTION: Well, in -- in Elstad, the --20 there were two officers, one went with the mother of21 the suspect into the kitchen to tell her why they22 were there. The other one -- excuse me -- stayed in23 another room with the -- with the boy who was the24 suspect and started telling them what they were there25 to -- to investigate, there was a burglary next door.14, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425And at the end of the conversation that's quoted in the opinion he said, you know, I -- I think you may know something about that, and the boy said, yes he did. And it seems to me that the elicitation there was functionally about the same as the elicitation here.MR. WAXMAN: Well, that --QUESTION: But I want to know whether youagree.MR. WAXMAN: I -- I actually don't agree. I think -- I think for other reasons, that is, the -- the fact that this is a Sixth Amendment it doesn't matter. But I do think --QUESTION: Well --MR. WAXMAN: -- when the police officers come and say, we are here to discuss with you the following things, which happened to be the precise things that he has just been indicted for, that is a paradigm -- paradigmatic deliberate elicitation.QUESTION: Well, yeah, but --MR. WAXMAN: And --QUESTION: -- to -- to say to a kid, youknow, I think you may know something about this, and the person making that statement's a cop, sounds like elicitation to me.15, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. WAXMAN: Well, if -- if -- Mr. --2 QUESTION: Functionally -- if -- if3 functionally it is, let's assume -- I -- I tend to4 think it is -- and -- and functionally in each case,5 whether it's Fifth Amendment right or Sixth Amendment6 right, the statement doesn't come in unless there is,7 among other things, a voluntary waiver of the right8 to the presence of counsel then and there. And in --9 in each case we didn't have it. It's hard for me to10 see why in functional terms it should make a11 difference whether we're talking about Sixth or Fifth12 and why there should be a difference between this13 case and Elstad.14 MR. WAXMAN: Because the functional15 analysis depends on the right being protected. The16 Fifth Amendment right does not embed a policy against17 deliberate elicitation of information from suspects.18 In fact, our system embraces that. And if there was19 a violation in Elstad, it was --20 QUESTION: Well, neither does the Sixth.21 The -- what the Sixth says is, before you try22 anything like that, you've either got to have his23 counsel present or his counsel permission or his24 waiver of it. What's the difference?25 MR. WAXMAN: It -- the difference is16, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 what's being protected. What's being protected in2 the Fifth is coercion. What's being protected in the3 Sixth in this instance is precisely what --4 QUESTION: Well, Mr. Waxman, isn't it also5 true that in one case there was an indictment, in the6 other there wasn't?7 MR. WAXMAN: Well, yes. And what the8 Sixth Amendment protects in terms, Justice Souter, is9 that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall10 enjoy the right to the assistance of counsel.11 QUESTION: And -- and recognize he's got12 that right because there was the indictment. And in13 the Fifth Amendment case, the Miranda case, we14 recognized that he's got that right, because this15 Court has said that's the only way you're going to16 make the Fifth Amendment work. So we start with the17 assumption that he's got the right, and that in fact18 the elicitation or statements that produce his19 statement are -- are -- are improper. His statement20 is inadmissible unless there's a waiver of the right21 to the presence of counsel at that time.22 MR. WAXMAN: Absolutely. And that gets us23 right to Elstad, and the line that this Court drew in24 Elstad at the very outset of its opinion, which is25 that the consequences of an interrogation in17, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 violation of Miranda differ importantly from the2 consequences of a violation of the Constitution3 itself, that is, primary illegality that goes4 directly, without prophylaxis, to what the5 Constitution proscribes. And this Court said over6 and over and over again in Elstad that we will not7 apply a derivative evidence rule where the violation8 is only the former, but we will apply it in the9 latter.10 And that is the key distinction in this11 case. The distinction is not that the12 that they elicited from Mr. Fellers at13 didn't also violate Miranda, if he was14 the court found that he was, they did.15 QUESTION: But most of our Miranda cases,16 we recognize that the -- the police nationwide17 understand the dynamics of Miranda. I have no18 empirical basis, and apparently you don't knowstatementshis homein custody and￼19 either. My assumption is most20 be very surprised if there's a21 Fifth and Sixth --22 MR. WAXMAN: But --23 QUESTION: -- their24 Amendment obligations in -- in25 circumstances.18, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005police officers would difference betweenFifth and Sixth this -- in these1 MR. WAXMAN: But Justice Kennedy, I submit2 to you that it doesn't matter as a matter of3 constitutional prophylaxis. It may very well -- what4 the police officers know is, they knew they had to5 give him his Miranda warnings there. That we can be6 sure of. And they also knew that there would be7 consequences for not doing it, and this is not just8 the police. If it -- if it please the Court, this is9 the prosecution. Once there is an indictment, the10 police are not acting on their own. The police are11 part of the government prosecution, and if police12 don't know that, and are trying to game the system13 the way we heard it yesterday, it's the burden of the14 prosecution -- the prosecution and the Government to15 make sure that they do understand that.16 What we're talking about here is the17 preservation of -- as this Court has said it --18 equality -- equality of each side once the Government19 unilaterally define -- changes its posture with20 respect to someone so that that person is accused,21 and when it does that, it has to make -- it has to22 take steps to avoid interfering with the ability of23 the defendant at all critical stages and all24 confrontations to proceed based on ignorance or25 misapprehension of his rights or the legal19, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 consequences.2 I realize this sounds like --3 QUESTION: Mr. Waxman, can I -- Mr.4 Waxman, can I just clarify that we do have the5 threshold question in this case, right? Because as6 it stands in the Eighth Circuit, you don't even have7 a foot in the door because there was no8 interrogation, it was only -- so we have to overturn9 the Eighth Circuit on that point before we get to10 what you're now talking about.11 MR. WAXMAN: Yes, Your Honor. Now, the --12 the Eighth Circuit was incorrect, because it applied13 the wrong standard. It asked whether there was14 interrogation, when this Court made clear in Rhode15 Island v. Innis that that is not the test under the16 Sixth Amendment for good reasons, and in any event,17 this was the, quote, functional equivalent of18 interrogation. I mean --19 QUESTION: Well, because of the Eighth20 Circuit's position on the original statements, it21 really didn't address the subsequent jailhouse22 statements in any proper fashion, did it?23 MR. WAXMAN: No. It -- it said -- what24 the Eighth Circuit said is, look, we don't think that25 there was a primary illegality, and therefore, we20, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425don't have to discuss -- QUESTION: Right.MR. WAXMAN: -- what the fruits consequences are.QUESTION: So I suppose -- if we were to agree with you on the first statements and conclude they were deliberately elicited, we'd have to remand, I suppose --MR. WAXMAN: I don't think so, Your Honor. QUESTION: -- on the second question.MR. WAXMAN: Because the questionpresented in the petition, the second question presented in the petition is, okay, assuming that there was a violation of the Sixth Amendment in the first interrogation, does the invocation, the mere invocation of Miranda warnings, cleanse that taint?QUESTION: No, it wasn't that --QUESTION: Well, except the Eighth Circuit didn't address that second question.QUESTION: Right.MR. WAXMAN: That's correct.QUESTION: Well, would you like to saysomething about it --MR. WAXMAN: I would.QUESTION: -- because I -- in looking at21, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 it, I want -- would like you to address the2 particular argument. First, the questioning at the3 house was about whether he'd ever participated in4 taking drugs with these people. The relevant5 question was whether he distributed drugs at the6 station. They did ask him if he wanted a lawyer. He7 did consciously waive it. And therefore, in fact,8 since this case is about a right to a lawyer, maybe9 if he'd had a lawyer it would have made a difference,10 but it's hard to see how the decision not to have the11 lawyer flowed from the first.12 MR. WAXMAN: Well --13 QUESTION: So they're different subject14 matters. Time passes and it's pretty attenuated to15 say that that first violation led him to the second.￼16 All right. 171819Those are the arguments, et cetera.MR. WAXMAN: Okay.QUESTION: What do you say?MR. WAXMAN: I'll -- I'll answer Justice question first and then your question.20 O'Connor's21 Justice O'Connor, the -- the -- the point here is22 that this Court has uniformly held that where there23 is conduct that constitutes primary illegality in24 violation of the Fourth, Fifth, or Sixth Amendments,25 not just a prophylactic rule, but the constitutional22, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 requirement itself, the remedy is, you apply the2 derivative evidence rule, which puts the burden on3 the Government to prove that the taint has4 sufficiently attenuated.5 QUESTION: But certainly the -- the -- the6 defendant can waive his right to counsel later on,7 and he did.8 MR. WAXMAN: He absolutely can. And our9 case doesn't --10 QUESTION: And he did.11 MR. WAXMAN: He --12 QUESTION: Do you think it's tainted13 simply because if we find a violation originally?14 MR. WAXMAN: Our -- our case, Your Honor,15 doesn't depend on any argument or showing that the16 second statement was either involuntary or that the17 waiver of the right to counsel was not knowing and18 intelligent. Our submission is that the second19 statement is the fruit of the poisonous tree, just as20 if it were a piece of inanimate evidence. There's21 nothing wrong if somebody said -- with what the -- if22 police going and finding the body in the Nix case,23 the Christian burial case, but it's tainted because24 they got the -- that information derived from a25 violation of the Sixth Amendment. I had not up here23, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 --2 QUESTION: But he can certainly waive his3 Sixth Amendment right later. I just don't understand4 why what you say necessarily follows. We've never5 held that squarely, have we?6 MR. WAXMAN: Well, you -- you have never7 held in a Sixth Amendment --8 QUESTION: No.9 MR. WAXMAN: You've never held the -- the10 precise question that's presented here for sure. But11 you have held that where there is conduct that12 violates the Sixth Amendment, this is Nix and Wade,13 the fruits of that conduct, regardless of what14 happens thereafter, are excludable as fruit of the15 poisonous tree, unless the Government shoulders its16 taint-attenuation burden.17 And you have also held in a variety of18 cases that, starting with Wong Sun, that where the19 fruit is testimonial evidence, it too has to be20 excluded with the understanding that the administer21 -- the intervening administration of Miranda warnings22 are potent evidence, but they are not sufficient in23 and of themselves to establish taint attenuation.24 You said it in Brown. You said it last term in Kaupp25 v. Texas. You've said it in Dunaway and any number24, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 of other cases.2 QUESTION: How is the second statement the3 fruit of the first?4 MR. WAXMAN: The first statement in the5 first--Imean,asa--that--thisisasortofa6 common sense, practical analysis, but in the first7 statement he was -- he acknowledged that he had used8 methamphetamines and he had associated with the four9 individuals that the police officer named. And you,10 Justice Breyer, the indictment was conspiracy to11 possess methamphetamines with intent to distribute12 and to distribute. He made very inculpatory13 statements.14 Thirty minutes later, he executes a15 Miranda warning -- waiver -- in the station house,16 and he is asked, okay, tell us more about this17 possession and tell us person by person about your18 association with those four people. They then go on19 and ask more questions about other people, but in20 this case, the link between the two is as direct as21 one can possibly imagine. I mean, this Court has22 established a -- has long recognized a presumption23 that where the -- when the Government acquires24 evidence in violation of the Constitution, any25 substantially similar evidence obtained by the police25, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 subsequent to that derives from it unless the2 Government can prove it doesn't. That was waived.3 QUESTION: I can under -- I can understand4 the position, although I'm not entirely persuaded by5 it, that where -- when you are violate -- have6 violated the Fifth Amendment and gotten a confession7 that's already on the table, the second confession is8 sort of the fruit of that, because the person thinks,9 what the heck, I've already confessed, I may as well10 -- that's the argument that it's the fruit.11 MR. WAXMAN: The taint --12 QUESTION: But I don't -- but I don't see13 how the waiver of -- of counsel the second time is14 the -- is the fruit of the improper approach the15 first time. I mean, I -- I don't see somebody16 saying, what the heck, I waived counsel the first17 time, I may as well waive it the second.18 MR. WAXMAN: Your Honor, the taint --19 QUESTION: That doesn't follow the way --20 the way confession does.21 MR. WAXMAN: The taint, which this Court22 in Elstad, in part IIa of its opinion in Elstad, said23 was insufficient -- IIb -- was insufficient to prove24 involuntariness, is in fact what demonstrates that25 there is fruit of the poisonous tree here in the26, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 link, and that is the accepted, common sense2 proposition that an uncounseled accused, from whom3 the Government deliberately elicits an unwarned,4 incriminatory statement after it institutes5 adversarial proceedings, is erroneously likely to6 believe that there is little to be gained and much to7 be lost from attempting to avoid further8 incrimination.9 QUESTION: Well, now, but is there -- is10 there some authority for that specific proposition11 that you just said?12 MR. WAXMAN: This Court recognized it in13 Bayer, in Brown, in --14 QUESTION: Did it say -- I -- I'm -- you --15 you just recited kind of a litany. Did the Court16 recite that sort of a litany in Bayer?17 MR. WAXMAN: Well, in Brown, for example,18 it said that the second warrant statement, quote, was19 clearly the result and fruit of the first. The fact20 that Brown had made one statement believed by him to21 be admissible bolstered the pressures for him to give22 the second, or at least vitiated any incentive on his23 part to avoid self-incrimination.24 QUESTION: But that -- that's a -- that's25 a first statement. That's -- you're -- you're27, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425talking here about a waiver of counsel and you're saying that's the same thing.MR. WAXMAN: It is the same thing. In that case they were talking about the secondstatement, which was preceded by a waiver of counsel, and making not the, Your Honor, not the legal judgment that the second statement was there for coerced or involuntary, but the practical -- what this Court has described as the psychological and practical disadvantage of having confessed a first time can be regarded as a fruit of the first.QUESTION: Yeah, but isn't the -- the -- isn't the -- correct me if I'm wrong. I think your theory is that the waiver itself is likely to be a fruit because a person is going to say, I've already letthecatoutofthebag,whatdoIneeda lawyer for.Is--is--MR. WAXMAN: Yes. That's -- as -- QUESTION: -- that your position?MR. WAXMAN: -- as -- as Justice Harlanstated in his concurrence in Darwin, which is only a concurrence, but I think is sort of the --QUESTION: Well, but that -- that's -- the cat out of the bag is what we rejected in Elstad.MR. WAXMAN: You rejected it, Your Honor,28, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 as evidence or as constituting or -- or eliciting a2 presumption of involuntariness. But you did it only3 after -- in part IIa of your opinion in Elstad, you4 said, derivative evidence rule doesn't apply. Fruits5 are not going to be excluded from Elstad -- from a6 Miranda violation. Now, the Court said in part IIb,7 now we have to deal with the contention that he says8 it's involuntary, and his only evidence that it's9 involuntary is that it was the cat out of the bag and10 there was this psychological compulsion.11 That's too attenuated and hypothetical to12 constitute a presumption of compulsion, but it is13 precisely what this Court has recognized in Brown and14 Dunaway and Bayer and Taylor and Harrison as being a15 psychological fact --16 QUESTION: And that should make the case17 -- that case that we heard yesterday easier than this18 one if that's the standard, because there, the first19 unwarned set of questions was much more intense, much20 more detailed than in this case.21 MR. WAXMAN: Right. And the -- the only22 burden in the -- in the case yesterday that I don't23 have is that the primary illegality was a violation24 of Miranda, and not of the Fifth Amendment25 prohibition against coerced confessions itself.29, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

Mr. Dreeben, we'll hear from you.ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:On the central legal issue in this case, the critical fact is that, at the jailhouse, after petitioner was transported from his home, petitioner received a full set of Miranda warnings, which apprised him of his right to counsel, and knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived his right to counsel.QUESTION: Did the Eighth Circuit ever decide whether there was a knowing and voluntary waiver at the jailhouse?MR. DREEBEN: Yes. I believe that the Eighth Circuit did, Justice O'Connor, because the Eighth Circuit applied Oregon v. Elstad to reject what appears to be a Miranda-style argument that petitioner made in addition to his Sixth Amendment argument.QUESTION: I thought that perhaps since they didn't think the first statement posed a problem30, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 that they never really got to the crux of the2 jailhouse inquiry.3 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I -- I think in -- in4 part, Justice O'Connor, your reading of the opinion5 is correct. The court did say that under Patterson,6 the Sixth Amendment argument that petitioner is7 making in this Court doesn't get out of the starting8 gate, because there was no interrogation, it used the9 word interrogation. There was an issue about whether10 interrogation is equivalent to deliberate11 elicitation, and I'll try to address that.12 But before the court got to the Sixth13 Amendment question, it addressed on pages 121 and 12214 of the joint appendix the argument based on Elstad,15 and the argument that the petitioner made was that16 the statements made at the jailhouse should be17 suppressed -- and this is on page 121 of the joint18 appendix -- because the primary taint of the19 improperly elicited statements made at his home was20 not removed by the recitation of his Miranda rights21 at the jail.22 And then the court went on to discuss23 Oregon v. Elstad in detail and rejected that holding,24 that argument. And the way that I interpret that25 passage is that the court affirmed the district31, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 court's explicit finding of a knowing, voluntary, and2 intelligent waiver, and applied Elstad to reject that3 claim.4 QUESTION: Just so I understand what the5 Sixth Amendment rule is, if the Sixth Amendment6 prohibits the state from eliciting statements when7 the defend -- when proceedings have begun, outside8 presence of counsel, is it wrong for them to give the9 Miranda warning and if he's then silent, then go10 ahead and say, now you've had your Miranda warning,11 would you like to talk to us? Is that consistent12 with the Sixth Amendment rules that we impose? That13 is to say, can you elicit the statement after you've14 given the waiver, consistently with the Sixth15 Amendment right?16 MR. DREEBEN: Yes. Patterson v. Illinois17 specifically addressed the question of what does it18 take for officers to obtain a waiver of counsel. The19 only point where I would disagree, Justice Kennedy,20 with your summary is that presence of counsel is not21 required. The defendant has the right to choose22 whether to have or to waive counsel.23 And in Patterson, the Court held that the24 Miranda warnings conveyed to a suspect who has been25 indicted all of the information needed to make a32, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 knowing and a voluntary and intelligent waiver of2 counsel in3 petitioner45 that waiver consistently with the Sixth Amendment?6 MR. DREEBEN: That's correct. They can7 approach the defendant, apprise him of his rights,8 and if the defendant then makes a knowing andcustodial interrogation. That's what got.QUESTION: And they can attempt to elicit9 intelligent waiver of his rights --10 QUESTION: No, that wasn't my question.11 Can they -- can they advise him of those rights, he's12 silent, and then try to elicit the statement? Say,13 now we've apprised you of your rights and we want you14 to talk to us. Is that consistent with the Sixth15 Amendment?16 MR. DREEBEN: I think so, if that's17 construed as seeking a waiver of his right to18 counsel. Of course, there has to be a finding that19 there was in fact a waiver of the right to counsel.20 The police officers can't simply read Miranda21 warnings, provide no interruption whatsoever to make22 sure that the defendant actually understood them, and23 then barge right ahead.24 Now, there are cases where the courts have25 to decide whether there was an implicit waiver of33, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425case like that, because the Miranda waiver form in the record clearly indicates --QUESTION: But, Mr. Dreeben, maybe I'm wrong on the facts, but you're relying on the waiver at the station house?MR. DREEBEN: That's correct.QUESTION: Do you agree that prior to that waiver there had already been a violation of the Sixth Amendment?MR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Stevens. Our --QUESTION: Well, then -- then you don't need the waiver.MR. DREEBEN: That -- that is true. I -- my submission is on the critical legal question. Even if the Court finds against us on what I would acknowledge is a close question about whether the interaction at the home constituted deliberate elicitation under the Sixth Amendment --QUESTION: Assume it was deliberate elicitation. Would you say it was a violation then?MR. DREEBEN: No, I wouldn't say that itwas a -- an actual violation of the Sixth Amendmentat the time. The Sixth Amendment is a trial right.The right to counsel has to be evaluated by reference34, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 --2 QUESTION: So even if there was no waiver3 at the home, there -- there still was no violation of4 the Constitution?5 MR. DREEBEN: Not at that time. I -- I6 want to make it perfectly clear, Justice Stevens --7 QUESTION: It seems to me a rather extreme8 position.9 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I -- I don't think it10 is extreme, because I'm going to follow it up with11 what I think Your Honor is getting to, which is, can12 the police simply go to an indicted suspect's home,13 ignore his right to counsel, and engage in14 questioning? And the answer is, generally no,15 sometimes yes. The generally no is that once the16 defendant has been indicted, the right to counsel17 provides a -- a direction to the police not to18 interfere with or circumvent the right to counsel.19 QUESTION: Well, what is the sometimes20 yes?21 MR. DREEBEN: Sometimes yes is that, this22 Court has recognized in its seminal case in this23 area, the Massiah case, and then again in Maine v.24 Moulton, that the Sixth Amendment, as it is25 offense-specific, does not preclude the police from35, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425investigating ongoing criminal activity that's not charged.QUESTION: Well, but this is -- this was an offense-specific interrogation if it -- if was an interrogation.MR. DREEBEN: Yes. I -- and this case doesn't involve the --QUESTION: It seems to me there's an analogy to civil cases here. Supposing you just had a civil lawsuit pending against the person and after it's filed, wouldn't there be an ethical obligation on -- on behalf of the plaintiff not to send agents out to question your adversary in the proceeding?MR. DREEBEN: There may be a ethical obligation, even if the party is not known to be represented at the time, although --QUESTION: If he's known not to be represented, that's my case.MR. DREEBEN: He's known not be represented, I think it's a closer question whether -- whether the ethics rules would -- would bar the approaching of the defendant. But this Court has made --QUESTION: Who -- who -- who would you go to? If he hasn't appointed counsel and --36, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Stevens --QUESTION: -- and he's filed the case -- he's filed the case pro se. Who would you approach if you don't approach him?MR. DREEBEN: I think, Justice Stevens --QUESTION: Now, I'm assuming that the -- the Government is the plaintiff in the case. That --MR. DREEBEN: The implication is that you couldn't approach him. And this Court has clearly made it evident that whatever the ethical rules might be with respect to private conduct, the Sixth Amendment rules are not governed by them. And the Sixth Amendment rule, in this area at least, is relatively clear. The police can approach an unrepresented defendant, advise him of his rights, and obtain a waiver of the right to counsel.QUESTION: Well, can the police approach a person and deliberately elicit statements without advising him of his right to counsel after indictment?MR. DREEBEN: Not on the charged offense, Justice O'Connor, and have the information admitted at trial. The -- the threshold question --QUESTION: Well, have we looked to whether the statement was deliberately elicited? Has that37, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 been our understanding of what we'd look to?2 MR. DREEBEN: That -- that has been the3 way that this Court has formulated the test, and I4 would suggest that if --5 QUESTION: And so should we apply that6 test here to those early statements?7 MR. DREEBEN: Yes, but I think the Court8 should clearly reformulate it to make it in the9 context of overt interrogation by the police, known10 police officers, to be an objective test. The11 deliberate elicitation standard, as so phrased, gives12 rise to some confusion, because it does suggest that13 there's a subjective component to it, where14 deliberate elicitation does have a different15 application than interrogation for purposes of16 Miranda with respect to undercover agents. The Court17 has made clear that once a suspect is indicted, the18 police cannot use an undercover agent, not known or19 identified as such to the defendant, to circumvent20 his right to counsel. And in that respect,21 deliberate elicitation is broader.22 But in footnote 12 of Maine v. Moulton23 where the Court was discussing deliberate elicitation24 in some detail, the Court made clear that intent is25 hard to prove, and it's really not the main issue38, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 here anyway. What we should be interested in is2 whether the Government must have known that its3 conduct would be likely to elicit incriminating4 statements, and that is essentially the same as the5 Rhode Island v. Innis standard for interrogation. In6 fact, it's a little bit more onerous for the7 defendant, because it says, must have known, and the8 Rhode Island v. Innis standard is should have known.9 In any event, the Government submits that10 the Court should make it clearer that when you're11 dealing with identified police officers interacting12 with suspects post-indictment, the Rhode Island v.13 Innis standard, the objective test should be the14 definition of deliberate elicitation. Then the15 question becomes, was there deliberate elicitation on16 the record in this case?17 What happened is, the officers arrived at18 petitioner's home. The officers knew petitioner.19 This was not somebody that they had never met before.20 They'd met him on prior occasions. And they said in21 one continuous statement, we're here to discuss your22 methamphetamine activities, we have a warrant for23 your arrest --24 QUESTION: Didn't they say, we're here to25 discuss with you?39, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. DREEBEN: Justice --2 QUESTION: Wasn't it Bliemeister's3 statement, I'm here to discuss with you?4 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Souter, on three5 occasions when Officer Bliemeister was asked to say6 what he said in his own words, he said, we're here to7 discuss your methamphetamine activities. On one8 occasion, when defense counsel in cross-examination9 reformulated what Officer Bliemeister said, and said,10 didn't you say you're here to discuss with petitioner11 his methamphetamine activities, Officer Bliemeister12 answered yes. Both the magistrate judge and the13 district court did not use the with you language in14 describing what the officer said.15 And to the extent that this case turns on16 a rather subtle distinction in language, I think the17 distinction is relevant, because what the officers18 were essentially doing is introducing the topic of19 what they were going to tell petitioner, namely, your20 methamphetamine activities have landed you in21 trouble, we're here to arrest you, we have an22 indictment for your arrest. And then petitioner23 began to speak primarily --24 QUESTION: Telling -- telling is not25 discussing. I mean, I don't see why the phrase, with40, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425you, is essential when the only person in the room is --is--isyou--(Laughter.)QUESTION: -- and somebody comes in and says, I'm here to discuss, you know, whatever. Who else are you going to discuss it with then?(Laughter.)MR. DREEBEN: I don't think there was any ambiguity about the object of the statements, but the question of what the officers were intending to do is somewhat informed by the way they phrased it.QUESTION: No, but the -- the usual sense of the word discuss is something that involves other than -- something involving more than a monologue.So I mean, I -- as Justice Scalia said, I -- it might make it clearer if he had said with you each time, but without the with you, discuss implies give and take.QUESTION: At -- at least if there's nobody else in the room. I mean, if there's a crowd of people and you say, I'm here to discuss something, maybe you're going to discuss it with the other people. That's fine, but -- but it -- this was one-one-one.MR. DREEBEN: I readily acknowledge that41, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 this is a case that could be reasonably decided more2 than one way, but I would submit that if you look at3 what the officers did, the officers in the -- at his4 home, basically informed him about the fact that he5 was under arrest and indicted. He spoke6 uninterrupted except by one completely irrelevant7 question to the topic of the indictment, until the8 officers interrupted him, cut him off, and said it's9 time to go, John, you know. And John said, can I10 please get some shoes on? And they accompanied him11 downstairs, he got shoes, then they took him down to12 the jailhouse. No questions about the topics that13 were later 1415 that there16 deliberate17 then what,18 of the jail, after the warnings had been given?19 MR. DREEBEN: Then I think, Justice20 O'Connor, that this Court should apply its rule in21 Oregon v. Elstad that the knowing, voluntary, and22 intelligent waiver of the right to counsel23 constitutes an independent act of free will that24 breaks any causal link that might otherwise have been25 posited between the statements that were made in the42, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005discussed at the jailhouse.QUESTION: Well, if we were to conclude was a violation of the so-called elicitation standard, modified or not, with regard to the subsequent conversation￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425initial unwarned session --QUESTION: And you think that thatdetermination has been made knowing and voluntariness as to the jailhouse statement --MR. DREEBEN: I --QUESTION: -- by the court below.MR. DREEBEN: Not only do I think that itwas made explicitly in the district court and implicitly in the court of appeals, but I don't believe that petitioner contests it. I don't believe that petitioner's position is that the waiver of rights was actually tainted. What I understand petitioner's position to be is that there was a violation of a primary constitutional norm at home when -- when petitioner was interrogated or statements were deliberately elicited. Accordingly --QUESTION: The fruits --MR. DREEBEN: Exactly. The same fruits rule ought to apply that applies under the Fourth Amendment and then petitioner relies on Fourth Amendment precedents, which the Government does not think are -- are applicable here.QUESTION: I - I think -- I think he would say it is a fruit because it is not totally43, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 voluntary, given the fact that he had already let the2 catoutofthebag. I--I--Idon'tthink--I3 don't think he would acknowledge that the second4 waiver -- that the waiver of counsel in the second5 interrogation was entirely free, given what had6 preceded.7 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Scalia, I'll8 have to let petitioner's briefs speak for what --9 QUESTION: Well, we -- we've destroyed his10 right of rebuttal, so --11 (Laughter.)12 QUESTION: And that's the question13 basically, because I think that's an important14 question and -- and the question is whether there is15 a right to a lawyer, and when the Government violates16 the right to the lawyer, like the Fourth Amendment or17 any other amendment, they can't use a fruit. Now,18 Oregon v. Elstad is talking about a right that isn't19 complete until you fail to introduce the -- until you20 use it as testimony at trial, and therefore Oregon v.21 Elstad is a different, and considerably more lenient22 test. I confess I always would have thought until23 this moment that our Court cases said you apply the24 fruits because the violation is complete.25 Now, it seems to me in advocating the44, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 second, you're advocating a considerable change, but2 whether it's a change or not a change, I want to know3 the reason for it.4 MR. DREEBEN: There are two critical5 reasons, Justice Breyer, why Oregon v. Elstad should6 apply in this context. The first is that the right7 that the defendant did not get, by hypothesis now, at8 home, was the right to make an informed waiver of the9 right to counsel. When the defendant got the Miranda10 warnings at home, that fully cured any deficiency in11 knowledge that the defendant previously had about his12 right to counsel, and enabled him to make an act of13 free will that broke any causal link between the14 first statements and the second statements.15 And the second crucial reason why Elstad16 should apply here is Elstad is not simply limited to17 reasoning that is only applicable in the context of18 compulsion under the Fifth Amendment. It also19 clearly and explicitly said, it's very speculative20 and attenuated to posit that a defendant who spoke at￼21 one time is therefore22 is out of the bag and23 really have a choice.24 QUESTION:25 Constitution says yougoing to believe that the cat I should speak again, I don'tRight. But as to the first, my have a right to a lawyer, not45, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425-- of course you can waive it, like anybody -- other right. But that's quite different than the Fifth Amendment right, which is a right not to testify against yourself, which is in complete to a trial.As to the second, of course, attenuation is relevant. It's relevant under the tree -- fruits doctrine. It's relevant under Elstad. So if you prove attenuation, fine. So, given those two things, whydowehavetochangethelawhere? Orisita change?MR. DREEBEN: Well, I don't think it's a change, Justice Breyer, because the Court has never addressed the specific dynamic involved in this case under the Sixth Amendment of a defendant who makes an unwarned statement --QUESTION: Well, the Nix v. Williams case bears on it to some extent, doesn't it?MR. DREEBEN: It does --QUESTION: That was a Sixth Amendmentcase.MR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice O'Connor, and I -- I accept, although I think it's fair to say that Nix did no more than assume that there would be a fruits rule as to physical evidence.QUESTION: Yeah. And the Court in Nix46, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425made it pretty clear that we assumed there would be a fruits suppression.MR. DREEBEN: Correct. As to physicalevidence.QUESTION: But applied some other reason to let the body --MR. DREEBEN: Well, the Court -- the Court there relied on inevitable discovery.QUESTION: Right.MR. DREEBEN: Here, our basic position is that the voluntary testimony of the defendant himself is different from physical fruits or from the situation involving a tainted line-up, which was involved in Wade, and that the decision, made voluntarily and intelligently by a defendant to waive counsel, is a per se break in any causal chain that would be positive.And our second argument is that the Court has already rejected in Elstad the idea that there is a causal link between a defendant's letting a cat out of the bag in the first statement and then being confronted with the question whether to waive his rights in the second.QUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, do -- do I understand correctly that essentially you are saying47, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 that Mr. Waxman in wrong in bracketing the Sixth2 Amendment with the Fourth Amendment, that it belongs3 with the Fifth Amendment? And one, it seems to me,4 large difference between the two of you is Mr. Waxman5 describes the Sixth Amendment violation of -- as6 occurring on the spot. You have said in your brief7 it's just like the Fifth Amendment. It's sort of8 inchoate until the Government seeks to introduce it9 at a trial. Is that still your view, so that the --10 the right to counsel isn't complete -- the violation11 isn't complete until the Government makes an effort12 to introduce it at trial?13 MR. DREEBEN: It is. My view that the14 violation is not complete until the evidence is15 introduced at trial, but I think where I put the16 Sixth Amendment is not numerically accurate, but it's17 somewhere in between the Fourth and the Fifth18 Amendment rules, in that there are circumstances in19 which I believe that there is a fruits rule attached20 to conduct that infringes a Sixth Amendment norm.21 The right itself may not be a completed violation22 until evidence that results from infringing a Sixth23 Amendment norm is actually used against the24 defendant. Adversarial fairness is the goal of the25 Sixth Amendment. If it is not infringed, neither is48, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 the Constitution.2 QUESTION: Because if -- if the -- we3 describe that right, that Sixth Amendment amendment4 right as a right to counsel at every critical stage5 in the criminal proceeding, then that sounds like6 there's a critical stage and you haven't been told7 and haven't waived your right to a lawyer, the8 violation is complete.9 MR. DREEBEN: No, I don't think so,10 Justice Ginsburg. And one example that I think makes11 the point very clear is this Court's ineffective12 assistance of counsel cases. Those cases require not13 only that a lawyer performs deficiently, below any14 reasonable professional standard, but also that there15 be an effect on the fairness of the trail in the form16 of prejudice. It's a two-part standard. There is no17 constitutional violation merely by interfering with18 the right to counsel. Another case that makes that19 point --20 QUESTION: Well, there's a constitutional21 deficiency. I mean, we're playing with words. What22 we're saying in the counsel cases is, if we have to23 go back and unring the bell, we want something more24 than simply the deficiency. We want to know that25 requiring a new trial or whatever is likely to make a49, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 difference.2 The question here is -- is asked, I think,3 Justice Ginsburg's question is asked on a prospective4 basis. And that is, at the time the -- the police5 question without counsel, is that a violation of the6 -- of the Sixth Amendment?7 MR. DREEBEN: And my --8 QUESTION: Your -- your answer a moment9 ago was, the only violation of the Sixth Amendment10 was the denial of the -- of the opportunity to waive.11 But he's got to have an opportunity to waive12 something, and I suppose that implies that he has, at13 least on a prospective basis, a right to the presence14 of counsel there if the police are going to question15 him, absent a -- a waiver.16 MR. DREEBEN: I -- I think that there's a17 lot in your question, Justice Souter, but I -- I18 think I basically agree with the thrust of it. He19 does have the right to choose whether to have counsel20 or not after he's been indicted when the police21 approach him for interrogation. The question in this22 case is, what do you do if that didn't happen? And23 --24 QUESTION: Of course, the -- the other way25 to look at is upside down. I mean, if -- if you50, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 concede that there's a Sixth Amendment violation2 immediately, you're still free to argue that -- that3 in -- in the Miranda case, there's also a Fifth4 Amendment violation immediately. Now, you couldn't5 do that with Elstad, but after Dickerson, you can6 certainly argue that.78 yesterday, 9MR. DREEBEN: Well, as we discussed Justice Scalia --QUESTION: Yes, I know.MR. DREEBEN: I -- I believe that the1011 violation in a Miranda case consists precisely of the12 admission of the defendant's statements in the13 Government case in chief. The Fifth Amendment is an14 evidentiary rule. That's what the nature of the15 violation is. It's not a conduct-based rule.￼1617 support in 181920 same thing 2122 it matters23 engages in24 this case on the legal issue is that the defendant's25 independent, untainted decision to waive counsel is aQUESTION: Well, and that has a textual the constitutional language itself.MR. DREEBEN: That -- that's correct. QUESTION: But you don't have quite the on the Sixth Amendment?MR. DREEBEN: No, but I don't think that because we're conceding that the Court fruits analysis. Our primary position in51, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425act of --QUESTION: But Mr. Dreeben, it's -- the thought runs through my mind that if he were to waive counsel in front of a judge in a trial setting, the judge would ask him a lot of questions and be sure the waiver was intelligent and voluntary and so forth. And you're suggesting, at the time he's first indicted when the police approach him, he doesn't need any of that guidance as all. If he just answers the question, that's sufficient.MR. DREEBEN: Well, that -- that is --QUESTION: It's a rather dramatic difference in the kind of waiver of this very important right.MR. DREEBEN: True. But that's what the Court held over Your Honor's dissent in Patterson v. Illinois. The Court explicitly considered the issue of what kind of a waiver is necessary, and the Court held that the issuance of Miranda warnings provides the defendant with all the information that he needs to know.QUESTION: But, of course, you didn't even have the Miranda warning here --MR. DREEBEN: No, but -- QUESTION: -- at the home.52, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. DREEBEN: And we're not claiming that2 there was a waiver of the right to counsel. Our --3 our claim for whatever favor it may meet with the4 Court is that there was no deliberate elicitation of5 statements. We're not claiming a waiver at the home.6 We are unequivocally claiming a waiver at the7 jailhouse.8 QUESTION: Don't you think it is a rather9 -- rather strange that the judges are as careful as10 they are in a trial setting, whereas the police can11 just do what they did here? Does that -- doesn't12 trouble you?1314 strange at15 Patterson,16 question that turns on what the role of counsel might17 be at a particular setting. Now, the role of counsel18 at trial is considerably more complex in dealing with19 evidentiary matters and legal claims than the role in20 pre-trial interrogation.MR. DREEBEN: No, I don't think it'sall, because as the Court explained in the question of a waiver is a functional￼2122 like this,23 determined2425 case, and this is my third and final point, if theQUESTION: Actually, in -- in a situation the whole outcome of the proceeding isby what happened in his home.MR. DREEBEN: Well, in this particular53, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 Court should determine that the waiver of rights is2 not a per se independent act that attenuates any3 taint, on any record the Court should not find that4 there is any taint that is unattenuated. The5 violation at home, if there was any, was an extremely6 mild violation. If the defendant let the cat out of7 the bag, it was really at most one paw, not an entire8 cat.9 (Laughter.)10 MR. DREEBEN: The -- the defendant barely11 spoke at all about his activities relating to the12 charges that were identified in the indictment. He13 said that he had business and personal problems and14 he was a methamphetamine user, and he rambled on for15 a while until the police cut him off. At the station16 house, he was asked specifically person by person17 what his relationship was with the individual and18 what the activities were, and of course, he gave more19 elaborate information at that time, but -- and this20 is critical too. It was not information that21 admitted the charges in the indictment. This wasn't22 a case where a defendant said, well, I've confessed23 once, I might as well confess again now that I have24 my Miranda warning. This was an individual who spoke25 about his problems at his home, then he gets down to54, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 the station house and he's essentially talking about2 all the things that make him not liable, criminally3 liable under the indictment.4 It was an instance in which, I would5 submit, the motive for the defendant to talk was not6 that the cat was out of the bag, but that he was7 hoping to minimize any suggestion of guilt and8 persuade the officers that the indictment was not9 properly founded.10 And finally, of course, the officers never11 exploited any prior statement and they did give him a12 thorough, complete administration of Miranda13 warnings, and under the circumstances of this case,14 even if the Court were to apply a taint analysis15 sometimes, or to assume that a taint analysis16 applies, the facts of this case demonstrate enough17 attenuation so that the jailhouse statements should18 be admitted, while the statements at home were19 suppressed.20 QUESTION: Are -- are you arguing that the21 fruits rule does not apply, or are you arguing that22 this is not the fruits?23 MR. DREEBEN: I am arguing that a fruits24 rule applies under the Sixth Amendment. I'm25 conceding that by virtue of the Court's assumption in55, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Nix v. Williams and its holding in United States v.2 Wade. But the case of a defendant's own voluntary3 statements should be treated as a special case under4 a fruits rule in which there is per se attenuation in5 the form of an independent act of free will that6 intervenes between the violation and the ensuing7 waiver. And that comes about when the defendant8 receives full and complete information about his9 rights. There is no suggestion of involuntariness in10 his waiver and he decides to speak.11 The ultimate test in attenuation law is12 was there an independent act of free will when you're13 speaking of a confession that breaks the causal link14 to the prior illegality. Here, we submit as a matter15 of law under Oregon v. Elstad's reasoning, there was.16 Thank you.17 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.18 Dreeben. The case is submitted.19 (Whereupon, at 11:07 a.m., the case in the20 above-entitled matter was submitted.)21 22 23 24 2556, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼
