Bartlett.Mr. Lefkowitz.ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY P. LEFKOWITZON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. LEFKOWITZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and mayit please the Court:This is a classic case of impossibilitypreemption. Federal law required generic sulindac to have the same ingredients, the same warning and the same safety profile as the branded version. But a New Hampshire jury imposed liability because sulindac didn't have a different safety profile, meaning a different ingredient or a different warning.And as Mensing recognized, that's an impossibility conflict. And there is no principle basis for treating design defect claims any differently from failure to warn claims.JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Lefkowitz, could I understand something just about the scope of your argument? It -- it seems to me that in this case we are not really dealing only with generics, we are also3￼1 dealing with brand-named drugs.2 And I guess the -- the thought there would3 be, in -- with -- with -- in this respect, as to design,4 as compared to warnings, but as to design, they're5 really all in the same boat. In other words -- you6 know, they have a design, that it is only that design7 that's approved. If they change their design there's no8 authority to continue marketing it. They have to go9 back to square one. And that's just as true of brand10 names as it is of generics.11 So am I right about that? That -- that if12 we're just looking at a pure design defect claim,13 putting the warning card aside, where you are in a14 different position from the brand-name drugs, but as to15 design, don't the brand-name and the generics go hand in16 hand?17 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Justice Kagan, it's -- it's18 certainly the position that the government takes in its19 brief. I'm sure Plaintiff's lawyers would find20 arguments to differ. But the important thing is that21 it's really a distinction without a difference in real22 life because in light of this Court's decision in the23 Wyeth case, what happens across the board is that design24 defect claims are brought either as they are in nearly25 every State where there is a warning component, or -­4￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE KAGAN: I want you to put that aside for me for just a second, and I understand that's a very significant thing in your argument to put aside. But let's just assume that there was a design defect claim that didn't have to do with warnings, where you are in a different position. Let's just assume on a pure design defect claim, am I right that generics and brand-name manufacturers are in the same position with respect to those claims?MR. LEFKOWITZ: If you are hypothecating -- hypothesizing a pure design defect regime, we're not -- JUSTICE KAGAN: Just about how you make thedrug?MR. LEFKOWITZ: Correct. That is certainly￼the argument the governmentor not the Court would findthe Court did in Wyeth, butappropriate interpretation of what the government is saying. But --JUSTICE KAGAN: saying, I mean, I myself, I distinction there would be.MR. LEFKOWITZ: JUSTICE KAGAN: MR. LEFKOWITZ:5Not what the government is just can't figure out whatYour Honor --So I'm asking you.As a legal matter, I'm notmakes. I'm not sure whether any type of distinction as that is certainly an1 sure reading the FDCA there is a matter. My point is2 simply that in the real world, the cases are going to be3 brought as failure to warn claims or as design defect4 claims with warnings components.5 JUSTICE KAGAN: But, you -- but again, and I6 know that this is a big part of your argument, but to7 the extent that a warning was not involved in the claim,8 and it was just about the design of a drug, I guess I'm9 asking you, is there any possible way to distinguish10 between generics and brand-name manufacturers?11 MR. LEFKOWITZ: I'm not sure, Your Honor,12 that there is a way to distinguish. If you were dealing13 in a regime in a State statute or a State tort regime14 where the only issue was design, unlike in the New15 Hampshire design defect, where as we know from PA 1816 where the First Circuit made clear that it, in fact, was17 the lack of an adequate warning that in fact made the18 drug more dangerous under the design defect case, the19 Supreme Court's case Vautour, which is the leading New20 Hampshire case. And in fact the jury instruction in21 this case was a binary choice. It specifically said, if22 you find that the drug is unreasonably dangerous, then23 you have to take a look at was the warning sufficient or24 not.256￼We have a case here that is directly7 design defect cases. And therefore it is a8 impossibility case, just as the Court found9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So tell me,10 now your position, and it seems to be, that11 FDA approves a product that12 liability claim because the13 ceiling of what you can do?14 MR. LEFKOWITZ:15 Justice Sotomayor.classicin Mensing. is -- is it any time the be a tort1 controlled by Mensing because the warning was critical2 to the design defect case. We also have a case here3 that even if it were just purely a design defect case,4 at least with respect to a generic drug company, the5 Federal sameness mandate, the same Federal sameness6 mandate that applied in Mensing to warnings, applies inthere can neverFDA's approval is now the￼16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They approve17 nonprescription drugs. They approve a lot of things.18 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Absolutely. And19 Justice Sotomayor, as this Court made clear in20 Mensing -- in Wyeth and as Justice Thomas made clear in21 his concurring opinion in that case, just because a drug22 is granted an approval by the FDA does not mean that23 it's entitled to have the same label for all time. The24 distinction, though, that the Court articulated was that25 in Wyeth a brand company has the authority, and indeed7Absolutely not,1 as this Court found, the obligation to update its2 warnings. A generic --3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's not true with4 respect to the active ingredients. An active ingredient5 requires a new FDA approval process.6 MR. LEFKOWITZ: But -- but we were talking7 in that case about the warning.8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But -- but we came back9 to the same point, which is -- and we are sort of10 dancing around the argument -- which is what happens11 with a truly dangerous drug, and we can posit one, that12 has nothing to do with a warning of whether it's13 adequate or not, but a drug that on its face no14 reasonable practitioner -- I'm going to the restatement15 third formulation -- no reasonable practitioner, knowing16 all the benefits and risks, would ever prescribe this17 drug.1819 position at202122 there were other, safer, one-molecule drugs, no one￼23 should have 2425 that is notprescribed this, no matter what the label. MR. LEFKOWITZ: Actually, Justice Sotomayor, the position my adversary took at trial. My8Because your adversary basically took that trial.MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It doesn't matter --17 very narrow 1819 they bring? 202122 could manufacture and the generic.23 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Right now if the24 Plaintiff -- the Respondent here had taken the25 brand-name drug Clinoril instead of the generic91 adversary specifically put on a case about the warnings2 and said, the fact that SJS/TEN was warned about in the3 adverse reaction section and cross-referenced within the4 warning section was not sufficient. If it had been in5 the warning section like the FDA later said it should6 be, that would have made the difference.7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We can argue. But let's8 go to the point I raised, which is, I think what you are9 arguing now is that no truly bad drug, that shouldn't be10 on the market, would there ever be a tort claim that11 anybody could bring --12 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Absolutely not --13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- because the FDA14 approved it.15 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Absolutely not. That's not16 our argument at all. Our argument, first of all, is a￼argument --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what tort claim couldMR.

The FDA approved MR. LEFKOWITZ: Because the design defect JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And they couldn't changeMR. LEFKOWITZ: But they could change the warning, and that's the essential component, as the First Circuit made clear. At PA 18 what the First Circuit said was the label was relevant to the design defect claim. The lack of a clearer warning made the product itself more dangerous under the risk/benefit tests prescribed by Bextra. That's the design defect standard.So had the Respondent taken the brand-name drug, she would have had a cause of action, even under the articulation of the sameness standard under Hatch-Waxman that we are articulating here.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One of our cases --JUSTICE GINSBURG: And she didn't take -- she didn't take the -- the brand-name drug because the10￼1 pharmacist gave her the generic, but she didn't know2 brand, generic, isn't that correct?3 MR. LEFKOWITZ: That's correct,4 Justice Ginsburg, and that's exactly the same issue that5 we had in the Mensing case a couple years ago.6 Obviously we understand that not all consumers get to7 select on their own; their doctors select or maybe their8 State Medicaid laws make this choice, or the pharmacy,9 but the standards -- again, conflict preemption comes10 when the State is imposing a requirement or an11 obligation or enforcing a standard that you simply can't12 comply with under Federal law without violating Federal13 law.14 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose that New Hampshire15 had a real strict liability regime, so that you -- you16 sell a drug, and whether it's unreasonably dangerous or17 not it causes an injury, you pay, to spread the costs.18 Would there be a problem with that?19 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Justice Alito, I think if we20 had what would really be an absolute liability scheme, I21 think is really what you are suggesting, something22 similar to the kind of vaccine compensation program that23 we heard about this morning, that would not raise24 impossibility preemption problems at all. It might or25 might not raise obstacle issues; it would depend perhaps11￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425on the scope of the program, whether it was singling out certain types of drugs, how expensive it was; but that would be a very different situation.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't there a FirstCircuit --JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Frederick argues that that -- that's the thrust of the -- of the New Hampshire law. Why is he wrong on that?MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, he's wrong because -- Price v. Dick -- the New Hampshire Supreme Court case, says very clearly, "We do not have an absolute liability system. We do not make manufacturers insurers of their product." And in fact, Mr. Frederick on page 21 of his brief articulates the standards for liability in this very case where he said, it has to be found unreasonably dangerous.And we know from Judge Boudin's statement that I just read that that -- that condition ofunreasonable dangerousness is premised in large part on the question of the warning. And it makes sense because drugs are unavoidably dangerous. If you have --￼follow-up?JUSTICE ALITO: Can I just ask this one moreMR. LEFKOWITZ: Sure.JUDGE ALITO: Why -- why would -- why is a121 generic manufacturer in a worse position under the2 absolute liability scheme than it would be under the New3 Hampshire scheme?4 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well --5 JUDGE ALITO: Because under the absolute6 scheme they might say, if that's the cost, we are not7 going to sell this drug at all? Is that the reason?8 MR. LEFKOWITZ: No, it's -- it's not a9 question of -- of policy choices, it's a question of10 operation of law. The issue here -- States are free to11 do lots of different things. They only are not free to12 do things when they conflict directly with Federal13 obligations. Basically, the Supremacy Clause sets up a14 rule of priority.15 And you have that rule of priority come into16 play when you have a State requirement and you have a17 Federal requirement. Here the vaccine program does not18 hinge on a question of whether or not the generic19 company violated a safety standard, whether the State is20 saying, your drug is too dangerous either because of the21 warning or because of the design.22 It is simply saying, we are going to charge23 manufacturers $1 dollar per prescription or --24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. -- Mr. Lefkowitz,25 then what you are saying is that the FDA's approval is13￼1 not only what everyone agrees it is, a floor to enable2 you to market, but it is also a ceiling. That is you3 meet the FDA -- you get the FDA approval and4 that gives you a right to market, not simply an access5 to market, but it -- it operates as a ceiling?6 MR. LEFKOWITZ: With respect to the7 question, Justice Ginsburg, as the Mensing Court made8 clear, when this very issue came up with respect to9 warnings which are commanded as a sameness requirement10 by Federal law in exactly the same way as the molecule,11 the design, the Federal regime does operate as a floor12 and as a ceiling.13 And when Federal law authorizes you to14 market a drug in interstate commerce by granting you the15 ANDA, that comes with it enormous protections. In fact,16 Congress has established --17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there something in18 the -- in the Act that says that the States have no role19 with respect to the safety and efficacy of the drug --20 the drug, it's only the FDA approval, that's it?21 MR. LEFKOWITZ: There is no express22 preemption clause here. However, as we know from23 Mensing where the Court articulated it in footnote 5 and24 as we know from Geier where the Court went and said25 ordinary conflict principles apply. In fact, even when14￼1 we have an express preemption clause and we have a2 savings clause, that they don't apply, we have to use3 ordinary operation of conflict --4 JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Lefkowitz, I think5 in describing the FDCA just now, you used the word6 "authorizes," and typically, when we think about7 impossibility, it's not enough that a State law8 penalizes what Federal law authorizes.9 What we -- something is impossible when a10 State law penalizes what Federal law requires or11 maybe -- or, where State law penalizes what Federal law12 gives you a right to do. But it's not enough for13 impossibility that State law penalizes what Federal law14 permits.15 And it seems as though what we have in the16 FDCA is a statute that authorizes, that says, you can17 sell this. But it doesn't say you must sell it, and it18 doesn't give you a right to sell it.19 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, Justice Kagan,20 I'd like to give you two answers to that. The first as21 to the impossibility, for over 50 -- 50 years exactly22 now, this Court has been articulating as the23 paradigmatic example of impossibility preemption.24 The example from Florida Lime and Avocado25 Growers where the Federal government said you can't sell15￼1 an avocado with less than 7 percent and you can't2 sell -- and the State said you can't sell the avocado3 with more than 8 percent oil. Now, clearly, there is no4 Federal obligation to sell avocados.5 I would submit that Congress is not agnostic6 about the sale of drugs, but the key is that the7 quintessential example of impossibility has nothing to8 do with a Federal right at all. It is simply9 conflicting standards.10 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that is your best11 case, but -- you know, there are quite a number of cases12 where we've really held when a Federal law permits13 something, typically, a State can do more if it wants14 to.15 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Justice Kagan, the very same16 issue came out in Mensing as well. After all, PLIVA was17 not obligated in any way to sell metoclopramide in18 Mensing. But, of course, this Court found that that was19 a case of impossibility conflict. And moreover,20 Congress has -- as I said, is not agnostic here.21 Congress had established a regime where in22 order to take a drug off the market, Congress had said23 the FDA has to provide the company with all sorts of due24 process protection, direct appeal to the Federal court,25 and in fact, Congress, in 1997, specified that any16￼1 people at the FDA involved in the drug approval process2 at all, withdrawing drugs or approving drugs, has to3 have special technical, scientific expertise, very4 different from what we have in lay jurors.5 But simply stated, Your Honor, from a6 impossibility perspective, this is not only the Florida7 Lime example, this is the Mensing case as well.8 Now -- you know, the -- the Respondent9 doesn't really take issue with either the sameness10 requirement of design or the sameness requirement of11 warning. The Respondent recognizes that our hands are12 tied.13 The Respondent also doesn't really try to do14 much with salvaging the First Circuit's dodge on15 supremacy by saying we could stay out of the market.16 Instead, what the Respondent does is he tries to carve17 out a distinction between strict liability and18 negligence claims.19 And all I will say before reserving my time20 is there's simply no basis in the law. This Court made21 clear in Riegel and in Cipollone and in several other22 cases that with respect to preemption, the same rules23 apply, strict liability or negligence imposed24 requirements by this case.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.17￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Mr. Yang?ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG,FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERMR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:New Hampshire law applies a hybrid design-defect standard that imposes liability for harm caused by a product if the product, in light of the manufacturer's warnings, is unreasonably dangerous.Now, that standard falls within the traditional way that this Court has looked atimpossibility preemption in Mensing. It's also implicit in Levine because the analysis of the courts -- the analysis in Levine reflects an implicit judgment that the manufacturer could simply stop selling the product. You know, if that were enough to avoid a Federal impossibility preemption, there'd be no reason to dothe analysis --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's alittle different. Our cases are focused on the concern that the State is going to impose on the manufacturer a different duty than the Federal government.That's not what's going on in a strict liability regime. They're saying, we're not saying you18￼1 should have a different structure, we're not saying2 anything about warning, we're saying if you do this,3 you're going to have to pay for the damage. It's not --4 it's not a different duty. And I think that's what's5 underlying the argument that, well, you can just stop6 selling because you don't have to adjust how you're7 going to make the drug. You understand that it's going8 to be the same as the Federal drug, but our system is,9 you pay for the damage.10 MR. YANG: There are two, I think, arguments11 embedded within that. There is a question of whether12 State tort law, whether by negligence or strict13 liability, imposes a duty that might conflict with the14 Federal obligation. And the second argument, I think,15 which is distinct, is that if you could simply stop16 selling, that would be a way of -- of cancelling17 impossibility preemption if there were in fact a18 conflict between the two standards.19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: How would you define the20 duty that New Hampshire imposed here according to the21 First Circuit and according to the Respondent?22 MR. YANG: The duty is that one cannot23 market an unreasonably dangerous drug in light of the24 warnings -- that's unreasonably dangerous in light of25 the warnings. And what that means is that a19￼1 manufacturer will have to pay money in the liability2 suit if he doesn't meet that standard.3 And as this Court recognized in Riegel and4 in earlier -- in Cipollone, that this type of tort5 obligation, when you contingent -- make an obligation to6 pay tort liability based on meeting a standard under7 State law, that is a duty that could conflict with a8 Federal duty. And the Federal duty here --9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But is that meeting10 a standard under State law that your friend's argument11 says, that's not what we're talking about here. The12 standard is the same. It's just a question under strict13 liability that if you follow the same Federal standard14 and market this in our State, you're going to pay the15 compensation for the reason of -- you know, spreading16 the costs.17 We don't want you to do something different.18 We just want to say that you want to do the same thing19 as the Federal government, and then you're going to have20 to pay. It's different than the -- at least that's how21 I understand their argument, which is that it's22 different where the situation says, yes, you can market23 it and avoid payment, but only if you do it our way.24 That's a different duty for the manufacturer.25 MR. YANG: Well, with respect to the20￼1 question of stop selling, which I think is what your2 question goes to, that you can always escape liability3 if you simply stop selling and don't have the market.4 It's not clear to me, first, that Respondent is, in5 fact, adopting the government's position because in our6 view, the obligation to change the labeling to make it7 safer and therefore escape liability under design-defect8 law in New Hampshire falls within the Court's decision9 in PLIVA v.1011 is material12 selling means that there's really not a conflicting13 obligation. And as that would have been true in14 Mensing, it would have been true also in Levine, and15 would not have necessitated any impossibility analysis.16 And I think this, as my brother was just17 explaining, traces back to Florida Lime and Avocado18 Growers. The court framed the impossibility preemption19 inquiry there -- and I think this is important -- at the20 top of page 143. It says, the question is whether21 compliance with Federal and State regulation is a22 physical impossibility for one engaged in interstate23 commerce. That was the -- the formulation.24 So the idea is if you are an avocado grower25 in Florida and the Federal government said you have to21Mensing.The only distinguishing factor we think that here would be whether the ability to stop￼1 pick your avocados before they're at 7 percent oil and2 then California says, you can't sell in our State unless3 it's 8 percent oil, it's impossible to be a person4 engaged in interstate commerce there unless you violate5 one of those obligations. And when you have to violate6 one of those obligations, it's the State law that --7 that falls. And I think, Justice Kagan, you were8 explaining --9 JUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, that suggests that10 there is an obligation of the Federal government. If11 there is one, yes, there's a conflict and yes, there's12 an impossibility defense. But if there's no obligation,13 if all there is, is permission from the Federal14 government, where do you get the impossibility from?15 MR. YANG: Let me draw a distinction if --16 that I think might help.17 When the Federal government were to say --18 let's go -- stay with avocados -- that avocados must19 have at least 7 percent oil. And the State says, you20 know what, we think it actually needs 8 percent oil.21 It's not impossible to comply there. But what we have22 here is a comprehensive regulatory scheme, where an23 expert agency with the relevant information makes an24 expert judgment based on sound -- sound scientific25 evidence that this drug is, in fact, safe and effective22￼1314151617 don't think 18MR. YANG: Our -- our position is -- JUSTICE KAGAN: And that's --MR. YANG: -- a little narrower.JUSTICE KAGAN: -- and that's something I we've really ever said.MR. YANG: I don't think the Court has19 addressed this question expressly. That is -- that's20 true. But I think our position is a little -- little1 and--2 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I take that point,3 Mr. Yang. I take that point, Mr. Yang, but I think then4 you're -- you're saying something quite deep about the5 FDCA, which is that the FDCA should not be thought of as6 merely authorizing drug sales.7 You're saying essentially that when the --8 when the FDA does what it does, it's saying not just --9 you know, you can do this if you want to, but you can do10 this and we really think this drug ought to be marketed.11 So that when States take action as against that -- you12 know, it's -- it's a conflict.￼21 tighter than that. Which is, when the State is imposing22 an obligation, they do it based on a safety standard --23 that is in fact second-guessing the FDA -- that is24 preemptive.25Not simply because the FDA has set the231 standard, but the FDCA also has within it the judgment2 that safety is best effectuated not only by having the3 FDA set the standard, but by forbidding any manufacturer4 from deviating from that once it's been approved by the5 FDA.6 When we're talking about a drug's7 formulation, the manufacturer cannot change it. And8 that's what brings this within the ambit of9 PLIVA v. Mensing. And it also, I think, reflects why10 the Florida Lime example is -- is relevant because11 when --12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So without the13 preemption clause, actually, with an express saving14 clause, you're arguing essentially complete field15 preemption. You're basically saying the minute that the16 FDA gives you permission to sell, it's a right to sell.17 And -- and it can't be altered by any State police18 power.19 MR. YANG: No, we're -- we're actually not20 saying that.21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I don't see how22 you're not saying that.23 MR. YANG: Well, no, with respect to the24 design-defect claims that -- and failure to warn, with25 respect to generics -- remember, this is exactly what24￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the Court said in Mensing -- we're saying the result in Mensing controls here.Now,ifwegoto the pure design-defect claim -- and a pure claim, in our view, is one in which carves out the failure to warn issue, and it hypothesizes a reasonable physician that knows allthe -- the health benefits and risks --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's your -- you're telling me that's exactly what the FDA is saying. You're saying there is no such thing.MR. YANG: No, but we -- in that --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And there's no strict liability that a State could impose.MR. YANG: If I might just finish.JUSTICE SCALIA: I would like to hear youranswer.MR. YANG: Yes. When that pure design-defect standard has been satisfied, it means that no physician would prescribe the drug for any person, which means that drug, regardless of how you might improve the warnings -- it just doesn't matter because they know all -- all the adverse and positive benefits of the drug. It should not be marketed because it should never be prescribed.And when it should not be marketed and it25￼1 complies with the Federal government's misbranding2 standard, about dangerous to health when used as3 instructed, and it honors the FDA's rule by requiring4 new and scientifically significant information that was5 not previously before the FDA, that would not be6 preemptive. That is not this case.7 And so what we are trying to do is preserve8 the FDA's role here, not have juries second-guess on a9 case-by-case and State-by-State basis imposing different10 safety obligations on manufacturers when the Congress has11 established a regime for FDA to control this.12 Now, we're not saying the FDA's decision is13 forever binding. If there is new and scientifically14 significant evidence that hasn't been considered by the15 FDA -- and this is analogous to what the Court already16 did in Wyeth v. Levine -- because there, in the17 impossibility preemption, the Court looked to whether or18 not there would be newly acquired information that would19 allow a manufacturer to go within the changes being20 effected regulation in order to change the labeling.21 So what we're doing is just like what the22 Court required to be done in Wyeth, that in that23 context, if you meet the Federal misbranding standard,24 and you avoid the problem of PLIVA -- because you don't25 have -­26￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This applies to everything that requires FDA approval, or is this a prescription drug-only rule?MR. YANG: May I answer?CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Briefly.MR. YANG: With respect to failure to warn,you can -- prescription drugs can be sued, generics cannot. With respect to pure design-defect claims, our view applies to both.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.Mr. Frederick?ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICKON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT MR. FREDERICK: Thank you,Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:I'd like to start with the questions thatyou and Justice Alito posed about State law because it's important to understand, before you have impossibility conflict preemption, to understand what the State duty is here.I think it was conceded that it would not be impossible to have an absolute liability regime. So the question here is because New Hampshire actually makes it somewhat easier for manufacturers to evade liability, that that somehow creates a different kind of preemption27￼1 problem. We would submit that it doesn't.2 What the State law is seeking to do here,3 Mr. Chief Justice, is to impose liability where there is4 proof of an unreasonably dangerous product.5 That unreasonable danger entails evidence of6 a risk/benefit analysis that looks at the overall risks7 to the population against the overall benefits that are8 provided to910 this, right? 11121314 true decide15 cost/benefit analysis is for a -- a very novel drug that16 unquestionably has some deleterious effects, but also17 can save some lives.18 And the jury's going to decide that?19 MR. FREDERICK: Yes, it is.20 And notably, the FDCA doesn't preclude that.21 Wyeth v. Levine affirms that principle. And what's22 important here is that under State law, there's not a23 duty to change the design or to change the label. It24 is, Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, exactly as you25 postulated, that if there is an unreasonably dangerous28the drug.JUSTICE SCALIA: The jury decides all ofMR. FREDERICK: That's correct.JUSTICE SCALIA: That's wonderful.Twelve -- twelve tried men and few -- and for the whole State what the -- what the￼1 drug, that the people that are harmed egregiously, like2 Karen Bartlett, will have an opportunity to compensation3 --4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not so sure --5 I'm not so sure it works that way because of the jury6 point. They didn't say that yes, you can market this7 drug, it benefits -- you know, 99.9 percent of the8 people, but there is that 0.1 percent, and you're going9 to have to compensate that person.10 They said the risks outweigh the benefits,11 period. So you should not market this at all. And it12 does seem inconsistent with the -- the Federal regime.13 MR. FREDERICK: Well, of course,14 Mr. Chief Justice, Mutual put in their defense in this15 case -- they rested after the plaintiffs put in their16 case. So it's not to say that in another case, they17 wouldn't have an opportunity to prove that there is some18 benefit of their drug.19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what do you in20 that case? You've got one jury saying the risks21 outweigh the benefits, can't do it. And then you're22 saying well, later, there might be another jury saying23 yes, you can.24 MR. FREDERICK: Well, there's no claim25 preclusion effect of a jury verdict, and that is why29￼1 there is no offensive collateral estoppel that would be2 applied, Mutual can adopt a different trial strategy.3 It is often the case, Mr. Chief Justice, that in these4 kinds of cases, the defense applies different tactics to5 how they defend this case.6 In this particular case, they chose to waive7 their comment k affirmative defense. They chose not to8 put in any affirmative evidence itself. They chose9 after the trial in their Rule 50 motion for judgment as10 a matter of law not to challenge the warning11 instructions that were given to the jury -- as Judge12 Boudin noted and as the district court noted -- they had13 waived their preemption warning argument.14 And so what they seek to do here after not15 being able to show, which they cannot show under New16 Hampshire Supreme Court precedent, Vautour and Kelleher,17 cases that we cited in our brief, that New Hampshire18 imposes any duty to change any conduct by the19 manufacturer whatsoever.20 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Frederick, it -- it does21 seem to me, and I understand that there's a waiver22 argument floating around here, but it does seem to me23 that this case was litigated such that the adequacy of24 the warning is really all over this case. There was25 expert testimony about the adequacy of the warning,30￼1 there were jury instructions about the adequacy of the2 warning.3 In the closing statements that the lawyer4 gave, it was -- there was a lot of talk about -- that5 the FDA's decision to change the label, to show that the6 label was ineffective before. So there is just all over7 this stuff about adequacy of the warning, which does8 suggest that this is sort of within the four corners of9 Mensing.10 MR. FREDERICK: Let me address that because11 I think that's the hardest part of this case to12 understand, and why this is different from Mensing. In13 a strict liability case in New Hampshire, the warning is14 not relevant as a -- as an element of the claim. What15 the jury is required as an element of the claim is to16 prove unreasonable dangerousness.17 And District Judge La Plant, who presided18 over this very complex and difficult trial with a lot of19 skill, understood the difference between the concept of20 adequacy of a warning which describes the risks and21 efficacy of the warning which limits or minimizes the22 risks.23 And all over the pretrial instructions, he24 made very clear to the counsel, you are not to argue25 about adequacy of the warning because that goes to the31￼1 comment k defense that they waived on the eve of trial.2 Instead, once the jury finds that the drug is3 unreasonably dangerous, it may use the warning as a way4 to limit or minimize the risk.5 In other words, the warning could only6 benefit Mutual because liability was going to be found7 in spite of the warning and not because of the warning.8 JUSTICE BREYER: I see that. But I don't9 understand why that matters. That is, the -- I mean, I10 was thinking just what you said. I was thinking well,11 I -- I dissented in the other case, but I lost, okay?12 So I lost, I lost. The -- the -- the point is that --13 that you have a drug, and you say to the jury, well, if14 there were no warning here at all, then it would be15 unreasonably dangerous.16 I think, yes, that probably applies to17 chemotherapy, it probably applies to Parkinson's, it18 probably applies to all kind, but you see, says the19 defense, there is a warning here and it says how to use20 it. And as you say, that would be not -- it would be21 despite or whatever it is, despite, not because.22 But it seems to me in terms of -- it comes23 for the same thing, lots of drugs would be dangerous,24 too dangerous, unreasonably so without a warning.25 Chemotherapy is what I'm thinking of. But properly32￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425labeled they're not, and so that seems to be your case. MR. FREDERICK: It is not.JUSTICE BREYER: Because -- why?MR. FREDERICK: No, absolutely not,Justice Breyer. The evidence here was clear. No warning would have made any difference to lessening the risk. And that is because, and this is on --JUSTICE BREYER: In other words, in this case, they have to find that -- that no warning -- there is no such warning that could make a difference, that's what they're asked to find?MR. FREDERICK: All that they -- in terms of minimizing the risk. Justice Breyer, here --JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how can that be,Mr. Frederick, because the plaintiff really spent a large portion of their case trying to show this, that the warning was inadequate. So the plaintiff must have thought that there was a possibility that if the warning was adequate, the jury would find one thing, but if the warning was not adequate, liability would follow.MR. FREDERICK: The case as it was litigated up until the day before the trial was with a comment k defense, which allows as an affirmative defense the defendant to say if the drug is unavoidably unsafe and it has an adequate warning, i.e. it adequately describes33￼1 what the risks are, complete immunity from suit.2 They abandoned that comment k defense on the3 eve of trial. And so as the judge understood and4 instructed the jury, the only role that the warning5 actually played was whether it could lessen the risk to6 patients who took the drug, i.e. in the risk/benefit7 analysis, it's somewhat less risky in weighing it8 against the benefits.9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The failure -- the10 failure to warn defense was -- the -- the judge struck11 that out. So there was no failure to warn defense in12 the case.13 MR. FREDERICK: That's correct, that's￼14 correct. And as the Le Blanc case held in the15 New Hampshire Supreme Court, the New Hampshire law16 treats failure to warn cases as distinct from17 design-defect cases. Here, no words would have made any18 difference because the scientific --19 JUSTICE BREYER: Where is that? That's -- I20 do see that distinction. If, what you're -- but look,21 the complaint's filled with words about adequate22 warning, no adequate warning, no adequate warning, da,23 da, da.24 2534MR. FREDERICK: Yes.JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now what you're1 saying is, is really what the jury found, nothing to do2 with adequate. There is no warning in the world that3 anybody could have invented that would have made a4 difference. I'll have to think about that one. But in5 the meantime, where is it that that's what they said?6 MR. FREDERICK: Where is it in the record?7 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. How do I discover8 that you're right about this? Because everything in9 the -- in the complaint that I've read so far seems to10 talk about the adequacy of warnings, not that there is11 no warning in the universe could possibly have made a12 difference.13 MR. FREDERICK: Well, I would direct you to14 two --15 JUSTICE BREYER: How do I discover that?16 MR. FREDERICK: -- two pieces. The JMOL17 order that the judge issued, which is in the petition18 appendix, goes through this very clearly. And Judge Le19 Plant understood how the different roles of warning20 apply, and he instructed the jury, and this is in the21 pre-formal colloquy that he's giving to the jury orally,22 you can find this at 496 of the Joint Appendix where he23 says, "Adequacy is not an issue for -- the adequacy of24 the warning is not an issue for you to decide."25 He then goes further to explain that "You35￼1 will only consider the warning after you have considered2 the unreasonable danger" -- that's at 513 to 514, and3 then on page 516 of the Joint Appendix, he says, "You4 only consider the warning to minimize the risk," i.e. to5 benefit Mutual in the assessment of whether or not in a6 risk/benefit analysis this drug has greater risks7 than --8 JUSTICE BREYER: The second point is a9 different point. The second point is, look, I have10 chemotherapy, it saves 100 and it kills 10. All right.11 If you have no label at all, a jury might find it was12 unreasonably dangerous, but once you put in the label13 explaining the whole thing, it doesn't. It isn't14 unreasonably dangerous because of the situation, and15 they could perhaps wouldn't find it.16 All right. Now, you can call that17 diminishing or you could call it adequacy. Call it what18 you want, but that seems to me to come to the same thing19 and is different from saying, no label in the universe20 would say it.21 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Breyer, a22 chemotherapy drug has got a huge benefit. It23 potentially saves you from cancer. A nonsteroidal24 antiinflammatory drug, of which there were 16 other25 types, is not at all analogous to a chemotherapy drug.36￼1 JUSTICE BREYER:2 juries could find and that's3 about Parkinson's -- I don't4 That's why I said let the FDA say it.5 MR. FREDERICK: But that's why when the jury6 gets evidence that aspirin and acetaminophen, Tylenol7 produce the same kind of pain relief, but they do not8 produce the kind of SJS/TEN that Ms. Bartlett -- that9 caused 60 percent of her body to burn. I mean, that10 gives you a very clear contrast.11 JUSTICE ALITO: If that's correct, and maybe12 it is, doesn't that mean the drug should never have been13 approved?14 MR. FREDERICK: No, because the evidence at15 the time of approval had not yet been ascertained. What16 was clear from the unpublished Pharmacia report that17 went into evidence in this case was that between the18 time of 1980 and 1997, the adjusted reporting rate of19 these adverse incidents went very high, and it was of a20 rate that was comparable to Bextra, which went on the21 market several years after that study ended, in which22 the FDA, in looking at a comparable adjusted adverse23 reporting rate, concluded should be taken off the24 market.2537We're talking about what what -- and I don't know know what these drugs are.￼JUSTICE ALITO: But isn't it true that when1 the -- the FDA reviewed this whole class of drugs, they2 decided to pull Bextra, but not this drug?3 MR. FREDERICK: That is true, but what the4 FDA did not take into account, and this is what the5 district judge instructed the jury on September 22nd,6 2010, I think it's page 108 in the charging colloquy, is7 the evidence in this case was that the FDA did not have8 that evidence.9 So what the Solicitor General seeks to argue10 here is evidence that was not in the record and in which11 Mutual's own expert who created this evidence testified12 in deposition he didn't give it to the FDA. And then13 Mutual never put him on the stand to be cross examined.14 And so now what we have is a trial record that shows15 this evidence was not given to the FDA at all.16 JUSTICE ALITO: The -- the SG says that the17 FDA did have this right, did have it and did consider18 it, and that's incorrect?19 MR. FREDERICK: That is incorrect. That the20 FDA, if it considered it, there is no record of it doing21 so because in the response to the 2005 citizen petition22 and in a later memorandum, it never mentions sulindac.23 So if you are to take any kind of regulatory preemption24 here, it surely has to be on the basis of a considered25 action that the FDA takes after notice and comment38￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425rulemaking.That was the kind of standard that was advocated in the concurring opinion in Wyeth v. Levine, that is absent here. And, in fact, this case has even a weaker case for that kind of considered and rejected than in Levine itself where there was evidence that Phenergan had caused some arterial exposure.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you want me to write down in this case, from my understanding, that under New Hampshire law, strict liability is determined quite without reference to the adequacy of warning?MR. FREDERICK: You can do that. Yes, Justice Kennedy, you can do that. It is a factor forthe jury to claim. Andconsider. It is not an element of the what PLIVA makes clear --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now wait. What's --￼what's a factor? The warning is or is not a factor?MR. FREDERICK: The warning can be a factor.What that --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that's -- that's not the thrust of your argument. And I think it was a factor here for some of the reasons Justice Kagan has suggested.MR. FREDERICK: And Justice Kennedy -- JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, which does -- was391 the warning relevant or not relevant to the2 determination of strict liability?3 MR. FREDERICK: Yes, it was relevant as in4 this case. But, Justice Kennedy, if you were to take5 the position that mere evidence that is a factor for the6 jury to consider, even though there is no need to change7 any legal duty, you would be adopting field preemption8 under this statute because the whole thrust of PLIVA --9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm talking about the10 definition of the duty. Was it permissible for the jury11 to define the duty here and the breach of the duty in12 part by -- by reference to the adequacy of the warning?13 And I -- I now understand your answer to be yes.14 MR. FREDERICK: No. And let's be clear on15 our nomenclature here. A duty is a legal requirement16 imposed under State common law, a duty to use due care,17 a duty to change the label, which is what was conceded18 in PLIVA and Mensing. Here New Hampshire law does not19 require a duty to change the label or to change the20 design. All it does, Justice Kennedy, is to say, if the21 jury finds that the risks outweigh the benefits, it may22 consider whether the warning would have lessened the23 risk.24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you are saying25 there is a huge difference between saying you didn't put40￼1 the warning2 saying, you3 the warning4in, so you are liable for $9 million, and are liable for $15 million, but if you put in, you are only liable for 9 million?MR. FREDERICK: Well, when there is a5 comment k defense, Mr. Chief Justice, you may be off6 completely.7 critical in89 get back toAnd that's why the role of comment k is so these strict liability claims. All -- CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -- but just to my -- to my question. You say there is a10 difference between saying, you have to put on warning11 and you are going to be liable if you don't, and saying,12 you are liable no matter no matter what because it's13 strict liability, but if you put on a warning it's14 reduced. If you are a drug manufacturer, you are15 supposed to see a difference in those two situations?16 MR. FREDERICK: There is a difference, and17 the difference is this, assume in the Diana Levine case18 there had been a strict liability claim that went all19 the way through. The question under a strict liability20 law would be would a -- would -- did the warning lessen21 the risk that she would have had gangrene and amputation22 of her arm? The adequacy of the warning under a strict23 liability law simply goes to did the manufacturer24 adequately describe the risks that the patient might25 incur.41￼1 In the Levine case it very well might have2 been that the warning adequately describes that there's3 a possibility of gangrene, but it didn't do enough to4 lessen the risk that she would sustain. And because5 there was a way to change the label to lessen that risk,6 she got a judgment for a failure to warn. Because the7 manufacturer's conduct was such that it could have8 improved the label.9 Here we acknowledge and the evidence shows10 there is no way to change the label here. Some --11 some -- some number of people, maybe some in this room,12 might take sulindac and get SJS/TEN. We don't know who13 they are, and we can't write words that would tell14 anyone in this room, you have a lesser chance of getting15 that horrible disease.16 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, but then if you apply17 this -- what is deeply bothering me in all these cases,18 and it's why I came up and said, the FDA has to19 tell us -- you know. Because just what you said before;20 what you say applies to sulindac also applies to 1221 people who will tell the Mary Hitchcock Hospital up in22 Dartmouth that they can't use a certain kind of23 chemotherapy.24 You see, you could in certain horrible cases25 find a very sympathetic plaintiff who really did suffer42￼1 terribly. And -- and -- and you are getting 12 people2 rather than the FDA. So my solution to it, which you3 know because you read Medtronics, may not work, but it's4 the best I can think of.5 Now, what -- what -- you can tell me if you6 want, no, there is some totally different thing. But7 what you are saying at the moment, what I do in my mind8 is I say, beware because it's also true potentially of9 some of these life-saving drugs and that's what's10 worrying me.11 MR. FREDERICK: Let's be clear,12 Justice Breyer. There is a difference between the13 application of impossibility preemption, which I don't14 think anybody here can argue with a straight face that15 simply paying a judgment in strict liability is16 impossible in light of the Federal regime, an obstacle17 preemption.18 Now, it may well be that there could be19 cases out there like your life-saving type drug, which20 by the way has a special regulation under a special21 statute to ensure that that is on the market, and some22 other drug where the risk/benefit equation is -- is23 such.24 But surely in our system we have to trust25 district judges to be able to grant or deny judgments as43￼1 a matter of law, where they conclude that the evidence2 would not be sufficient to show that the risk outweighed3 the benefit.4 And here, the judge made very clear that5 because Mutual had not put in any evidence of the6 benefit of its drug at all and arguably couldn't have7 done so because this drug is like aspirin -- except that8 it causes these horrific injuries -- it's reasonable to9 suppose that a jury which can decide misbranding actions10 under the FDCA, and that has been acknowledged by the11 majority in Wyeth v. Levine, can make the very same12 risk/benefit safety determination that Justice Thomas in13 his concurring opinion said also is -- enabled the14 States to make. The States are not precluded under the15 FDCA from making that kind of judgment.16 So in the hard case, Justice Breyer, there17 is a mechanism for preemption. The FDA has to act. It18 has to act pursuant to notice and comment rulemaking.19 It has to identify which drugs it thinks would not be20 subject to these kinds of strict liability claims, but21 it hasn't done that here.22 All it's done is to say, we happen to have23 some evidence in our files, ergo preemption. Well,24 preemption doesn't work like that under the Supremacy25 Clause.44￼1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just -- just to --2 because my memory is failing me, is this drug still on3 the market?4 MR. FREDERICK: Yes.5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. And is it on6 the market with a different label?7 MR. FREDERICK: It is. The label changed8 after Karen Bartlett sustained the injuries that she did9 in this case. In fact, that was one of the arguments10 that -- that at the time, this was before PLIVA, okay?11 So there was a lot of failure to warn being argued12 because the regime, as the case came into trial was13 under Wyeth v. Levine, it was not under the14 PLIVA v. Mensing case.15 So Justice Kagan, that's why it's perfectly16 reasonable for the trial lawyers here to think that the17 warning is an appropriate thing because this Court's18 case that had just been decided made that perfectly19 clear. But what was interesting here was that Judge La20 Plant made a very clear distinction between the role21 that the warning would play, appropriately so, under a22 strict liability regime.23 Now, I would like to note that the avocado24 case is one that did not entail the State banning25 avocado sales. Judge Boudin is absolutely right when he45￼1 says that there is nothing under the FDCA to preclude2 the State from making a reasonable safety determination3 that might lead to the withdrawal of the drug. Now,4 admittedly, that is a rare circumstance.5 And that is not what New Hampshire is doing6 here, and in his post-trial orders Judge La Plant made7 clear that is not what New Hampshire is imposing here.8 All New Hampshire is imposing here is a duty to pay9 compensation if your unreasonably dangerous product10 harms a patient.1112 the13 the14 it?1516 here, if there is any duty to stop selling under New17 Hampshire law, it can be complied with by not selling18 the drug. There's nothing in Federal law that requires19 or mandates the sale of these drugs.20 JUSTICE ALITO: But that's true -- isn't21 that true often in -- in these impossibility cases? Let22 me say Congress passes a law that says everywhere in the23 United States you must drive on the right side of the24 road, and New Hampshire is quirky, they say, in New25 Hampshire you have to drive on the left side of the46JUSTICE ALITO: This argument about stopping sale of the drug completely seems to me to eliminate impossibility -- impossibility preemption, doesn't￼MR. FREDERICK: No, because the -- the duty1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425road. That would seem to me to be a very clear impossibility case, wouldn't it?MR. FREDERICK:JUSTICE ALITO: both rules by not driving. MR. FREDERICK: JUSTICE ALITO: MR. FREDERICK: to try comply with both atYes.But you could comply withIt would be very dangerous. Not to drive at all?Well, it would be dangerousthe same time. But certainly You decide -- if you decide Yeah. If the difference --if--to drive --JUSTICE ALITO:MR. FREDERICK:right. But the difference, Justice Alito, is what is the content of the substantive duty. If the content of the substantive duty is you -- the State says to do one thing and the Feds say do the opposite, that's impossibility conflict.￼JUSTICE SCALIA: The Feds didn't say to do the opposite. They said -- they didn't say you have to drive in New Hampshire. They say, you must drive on the right if you drive. They don't require you to drive in New Hampshire.MR. FREDERICK: Right, but our position, Justice Scalia, is if you that follow PLIVA to what it471 says in its logical extension, you look at the -- you2 look at the content of the duty there, the content of3 the duty was to change the label. What the majority4 opinion says is that Minnesota and Louisiana law said5 you must change the label and the Federal government6 says, you cannot change the label. So here --7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, just -- I'm8 sorry to interrupt you. But your friend on the other9 side, of course, says PLIVA involves strict liability as10 well. So it did not say you must change the label.11 MR. FREDERICK: Actually we dispute what12 they say, and we've got an -- an excursus about Mensing13 in our brief, and what is clear is that as the case came14 to this Court, the only duty that was being litigated15 was the duty concerning the warning label. There was16 not a strict liability claim in the sense of a design17 defect.18 Mind you, there are strict liability claims19 in -- in failure to warn as well. That is essentially20 what comment k gets at. This case however, was tried as21 a design case only, and the State law duty made very22 clear there was no duty to change the design of the23 drug. And so therefore, under Mensing, there can't be24 impossibility because State law is not telling you --25 JUSTICE BREYER: But even the compensation,48￼1 suppose you had strict liability that Florida Avocado2 Growers could -- what they have to do, all they have to3 do since they can just be fined and the money would go4 to pay the consumers of California who have the5 unfortunate mixup sometimes of eating Florida avocados.6 I mean, that would raise at least serious problems of --7 commerce clause problems and preemption and so forth.8 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Breyer, that's not9 an impossibility hypothetical. That's an obstacle10 hypothetical. And in Wyeth, I think six justices said11 there is no12 remedies to1314 to keep these concepts of preemption distinct is that15 they ask you to grant cert on whether or not it isobstacle under the FDCA of having State law compensate injured patients.So you know, the reason why it's important￼16 impossible to comply in light of PLIVA, which was an17 impossibility preemption case. That was not an obstacle18 preemption case.19 Now, having -- you know, I think gotten a20 deeper view of what State law requires, they're seeking21 to shift the case into an obstacle case, and virtually22 all of the Federal government's arguments here are23 obstacle-type arguments. It is because the FDA is so24 expert that it has this information in its files and25 that that should therefore negate and displace and498MR. FREDERICK: Yes, yes. Our position, and we made this clear that all they were asking petition was for an impossibility look at obstacle argument has been waived in our1 nullify State law, which is a rather sweeping2 proposition.3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is your point in this4 case that obstacle preemption has been waived?5 MR. FREDERICK: Granted --6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or were you granted cert7 just on impossibility?9 we--we--10 in the cert11 PLIVA. The12 view of the13 cases and then decides them. So -- and on the14 impossibility point, I think that our position is clear.15 Now, Justice Kagan, the very first question16 out of the box was does this rule that they'reway this Court ordinarily takes certiorari￼17 advocating apply to brand name drugs and the answer18 unfortunately is yes. Because the premise of their19 argument is that simply because the FDA approved the20 drug and there would need to be some State law claim21 that would give rise to some alteration, that that22 necessarily would mean that it would be impossible to23 comply with.24 And so that applies to brand name drugs as25 well as generic drugs. We don't see a principal501 difference, unfortunately, to distinguish them. There2 may be some difference in certain State laws. I don't3 want to speak for all 50 States, but the basic gist of4 their argument is FDA approval über alles.5 JUSTICE KAGAN: There is no such thing then6 as a brand name manufacturer can change some design7 features of the drug -- you know, without FDA approval8 or without going back to square one of the FDA, there's9 nothing like that?10 MR. FREDERICK: No, the FDA requires a -- a11 new drug or an abbreviated drug application, I get the12 terms of them sometimes confused, but if there was to be13 a tweak to the design, they'd need to go to the FDA to14 get approval for that.￼15 I want to make one other point, which is16 that strict liability applies to distributors as well as17 to manufacturers. And so here it seems obvious that a18 distributor can't change the design and it cannot change19 the label.2021 liability,22 product in23 product that causes somebody to be injured, you can be24 held liable in strict liability. That principle is very25 well settled.51But under normal principles of strictthe idea is that if you are a seller of the your normal course and it is a dangerous1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425And so it would seem odd to suppose that the distributor who has no power to make any change in conduct that would make the product any safer also gets to be immunized from suit.I have no further points unless the Court has further questions.JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you respond to the argument, Mutual's argument that they have -- in 2005, they made -- this drug produced $7 million. The jury verdict was 21 million. They said that 3 years of their earnings wiped out.MR. FREDERICK: Justice Ginsburg, I've never been in a case in my time arguing before this Court where somebody in a reply brief at the merits put in evidence that they did not put in at trial and they sought to persuade you that that was somehow relevant.Number 2, the issue here concerns sulindac manufactured by all the different manufacturers of sulindac, not just Mutual.Number 3, we never have seen that information. It was never served on us. We have no way to test it. I have no idea whether it is accurate or not.Number 4, if they are only making$7 million, they ought to withdraw from the market52￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425because their -- their product causes such horrific injuries it ought not to be sold.Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Lefkowitz, you have three minutesremaining.REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAY P. LEFKOWITZON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. LEFKOWITZ: Thank you. I'd like to justmake three brief points.It is rather incredible to hear counsel talkabout how the warnings were not the issue in this case. From the opening statement of plaintiff's counsel, I'm quoting now, "The evidence will show you that sulindac was unreasonably dangerous and had an inadequate warning as well. One of the easiest ways to show you this will be to show you that they got a new and better warning about six months after respondent took the drug. The label got better.And at CA App. 2761, we have the FDA letter￼explaining exactly why, in the FDA's view, warning was going to make the drug safer. said" --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you get jury's -- to the instructions to the jury?53the new What itto the1 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Absolutely not. It was a2 proper instruction under New Hampshire law. It was an3 instruction that --4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that's what the jury5 was supposed to apply, not what counsel said.6 MR. LEFKOWITZ: The jury applied the7 instruction that the court gave it, which was to decide8 whether or not the jury was good enough -- the warning9 was good enough or not. And, in fact, as the First10 Circuit made very, very clear at PA 18A, it said, the11 label was relevant to the design defect. The lack of a12 clearer warning made the product itself more dangerous13 under the risk/benefit analysis of New Hampshire law.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you just said there15 was nothing wrong with the jury instructions, at least16 you didn't object.￼1718 We objected19 this is all20 the warnings. The warnings are acceptable as a matter21 of Federal law. And this Court, every Justice on the22 Court agreed in Mensing that we couldn't change the23 warnings. Once the Court rejected that, it was a fair24 statement of New Hampshire law.25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How -- how did the Court54MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, let me be clear. at the very beginning of this case, we said preempted. There is no ability to change1 reject it? They threw out the failure to warn claim.2 MR. LEFKOWITZ: The trial judge rejected our3 summary judgment motion on preemption. We raised these4 issues.5 JUSTICE BREYER: It says on page 5496,6 adequacy of the warning, I guess, the judge says, is not7 an issue before this jury. And that was the point.8 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, he said that, but then9 he went and he instructed the jury and, again, as the10 First Circuit made clear, it was in fact -- the11 dangerousness was because of the arguable inadequacies12 of the warning, which the plaintiff said we could have13 changed, we should have changed.14 I want to just finish with two brief points,15 if I may. On impossibility, look, this impossibility16 doctrine under preemption is premised on the fact that17 parties will engage in conduct. As Justice Breyer made18 clear in his opinion in the Geier case, he said, under19 ordinary obstacle principles, a State might be able to20 make you liable for using the Federally required21 windshield retention requirements.22 Obviously, there is no Federal requirement23 to sell cars. It conditions that if you sell the car,24 you have a requirement. If you sell a drug, a generic25 drug, you have a particular requirement.55￼10111213141516171819202122232425The distinction between strict liability and Cipollone, Riegel, make absolutely clear basis whatsoever for a distinction underCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
