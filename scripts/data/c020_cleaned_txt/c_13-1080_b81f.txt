Association of American Railroads.      Mr. Gannon.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNONON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      The court of appeals held that Section 207of PRIIA was unconstitutional because it believed thatthe statute constituted an actual delegation ofregulatory authority to a private entity.  And none ofthose three things is true about this statute.      First, under Lebron, Amtrak should not beconsidered a private corporation for nondelegationpurposes.  Second, the metrics and standards are notregulatory.  The regulatory effect here comes from thelongstanding statutory preference requirement, which wasenacted by Congress, not Amtrak, and is enforced by anindependent adjudicative agency, the SurfaceTransportation Board.  And third ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Go ahead, please.MR. GANNON:And third, requiring Amtrak to3￼4￼1 approve the metrics and standards before they went into2 effect is not a delegation outside the government under3 this Court's cases.4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think the Lebron5 argument, Marsh v. Alabama, the company town case, no6 one says that it was a governmental agency. It was just7 exercising governmental­like powers which entitled the8 person to exercise free speech. That's all Lebron can9 stand for. You wouldn't say that Marsh v. Alabama, the10 company town, was a governmental agency after reading11 that opinion, would you?12 MR. GANNON: No. I would say that after13 reading the opinion in Lebron, that the Court concluded14 that Amtrak is a governmental entity for things that15 Congress doesn't have control over.16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you could say the17 same thing about Marsh v. Alabama.18 MR. GANNON: Well, I think that the19 difference is that the Court recognized in Lebron that20 Amtrak is a government­created corporation that is under21 the government's control and that under the government's22 control both because of the management control that it23 has over it and because it created the purposes for24 which Amtrak exists and the things that it has to do.25 And then the Court there distinguished between whether Amtrak5￼1 is governmental for constitutional purposes that were2 beyond Congress's control, but acknowledged that3 Congress could control whether Amtrak was governmental4 for other purposes, other powers and privileges of5 government.6 JUSTICE ALITO: If Amtrak is governmental7 for nondelegation purposes, is it also governmental for8 appointments clause purposes?9 MR. GANNON: Well, I think that that follows10 from the ­­ the way the Court approached the question11 about the PCAOB and Free Enterprise Fund where Congress12 had also enacted a statute that said the PCAOB was not13 an agency or instrumentality of government, that no14 board members or employees were going to be considered15 officers or employees of the Federal government. The16 parties in that case, which included the United States,17 did not dispute that the appointments clause and18 separation of powers concerns that were at issue there19 were applicable to the PCAOB, notwithstanding those20 general statements by Congress. And we do think here ­­21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was just going to22 say your argument that Amtrak is governmental for23 purposes of ­­ that doesn't get you to the finish line,24 right? I mean, if you had a law that said the25 Department of Defense and the Department of State will61 consult and jointly issue regulations and if they don't,2 this private individual resolved it for them, that would3 still present the same problems.4 MR. GANNON: Well, I think,5 Mr. Chief Justice, you are referring to the arbitrator6 provision.7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.8 MR. GANNON: Before we get to the arbitrator9 provision, I do think that ­­ that this would resolve10 the question. And ultimately, if this is not regulatory11 authority that cannot be conditioned ­­12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it wouldn't resolve13 the question. Only ­­ only perhaps for delegation14 purposes. But ­­ but it doesn't resolve the ­­ the15 other issue in the case, which is due process. That is16 to say, even if this is a governmental entity, there are17 some things that governmental entities can't do. And,18 indeed, I think that the case law in this area relies on19 the due process clause more than on the distinction20 simply between public and private entities.21 MR. GANNON: Well, to be sure, the Carter22 Coal case talked about both nondelegation ideas and also23 due process issues. We ­­ we would be surprised if24 the Court wanted to decide the due process issue here25 since it wasn't decided by the court of appeals.￼here.      MR. GANNON:red brief here.  And we do think that we're correct onthe merits with respect to the due process issue andthat ­­ for two principal reasons.  One is that what isat stake here is not the equivalent of what was going onin the due process cases.  This is not like thede­licensing of optometrists in the Gibson v. Berryhillcase.  It's not like the wage and hour requirements inCarter Coal, because ­­ because the analogy to thosethings here is the statutory preference requirementrather than the antecedent metrics and standards.JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. But the statutory preference requirement requires ­­ would require consideration of whatever is determined by this body, right?MR. GANNON: The statutory preference requirement is independent of the metrics and standards and preexists them. That is what the Surface Transportation Board would be enforcing in a proceeding under Section 24308(f). The metrics and standards ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: What must it consider?It ­­ it has been argued in the7￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SCALIA:MR. GANNON:JUSTICE SCALIA:    It was raised.It certainty was raised.    And it's ­­ and it's argued81 MR. GANNON: The metrics and standards play2 a triggering and gatekeeping role. The ­­ these3 provisions are reprinted in the government's brief on4 pages 15A and 16A of the appendix, that the ­­ the5 investigation by the Surface Transportation Board is6 triggered by their having been a failure by Amtrak to7 satisfy the metrics and standards. But I think that ­­8 that ­­ that is ­­ and if we're talking about the due9 process cases, that is not the prohibition that10 the Court has been concerned about. If you look at11 cases like Roberge, which talked about Cusack, it said12 that it's okay to have something that is presumptively13 bad banned by the legislature.14 Here, the analogy to that is the statutory15 preference, and it's okay, then, to allow a private16 party to relax its application in certain circumstances.17 And we think that's the role that the metrics and18 standards play here, because Congress could have allowed19 Amtrak to ask for an STB investigation into violations20 of the statute any time it wanted to. And instead what21 they said is that it is only ­­ you are only going to22 get that investigation when you have failed to ­­ to23 perform at an adequate level such that we think there's24 been adequate injury. And then in that investigation,25 you are going to have to establish that the injury to￼      JUSTICE KENNEDY:view, the case would come outcould issue these metrics andown, without consultation with the ­­ or cooperationwith the government.  Same ­­ same case ­­MR. GANNON:JUSTICE KENNEDY:MR. GANNON:One of the ­­     ­­ same result?                         One prong of our argument is,yes, that because this is not regulatory in that sense,this is more like the neighbors being able to veto thebillboard in the neighborhood in Cusack, which the Courtsaid was okay in Roberge, because the statutorypreference is presumptively bad.  Violations of thestatutory preference by the freight railroads were thething that Congress wanted to be enforceable here, andthe metrics and standards just cabin the circumstancesin which Amtrak can seek that type of enforcement.      If I could return to the Chief Justice'squestion about the ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You may. You may.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That doesn't stop ­­ do the metes and standards stop you from initiating or stop the agency from initiating a review, even if a carrier meets the metes and standard?9￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425you was caused by the violation of the statute.So in your ­­ in yourthe same way if Amtrakstandards entirely on its10￼1 MR. GANNON: Well, it's ­­ it's not the2 carrier. It's not the host railroad that would meet the3 standards.4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, it would be ­­5 MR. GANNON: It would be Amtrak's own6 performance.7 But there is ­­ there is ­­ that would8 depend upon the reading of the beginning clause of9 (f)(1) which refers to if on­time performance fails to10 satisfy 80 percent for two consecutive quarters or the11 service quality isn't complied with for two quarters,12 then those are the circumstances in which an13 investigation could be requested and ­­ in which14 instance the STB would need to start the investigation15 or the STB could initiate the investigation.16 And there is an open question about that17 first clause about whether the 80 percent on­time18 performance reference is something that has to be19 predicated upon the metrics and standards. That's been20 briefed before the Surface Transportation Board in the21 proceeding brought against Canadian National, the22 complaint of which is reprinted ­­ a snippet from which23 is reprinted at the end of the joint appendix. And so24 the question there would be whether on­time performance25 there depends upon a pre­PRIIA definition rather than11￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the ones that are included in the metrics and standards.      So there's a possibility that the agencycould ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we were ­­ if we wereto rule that this is not a regulatory action, would thatsatisfy the entire case?  We wouldn't have to go to thedelegation issue or to whether it was public or private,et cetera.MR. GANNON: I ­­ I think that that is right. And I think even in those circumstances, because it ­­ because if it's not regulatory, it's okay for private persons to have that power, and I think that would cover even the question of whether ­­ if ­­ if the arbitrator is assumed to be private. That is not what we think is the case.      And we also think that we don't have to winon that agreement either on ­­ on the question of ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: On ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If the ­­ if the actions are not regulatory, why ­­ why did Amtrak's performance drop dramatically as soon as the Court issued its decision in this case?MR. GANNON: Well, I think that's because of the ­­ that had decreased the threat of enforcement of the statutory preference. I do think that the ­­ it is12￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the statutory preference that is having the regulatoryimpact here.  The freight railroads are not going to beheld liable for Amtrak's failure to satisfy the metricsand standards.  They're going to be held liable forfailing to ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They're going to be ­­ Amtrak can then force a proceeding at which the freight carriers will have to defend, right?MR. GANNON: That ­­ that is correct. And the same thing ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's a significant regulatory impact, to tell railroads I, a private party, get to start a governmental proceeding and you have to show up to defend it.MR. GANNON: Yes. But that ­­ that happens ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And, by the way, if I don't ­­ it's triggered if I don't comply with standards that I get to set.MR. GANNON: It's ­­ but we allow private parties to initiate governmental investigations and enforcement proceedings all the time, either before administrative agencies or courts, and we don't think that that is a delegation of legislative power ­­JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Gannon ­­13￼1 MR. GANNON: ­­ to the person who is2 beginning the investigation.3 JUSTICE KAGAN: Is the ­­ is the government4 able to award damages without the showing that there's5 been a violation of the metrics and standards?6 MR. GANNON: No. That is ­­ that is going7 to be a threshold determination. But as I said, that is8 a ­­ it's serving as a threshold gatekeeping function9 to ­­ of ­­ of limiting the circumstances in which the10 investigation can begin and when there will be damages.11 JUSTICE KAGAN: But I would think if that's12 the case, if the statutory preference does not get ­­ is13 a ­­ if a violation of the statutory preference doesn't14 get you all the way to damages, if there is essentially15 a second requirement which is a violation of the metrics16 and standards, I mean, in effect what the ­­ a statute17 does is it says there are two things you need to show, a18 violation of the preference and a violation of the19 metrics and standards, in order to get to damages. That20 seems ­­ if ­­ if that's the case, it seems kind of21 regulatory.22 MR. GANNON: Well, I ­­ I ­­ I understand23 the impulse, but I think that seems ­­ it ­­ it also24 seems like the ability of the neighbors to veto the25 billboards in Cusack because what Amtrak ­­ all Amtrak1 has done is relax certain circumstances in which the2 freight railroads can be held liable for violating the3 statutory preference. A violation of the statutory4 preference is presumptively a bad thing.5 And what has happened here is Congress has6 recognized that if it doesn't actually cause Amtrak to7 be ­­ to have sufficiently subpar performance, then we8 are not going to make a Federal case out of it and we're9 not going to let Amtrak do so. But ­­ and ­­ and there10 aren't going to be damages at the end of the day.11 But I do think that the real­world reason of12 why the freight railroads had greater incentive to13 cooperate and Amtrak believes that it was their14 cooperation under the regime in which the metrics and15 standards were in effect, and there was still the16 possibility that there would be enforcement proceedings17 before the STB to determine whether the freight18 railroads had failed to comply with the statute ­­19 JUSTICE ALITO: The statute says that the ­­20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we ­­ can we get back21 to the arbitrator? I think the Chief asked that22 question that ­­ and we passed it and assume it's23 regulatory.24 MR. GANNON: Yes.25 JUSTICE GINSBURG:The arbitrator, it's14￼151 argued, need not be a government officer. It could be a2 private officer. I have a question to ask about that3 provision.4 Is it ­­ is this a one­time operation, that5 is, the setting these metrics and standards? In ­­ in6 fact, there was no arbitrator in this picture. Will7 there be a renewal of this, a repetition where there8 might be an arbitrator?9 MR. GANNON: Well, I ­­ I don't think that10 the terms of 207(d) contemplate that the arbitrator will11 come into effect again. I think that because the12 beginning of it says that it ­­ it is only triggered if13 a development of the metrics and standard is not14 completed within the 180­day period required by15 subsection (a), which is the 180 days after PRIIA was16 enacted in 2008.17 And so the arbitration provision was, I18 think, good for one time only. It was never invoked.19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but does that20 matter? I mean, the idea is that having the21 arbitrator ­­ arbitration provision there affected the22 issuance of the regulations.23 MR. GANNON: Yes, I ­­ I understand that24 question, Mr. Chief Justice. I ­­ I think that's ­­25 it ­­ it mattered the first time around. To the extent￼could ­­here, sofor you.that thethe question ­­there's ­­ the issues are pretty intertwinedI know it's a difficult thing to keep track of But if ­­ if ­­ and for us.  But if we thinkregulations have a regulations ­­ not to loadMR. GANNON: The metrics and standards have a regulatory affect.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Metrics and standards are regulations. And if we think there is nothing in the statute that requires ­­ well, I guess it doesn't ­­ doesn't ­­ doesn't really matter.      If that's the case, is the arbitrator anofficer of the United States?  In other words, if he isthe one that ends up issuing what we will hypotheticallyconclude are regulations, I assume he has to be anofficer of the United States.16￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that there may be any amendments to the metrics and ­­ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If ­­MR.

We do not think that the best reading of the arbitrator reference is that that would be a private person. We think that ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know ­­ if I17￼1 MR. GANNON: I ­­ I think that would2 constitute significant governmental authority under3 Buckley against Valeo, and that would be ­­4 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you know, I'm quite5 interested in the government's view of this case, and I6 hope you will calm me down.7 The reason that I find it interesting is8 because it seems to me there are hundreds, maybe9 thousands of organizations that set standards for the10 industry. And some of them operate under government11 memoranda or authority that ask them to do it, the most12 noted being ICANN which sets all the standards for the13 internet.14 Now, it also seems to me very possible that15 a member of such an organization that fails to follow16 the standard could run afoul of other government rules17 or other agency rules or other laws, for example, by18 stalling the internet delivery of services and being19 delayed, and violating some FCC requirement. And since20 I know that there are about 2 or 300 international21 organizations that we belong to, to do such things, I22 just wonder what the implications would be if you lose23 this case. That is to say, if this Court held here that24 if a government, say, Congress, agency, Commerce25 Department, says to a group of private people set181 standards, and then if they fail ­­ or if they do so and2 a member fails to meet a standard, it runs afoul of a3 different rule, such as a rule that you have to have a4 certain speed on the Internet or some such thing. Were5 we to hold that unconstitutional, I have a feeling ­­6 that this is what I want assurance on that I'm wrong ­­ that7 it would work havoc, possibly with the Internet,8 possibly with industry throughout the United States, I9 know not where, possibly in communications, possibly10 with the 200 or so organizations regulated by treaty.11 Now, you've looked into this more than I12 and, therefore, I want you to calm me down and say no,13 this isn't a big­deal case. Don't worry about it.14 MR. GANNON: I think it depends upon how15 broad the Court's ruling is. I think ­­16 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. The ruling is17 narrow. It just says the following. It says, these are18 standards which equal legislation and as a result of19 these standards being legislated by this, I think,20 Quango or something, or whatever, by ­­ by this21 particular entity, bad things happen to freight trains￼22 when they fail to23 they violate some24 unconstitutional.25 MR.

And Ithink that the question here would be because of therole that the metrics and standards play in the STBinvestigation.  I think that would be the only way inwhich the Court would conclude that it is ­­ istantamount to regulations.  We don't believe that theyhave that effect.  We don't think that other standardsthat are conditions for application of ­­ of the law outthere in the world have necessarily the same effectsunder even Respondent's view of the case.  But I ­­ andso I ­­ I think that the one you want to getreassurances from is actually Respondent, that thenature of their challenge is ­­ is narrower than that.But if I could return to the arbitrator ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thanks.      I know it's a ­­ if he is an officer, is thegovernment's issue a principal officer or an inferiorofficer?MR.

I mean, that's what we said in Morrison14 and we repudiated it in a later case, which said the15 touchstone of a ­­ of a principal officer is whether16 that person is not subject to control by somebody else.17 And I don't see how this person is subject to any18 control in ­­ in the task that he's assigned.19 MR. GANNON: Well, in that sense, it's20 consistent with Morrison, and it is not consistent with21 what the Court said was sufficient to enter the question22 in Edmund, but did not say was necessary to answer the23 question in Edmund about there being review within the24 Executive Branch of the decisions being made by the25 Coast Guard judges there.I don't ­­ I don't see how21￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA:2 regulatory effect.

So they had a very immediate8 and clear effect on the behavior of ­­ of the parties.9 Now, do you think that because the10 sentencing guidelines are now just advisory that we11 could have the sentencing guidelines issued by some12 private party that ­­ that is not appointed pursuant to13 the requirements of the Constitution? Because after14 all, they're just advisory. Now, the reality is, they15 have a significant effect on ­­ on the behavior of ­­ of16 lower courts. And I think it's the same thing here.17 There's a significant effect. I don't know ­­18 MR. GANNON: I ­­ I don't think that this is19 the same as the sentencing guidelines, the effect that20 it has on the judges, because those are advice to the21 judges. Here, what the metrics and standards do is they22 satisfy conditions in the world when ­­ when the Federal23 statute is going to be applicable.24 just like the Court contemplated in25 in cases like Currin v. Wallace andIt's in that sense,JW Hampton or indeedRock RoyalLet me ­­ let me talk about22￼10 decades there was a meaningful threat that there would11 be an enforcement proceeding, not to enforce the metrics12 and standards, but to enforce the statutory preference13 requirement, which is not challenged here, which was not14 written by Amtrak, and which would be enforced by the15 Surface Transportation Board in an independent16 adjudication in which they would take evidence from both17 sides and determine what the real story was.

We have judges who receive information in briefs.15 We had lots of guidelines promulgated by the states.16 There are all kinds of systems, and judges do use them,17 and some of them do have a practical effect and make a18 difference.19 But once this Court starts down the road ­­20 and it would be starting, because I am aware of no21 precedent ­­ once we start down the road of saying22 Congress cannot tell even a private agency to go and23 make some standards, which we all know will be followed,24 once we start down that road there is no stopping place25 and, therefore, the measure has nothing to do with25￼1 separation of powers. It is exactly what Justices2 Cardozo, Hughes, Brandeis and Stone said in Carter Coal,3 the measure is the due process clause, and we're all off4 on something of a wild goose chase in this case. That's5 what is suggested to me by the sentencing guideline6 analogy.7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wow, I didn't mean that.8 (Laughter.)9 MR. GANNON: To the extent that Justice10 Scalia also doesn't see a nondelegation problem in11 Carter Coal, then I ­­ I take it that you are agreeing, but I12 think here that ­­ that the criminal sentencing context13 may present different issues. And I do think that the14 basic ­­ the basic reasons why the due process issue is15 not one where we would have a problem is both because of16 the ­­ what we think is the ­­ the fact that this is17 relaxing the regulatory effect of ­­ of the statutory18 preference. And secondly, because those cases about19 bias in the due process context involve the entity20 that's actually doing the adjudication. And here the21 analogy is that's the STB is acting as the Board of22 Optometrists in ­­ in the Gibson v. Berryhill.23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think it was the24 Respondent's brief in which they gave the hypothetical.25 Suppose that the government together with auto26￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425manufacturer A made standards, but then automanufacturers B and C had to follow them.  That seemswrong.  Why is this different?MR. GANNON: I take the point that that seems wrong. We don't think that this is the equivalent of regulating the automotive industry because Congress has put the regulation in place. That's the statutory preference requirement. This is something in which automobile manufacturer A would be, in advance, saying, I, automobile manufacturer ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose Congress put that in place? Suppose Congress said, and once this is promulgated, all manufacturers have to obey it.MR. GANNON: I think that that would ­­ without the federal agreement that we also have here, the federal railroad administration’s contemporaneous agreement with the standards, that would present non delegation problems.      But, if I could reserve the remainder of mytime.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dupree.    ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS H. DUPREE, JR.       ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. DUPREE: Mr. Chief Justice and may it27￼1 please the Court:2 The constitution does not permit Congress to3 create a corporation, deem it nongovernmental, and then4 launch it into the commercial sphere with a for­profit5 mandate and then vest it with regulatory authority over6 other companies in the same industry.7 The text of the constitution places all8 legislative power in the Congress. Although this Court9 has approved grants of rulemaking authority to executive10 branch agencies or judicial branch agencies, it has11 never approved a grant of regulatory power to a private12 corporation.13 JUSTICE GINSBERG: What do you do about ­­14 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the big problem15 here, regulatory authority. As far as I'm concerned,16 that's the big difficulty. Why is this an exercise of17 regulatory authority when all it does is enable an18 investigation?19 MR. DUPREE: Well, Justice Scalia, I don't20 think it's quite correct to say all it does is enable an21 investigation. For one thing, there is the provision in22 Section 207 (c) that requires the freight railroads to23 amend their contracts with Amtrak to the extent24 practicable to incorporate the metrics and standards.25 So there is a direct regulatory command on the freight28￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425railroad.JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but to the extentpracticable, I mean, what does that mean?MR. DUPREE: Well, unless it's a null set,Justice Kagan, it has to mean something.  And I don'tthink the government has ever said that the freightrailroads ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So instead you want a rule that lets the STB investigate even when you have one failure to accommodate?MR. DUPREE: Well, I'm not sure that's the rule we want, Justice Sotomayor, but at least that would have the merit ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you would prefer that?MR. DUPREE: Well, it would at least have the merit of being constitutional. In other words, the problem here is not necessarily the scope of the investigatory power. It's the fact that Congress gave Amtrak the pen or co­authorship of the regulation. That's the constitutional vice here ­­JUSTICE BREYER: Just like the Department of Commerce acting under authority from Congress gave ICANN the power to write standards for the internet.MR. DUPREE: Well, and, Justice Breyer, let29￼1 me address your concern head on. Because we've been2 litigating this case against the government for several3 years now and to my knowledge no party involved ­­ the4 parties, the amici have foreseen the dire consequences5 that you honor posits ­­6 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not saying it's a dire7 consequence. By coincidence, I happen to be reading8 about the internet. I'm trying to learn about9 something.10 MR. DUPREE: Well, Justice Breyer, I can11 make a few points in response. One is that in the ICANN12 case that's not a situation where you have a company13 trying to regulate other competitors in the market.14 That is one difference. Another difference is that a15 lot of these organizations tender their proposed16 standards to the agency for approval. So at the end of17 the day, it's the agency that has the final say in many18 cases. That's this model that Congress enacted.19 And here, Congress plainly could have given20 Amtrak an advisory role, Section 207 (a) gives all sorts21 of entities and participants with a stake in these rules22 an advisory role. And there is absolutely no reason23 that Congress could not easily have drafted that statute24 to give Amtrak an advisory role.25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if the government30￼1 agency, the FRA, it says, you know, what Amtrak2 proposes, the government's assent is essential to this3 scheme, right?4 MR. DUPREE: That's correct, Justice Ginsburg. But5 I think the key point here is that Amtrak's assent is6 also essential. So, to be sure, the government could7 halt a regulation that Amtrak wanted to put in effect, but the8 constitutional advice here is that Amtrak has the same9 power. It could prevent the government from putting the10 government's preferred regulation in place. And that's11 giving too much power to a private entity to be able to12 dictate to the federal government what regulations will13 be issued ­­14 JUSTICE BREYER: You don't have to answer15 this question, but have you thought through what this16 means ­­ what I think is called the Baal conference17 where you have groups of regulators and banks meeting18 together to determine what they are going to do about19 interest rates, money supplied, et cetera. You have20 not, is the answer, and I don't know enough about it, so21 skip it.22 MR. DUPREE: Very good.23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but then, how do24 you ­­ do you say that we were just plain wrong when we25 let the tobacco industry and milk producers veto1 regulations in our two prior cases Currin and Rock2 Royal?3 MR. DUPREE: Yes, the difference in those4 cases, Justice Sotomayor, is that in those cases it was5 a federal government that drafted the regulation. And6 what happened at that point was that Congress gave the7 industry ­­ or in those cases a super majority of the8 industry the power to vote whether to subject themselves9 to the regulation. And the distinction there is between10 the government exercising the legislative authority and11 the private company determining when that12 authority becomes effective. That's ­­13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's ­­ that line is14 too thin for me. Because consent to me means it has to15 satisfy both parties. And that's no different than a16 veto. This is the STB saying, this satisfies us, this17 is what we would like to do. Amtrak is this ­­ are you18 willing to be regulated, just like the tobacco produce19 ­­ the tobacco industry and the milk producers.20 MR. DUPREE: Well, for one thing my clients,21 the regulated parties, were not22 to say Amtrak, is this what you23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:24 That's the due process.given a say in this.  Sowant ­­That's the due process.25 MR. DUPREE:Fair enough.  Then, with regard31￼1 to Your Honor's point ­­2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:3 by the way. That's an issue that's fair enough. But ­­4 and subject to more talk. But I'm not quite sure why5 this becomes ­­6 MR. DUPREE: With regard to Your Honor's7 earlier point about that being a thin line, I understand8 that but at the same time that is the line, the precise9 line that this Court explicitly drew both in Curran and10 in J.W. Hampton where it said that allowing this vote of11 the regulated parties, that doesn't amount to12 legislative action. Agreed it may be a fine line but it13 is the line that this Court has reverted to time and14 again.15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't know what they16 meant because they were subjecting themselves to17 standards.18 MR. DUPREE: Well, and I would simply go19 back to our point that we never had a vote in this20 process.21 JUSTICE ALITO: What do you make of the22 provision to which you referred earlier that says that23 the metrics and standards shall be incorporated into the24 operating agreements to the greatest extent practicable25 or to the extent practicable. If a particular railroadAnd that's fair enough32￼2 incorporation of the3 operating agreement,4 government could do?5 MR. DUPREE:metrics and standards into anis there anything that the federalWell, Justice Alito, I think in 6 that situation what would likely happen if Amtrak and7 the freight railroad could not reach agreement and8 therefore there was no agreement on the terms of the9 operating agreement, is that the Surface Transportation10 Board ultimately would be called upon to step in and11 essentially dictate terms or help the parties reach12 terms and proscribe the terms of the operating13 agreement. And I think in that situation ­­ again, it14 hasn't yet arisen but it would not surprise me in the15 slightest if Amtrak's argument at that point to the16 Surface Transportation Board was pointing to the17 language of 207 (c) and saying, this freight railroad is18 under a statutory mandate that it shall amend its19 agreements to the extent practicable. And nothing in20 the statute suggests that the determination as to21 practicability is something that falls within the22 exclusive jurisdiction of the freight railroads. The23 statutory language doesn't suggest that. If this Court24 were to hold that, I certainly wouldn't quarrel with it,25 but I'm not quite sure the statutory language gets you33￼1 took the position that it will never agree to the1 there.2 I think one fundamental flaw with the3 statute which we've not yet touched on, an additional4 flaw, is the problem of accountability. That, of5 course, is the concern that has animated this Court's6 non delegation and due process jurisprudence. And here7 you have a situation where Congress, the President and8 Amtrak itself have repeatedly declared to the public in9 explicit terms that Amtrak is not the government.10 JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think that's11 dispositive? Because I've always thought that the12 labels that Congress decides to put on these things is13 not of particular relevance.14 MR. DUPREE: I'm not so sure I would go so15 far as to say it's dispositive, Justice Kagan. But I do16 think it's highly relevant. I think when this Court has17 spoken about transparency and accountability in the18 legislative process, what it's been talking about is the19 ability of the public to look at a regulation or a law20 and make a judgment as to where to assign blame. And21 when you have all parties involved assuring the public22 that Amtrak is not a government actor, I think the23 public is entitled to take the24 Congress at their word and say25 JUSTICE GINSBURG:President and thethat this is not the ­­And not look at the34￼10 for­profit corporation.

I mean, I guess21 about Amtrak is not governmental other than the label.22 MR. DUPREE: Well ­­23 JUSTICE KAGAN: Subject to the policy24 control of Congress, which Congress exercises pretty25 much on a routine basis, it's entirely funded bybranch.But then that all goes backI'm just wondering what35￼1 animal as it exists? Lebron said that the government2 exerts control over Amtrak as a policy maker. This ­­3 Amtrak, you will agree, is not like a private4 corporation. It's ­­ there's a great deal of federal5 involvement in Amtrak, right?6 MR. DUPREE: I agree. I agree. But I think7 what resolves this case is the fact that Amtrak operates8 under a statutory mandate to conduct its affairs as9 though it were a non­governmental entity and a361 Congress, all the members of the board are appointed by2 the President with the advice and consent of the Senate,3 save the ­­ save one.4 You know, I guess I'm just wondering other5 than this label, what suggests that this is not the6 government?7 MR. DUPREE: Well, first, I would take issue8 with just the label. In other words, the organic9 statute of Amtrak in the US Code says it is not the10 government. So it may be a little more than just a11 label.12 But taking Your Honor's point, I think what13 makes Amtrak not the government for nondelegation14 purposes is that Amtrak's officers and employees are not15 Federal employees, they don't take an oath of office and16 they are constrained by various financial incentives and17 statutory mandates to operate Amtrak not in the common18 good, not as a neutral, disinterested regulator would,19 but as a for­profit commercial actor.20 That's actually the very point that Amtrak21 made to this Court in its Lebron brief where it said22 keep in mind, we are not neutral government regulators,23 we are hungry capitalists. That's how we run Amtrak.24 We have a ­­25 JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes. We rejected that￼37￼1 argument.2 MR. DUPREE: Well, it rejected the ultimate3 constitutional conclusion for purposes of the First4 Amendment claim, but I don't think this Court took issue5 with the fact that Amtrak's officers and directors have6 said from day one very publicly that we don't govern in7 any sense. We are not neutral, disinterested8 regulators. We are a for­profit business. And that's9 what makes this case different, Justice Kagan.10 JUSTICE SCALIA: So for ­­ I mean, for that11 purpose, what difference does it make whether it's a12 governmental entity or not, so long as it is operating13 on a for­profit basis and is giving ­­ is given the last14 word on some regulatory matters that disadvantage its15 competitors, there's a violation of due process. I ­­ I16 don't see how it makes any difference whether you call17 it governmental or not.18 MR. DUPREE: Justice Scalia, I certainly19 agree a hundred percent with you on the due process20 point. I think that whether it is government or21 nongovernmental may play a role if this Court were to22 approach this case through the lens of nondelegation,23 but as far as due process goes, Your Honor is exactly24 correct. No matter what we call Amtrak, the question25 ultimately at the end of the day is whether this381 Federally­chartered corporation with all of the various2 financial incentives, statutory mandates and commands,3 can exercise regulatory power over other commercial4 actors in the marketplace.5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The due process question6 wasn't ­­ the due process question wasn't aired below at7 all; isn't that so?8 MR. DUPREE: It was aired below, Justice9 Ginsburg. We have fully briefed due process at every10 stage of this case, as has the government. The district11 court resolved it on the merits and the D.C. Circuit12 didn't need to reach it because it resolved it on13 nondelegation grounds, but it did drop a footnote and14 said, nondelegation and due process are so closely15 intertwined in this context and, frankly, we're not16 sure, as Justice Scalia suggested, whether ultimately it17 would make a difference. So that's why I took the18 nondelegation route. But there's no question that due19 process is fully briefed, fully teed up for this Court's20 review.21 JUSTICE GINSBURG:22 D.C. Circuit.23 MR. DUPREE:24 JUSTICE GINSBURG:25 MR. DUPREE:￼      And not decided by theThat's correct.I beg your pardon?      And not decided ­­39￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE GINSBURG: ­­ because the D.C. Circuit went on a delegation.MR. DUPREE: That's correct. But as I said, they said in the footnote, Footnote 3 toward the beginning of the opinion, that they didn't see much of a difference in this context because Carter Coal speaks both to nondelegation and due process and it did an analysis under Carter Coal.      So regardless if this Court thinks thatCarter Coal is more properly characterized asnondelegation of due process, the merits of thatquestion are squarely before this Court.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So are you attacking the statute that says that competitors have to accommodate Amtrak? Is that what you're saying is the due process violation?MR. DUPREE: It's not, Justice Sotomayor. The statute that we're attacking is Section 207 of PRIIA.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the ­­ but the investigation is only going to determine whether you violated the statute's failure to accommodate Amtrak.MR. DUPREE: I don't think that's quite right, Your Honor. In other words, the ­­ a necessary predicate for liability is not just violation of the401 preference statute, but also a violation of the metrics2 and standards. The government needs to prove both. It3 needs to prove violation of the metrics and standards4 and violation of the preference requirement.5 JUSTICE BREYER: Can the government ­­ what6 is the due process violation? That is to say, if the7 Department of Energy under delegated authority says that8 the makers of the bulbs that are energy efficient must9 use, and they may choose any one of the five methods10 that produces green light or white light or whatever it11 is, and they are ­­ they are to choose the method, and12 that's just it. Now, that puts at a disadvantage those13 competitors who do not use energy­efficient bulbs. Is14 that a violation of due process?15 MR. DUPREE: Well, if I'm understanding Your16 Honor's hypothetical, it doesn't sound like it because17 you have a situation where it's the government that's18 prescribing the regulations.19 JUSTICE BREYER: No. It gives them20 considerable leeway as to make subsidiary decisions. I21 was trying to make it realistic. They make subsidiary22 decisions as to how they go about fulfilling the basic23 energy efficiency mandate.24 MR. DUPREE: Right. It ­­ it ­­ the way25 Your Honor described that ­­￼now.Right.    They have broad authority,      JUSTICE BREYER:but they have to meet certain energy­efficient mandatesand they can prescribe standards and so forth that willallow them to do it.  Does that violate due processbecause it hurts the manufacturers of ordinary energybulbs?MR. DUPREE: If ­­ when you say "prescribe standards," it would pose a problem if the standards they're prescribing apply to others in the industry. If the way Your Honor posited it originally, it sounded as though Congress was essentially giving ­­JUSTICE BREYER: It applies. They don't have to meet it.

DUPREE: Well ­­ and if that's the situation where the government is both acting in the marketplace as a commercial actor and as a regulator of the industry, that's a problem.      But what makes this case, I think, sodifficult is that being a commercial for­profit actor isfundamentally incompatible with the notion of being adisinterested government regulator.  That's because theessence of a ­­JUSTICE BREYER: That's what I was ­­ I'm trying to get at ­­ I started with the statement, I think, that due process ­­ your argument ­­ it didn't matter whether you called them private or public; am I right?And thatit keeps thedoesn't have to go42￼19 JUSTICE BREYER:20 deal with that normally is the statute would be21 interpreted not to give them the authority to write22 anticompetitive regulations and you'd attack it under23 the antitrust laws.

Is that a violation of due9 process? If so, why? If not, how is yours different?10 MR. DUPREE: Well, that ­­ I think that11 might be a violation of due process because in that12 situation what happens is that the Department of Energy13 is giving authority to private corporations to set14 rules, standards that govern the conduct of other15 private corporations.16 JUSTICE BREYER:17 private organizations.18 MR. DUPREE: Right.44￼1 process.2 Now ­­ now, maybe there's some cases I've3 overlooked. The only one coming close, it seemed to me,4 is Carter v. Carter Coal, which I always put in the same5 box as Lochner. Now ­­ now, are we supposed to6 resurrect that? Is there other authority for that7 proposition? What is it?8 MR. DUPREE: Well, Justice Breyer, I do9 believe that this Court on multiple occasions subsequent10 to the Lochner era has reaffirmed the core holding of11 Carter Coal about delegations to private parties are12 forbidden. This Court said that in Mistretta. A number13 of justices have said in separate opinions that that14 holding remains ­­15 JUSTICE BREYER: But your due process, I16 want some authority for your due process point on the17 private agencies.18 MR. DUPREE: Well, our ­­ the foundational19 case we have for due process in this context is Carter20 Coal. Absolutely. But again, I simply take issue with21 Your Honor's suggestion that it's a remnant of the22 Lochner era. I think it retains its vitality today as23 many subsequent opinions of this Court have recognized.24 Let me address Mr. Gannon's point very25 briefly, if I may, on the notion that it was somehow the45￼1 preference requirement that was driving the dramatic2 change in Amtrak's performance. The preference3 requirement was enacted in the early 1970s. So Mr.4 Gannon is unable to explain why this magical change5 didn't occur until the metrics and standards came into6 effect.7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he said the metrics8 and standards for the first time made it realistic that9 there would be enforcement of that requirement.10 MR. DUPREE: Well, first, I would say if11 that's true, that, to me, strikes me as a pretty plain12 regulatory effect in that the metrics and standards are13 on the books and the freight railroads know that they14 now need to comply or they're going to face enforcement15 actions. The government ­­16 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. I think ­­ I think you17 can allow a private party to bring an enforcement18 action.19 MR. DUPREE: You can allow a private20 party ­­21 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, even if they just22 said an enforcement action shall be commenced if Amtrak23 requests it. I think that would be perfectly24 constitutional.25 MR. DUPREE: I agree, Justice Scalia, but at46￼1 the same time the problem here is that Congress has2 given Amtrak the power to define the terms and to draft3 the regulations in which it may bring an enforcement4 action. If ­­5 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Dupree, I mean, one way6 to look at this on the delegation question, not on the7 due process question but on the delegation question, is8 that there is government all over this at every step,9 that there is all kinds of supervision of Amtrak itself,10 no matter what Amtrak does that; but with respect to the11 metrics and standards, particularly, that there is no12 way Amtrak is actually going to be able to get anything13 unless the FRA comes aboard, and that furthermore, that14 even those metrics and standards are useless unless the15 Surface Transportation Board decides to enforce the16 preference requirement.17 So there is, like, no place at which a18 private actor can do something itself in this scheme, it19 would seem to me.20 MR. DUPREE: Well, I ­­ I take the point21 that the FRA is involved in the development of the22 standards, but I don't think it follows from ­­ from23 that premise to say that Congress can give a private24 company and the Federal government joint ownership of25 the pen in drafting the regulations. That's the47￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425problem.      And with regard to the issue of governmentcontrol over Amtrak, the government conceded in the D.C.Circuit that it did not control Amtrak on a day­to­daybasis and that includes, for present purposes, therulemaking at issue.  In fact, Congress certainly didnot view the Federal government as controlling Amtrak inthe rulemaking, because if it did, it would not haveinserted the arbitration provision.      Congress clearly understood that in thecontext of this rulemaking, the Federal government didnot control Amtrak.  That is why the arbitrationprovision is in there.      Unless there are further questions, we’llask that the judgment below be affirmed.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.      Mr. Gannon, you have four minutes remaining.    REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNONON BEHALF OF PETITIONERSMR. GANNON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Dupree stressed the question ofaccountability, and I think as Justice Kagan was justpointing out that there is plenty of accountability herefor the Federal government.

There are certain22 aspects of the metrics and standards that it would not23 make sense to incorporate in the contracts, and what the24 statute ­­25 JUSTICE SCALIA: But if they can't come toWould you talk about theYes, we think that  ­­    You should have raised that48￼1 metrics and standards because the FRA had to approve2 them.3 On the Amtrak side here, the metrics and4 standards were approved by Amtrak's president who is5 somebody who is appointed by the eight presidential6 appointees and serves at their pleasure. And so the7 notion that this is just somebody down in the bowels8 of ­­ of a corporation's day­to­day operations that the9 Federal government had no connection with, I think, is49￼1 an agreement, who decides what the contract ­­2 MR. GANNON: As Mr. Dupree said, that the ­­3 then the dispute goes before the surface transportation4 board, this is in 24308 ­­5 JUSTICE SCALIA: And the STB ­­6 MR. GANNON: Will determine what are, quote,7 "reasonable terms and conditions."8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which would include ­­9 which would include the requirement that, to the extent10 practicable, the standards set forth by Amtrak be11 followed.12 MR. GANNON: But we ­­ we don't think that13 that requires they be ­­ they are not things that would14 be binding on the freight railroads. The statute15 provides that there needs to be an incentive payment.16 For instance, the statute provides that there needs to17 be an incentive payment in the contracts. But it18 doesn't mean that that ­­ that the incentive payment now19 has to correspond precisely to what the metrics and20 standards are. That is something that's subject to21 negotiation between the parties, and ­­22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, as ­­ as your friend23 said, to the extent practicable, unless the whole thing24 is nugatory, certainly does not wash out the whole25 provision.1 MR. GANNON:2 JUSTICE SCALIA:3 What bite does it have?4 MR. GANNON:5 parties to ensure that they are now collecting data in6 systematic ways, that they can nationalize things,7 that ­­ that they now measure things in the same8 fashion, they use minutes instead of seconds or9 whatever, and also that there are some parts of the10 metrics and standards that wouldn't make sense to go in11 the contracts at all, things that have to do with12 customer service surveys about ­­ satisfaction surveys13 about the cleanliness of the cars. And so ­­ and14 ultimately even the canon of constitutional avoidance15 could be used to prevent that from doing the work that16 would ­­ that would make it regulatory in this context17 if that were to make it a problem here.18 I think that it's also the case that19 Mr. Dupree is talking about Amtrak as a competitor of20 the freight railroads, and we think that that's the21 wrong analogy, that Amtrak is effectively like a22 customer of a common carrier that is entitled to get23 services from the railroads at a particular rate. And24 that's the way it's always been. And under Respondent's25 approach, there would be both nondelegation problems andWell, I think that ­­    It must have some bite.I think it was to encourage the50￼511 due process problems, apparently, with the type of thing2 that occurred in Boston against Maine, where this Court3 held that Amtrak was able to initiate a condemnation4 proceeding for rail property before the ICC, and its5 determination that it needed that particular property6 had a strong presumption that it was going to be true7 and governing in that proceeding. This Court held that8 that was not an impermissible delegation of eminent9 domain authority, because the ICC made the ultimate10 determination there, notwithstanding the fact that11 Amtrak had to trigger the proceeding and Amtrak's12 decision to do so created a statutory presumption that13 there would be need.14 I think that Mr. Dupree also is concerned15 about the need for Amtrak's consent here. This goes16 back to the very first argument that we have in our17 brief that under cases like Currin and Rock Royal18 Cooperative, the fact that the government needed to19 secure the consent of Amtrak is not something that makes20 that a delegation outside the government. Even though21 they had the pen along the way, the veto power is what22 is most important, and we think it's especially easy to23 get there in the context of an entity like Amtrak which24 is, at worst, for us quasi­private rather than entirely25 private.￼52￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      And we think if you take that into accounthere, also the limited effect that the metrics andstandards have, that this is not a non­delegationproblem for any of the three problems the court ofappeals believed.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
