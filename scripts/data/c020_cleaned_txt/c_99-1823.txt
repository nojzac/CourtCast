Waffle House, Inc.          Mr. Clement.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          Respondent Waffle House and Eric Baker agreed toarbitrate rather than litigate disputes between them.That agreement precludes Waffle House and Baker fromhaving an action take place between them in court.  Butthe EEOC was not a party to that agreement.  Accordingly,the agreement does not preclude the EEOC's ability tobring a public enforcement action against Waffle House,nor does it limit the remedies available to the EEOC insuch an action.          Title VII gives the EEOC a public enforcementaction that's independent of and, in many respects,superior to the individual employee's cause of action.          QUESTION:  Mr. Clement, suppose the individualemployee had settled with the employer, not just anagreement to arbitrate, but there had been a complete3                                                                                             1    settlement.  They said, you know, in exchange for so much2    money, I waive any cause of action I had.  Would the3    Government still has -- have a cause of action for4 damages?5 6 7 8 9          MR. CLEMENT:  We believe the Government wouldstill have a cause of action in that case, though we admitit would be a much more difficult case.          QUESTION:  Wow.          MR. CLEMENT:  Because in the case of settlement,of course, judicial or arbitral resources have alreadybeen expended.  There's an agreement of the parties thatspecifically extinguishes the individual's right --          QUESTION:  What are the damages?  The Governmentgets damages that have already been paid to the individualto -- I don't understand.  And these damages go to the10111213141516    individual?171819202122232425          MR. CLEMENT:  The -- the damages could go to theindividual.  I think, to give you an example of the kindof case --          QUESTION:  So, if he'd settle and get thedamages, and then -- and then he'd get additional damagesrecovered for him by the EEOC.          MR. CLEMENT:  That's right.  But let me give youan example of the kind of case we have in mind, and it mayhelp illustrate why the Government thinks it still may4                                                                                             1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425have a cause of action in that situation.          If you can imagine a case where an employer hasretaliated against an employee and -- simply for filing acharge with the EEOC, and then that employee settles thatretaliation claim for a nominal amount of money, withoutany judicial supervision, let's say, it may be that inthat kind of case, the EEOC has a legitimate publicinterest in, nonetheless, bringing an action, getting someadditional amount of damages to really take theemployer --          QUESTION:  Well, but that's -- that's a separatewrong.  I don't know if that's a really fair answer toJustice Scalia's question.  If there's retaliation, I -- Iwould think that's a separate component.          But just suppose a case with no retaliation.The -- the employee recovers $10,000 and then the EEOC canrecover $20,000 more?          MR. CLEMENT:  Well, in a case like that, I'msure as a matter of its prosecutorial discretion, the EEOCwould not bring that case.          QUESTION:  Well, let's say the prosecutordoesn't exercise his discretion that way that day.          MR. CLEMENT:  Well, in that case I think theywould have cause of action.          But again, I want to make clear that we think                             5                                                                                             1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9that's --QUESTION:  And what -- and what happens --MR. CLEMENT:  -- a much more difficult case.QUESTION:  What would happen -- what wouldhappen if the employee recovered $10,000 in thearbitration, then only $5,000 in the litigation?  Does hehave to give $5,000 back?          MR. CLEMENT:  I don't think that would follow.          QUESTION:  Well, but -- but we're asking whatthe -- what the logical consequences of -- of yourposition are, and that's why we're putting the moredifficult case so we can test the general proposition.And the general proposition, it seems to me, has towithstand some analysis under these more difficult          But again, I want to make clear that's a muchmore difficult case because there there's been --1011121314151617    instances.18              MR. CLEMENT:  Well, let me do -- let me make two19    responses.  One, let me try one more time to defend the20    general principle, which is simply that Congress in Title21    VII gave the EEOC a distinct cause of action, and so the22    extinguishment of the individual employee's cause of23    action shouldn't automatically extinguish the EEOC's cause24 of action.25              But let me hone in on why I think that's so much6                                                                                                                                  1    more of a difficult case because in that case, the 2    individuals settled their claim, so they have no claim to 3    damages in an arbitration proceeding.  And so, it might 4    make some sense to say that the EEOC has no claim to 5    damages in a litigation proceeding. 6              What is so anomalous about the decision below 7    and the rule that respondent seeks in this case is that it 8    seeks to limit the EEOC's ability to get victim-specific 9    remedies in court even though those victim-specific10    remedies are available to the employee in the arbitration.11    All of the cases that respondent cites --12              QUESTION:  Well, here we have a case where the13    employee did not settle, but we were really discussing14    with you the possibility not presented in this case of a15    full settlement or a judgment in arbitration, disposing of16    the victim-specific relief, and asking you why then should17    EEOC continue to have a cause of action for the victim-18    specific relief, as opposed to broad injunctive relief, to19    address the overall problem.20              MR. CLEMENT:  And I guess I do think there are21    two reasons why they would still have a cause of action in22    that situation.  One is that Title VII does give the EEOC23    an independent cause of action.  It's quite a remarkable24    statute in that respect.  It's unlike statutes this Court25    has analyzed in, say, the Newport News Shipbuilder case7                                                                                                                                  1    where it specifically contrasted Title VII as being the 2    rare statute that gives the EEOC a duplicative cause of 3    action to the individual. 4              The second reason, though, is that generally, as 5    a matter of privity, res judicata principles, the reason 6    that you hold one party in --in -- to a judgment that they 7    didn't participate in to the consequences of that is 8    because the party in the first action adequately 9    represented the interests of the party that wasn't10    present.  I --11              QUESTION:  Well, why did the EEOC decide to get12    into this case?  Is there some sort of a pattern or13    practice involved that goes beyond this individual14    establishment?15              MR. CLEMENT:  My understanding is that the EEOC16    picked this case because this case -- the events here took17    place in 1994.  So, the ADA was still quite new at the18    time that this -- that this case took place, and I think19    the EEOC was concerned that employers were not sure of20    what their obligations under the ADA were.  So, they21    picked this case to litigate to help establish what22    employers' obligations were under the EEOC --23              QUESTION:  This is -- this is not any broad24    pattern or practice.  This is simply honing in on an25    individual case?8                                                                                                                                  1              MR. CLEMENT:  That's fair enough.  But again, 2    Congress has specifically allowed the EEOC to use its 3    modest litigation resources to vindicate the public 4    interest both in pattern and practice cases or cases that 5    seek injunctive relief and victim-specific cases where 6    there's some aspect of the case that helps illustrate an 7    important principle of law. 8              QUESTION:  Mr. -- 9              QUESTION:  Mr. Clement, may I ask you to back up10    on how we would get to the point of having a settlement11    after -- or an arbitral determination?  I thought when the12    EEOC sues, then the individual has no right to come to13    court, that EEOC would be the exclusive litigator.  And14    so, I think it's clear that the -- the individual employee15    couldn't bring a suit, a rival suit, in -- in court.16              Doesn't that extend to arbitration as well?  I17    thought that the -- giving the primacy to the EEOC meant18    it would control this entire claim in all of its aspects,19    but you answered the question as though, even though the20    EEOC had filed, the employee could go on on a separate21 track.22              MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I had taken the import of23    the hypothetical as being that the individual had already24    sued and settled and then, only after that had taken25    place, that the EEOC decided to initiate a duplicative9                                                                                                                                 1 action.2              But your question certainly highlights the3    anomaly of having this predispute arbitration agreement --4              QUESTION:  Can the individual bring a suit?  I5    mean, is the -- within the 180 days, doesn't EEOC have6    total control?7              MR. CLEMENT:  That's absolutely right.  The8    statute gives the EEOC the exclusive right to initiate a9    cause of action for the first 180 days and then, for an10    extended period, until a right to sue letter issues.11              And that's why in light of the -- the12    congressional determination that -- that EEOC had not only13    a different action, but one that took primacy, that they14    had the right to initiate the action once they found that15    there was a determination that the suit would serve the16    public interest, it seems particularly --17              QUESTION:  Once they -- once they do initiate18    the action, though, the individual cannot also bring an19    action.  Right?  So, what you're saying is that the --20    that the EEOC suit is independent of the individuals, but21    somehow the individual suit is not independent of the22    EEOC's.23242510                                                                                                                                           MR. CLEMENT:  Well, allow -- allow me to maketwo responses.  One is it's clear that under the ADA andTitle VII, it's not that the EEOC's filing of a suit 1    simply extinguishes the individual's cause of action 2    entirely.  They -- the individual has a absolute right to 3    intervene in the EEOC's action.  So, if those actions were 4    100 percent duplicative, there would be no need to allow 5    the individual to intervene in the suit. 6              QUESTION:  Exactly.  I -- I don't know why you 7    think that cuts in your favor rather than against you.  It 8    seems to me the whole structure of the thing indicates 9    that there's one cause of action.  It can be brought by10    the EEC or by the individual, but not by both.11              MR. CLEMENT:  I mean --12              QUESTION:  Not by both successfully, anyway.13              MR. CLEMENT:  I respectfully disagree because,14    unlike the ADA, the ADA does not make the EEOC suit the15    exclusive vehicle and extinguish any cause of action or16    any basis to get into court for the individual.  They can17    still intervene in the EEOC's action.18              QUESTION:  So, you're saying that if the EEOC19    brings an action in circumstances such as this, an20    individual who has agreed to arbitrate the claim can21    intervene and not be bound?  The individual is not bound22    by the arbitration agreement?23              MR. CLEMENT:  No, we do not take that position.24    To the contrary, we think that the arbitration agreement25    does preclude in this case Mr. Baker from intervening in11                                                                                                                                 1    the EEOC's action.  And I think that's quite a persuasive2    answer to the argument that the other side has made that3    somehow allowing the EEOC to sue in these circumstances4    renders the arbitration agreement a dead letter.  It5 doesn't. 67 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  It's a very strange use of theArticle III courts to have litigation proceeding in whichone of the real parties in interest is not permitted tointervene.  That --          MR. CLEMENT:  Well --          QUESTION:  -- that strikes me as a -- adistortion of the whole case in controversy rule.          MR. CLEMENT:  It may be, but I think that is theconsequence of the arbitration agreement and theimplication of the FAA.          QUESTION:  Well, if it is a distortion of thecase in controversy rule, then we're in real trouble,aren't we?          MR. CLEMENT:  Well, even if you disagree with meon -- on that particular point and you say that the FAAdoes not prevent Baker from intervening on this action,it's still true that the arbitration agreement is -- has ameaningful benefit to Waffle House because before WaffleHouse entered that arbitration agreement with Baker, itwas subject to a suit in court by either the EEOC or12                                                                                              1    Baker.  The agreement with Baker limited Baker to an 2    arbitral forum.  But absent a similar agreement with the 3    EEOC, Waffle House has simply no expectation and no basis 4    to keep the EEOC out of court or to limit its remedies in5 court. 6              QUESTION:  Do you think it is -- do you think it 7    is going to be very comfort to Waffle House to know that, 8    yes, it can't be sued in court by the individual, but the 9    entire prosecutorial power of the United States can be10    brought to bear on it in -- in a suit in court?  What11    Waffle House wants to do is to stay out of court, and12    that's what they're getting at when they talk about13    undercutting the -- the -- in effect, the arbitration14    agreement.1516171819202122232425          MR. CLEMENT:  Well, with respect, if WaffleHouse wants to stay out of court, then it needs to reachan agreement with every party that has a statutory rightto get them into court.  And as a practical matter, Istill think --          QUESTION:  Unless one statutory right isderivative of the other.  I mean, that's the -- that's thewhole issue in the case.good --MR. CLEMENT:  Yes, and we think there areQUESTION:  And you -- you keep saying the                  13                                  1    Government has an independent right to sue, but you know, 2    that begs the question.  That -- that's the whole issue. 3    It is given a right to sue, but is -- is that right to sue 4    derivative of the individual's right so that it disappears 5    when the individual's does? 6              MR. CLEMENT:  And I do not think it is.  And 7    it's -- and I think in fact the text of Title VII is quite 8    clear. 9              QUESTION:  Then I think your answer has got to10    be that the settlement clearly does not bind the11    Government.12              MR. CLEMENT:  That's exactly right, and that's13    -- that's a well-established principle.  I mean, look at14    -- look at Firefighters Local No. 93 against -- against15    the City of Cleveland.  The Court says it's a fundamental16    principle that a settlement cannot bind non-parties to the17    litigation.18              QUESTION:  How does this compare with the Fair19    Labor Standards Act where the Secretary of Labor could sue20    or the individual could sue, say, for a wage and hour21    violation?  Or let's take a violation of the Equal Pay22    Act.  How -- how does that work when the Secretary brings23 a suit?24              MR. CLEMENT:  I think in all of those cases, the25    statutory scheme works effectively the same.  There are14                                                                                                                                  1    independent causes of action given to the Government 2    entity and to the individual.  And this Court held in the 3    Tony and Susan Alamo Foundation case that just because the 4    individual forswears a cause of action or right to sue 5    under the Fair Labor Standards Act, that does not preclude 6    the Secretary of Labor from bringing their own independent 7    action. 8              QUESTION:  Of course, the -- the cause of action 9    for -- that EEOC has could be vindicated by an equitable10 remedy.11              MR. CLEMENT:  I -- I don't think that's12    necessarily true.  It's certainly not going to be true in13    every case.  And Congress specifically made all forms of14    relief available to the EEOC in its public enforcement15    action.  The court below drew a distinction between16    equitable relief on the one hand and victim-specific17    relief on the other hand to avoid a perceived conflict18    with the FAA.  But with respect, I don't think there is19    any conflict.20              QUESTION:  But in this case then you say EEOC21    can go into court and that Baker can probably not -- not22    intervene, but the EEOC could get whatever he could have23    gotten and give it to him.24              MR. CLEMENT:  That is true, but I don't think25    that is particularly anomalous or limited to this area of15                                                                                                                                 1 law. 23 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          Take, for example -- I mean, this Court has heldthat an individual can agree to arbitrate his or her civilRICO claim.  I wouldn't think, though, that that agreementto arbitrate the civil RICO claim would in any way preventthe Government from bringing a criminal RICO action orprevent the Government from getting a restitution orderthat agreed to give restitution directly to the victim.          QUESTION:  Who had already recovered?          MR. CLEMENT:  No.  Let's -- let's take this --let's make it parallel to this case where theindividual --          QUESTION:  No.  I'm assuming a RICO victim who'salready been -- been compensated, and you think theGovernment can bring a RICO action in which it gets notjust criminal sanctions but also requires the -- the RICOdefendant to pay again what's already been paid.          MR. CLEMENT:  Well, actually they could get theorder, and then there are specific provisions in theFederal restitution statute that allow a set-off foramounts that have already been paid or that will be paid.          QUESTION:  Oh, well, that's quite different.          MR. CLEMENT:  But I don't think it --          QUESTION:  Okay.  Then let's go back -- thenlet's simply go back to the damages case.  You said a                            16                                                                                             1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425second ago in -- in response or you -- you agreed with thesuggestion of mine that in fact the Government canperfectly well sue independently.          My question then is, why do you concede that thesettlement case in which the individual settles for -- formoney in lieu of damages is a harder case?  Why don't yousay no?  It's just as easy as this is.  And -- and inneither case is the agreement between the individual andthe defendant binding or affecting in any way what theGovernment can do.          MR. CLEMENT:  Again, we don't think theagreement is binding, but let me give you three reasons --          QUESTION:  But why -- but --          MR. CLEMENT:  Let me give you three reasons whyI think it's a harder case.          QUESTION:  -- you did say earlier that youthought the settlement case more difficult.  So, I guess Iwant you to explain why you think it is.          MR. CLEMENT:  Okay.  Let me give you threereasons why I think the settlement case is more difficult.          First, there's already been some expenditure ofresources in that case, either -- likely, either judicialor arbitral.          Second, Title VII seems to place particularimportance on the EEOC's ability to be able to initiate17                                                                                              1    the action and consider the early stages of litigation. 2    If, for whatever reason, we've gotten to the point where 3    somebody has filed a claim and it's settled, that role has 4    already been filled. 5              The third reason is another particularly 6    important function of the EEOC under Title VII is to act 7    as a safety valve, so if for some reason the individual is 8    not willing or able to sue, maybe out of a fear of 9    retaliation or something, in a particular case that10    vindicates the public interest, the EEOC has the ability11    to step in and fill that gap.  If there's already been a12    settlement --13              QUESTION:  Well, but in each of the -- in each14    of the cases that you posit, even the third one, the --15    the essence of the objection to your position is that an16    agreement has been made between the individual and the17    defendant.  And in the case of the arbitration agreement,18    an agreement has been made between the individual and the19    defendant.  And I don't see why the one class -- the one20    kind of agreement should be treated any differently from21    the other kind of agreement in determining whether the22    Government really is in an autonomous position.23              MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I actually think there is a24    reason to treat that one agreement different, which is the25    agreement to settle a case extinguishes any claim to18                                                                                                                                  1    relief.  An arbitration agreement does not.  It's simply a 2    forum selection provision.  And the anomaly of the Fourth 3    Circuit's ruling is they take an agreement that limits 4    Baker's access to a judicial forum, but does not limit his 5    remedies and somehow transmogrify it into a rule that 6    limits the EEOC's available remedies but not their access 7    to a judicial forum. 8              QUESTION:  Then your objection is the 9    transmogrification, not to the -- not to the recognition10    of the agreement as such.11              MR. CLEMENT:  Again, we have no -- absolutely no12    objection to having the agreement bind the parties to the13    agreement.14              QUESTION:  But you do say that the employee15    could not proceed even in the arbitral forum once the EEOC16    starts.  It's clear in the statute that that's true as to17    a court action, but you I thought agreed with me that the18    employee, once the EEOC starts, can't go into the arbitral19    forum either.20              MR. CLEMENT:  Actually the EEOC is of the21    opinion that the -- that the individual could bring an22    arbitration action at that point.  That is a consequence,23    though, of the view that they cannot intervene in the24    EEOC's enforcement action.  I think -- I think they --25              QUESTION:  So, then the EEOC --19                                                                                                                                  1              MR. CLEMENT:  -- they have to have one action or2 the other. 3              QUESTION:  -- says we can have this -- we can 4    have this -- you've just told us that the substantive law 5    is the same.  And I think you're quite right about that, 6    and -- and it's just a question of which forum.  But now 7    you're saying it can be both forums simultaneously.  The 8    individual can go forward in the arbitration; the EEOC can 9    go forward in the court with all the problems that10    duplicative litigation can have of potentially conflicting11 results.1213141516171819202122232425          MR. CLEMENT:  That's equally, of course -- Imean, I -- I agree that there is that problem.  That isequally a problem with the Fourth Circuit's rule, ofcourse, because they said that the EEOC could be in courtseeking general injunctive relief while the individual isarbitrating his claim for victim-specific relief.          QUESTION:  Well --          MR. CLEMENT:  But -- but I think --          QUESTION:  -- that doesn't strike me as soterrible.  I mean, that -- that's entirely understandable.You have two different types of relief being sought in twodifferent forums.          MR. CLEMENT:  And -- and --          QUESTION:  What Justice Ginsburg points out is20                                                                                              1    -- is the anomaly of -- of the same relief being sought in 2    two different forums. 3              MR. CLEMENT:  Well, and -- and I think that -- I 4    mean, that may be a product of -- that happens when you 5    have an arbitration agreement that limits some parties but 6    not others.  That seems to be the case in -- in Moses7 Cone. 8              QUESTION:  Only if we adopt your view of the 9    thing, that the two -- that the two are independent.  If10    -- if the two are dependent, as the statute makes very11    clear they are when -- when the Government brings --12    brings the suit first, barring -- barring the individual13    from bringing a separate suit, if the two are -- are14    dependent, then you don't face any of these problems.15              MR. CLEMENT:  Well, fair enough.  But in this16    case, the Government did bring suit first.  Baker has17    never arbitrated.  So, that position would lead you to the18    conclusion that the Fourth Circuit was wrong, that the19    EEOC can pursue this case, seek victim-specific relief and20    general injunctive relief, and that it's up to you to21    determine whether or not Baker gets to intervene in that22    action.  But that is -- that is certainly a result that23    the Government is quite happy with.24              It seems to me what's really sort of25    indefensible about the Fourth Circuit's reasoning is they21                                                                                                                                  1    take this forum selection provision and turn it into a 2    restriction on remedies.  The -- the ADA and Title VII 3    have concurrent jurisdiction. 4              Suppose that an employer and an employee agreed 5    to litigate their case in State court, not Federal court. 6    It wouldn't seem to me that that forum selection clause 7    would bar the EEOC and bind the EEOC and limit them from 8    bringing their public enforcement action in Federal court. 9    It certainly wouldn't seem to me that that agreement to10    litigate in State court would somehow prevent the EEOC11    from getting victim-specific damages in Federal court if12    in fact there was no State court action.  But -- but in13    principle, there's no difference between the arbitration14    agreement and that forum selection clause agreement that15    picks the State court.16              QUESTION:  Except there's a Federal Arbitration17    Act, and we've said it's designed to encourage arbitration18    of disputes.19              MR. CLEMENT:  Well, in fairness, I don't think20    that the FAA embodies a self-executing preference for21    arbitration.  The --22              QUESTION:  No, but -- a -- a favoring where the23    -- where an arbitration agreement has been entered into,24    as it was here.25              MR. CLEMENT:  Well, that's true.  But I think22                                                                                                                                  1    the purpose of the FAA, as I understand it, was to put 2    arbitration contracts on an equal footing with other 3    contracts, not to give them some special private place. 4    And we think that that forum selection clause that picked 5    the State forum would be enforceable between the parties, 6    but we just don't think it makes any sense to say that 7    that agreement between the parties somehow leaps out and 8    bars the EEOC from bringing a Federal enforcement action, 9    or even more puzzlingly I think, restricting the remedies10    available to the EEOC in that public enforcement action.11              It seems to me that at -- at bottom Title VII12    gives the EEOC a right to bring a public enforcement13 action.14              QUESTION:  The trouble is it's not a public15    enforcement action to the extent that it is seeking16    damages for this individual.  To that extent, it -- it's17    an action that seeks to compensate this individual for the18    damage he has suffered.  Now, that -- that has some public19    benefit I -- I assume, just as his own suit, should he20    recover, would have such -- some public benefit.  But to21    call it a public enforcement action seems to me quite22    unrealistic.23 24 25          MR. CLEMENT:  With fairness, I think that's aposition that Congress rejected in Title VII itself.  IfCongress wanted to say that the only time that the EEOC23                                                                                              1    vindicates the public interest is when it seeks general 2    injunctive relief, it would have been quite easy for 3    Congress to limit the EEOC to general injunctive relief or 4    limit it to bringing pattern and practice cases.  Instead, 5    it gave it the right -- 6              QUESTION:  Why?  That would have been very 7    foolish.  Why -- why require two separate suits:  one -- 8    one by the private individual, the other by the -- by the 9    agency?  If the agency is going to be in there, it may as10    well go for the whole ball.11              MR. CLEMENT:  Well --12              QUESTION:  But -- but to say that the portion of13    it that compensates the individual is essentially, you14    know, a vindication of the public doesn't seem to me --15    doesn't seem to me reasonable.  And -- and that is16    demonstrated by the fact that if the agency brings the17    suit, the individual can't because he's going to be18    getting his individual relief.19              MR. CLEMENT:  Again, with all respect, I20    disagree.  I think restitution statutes reflect and21    vindicate the public interest, even though the restitution22    goes to the victim, and not the Government.  It's the fact23 that the --24              QUESTION:  If the model -- if the model is the25    Fair Labor Standards Act, which antedated these24                                                                                                                                  1    discrimination acts by many years, where the Secretary can 2    sue for the money to go into the pocket of the employee, I 3    thought that those were characterized as public interest4 actions. 5              MR. CLEMENT:  That's absolutely right.  I mean, 6    every time a wrongdoer pays money, the payment of that 7    money serves a public interest that's independent of the 8    destination of the payment, whether it goes to the 9    individual who was wronged or some sort of public10    enforcement action.11              And again, I suggest the example of a12    retaliation action.  In a retaliation action, when an13    employer has retaliated against an employee for filing a14    charge with the EEOC, the EEOC clearly vindicates the15    public interest when it files suit to take the employer to16    task for the retaliation.  And that's true even if the17    retaliation and the most effective remedies are victim-18    specific.  In a case like that, you really need the19    victim-specific remedies because, after all, it is clear20    as day from Title VII itself that an employer can't21    retaliate against an employee for filing a charge.  So, to22    simply get an injunction that says that is of somewhat23    limited utility.  On the other hand, to get back pay,24    compensatory and capped punitive damages I think does25    vindicate the public interest.                                  25                                                                                                                                 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  Well, what are your best authoritiesfor the proposition that when litigation has beenconcluded, another party can recommence the litigationalleging its own injury?          MR. CLEMENT:  I guess I would point --          QUESTION:  -- some other areas.  You cited theFirefighters case?          MR. CLEMENT:  Yes.  I would -- I would directyou to Local No. 93 v. City of Cleveland.  There's astatement in that case that I think was just meant toreflect a general principle that parties to a litigationcan't, through a settlement, bind a non-party to the10111213    litigation.141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Well, but that was because the otherparties had their own injury of a pecuniary nature, as Irecall the case.  I -- I don't see the case cited.          QUESTION:  As a practical matter, how often doesthe EEOC seek victim-specific relief in the form ofmonetary damages after there's been a settlement betweenthe victim and the other side?          MR. CLEMENT:  I'm actually aware of no casewhere that's happened.          QUESTION:  This is all a hypothetical.          MR. CLEMENT:  This is all hypothetical.  Andwhat we're concerned about is a case like this one where26                                                                                             1    there is an arbitration agreement, but the individual has2    never even sought to arbitrate.  I think that's a much3    easier case.45    rebuttal.6789I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time forQUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Clement.Mr. Gordon, we'll hear from you.   ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID L. GORDON      ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT10111213141516171819202122232425          MR. GORDON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          The answer to the question presented today isfound in the broad terms and policies of the FederalArbitration Act.  The question, of course, is what effectdoes Mr. Baker's arbitration agreement have on the EEOC'slitigation remedies.          The Fourth Circuit correctly held that the EEOCcould bring in court a claim for broad-based injunctiverelief and declaratory relief.  However, because Mr. Bakerhad agreed to arbitrate his claims, he could not seekrelief in court specifically for Mr. Baker.          Now, I -- I listened carefully to Mr. Clement'sargument about the issue of settlement of a claim, and Imust respectfully disagree with the authority and line ofcases that he's citing.  As a matter of fact, the27                                                                                              1    position, as I understand it from Mr. Clement, is that an 2    individual can settle a claim and then the EEOC can later 3    sue on behalf of that individual and recover relief for 4    that individual.  And that particular principle, if that 5    is what the EEOC is espousing today, contradicts their own 6    policy guidance -- 7              QUESTION:  Mr. Gordon, if I understood him 8    correctly, he did take that position, but he said you 9    don't have to take that position to prevail in this case.10    Is that right?11              MR. GORDON:  Well, perhaps I perceived it12    differently, Your Honor.13              But I -- I do think that from our position it's14    very important for the Court to understand that the cases15    are almost uniform for the proposition that if an16    individual settles a case --17              QUESTION:  Mr. Gordon, but that's so highly18    hypothetical because the likelihood that the employee19    would have proceeded -- if the EEOC in the beginning is20    the only one who can bring an action in court, EEOC brings21    an action.  Now, even if it's limited only to injunctive22    relief, isn't it clear that the basic finding of fact, was23    there discrimination, has to be made for any kind of24    relief.  And are you going to permit a viable set of25    proceedings to determine that question?28                                                                                                                                 1234 act?5              MR. GORDON:  Your Honor, we do not believe it6    should be given primacy when an individual has signed an7    arbitration agreement in which he says I agree that all8    claims arising out of my employment shall be resolved in9    arbitration.  We don't see any reason why that case needs          Once the EEOC brings in -- the case in court,mustn't its suit be given primacy to determine the basicquestion, was there discrimination in violation of the10    to wait for the EEOC to --11              QUESTION:  Well, because one of them has power12    to bind the other.  Does it not?  I mean, suppose the EEOC13    proceeds and there is a finding that discrimination,14    unlawful under the statute, occurred.  That would be15    binding on the employer in any other forum, wouldn't it16 be?17              MR. GORDON:  Well, Your Honor, it should be, but18    the EEOC doesn't take that position, as I understand it.19    As I understand their position, whatever happens in their20    court proceeding is an independent action and that Mr.21    Baker really doesn't have any control over.  And they're22    doing their own thing in court.23              QUESTION:  But we're not talking about Mr.24    Baker.  We're talking about the employer who has been25    found to have been a discriminator.  That would have issue29                                                                                                                                  1    preclusive effect against the employer in any other forum. 2    We're not talking about the individual now, but we're 3    talking about the employer who has been found to be a 4    discriminator in a Federal district court. 5              MR. GORDON:  It would, Your Honor, if there were 6    findings of fact that were common to the other proceeding. 7              QUESTION:  But the other way around, if the 8    arbitrator, say, finds no discrimination in that 9    arbitration forum, couldn't bind the EEOC because the EEOC10    wasn't party to that litigation.  Am I right about that?11              MR. GORDON:  Well, I would have to disagree with12    you on that because I believe that in the arbitration, if13    there were -- an adjudication was made as to Mr. Baker and14    in -- as in this particular case -- if I may use this case15    as the example, in this particular case, Mr. Baker is the16    only game in town here.  The EEOC is seeking relief solely17    on behalf of Mr. Baker.  All damages will go to Mr. Baker.18              QUESTION:  Let's -- let's cut out the relief19    aspect of it and again concentrate on the issue, was there20    discrimination or not, as to which there might be21    injunctive remedies.  If Mr. -- Mr. Baker loses on that,22    that can't preclude the EEOC from getting the23    determination, was there discrimination.24              So, the only point I'm making is when you've got25    one show that will be binding and the other that can't30                                                                                                                                  1    preclude the EEOC from litigating that basic question, 2    whatever remedies would attach to it, doesn't it follow 3    that the EEOC's suit must be allowed to go forward and 4    have the question of discrimination determined in that5 forum? 6              MR. GORDON:  Your Honor, I -- I still believe 7    that there's no reason to wait in this case, that the 8    arbitration can go forward to resolve Mr. Baker's 9    individual claims, that the EEOC, under the Fourth Circuit10    rule, can go forward and have the claims for broad-based11    injunctive relief heard there.12              And I -- I must say that there may be separate13    issues being litigated in that EEOC court proceeding14 because --15              QUESTION:  But isn't it true that for any16    relief, there must be a finding that the employer has17    violated the act?18              MR. GORDON:  There must be, but in the court19    proceeding, there's going to be a broader finding, that20    there is some pattern or practice of discrimination going21    on that may or -- may or may not apply to Mr. Baker.  If22    it does apply to Mr. Baker, I would agree with you.  Then23    that particular ruling would have some collateral estoppel24    effect in the arbitration.25              QUESTION:  Well, what -- what is your position31                                                                                                                                 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9-- maybe you've answered this.  What is your position ifthe employer and the employee arbitrate and there's afinding of no liability, no wrong on -- no wrong committedby the employer?  The EEOC then sues.  Is the EEOC notbound by the liability finding?          MR. GORDON:  Your Honor, in that particularcase, if the arbitrator makes a ruling that there was somepractice --          QUESTION:  No.  My hypothetical is thearbitrator rules for the employer.  No discrimination.There was no firing in violation of the ADA.  The employerwas taking -- the employee was taking money or something.That -- that was the reason.  Can the EEOC then re-litigate the issue of liability?101112131415161718192021    liability?22              MR. GORDON:  I am anticipating from your23    hypothetical that a specific finding is being made about24    Mr. Baker being discriminated against based on the facts25    and circumstances of his case.  What I am anticipating          MR. GORDON:  Not that particular very issue ofliability, but what I'm -- what I'm anticipating --QUESTION:  And why -- and why is that?MR. GORDON:  What I -- what I'm anticipating --QUESTION:  Why is it that the employer cannot --that the EEOC cannot re-litigate the raw finding of32                                  1    going in the court proceeding is some claim for broad- 2    based injunctive relief that may -- may involve Mr. Baker3 and may not. 4              QUESTION:  I just want to make it clear what 5    your position is.  Is it your position that when the EEOC 6    sues in -- in the Federal court and there has been a 7    previous finding of -- of non-liability on the part of the 8    employer, that the employer did not discriminate against 9    this person, is the EEOC bound in court by that finding?10              MR. GORDON:  Your Honor, the EEOC, to the extent11    that it's bringing a public enforcement action, something12    involving a pattern or practice of discrimination,13    something --14              QUESTION:  Suppose it's not.  Suppose it's just15    interested in this --16              MR. GORDON:  Just --17              QUESTION:  -- employee and it's going to base18    the injunction on the wrong that the employer allegedly19    committed against this employee, but the arbitrator has20    found that there is no such violation.21              MR. GORDON:  If it -- if the injunction is22    solely based on relief specific to Mr. Baker and the facts23    of his case, yes, it would be binding.24              QUESTION:  And what's your authority for that25    proposition?33                                                                                                                                  1              MR. GORDON:  Well, Your Honor, the -- the 2    authority would be that based on general principles of 3    collateral estoppel where there's been -- these issues 4    have been litigated and -- 5              QUESTION:  Against a particular person.  I 6    thought the basic principle of preclusion was that someone 7    who has not litigated cannot be bound.  You would have to 8    establish that there was some kind of privity between the 9    employee and the EEOC, but I think that would be certainly10    unprecedented.  The main rule is you have a right to a day11    in court, not two days in court, and if the EEOC has not12    been a party in the arbitral forum, I don't see how it can13    be bound, unless you're making up some new preclusion14    rule.1516171819202122232425MR. GORDON:  No, Your Honor, I'm not making --          QUESTION:  Or unless you say the statutoryscheme necessarily finds that there is privity because theEEOC's interests in this case, where there's no broadpattern or practice, are allied solely with those of the-- of the employee.  But it's -- it's a little odd to saythat a party in privity is -- is bound if that partycannot intervene in those proceedings when it's a publicagency.  But it seems to me that that has to be your --your proposition.          MR. GORDON:  Well, it is and it runs throughout                            34                                                                                              1    our brief, Your Honor, and it runs throughout what I'm -- 2    what I'm going to say to the Court is that basically what 3    -- what is happening here, in the -- in the terms of 4    seeking individual relief, is that the EEOC is acting on 5    behalf of Mr. Baker. 6              QUESTION:  Why -- why -- 7              QUESTION:  The EEOC is -- is effectively a party 8    to the earlier proceeding since its right in the later 9    proceeding is purely derivative of the right of -- of the10    individual employee.  That's essentially what you're11 urging.12              MR. GORDON:  It is, Your Honor, and -- and13    essentially the EEOC is standing in the shoes of Mr. Baker14    when you look at this case because it is -- if you look at15    the joint appendix, page 51 and 52, the interrogatory16    responses from the EEOC, you see that they acknowledge17    they are seeking -- when asked what -- what damages are18    you seeking in this case, we are seeking relief on behalf19    of Mr. Baker.20              QUESTION:  That -- that happens to be in this21    case.  They might have said that.22              Doesn't the EEOC also pursue a public interest?23    I mean, can't the EEOC -- imagine individuals who don't24    want to bring suits.  They don't care.  They're cowed or25    they just don't care.  And the EEOC says, I don't care35                                                                                                                                  1    whether you want to bring a suit or not; we're bringing 2    it.  Now, isn't that part of the EEOC's job to see that 3    employers don't discriminate?  And isn't there a public 4    interest in that, as well as the private interest? 5              MR. GORDON:  There is, Your Honor.  There's a 6    public interest in a case such as that, and there's also a 7    public interest in any claim that an individual brings to 8    vindicate the anti-discrimination -- 9              QUESTION:  But isn't there a public interest?10    Didn't Congress set this statute up so that it is more is11    involved than a simple tort action or a simple contract12    action?  There's a public policy in the United States13    against this kind of discrimination embodied in many laws,14    and this is one of those laws.15              MR. GORDON:  True, Your Honor, but that public16    interest can be vindicated just as effectively in17    arbitration.18              QUESTION:  That's the question.  If a person19    then in your view says to the EEOC, my employer20    discriminated against me because I'm black or because of21    gender or whatever, no doubt, but I like peace; I don't22    want to bother him; I'm a little worried about it; okay,23    drop it, if the EEOC says, I don't want to drop it, do24    they not have that right?25              MR. GORDON:  They can continue to pursue that                                  36                                                                                                                                  1    claim for broad-based injunctive relief involved.  But -- 2    but here's the rub. 3              QUESTION:  I'm talking about can they not get 4    appropriate relief.  That's what the statute says. 5              MR. GORDON:  It does say that, and the relief 6    would not be appropriate where an individual has signed an 7    agreement to arbitrate. 8              QUESTION:  I'm not -- I'm asking you my 9    question, not your question.  I, at the moment, have an10    individual who doesn't care, doesn't really want the suit11    brought, says to the EEOC drop it, forget it.  The EEOC12    says, we don't want to forget it.  There's -- I'm just13    repeating myself.  So, what's the answer to my case?14              (Laughter.)15              MR. GORDON:  Well -- well, the answer to your16    case I think is found in the Federal Arbitration Act17    because this individual agreed to arbitrate --18              QUESTION:  I'm not -- there is no arbitration19    agreement in my case.  It's a person.  You're quite right.20    As soon as you answer my question, I'm then going to ask21    you why does it matter that there's an arbitration22    agreement.23              (Laughter.)24              QUESTION:  But I'd like you to start with my25 case.37                                                                                                                                 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. GORDON:  All right.  Your Honor, if -- may Iask you to again assert your proposition?          QUESTION:  The person is lazy, frightened, orwhatever and says to the EEOC, I don't want you to bringthis action to get me reinstated.  Forget it.  Drop it.I'm indifferent.  Does the EEOC have the legal power tosay we don't care?  We have a public interest here.  Wewant to bring this suit anyway because we don't think it'sright for the employer to discriminate against you.  Wewant to make an example of him.  Okay?          MR. GORDON:  Yes.          QUESTION:  They can do that.          MR. GORDON:  They can do that.          QUESTION:  Fine.  Now, my question is, when theycan do that, why does it matter if there's an arbitrationagreement since once you -- all right.  Go ahead.  Whydoes it matter?          MR. GORDON:  Well, there is, of course, the --the strong Federal policy favoring arbitration, the textof the Federal Arbitration Act that says, we're going toenforce agreements.          QUESTION:  And, of course, my example isdesigned to show that all those interests have to do withthe private interest of the individual perhaps.          QUESTION:  Mr. Gordon --                            38                                                                                             1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Not the other.  That's why I asked --          QUESTION:  -- I think -- I think it is yourposition, is it not, that the -- that the agency would notbe able to bring such a suit if the individual had alreadysued and had been compensated, or indeed, if the -- if theindividual had already settled?          MR. GORDON:  True.          QUESTION:  Isn't that your position?          MR. GORDON:  True.          QUESTION:  And -- and your further position isthat the -- that the conclusion of an arbitrationagreement is similar to a settlement, that the agency'sability to bring the later suit depends on what theindividual, on whose behalf it sues, has given away.          MR. GORDON:  That is correct.          QUESTION:  Good.  That's perfect.  That's justmy question.  Why is this arbitration agreement more likethe settlement than it is like the instance we bothagreed, the indifferent employee?          MR. GORDON:  Your Honor, the EEOC in these cases-- and I hope I can be responsive to your question.  TheEEOC in these cases takes its employee as it finds it, andin this particular case, the employee has an arbitrationagreement.  And individual conduct can limit the abilityof the EEOC to seek remedies in a case.  It happens in a39                                                                                              1    number of different contexts. 2              QUESTION:  But the remedy -- I think we've 3    agreed that what we're not talking about here is the 4    substantive law -- the substantive right and the remedy. 5    It is simply a choice of forum clause.  And if you have 6    two parties that have a substantive right, who can assert 7    the substantive right, one of them is bound by a choice of 8    forum clause.  That's where that party must go.  And the 9    other one is not so bound.  Then how do you stop the EEOC10    from choosing its forum?11              The same question with respect to suppose it had12    been a State human rights commission that is going into13    the State court, and the employer says, no, State human14    rights commission, you can't do that because this employee15    has signed an agreement to arbitrate.16              MR. GORDON:  Your Honor, the -- the notion of17    the importance of the Federal Arbitration Act is that18    these agreements have to be put on the same footing as19    other contracts, and we must give force to an arbitration20    agreement such as this.  And to allow parties to come up21    with ways to get around these agreements completely22    undercuts the Federal Arbitration Act.23              And I -- I would disagree with your premise, if24    I -- if I may, respectfully, that arbitration is a forum25    selection clause.  It's a lot more than that.  It is a --40                                                                                                                                  1    it is a method of resolving employment disputes. 2              QUESTION:  But do you -- procedural mode, but do 3    you -- you don't contest, do you, that Title VII or the 4    disability act or the -- whatever Federal law is the law 5    that the arbitrator is to apply so that the substantive 6    law to be applied, whether you're in court or in 7    arbitration, is the same?  It would be Title VII.  It 8    would be the Disabilities Act.  You're not suggesting that 9    the arbitrator can apply some other brand of Federal law10    than the Federal court would apply, are you?11              MR. GORDON:  No, I'm not.  But --12              QUESTION:  So, we're talking about the forum and13    forums have rules of procedure, which can be different,14    but the substantive law is the same.  It is Title VII or15    the Disabilities Act.16              MR. GORDON:  That's true, Your Honor, but -- but17    still if we -- if we go forward with the rule that's18    proposed by the EEOC, in -- in my view we will be flying19    in the face of the Court's decisions in Gilmer, the20    Court's decision in Circuit City, the plain text of the21    Federal Arbitration Act.  We will be discouraging rather22    than encouraging arbitration, and --23              QUESTION:  Mr. -- Mr. Gordon, I assume that24    giving up the whole cause of action is the greater and25    giving up the forum is the lesser.  Isn't your response41                                                                                                                                  1    that if -- if the EEOC is bound by a settlement agreement, 2    a fortiori it should be bound by an agreement only to 3    bring the suit in a particular forum, if indeed its action 4    is derivative of the individual's action.  The greater 5    includes the lesser, and surely giving up the whole cause 6    of action, if that binds the EEOC, is greater than giving 7    up simply the forum in which the cause of action can be8 brought. 9              MR. GORDON:  True, and if you take a step back10    -- and let's -- let's take the more general -- general11    example where there -- there hasn't been a claim filed and12    where an individual is having a dispute with his employer.13    And the employer says, I will give you $300 in exchange14    for a -- a settlement agreement, a release of all claims.15    It doesn't involve where an EEOC charge has been filed or16    where there's a court case going on.  The EEOC and the17    courts take the position that that particular scenario18    would preclude it from later seeking relief on behalf of19    that individual in court.20              QUESTION:  Why is this greater?  You agreed that21    this is a -- this is the greater, the arbitration.22              The way I'm seeing it, which you can correct, is23    that the word in the statute is appropriate relief, and24    that there's a spectrum.  On the one hand, we have the25    indifferent employee.  Next is the one with an arbitration42                                                                                                                                  1    agreement who doesn't enforce it.  Next is the one who is 2    in the middle of arbitration.  Next is the one who has 3    been through arbitration and gotten some money, and 4    finally, at the far end we have a settlement.  And whether 5    each of those is appropriate, circumstances for the EEOC 6    to proceed might differ one from the other.  But certainly 7    the arbitration case is in the middle.  It's not way over 8    at the extreme.  So, what -- what is your response? 9              MR. GORDON:  I can't accept the spectrum10    analysis, if -- if I may.  I have to revert to the fact11    that -- that the individual signed the agreement to12    arbitrate.  Once signing that agreement to arbitrate, then13    he must pursue his individual claims in that forum and he14    cannot hand off the ball to the EEOC and have the EEOC do15    for him what he cannot do for himself, which is get16    individual relief in court.  That was the bargain that17    Waffle House made with this employee.18              QUESTION:  Would that carry over to, say, wage19    and hour claims?  Equal pay -- I guess the Equal Pay Act20    is the closest.21              MR. GORDON:  Your Honor --22              QUESTION:  Could the Secretary of Labor also be23    in privity with the individual employee who hasn't -- who24    has been denied equal pay?25              MR. GORDON:  Under the -- under the wage/hour43                                                                                                                                  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8    wage. 9              It's different on an ADA claim, for example.10    The EEOC does not have to approve the settlement of a11    claim.laws --QUESTION:  Yes.          MR. GORDON:  -- there -- there are differentinterests there.  For example, the -- the Department ofLabor has to approve a settlement of a wage/hour claimbecause of the public policy involved in making sure thatthe lowest wage earners in our society get a particular12131415    scenario.16              QUESTION:  Mr. Gordon, may I just ask you a17    question sort of about the other end of this case?  Let's18    assume that -- well, let's assume that there are parallel19    proceedings going on and that the EEOC suit comes to20    resolution first.21              Now, you -- you are -- you at least agree that22    the -- that the EEOC can get what I think you have23    described as sort of generalized equitable remedies on --24    on -- in -- in the public interest.  Would those remedies25    -- let's -- let's assume a case in which the EEOC sues on44                                                                                                                                 QUESTION:  How about an Equal Pay Act claim?          MR. GORDON:  Equal Play Act claim, Your Honor, Ibelieve would be covered under the Department of Labor 1    behalf of the individual who is subject to the particular 2    arbitration agreement, say, in this case, but also brings 3    in a -- in effect, a -- a class-wide claim and said, you 4    know, there are -- we'll prove that there are hundreds of 5    other individuals who have suffered the same -- what is it 6    -- Title I violation that this individual suffered.  Can 7    the -- and let's assume that in -- in the -- the EEOC 8    suit, that they prove that.  Can the EEOC get generally 9    class-wide remedy as -- as part of its general equitable10 relief?11121314    been --15MR. GORDON:  Yes.QUESTION:  Would that include back pay?MR. GORDON:  No, it would not where there'sQUESTION:  Why not?                MR. GORDON:  When there's been an arbitration17    agreement.18              QUESTION:  Well, not back pay for this19    individual.  Back pay for everybody in the class except20    this individual.  This is just -- I just want to know what21    your position is.22              MR. GORDON:  Our position would be, Your Honor,23    that for those individuals who have signed arbitration24    agreements, then any relief specific to them must be25    awarded in arbitration.  For those individuals who have45                                                                                                                                 16 1    not signed arbitration agreements, then that EEOC class- 2    wide relief action could encompass their claim for relief 3    in court.  But to give force to the arbitration agreements 4    that have been signed by the individuals, the -- the5 general -- 6              QUESTION:  Okay, but then -- then I -- is it 7    also your position that the -- that the general equitable 8    relief could not include an injunction to rehire all of 9    those who were improperly fired?10              MR. GORDON:  The -- the equitable relief11    specific to the individual -- specific to the12    individual --13              QUESTION:  Well, the injunction is just a14    general injunction.  It says, rehire the people in this15    class whom you unlawfully fired in -- in violation of this16    title.  Can -- can they get that relief on your theory?17    Can the EEOC get that relief on your theory?18              MR. GORDON:  It could if the relief was broad-19    based and not --20              QUESTION:  Well, in my example, it's broad-21    based in the sense that it applies to everyone in the22    class, but in order to enforce it, it will have to be23    enforced against specific individuals.  Somebody quite24    apart from this proceeding will come forward and say, I'm25    one of them.  You've got to rehire me.  Can the injunction46                                                                                                                                 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9      be -- be enforced in that case?                MR. GORDON:  Yes, it could, but --                QUESTION:  Then why can't back pay be enforced      in that case?                MR. GORDON:  But -- but -- well, it would be      enforced in arbitration.  The relief specific to the      individual would be enforced in arbitration.                QUESTION:  No.  You -- if I -- if I understood      what you just said -- maybe I didn't -- the -- the      injunction to rehire those who were improperly fired could      be enforced in -- in court.  In other words, there's an      injunction and a court that issued the injunction can      enforce it.  Is that correct?                MR. GORDON:  The determination would be in                QUESTION:  All right.  Then why -- why would not17    a similar determination and a similar power effect a back18    pay -- generalized back pay order?  Give back pay to all19    of those -- not this guy, but to all of those in the class20    generally who were improperly fired.21              MR. GORDON:  Well, it could, Your Honor.  In22    court a determination such as that could be made that23    these individuals have been discriminated against and24    therefore remedies are available to them.  But the actual25    determination of the remedies must be made in arbitration47                                                                                                                                 101112131415    court.16 1    for those individuals who signed arbitration -- 2              QUESTION:  I can understand why you say that, 3    but I don't understand why you say that a -- a general 4    equitable order to rehire could be enforced in court and 5    would not have to be remitted to an arbitral forum. 6              MR. GORDON:  The determination could be made in 7    court, but the determination of what specific equitable 8    relief, whether this person should be reinstated or -- or 9    this person should not, that should be made in10    arbitration.11              QUESTION:  So, in -- the only thing that on your12    theory then that is totally within the control of the13    court would be totally prospective relief, e.g., an order,14    don't do this again for anybody.  That would be15    enforceable in court.16              MR. GORDON:  Yes.17              QUESTION:  And purely in court.18              MR. GORDON:  That would be.19              QUESTION:  And let's say -- let's say a claim is20    made then later on that that order has been violated, that21    the title has been violated again, and the injunction22    against violating the title has been -- has been violated.23    And let's assume that the employee who claims that -- that24    he is the subject of that violation has also signed an25    arbitration agreement.  Does it have to go to arbitration?48                                                                                                                                 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. GORDON:  Well, in that particular case, YourHonor, I believe there would be contempt --          QUESTION:  Right.          MR. GORDON:  -- of the injunction.  The contemptwould be enforced in court.          QUESTION:  But why isn't your -- why isn't yourclaim to the vindication of the arbitration agreement thesame in the future case as it was in the past case?          MR. GORDON:  Because the relief that is awardedto a particular individual is awarded in arbitration.Assuming that relief was awarded, then that would probablyend the participation of the arbitrator at that point.          QUESTION:  The contempt action wouldn't bebrought by either the EEOC or -- or the individual, Iassume.  It would be brought by the United States attorneyor, as we have said, some attorney appointed by the court.          MR. GORDON:  Your Honor, the Court -- the Courtshould not allow -- and I think this is the central --central theme of -- of our argument here.  The Courtshould not allow the EEOC and its charging party who comesto it with an arbitration agreement to frustrate thepurposes of the Federal Arbitration Act by making this endrun around the agreement.  Mr. Baker entered into aprivate agreement with Waffle House to resolve anydisputes he has arising out of his employment.  The49                                                                                             1 Court -- 2              QUESTION:  Mr. Gordon, in -- in the history of 3    the anti-discrimination acts, there was legislative 4    history that said the EEOC should be the main player; that 5    is, they should be the main enforcer of these anti- 6    discrimination laws.  Now, that model, which would have 7    taken a lot more money than Congress has appropriated to 8    carry out -- but that model simply could not be realized 9    under your view of things because the Federal Arbitration10    Act would always take primacy, I think you -- you put it.11              But the notion that the EEOC ought to be running12    these discrimination actions -- they are the main show,13    and then the individual actions can supplement that.  But14    -- but you couldn't have that model effected under your15    view of it because the arbitration agreement could always16    come in and interfere with it.17              MR. GORDON:  Well, I think we should -- should18    take account of what the EEO still is able to do under the19    Fourth Circuit's rule.  The EEOC is still able to20    effectuate the public interest by seeking broad-based21    injunctive relief.  The EEOC is still able to get an22    injunction telling an employer that you are to certain23    things with the way you run your business.  The EEOC still24    has the opportunity to tell an employer that you must25    report back to us on a regular basis to tell us how you're50                                                                                                                                 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425complying with the employment discrimination laws.Injunctive relief is not a toothless remedy.          But I will -- I will say one other thing.          QUESTION:  Excuse me.  Does it have to wait forthe -- for the arbitration to be completed before itbrings such a suit?          MR. GORDON:  Before the EEOC brings a public --          QUESTION:  Before it brings such a suit basedupon the violation against an employee who has signed anarbitration agreement.          MR. GORDON:  No, Your Honor.  It could -- itcould file its own action for broad-based injunctiverelief if it wished.          QUESTION:  And -- and injunctive relief basedupon the violation that is the same subject as thearbitration proceeding.          MR. GORDON:  It could if there is a pattern andpractice involved in that scenario.          QUESTION:  I don't know what you mean.          MR. GORDON:  Well, if there is a policy, forexample, that is the root cause of --          QUESTION:  Well, that's fine.  It says thatpolicy is reflected in this one instance, and -- and it'sthe same instance that's -- that's before arbitration.What happens?51                                                                                             1              MR. GORDON:  Well, in that case, Your Honor, if2    the only -- if I'm -- if the only game in town is that Mr.3    Baker was discriminated against, and that's it, and there4    are no general -- general -- there's no general relief5    being sought, we're just mad about the employment decision6    directed toward him, then if the EEOC was in court just on7    that theory and was unable to show any broader8    application, then that -- the court should dismiss that9 case. 10111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Gordon.          Mr. Clement, you have 4 minutes remaining.           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. CLEMENT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.          I want to first pick up on Justice Souter'shypothetical about the contempt proceeding.  It seems tome that if that were enforced by civil compensatorycontempt, rather than a criminal contempt action broughtby the U.S. attorney, that he'd -- he'd have the sameproblem at the end of the day.          Respondents invoke the proposition that the EEOChas to take the victim as we find him.  The problem withthat is that principle applies with respect to damagesproblems, like a failure to mitigate, that apply to theindividual employee whether or not he arbitrates or52                                                                                              1    litigates and applies equally to an EEOC enforcement 2    action and to the individual claim. 3              What's so unique about this is that respondent 4    is attempting to take an agreement that does not restrict 5    Baker's ability to get any remedy in the arbitration 6    proceeding and turn it into a restriction on the remedies 7    available to the EEOC in its action. 8              The problem is, this is not, at bottom, a 9    restriction on damages or a problem with remedies.  It is10    a forum selection clause.  And you have a statutory11    structure that allows two people to initiate an action.12    When one of those parties has signed a forum selection13    clause and hasn't even initiated the action, it seems that14    even in the general case there would be no reason to15    restrict the other party's access to forums or their16    remedies.  That would seem to be a fortiori true for a17    statute like Title VII that gives the EEOC a right of18    first refusal over the initiation of the action.19              Another point I'd like to emphasize is that, as20    Justice Stevens made clear, there are currently no suits21    pending against employers in a situation where there has22    been a previous settlement.  In fact, there are only 45023    suits currently in the entirety of the EEOC's docket, and24    I think that puts this case in perspective.  In the25    literally 99 cases out of 100, an employer's arbitration53                                                                                                                                  1    agreement will govern and the only Title VII claim that 2    will be brought is the employee's claim in arbitration. 3    In the 1 case out of 100, in the extreme case where 4    there's some important public principle at stake or 5    there's particularly egregious conduct, the EEOC's public 6    enforcement action serves as a valuable safety valve that 7    allows it to preserve the possibility of precedent-setting 8    in public judicial proceedings. 9              The third and final point I'd like to make is10    that whatever the answer is in the settlement context,11    there's absolutely no reason to take a restriction that12    only restricts the available forum and not the remedies13    and turn it into a restriction on remedies but not the14    forum.  Here respondent seeks not only to bind the EEOC to15    the results of an arbitration, but to prevent the EEOC16    from seeking all remedies even when there hasn't been any17    arbitration proceeding initiated at all.                For those reasons, we ask you to reverse.                CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.                The case is submitted.54                                                                                                                                 181920    Clement.2122232425          (Whereupon, at 11:01 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)
