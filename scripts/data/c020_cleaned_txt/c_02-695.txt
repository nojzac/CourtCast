Racing Association of Central Iowa.General Miller.ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS J. MILLERON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. MILLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:The Iowa Legislature, consistent with the EqualProtection Clause, can charge different tax rates for its riverboats and its racetracks for a number of legitimate State interest reasons, including and especially the one highlighted by the district court judge here, the promotion of the development of river communities.In 1983, Iowa broke ground and got more friendly with gambling and allowed horse racing and dog racing in our State.￼it. Honor?QUESTION: It's called gaming if -- if you favorMR. MILLER: I -- is there a neutral term, YourIn -- in regard to gaming, one of the main purposes of having horse and dog racing was to develop a31111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 new subset of our agricultural economy, the breeding,2 training, and raising of horses and dogs. And that3 succeeded. It turned out to be about a $50 million4 industry.5 Six years later, with visions of Mark Twain in6 the background and the two incredible rivers in America7 surrounding our State, the Mississippi and the Missouri,8 the legislature authorized riverboat casinos, riverboat9 gambling. And one of the main purposes there was tourism,10 economic development for the river communities and11 riverfront development. In a very short time, there were12 $17 million worth of investment along the various13 riverfronts.14 A few years later, though, neither gaming15 enterprise was -- was doing as well as they would like,16 indeed, not doing -- not doing well at law.17 In regard to the riverboats, the problem was,18 well, Iowa had this sort of, in a way, naivete maybe about19 betting. They restricted the amount of bets on20 riverboats. It could only be a $5 bet and one couldn't21 lose more than -- more than $200 in one setting. Well,22 Illinois had a different view and had no limits and were23 starting to succeed competitively.24 The -- the situation with the racetracks was25 more severe, that economically it just wouldn't work to41111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425have racing, either horse racing or dog racing alone. So Iowa became the first State in the Nation to allow the sort of the -- the golden goose of gambling, slot machines, at racetracks.QUESTION: So now the bulk of the earnings are from slot machines rather than the races. Is that right?MR. MILLER: That -- that's right, Your Honor. Indeed, really the slot machines support the -- support the racing.QUESTION: But under your scheme, I take it the highest tax rate for slot machine income at racetracks is 36 percent versus 20 percent for slot machines on riverboats.MR. MILLER: That -- that is correct, Your Honor. And that was provided on a -- on a graduated basis. Actually in next year it's -- the 36 percent would be -- would be reached.QUESTION: And you want to offer a rational basis for that scheme?MR. MILLER: Yes. Yes, we do, Your Honor. And what -- what we say is that the development of the -- of the riverboats could be rationally preferred by the -- by the legislature because of riverboat development, because of economic development on the -- on the rivers.Additionally, the -- the district court found51111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 that the additional rational basis could be sort of2 supporting the riverboat enterprises as a -- as an3 industry, promoting riverboat history.4 Also, we argue that there was a problem of5 riverboats leaving the State, that three out of six in the6 previous -- previous to 1994, the legislation year, had --7 had left the State.8 QUESTION: Well, because of that legislation,9 the Delta King left the Sacramento River and it's gone up10 to the Mississippi.11 MR. MILLER: Well, that was the next purpose,12 Your Honor, to try and get other boats to -- to come to13 Iowa, and apparently --14 QUESTION: They're -- they're saying -- and15 maybe there's -- I take it from their brief that, look,16 there's never been a tax scheme like this. Obviously, a17 State very often would -- would tax at a different rate a18 handsaw and a screwdriver, but we've never heard of a19 State that said when you sell a screwdriver, you pay 520 percent tax if you sell it in Des Moines and a 3 percent21 tax if you sell it in Dubuque, and if it's sold by one22 kind of a person, they sell 8 percent tax, and it's all23 the same screwdriver. So they're saying there's never24 been a -- really a tax system like this anywhere, and --25 and they better have some pretty good reason or -- or61111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425something.I mean, now -- so is all that true, that therenever has been a system like that, saying the same screwdriver, everything identical, all it is is it's sold in different parts of the State or by different people, and -- and you have to pay a different tax?MR. MILLER: Well, I think there's been many times where the -- the taxpayer has been -- been treated differently even if -- even if the transaction is the same.QUESTION: Like what? Like what?MR. MILLER: Sort of the -- the enterprise zones, for instance. Communities are -- are given favorable tax rates all the time for economic development purposes and that's what's here. And --QUESTION: Typical -- typical sales tax. You know, the State may tax a barber's income at a different rate than a hairdresser's and yet they may use the same stuff.MR. MILLER: Yes. Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that -- that would -- that would be another example.And, you know, the State has great latitude in the taxation area and justifiably so because there are so many complexities that -- that that be available to the State.71111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Do -- do you agree, at least to the2 extent the respondents say, that there's no other State in3 which slot machines are taxed at a different rate4 depending 56 that's --7 typically8 places like Iowa. Typically they're in -- they're in9 casinos. So there's not -- not a lot of apt comparisons.on their location, that this is unique to Iowa? MR. MILLER: I -- I think as far as I know, that's the -- that's the case. Slot machines are not in multiple purposes -- not multiple10 But you know, this is -- this is a -- a question11 for the legislature. When there's no suspect category or12 fundamental right available, the legislature has -- has a13 great deal of -- of discretion. And the enterprise -- the14 purpose of the enterprise is different. The economic15 development as opposed to the agricultural, for instance.16 When that -- when that is the case, the -- the legislature17 really has -- has a great deal --18 QUESTION: So I push their argument or am I19 imagining -- I'm trying to put it the strongest way.20 Look, cosmetologists and barbers do different things, and21 moreover an enterprise zone is a special part of the State22 that's not exactly the same. Something different is going23 on there. Here it's slot machine income. Nothing24 different is going on. Nothing.25 MR. MILLER: Well, there is difference --81111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: I -- I -- yes, go ahead.2 MR. MILLER: There is difference in -- in the3 enterprise. One has slot machines and table games. The4 other has slot machines and -- and racing. But here you5 have a -- a series of communities in -- in eastern Iowa6 and then in western Iowa along the rivers that had7 suffered loss of manufacturing jobs. This was -- this was8 an effort, a legitimate effort, on the part of the9 legislature to advance a new industry, a tourism industry,10 on the two rivers.11 QUESTION: As I understood it, didn't -- didn't12 the tax on the -- the higher tax on the racetracks come13 later?14 MR. MILLER: It was -- it was phased in, Your15 Honor. That --16 QUESTION: And I can't quite understand how17 imposing an extraordinarily high tax on racetracks is18 suddenly going to provide a benefit for riverboats.19 MR. MILLER: Well, the legislature, of course,20 had the -- had the discretion to -- to have them both at21 36 percent. The -- the benefit of the -- to the -- to the22 riverboats was that -- that they didn't go to the higher23 rate that -- that the -- that they did for the -- for the24 racetracks. It's sort of a chicken and egg problem, but25 -- but they're spared that -- that higher rate and -- and91111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that's -- and that's an appropriate benefit. QUESTION: It's across-the-board rate foreverything that goes on at the riverboat, right? It's a 20 percent rate, whether its roulette or card games or dice, it's all 20 percent.MR. MILLER: That's it. The --QUESTION: For the race, there's a great disparity between the parimutuels. It's only what, about 5, 6 percent?MR. MILLER: That's right, Your Honor. There's a -- there's a very favorable rate for the -- for the racing at the -- at the racetrack. So it's a -- in a sense it's a -- it's a blend of rates between the two. Again, understandably so --QUESTION: Is the rate -- is the rate for taxing other gaming activities on the riverboats different from the slot machines on the riverboats?MR. MILLER: No, Your Honor, it's not. It's -- it's the same. It's the same rate. So you have -- you sort of have 20 percent there as opposed to, say, as was just pointed out, 4 or 5 percent for the racing at the -- at the racetrack.QUESTION: So it's administratively easier to calculate if you have all one rate for the riverboat?MR. MILLER: It would be -- it would be more101111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 easily to -- to calculate and more efficient.2 QUESTION: You say the riverboats, obviously,3 are located on the rivers which bound Iowa on the east and4 on the west. How about the racetracks? Are they5 scattered throughout the State?6 MR. MILLER: They are scattered throughout the7 State. Two of them are on the -- turned out to be on the8 rivers. But the largest one, the premier one, Prairie9 Meadows, is in the Des Moines area in -- in central Iowa.10 QUESTION: Add that if we looked into this at11 any depth at all, we'd discover this originated from a12 legislator who hated racetracks and loved riverboats and13 was trying to kill the whole thing. And then they say14 that besides that, there was a report of a committee that15 said all this enterprise zone -- we don't think that's so,16 et cetera, et cetera.17 MR. MILLER: Well, I mean, shocking that -- that18 a legislator on -- on -- in riverboat country would try19 and help the -- help the riverboats. I mean, that's, for20 better or worse, part of the -- part of the legislative21 process, always was and always will be. And -- and courts22 can't be sort of cops to -- to make sure that -- that they23 -- that they do not do that.24 QUESTION: Well, under --25 QUESTION: If we ever look to the real reasons111111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 for things, it would be a disaster, wouldn't it?2 (Laughter.)3 MR. MILLER: Yes. Well, it's, you know, the old4 adage about sausage, making sausage, that you shouldn't5 watch it, that --6 QUESTION: But the Iowa -- the Iowa Supreme7 Court seems to think it could look to what was the real8 purpose, not the purpose that we could conceive. Lots of9 nice purposes like the riverboat drifts away and the10 racetrack is --11 But you said something in your reply brief that12 -- that really surprised me. It seems to me that if we13 say -- if you're talking about Federal equal protection,14 this is an area in which the leeway for the legislature is15 the widest that there is. But couldn't Iowa then say,16 okay, we're just doing this under Iowa equal protection,17 and we can make that whatever we want? And for us, the18 real purpose counts, not the conceivable purpose.19 MR. MILLER: Yes. The -- you know, the -- the20 legislature -- the court could have said that they were21 diverging from -- from the standards of this Court.22 QUESTION: But you said they couldn't do that on23 remand. On page 6 of your reply brief, you said that the24 Iowa Supreme Court cannot reconsider the State court25 decision in order to subsequently establish an adequate121111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 and independent State ground. Why couldn't it?2 MR. MILLER: Well, our argument is -- is, Your3 Honor -- and we know we're -- we're into sort of a little4 bit new territory here. But our argument is that -- that5 the court has made a decision that the -- the analysis --6 a clear decision that the analysis is the same under the7 Federal and the State constitutional provision. If that8 analysis, judged by a higher court, is determined to be9 wrong, then that would -- would seem perhaps to settle it.10 But more significantly, the -- the respondents11 didn't argue below that there was a separate analysis,12 that -- that they should look at it separately.13 QUESTION: But they could. I mean, nothing14 would foreclose them on remand or the Iowa Supreme Court15 itself.16 MR. MILLER: Yes. It's -- it might not, but we17 argue that -- that they sort of waived that argument, that18 they didn't argue that in -- in the first time through,19 that they -- it was a different analysis. They conceded,20 like everybody else, and assumed that it was the same21 analysis.22 QUESTION: All our opinion would say, if we23 reverse the Supreme Court of Iowa, was remand it for24 further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.25 And so certainly, so far as our remand order is concerned,131111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 the Supreme Court of Iowa is free to do whatever it wants2 so long as not -- as it's not inconsistent with our3 opinion.4MR. MILLER: I understand, Mr. Chief Justice. making my argument too soon and -- and will -- QUESTION: I doubt if you'll have any better it before the Supreme Court of Iowa. (Laughter.)5 Maybe I'm 67 luck with 8MR. MILLER: Well, we -- we will -- we will try10 I -- I assume.11 What -- what we're saying here is that -- that12 there are multiple legitimate State purposes available13 that are well within the zone of Nordlinger and the14 related cases that have been before this Court, that --15 that this is comfortably a legitimate State interest, a16 number of them, most specifically the development of the17 -- of -- of the river communities. And that's -- that's18 consistent --19 QUESTION: Would it make any difference in your20 analysis -- I don't know if this is true or not -- but if21 the legislative history, if you had a complete record of22 all the debates and everything else, and it was perfectly23 clear that the hypothetical reasons you advance were24 definitely not the reasons that motivated the particular25 tax rates, that they did it just, say, to get even with141111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200059￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the racetracks because somebody was unhappy with something they had done in the past or something like that, would that make any difference?MR. MILLER: Well, I -- I don't think that there's -- there would be sufficient legislative history to foreclose rational speculation.QUESTION: No, no. Take his hypothetical. There is.QUESTION: I'm assuming that there is, that -- that there's a reason out there that -- that -- none of the reasons that you advance were, in fact, considered by any of the legislators. In fact, they rejected them. They thought, we really don't want to help the riverboats. What we want to do is do something to really penalize the racetracks because they're an immoral business, they're even worse than gambling on the rivers. But that's why they're doing it.QUESTION: And they put that right in the preamble to the act.QUESTION: Would that make any difference in your analysis?MR. MILLER: I -- I think that that kind of -- kind of history would not, in a rational speculation case, that -- that --QUESTION: I guess my question is, is it151111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425rational speculation when you know it's not true? (Laughter.)MR. MILLER: Well, I -- I suppose not.QUESTION: Well, it's usually not true. I mean, usually these things are done for the self-interest of -- of legislators from various districts, and -- and as long as there could be a rational -- I -- I would have -- I'm surprised it took you so long to answer that question.(Laughter.)MR. MILLER: I wanted to be thoughtful, Your Honor. But like -- we get back to -- to the -- the rough and tumble of the legislative process as -- as you suggest, Your Honor, is such that the courts don't -- don't review that, don't -- don't --QUESTION: But isn't -- isn't that exactly really the point? The courts just don't review it. And unless you get to -- to some fact pattern that -- that gets you a -- a higher level of scrutiny, it's not so much that we're engaging in rational basis scrutiny. We're just saying we can't touch the political process unless you get yourself into a suspect class. Isn't that really what we're saying?MR. MILLER: That's -- that's pretty much -- pretty much what's -- what's being said here and -- and how the cases have been interpreted. And is -- and it161111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425makes -- makes a lot of sense because like you -- like you suggest, Your Honor, when there's -- there's not a fundamental right or a suspect category, that's the pure legislative authority and that's where democracy kicks in our -- in our country, for better or for worse, and the assumption is that if they make a mistake, democracy later will -- will catch that mistake.Your Honor, I'd like to -- to now turn it over to -- this has been my first argument, so I refer to him as my safety net.(Laughter.)MR. MILLER: Kent Jones from the Solicitor General's office, and reserve what time is remaining after he is done.QUESTION: Very well, General Miller. Mr. Jones.ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONESON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE,SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERMR. JONES: I'd like to thank counsel. And Mr.Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:Taxing decisions are like spending decisions because they affect the State's economy, as well as its balance sheet. In recognizing that fact, this Court has consistently upheld the -- the -- has consistently held171111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 that a State's desire to promote or foster one type of2 business over another or even to promote or foster one3 mode of doing a business over another is a rational basis4 that supports taxing the one and exempting the other.5 For example, in State Board v. Jackson in 1931,6 this Court held -- upheld a tax differential, a different7 tax treatment, of chain stores versus single enterprise8 retail stores. Even though these businesses did9 essentially the same commerce, the Court held that in the10 State's exercise of its broad authority to govern the11 economy of the State, it can prefer one mode of doing the12 same business over another.13 And that same rationale has been applied by this14 Court in numerous contexts involving tax distinctions15 between, for example, warehouses located near railroads16 and warehouses not located near railroads, between17 laundries that are operated by hand and laundries that are18 operated by machine, and even between individuals and19 corporations that are conducting identical businesses.20 QUESTION: What about -- what about slot21 machines owned by Republicans versus slot machines owned22 by Democrats?23 (Laughter.)24 MR. JONES: Assuming that we're still talking25 about State laws --181111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: No, that's exactly -- I'm seriousabout --MR. JONES: Assuming we're still talking about State laws, I would have to ask myself what would be the rational basis. The rational basis --QUESTION: The rational basis is the Republicans have a majority in the State legislature.(Laughter.)MR. JONES: Well, that might explain -- the difference I think between your hypothetical and -- and where I'm trying to come from is that the rational basis has to be related to a legitimate State purpose. There's a -- a legitimate State purpose in fostering certain kinds of commerce and suppressing others.QUESTION: What about -- what about slot machines owned by farmers and slot machines owned by city dwellers?MR. JONES: It's -- it's hypothetically conceivable and that's the question that this Court asked itself under -- under FCC v. Beach. Is there a conceivable State interest that would justify that distinction? And obviously, that -- the fact that there has to be one doesn't mean there always is one, and I'm not standing here saying, well, every imaginable distinction is justifiable. The distinction in this case191111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 is simply between -- is whether the State could2 conceivably have preferred riverboats over racetracks.3 QUESTION: What -- what have we held wasn't4 justified outside of a suspect category situation, such as5 -- I don't mean Republicans and Democrats. You're into6 First Amendment suspect categories I suppose. What --7 what have we ever held was -- was irrational that didn't8 involve race or -- or, you know, political discrimination9 or something like that?10 MR. JONES: The -- there's a case that Justice11 Ginsburg could tell us about. She argued a case where12 this Court -- I think it was called Weinberger v.13 Wiesenfeld, a case -- not a tax case. It was a Social14 Security benefits case, and the Court held that the15 distinct treatment of -- of the surviving spouse's16 ability --17 QUESTION: It's a suspect category, and I mean,18 we're into sex discrimination.19 MR. JONES: Well, it -- it was described by the20 Court as -- as a rational scrutiny case, and it said there21 was no legitimate State interest because in -- in the22 context between treating differently male and female23 surviving spouses, in light of the objective of that24 statute, which was to protect the -- the children of the25 couple, there was no rational basis to prefer one rather201111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 than the other.2 That is -- that is the only case that I can cite3 to you where this Court has applied a rational basis test4 to strike down a Federal statute. There may well be5 others.6 QUESTION: There are others, but it's -- it's7 the -- it's quite interesting, is -- is there a -- there8 are two sets where they're struck down. One is what you9 might call the heightened rational basis which are10 normally not economic regulation, but there was the mental11 -- the mental -- the building, you know, the -- of the12 home for the mentally disturbed or whatever. And then13 there are the ones that are out-of-state, which are14 Dormant Commerce Clause cases. But is there any which is15 a pure rational basis in an economic area? You think the16 answer to that is no, and I can't think of one.17 MR. JONES: I -- I can't think of one, but it's18 not because there is no rational basis test. It's because19 in applying this test, the Court is very deferential in20 recognizing that States have intentionally been given this21 authority over regulating State commerce, and that these22 kinds of choices are left to the legislative branch.23 QUESTION: Mr. Jones, when you talked about24 Federal tax, I thought you were going to say the one that25 you have in your brief, Martz against Commissioner.211111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. JONES: Well, I -- we understand that to2 have been a case where the -- which you also argued I3 believe, unless I'm remembering the wrong case --45 that cert 6789 that I'll10 was --11 12 13QUESTION: That was -- that was -- you left out was denied.MR. JONES: Ah.(Laughter.)MR. JONES: I made another mistake in the brief get to later if I have a chance. But thatQUESTION: These are all cases she won or lost? MR. JONES: I'm afraid --(Laughter.)QUESTION: You didn't -- you didn't make the1415 mistake of citing one that she lost, did you?￼161718192021 case. It 222324 tax case.25 Court was(Laughter.)MR. JONES: No, I don't think so.QUESTION: There are no such cases.(Laughter.)QUESTION: Oh, yes, there is and it was a tax was a State tax case.(Laughter.)MR.JONES: But--butthe--itwas--itwasaBut in that case, the Court -- you were -- the persuaded that the distinction was invidious.221111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 The Court didn't say that a different treatment of2 unmarried men and unmarried women in this particular3 deduction context was irrational. The Court said it was4 invidious. So I believe that the only tax -- Federal tax5 case that has -- well, I don't believe there is a Federal6 tax case that this Court has decided that violated --7 failed to meet the rational basis test.8 The -- the court below made -- the Iowa Supreme9 Court -- where it went wrong was looking to only one of10 the purposes of the statute. There were many purposes.11 They looked to just the purpose of whether it aided12 racetracks, which just kind of strikes me as an13 unrealistic way to look at what the purpose of a14 legislation that imposes a tax on racetracks would be.15 But to answer a question that Justice Stevens16 raised earlier, when -- in applying the rational basis17 test, the courts are to look to any plausible or18 conceivable theory. And -- and in FCC v. Beach, as well19 as other cases we've cited, in applying that test, the20 Court has said that you don't look -- you're not bound by21 the facts of the particular case. And indeed, you're not22 supposed to make fact findings as to what these legitimate23 interests might be. Instead, you're supposed to allow the24 State any rational legitimate interest that the Court25 might -- might be able to perceive and -- and nail down231111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 that point in that case by saying that -- and I'm quoting2 -- it is entirely irrelevant whether the conceived State3 purpose actually motivated the State's decision.4 So you don't have -- the State doesn't have to5 show that these rational, legitimate State interests, in6 fact, motivated the decision. It doesn't have to show7 that they are, in fact, the basis for the decision because8 this is a Federal constitutional question. This is not a9 question of interpreting the State law. If we wanted to10 interpret the State law, we'd want to know what its11 purpose was, but that's not this task. In looking at the12 constitutional limitation, it only -- it only takes effect13 if the State has no conceivable or plausible legitimate14 interest in the classification.15 One other point to mention briefly is they say16 Allegheny Pittsburgh points another direction. Allegheny17 Pittsburgh was the rare case that this Court said in18 Nordlinger -- was the rare case where there was a West19 Virginia State constitutional provision that said all20 assessment -- all property taxes will be levied based on21 market value. A local assessor in that State didn't like22 that and he -- he assessed taxes based on acquisition,23 which is prices, which is the last sale price of each24 property, and that resulted in -- in a differential25 treatment of each taxpayer. And what this Court held in241111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 -- in Allegheny Pittsburgh was that because the State2 constitution prohibited any taxation other than market3 value, there was no legitimate State interest to justify4 the -- the distinguishing tax rates.5 Well, that case doesn't have any application6 here because there's no provision in the Iowa constitution7 that says8 commerce,9 riverboatthat the Iowa Legislature cannot, in regulating prefer or promote riverboat traffic and--QUESTION: Do you read Allegheny as saying that the State had enacted exactly the scheme that administered there, that it would pass equal1011 the -- if12 was being13 protection review?14 MR. JONES: It -- well, in Nordlinger, the Court15 -- if I understand your question right, in Nordlinger, the16 Court upheld an acquisition -- last sale price tax scheme17 I think in California where there was no constitutional￼18 provision19 taxation.2021 different22 constitution requires that all slot machines be taxed23 alike?24 MR. JONES: I think that you would make -- I25 think in that -- in looking for a legitimate State251111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005in California that required market valueQUESTION: Would the answer in this case beif the Iowa Supreme Court told us that the Iowa1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425interest, you would make an inquiry into whether the Iowa constitution prohibited preferring riverboats -- preferring riverboat commerce because a legitimate State interest for Federal purposes -- and the Court made this very point in response to a dissent of yours in -- in the opinion by Justice Brennan in the Minnesota v. the Clover Leaf Creamery case.QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Jones. Mr. McCormick.ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK McCORMICK ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSMR. McCORMICK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:I think the Iowa Supreme Court in this case, as this Court will determine as it reviews the opinion, addressed two questions, not merely one question, in this equal protection challenge.The first question the court addressed is what did the legislature have in mind in enacting this legislation. In doing so and in answering that question, the State court was doing what State courts routinely do, interpreting State law.Once having determined the meaning of State law, as was its prerogative, the court then moved to the second question which is the only question that the State and the261111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 United States have argued here, really, which is the equal2 protection issue.3 We think the first question has to be answered4 before you jump to the second.5 QUESTION: Well, what about the -- our decision6 in FCC v. Beach, which was just referred to earlier, where7 it says it really doesn't make any difference what the8 actual facts were?9 MR. McCORMICK: The -- the decision in Beach, as10 I understand it, did require the establishment of a11 legitimate State purpose under the FCC provision that was12 at issue. In fact, the court of appeals had sent the case13 back to the FCC: Tell us what you had in mind, and the14 court of appeal -- or the FCC said, we can't think of a15 better reason than was given by Judge Mikva in his16 concurring opinion, and this Court accepted that as being17 a plausible basis then for the distinction that was at18 issue in that case.19 QUESTION: But we have said that any conceivable20 rational basis is enough. We don't care what Iowa really21 had in mind.22 MR. McCORMICK: I think you do, Your Honor, and23 I think the case that was mentioned earlier, the24 Weinberger case, is an illustration of how it makes a25 difference. In that case, as the Court ultimately found,271111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 there was gender discrimination which was inappropriate in2 dealing with the issue survivorship benefits as to3 spouses, and the argument that was being proffered by the4 Government in that case was, this is okay because this5 statute was intended to take care of women who have6 trouble, when they are widowed, getting by in the work7 place.8 QUESTION: If you think gender discrimination9 cases aren't different, you're just wrong.10 MR. McCORMICK: No, Your Honor.11 saying that the analysis was the same, but12 that the Court looked to the actual intent13 by legislative history.I--Iamnot I am sayingas it was shown14 QUESTION: Some legislatures -- some15 legislatures don't have legislative history. What is to16 be done in those cases? What, do you -- you convene a17 trial court to take testimony from legislators and others18 to find out what was the actual intent of the legislators?19 MR. McCORMICK: What is routinely done in Iowa20 is what we did in this case, which is -- and what courts21 routinely do at the State level, at least what's done in22 Iowa, is that the court looks at any available materials23 that would bear on the concerns --24 QUESTION: There are no materials. I mean, some25 States don't have legislative history. They just don't281111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425keep it.MR. McCORMICK: That's right.QUESTION: What do you do in that case?MR. McCORMICK: I'm telling you.QUESTION: Do you call witnesses?MR. McCORMICK: We don't have -- we do not haverecords or transcripts of legislative debates at committee hearings.QUESTION: So were -- were -- was testimony taken from legislators asking why did you vote for this bill?MR. McCORMICK: No, Your Honor, but -- QUESTION: Why not?MR. McCORMICK: -- affidavits -- excuse me. Butaffidavits were obtained that explained what the concernswere that were being addressed. We have a full record. This was a summary judgment motion in which we put in information that was available to the legislature.QUESTION: Affidavits from legislators?MR. McCORMICK: Yes, Your Honor, but not saying why they voted as they did, but explaining the legislative history. And the Iowa court routinely, in dealing with the meaning of State law, has accepted the kinds of materials that we put in the summary judgment record.QUESTION: Why didn't they explain why they291111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 voted as they did? If, as you say, the -- the intent of2 the legislature is the criterion, why didn't you ask them,3 why did you vote the way you did?4 MR. McCORMICK: Because Iowa, like this Court,5 suggests that an individual legislator is incompetent to6 say that, but Iowa, like this Court, will permit7 legislators to explain legislative history, which is what8 was done here. That's what we did with these legislator9 affidavits. The Iowa Court used the kinds of materials10 that States use when they --QUESTION: The whole is the sum of its parts. really interested in why the legislature did it, to get affidavits from every legislator saying1112 If you're13 you ought14 this is why I voted for it, and if 51 percent voted for it15 for a certain reason, that was the reason.16 MR. McCORMICK: In a State like Iowa, where we17 don't have the kind of information that's available from18 Congress, what we do is we ask our court to determine what19 the legislature intended as it must in many, many cases,20 including this kind of case, and offer the court the kind21 of information, the background information that's22 available.23 QUESTION: If that's how it's done in Iowa, it24 can be done that way. This Court, when it's dealing with25 tax cases, it doesn't do it that way. It doesn't look for￼301111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 the actual purpose.2 And in -- and in the Wiesenfeld case, the whole3 thing was driven by it being a gender classification, and4 the Government's argument was this was pure favor to5 women. And the argument is that, no, that was not the6 actual purpose.7 MR. McCORMICK: This Court has said in several8 cases -- it has said in the Nordlinger case and also in9 Heller against Doe -- that even in a rational basis case,10 to be plausible, a justification must not be precluded by11 the record.12 And, for example, that is how Nordlinger13 distinguished Allegheny Pittsburgh because Allegheny14 Pittsburgh had determined that the West Virginia property15 tax scheme was a market value valuation or appraisal16 system. And in Nordlinger, the position was being17 advocated, well, this case is governed by Allegheny18 Pittsburgh. You can't have an acquisition value system19 like California. The Court distinguished Allegheny20 Pittsburgh by saying that the record in Allegheny21 Pittsburgh precluded the legislative goal of having a22 market value -- excuse me -- having an acquisition value23 tax system. That's how the case was distinguished.24 QUESTION: But if you're looking at what -- what25 the legislature did, they did one thing great for the311111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 racetracks. They gave them permission to have these slot2 machines, which they didn't before, so they're preferring3 the racetracks by giving them this, but they say not too4 much because we're going to let you make money from these5 slot machines, but not too much. We're going to take a6 piece of it.7 So you like what they did, the permission to8 have the slot machines, but then say, ah, but once -- they9 have to give us as sweet a deal as they gave the10 riverboats. They didn't have to give you anything. They11 didn't have to let you have the slot machines.12 MR. McCORMICK: Well, Your Honor, our argument13 about that is that they -- they threw us a lifeline when14 we were faced with economic disaster, just as they were15 throwing a lifeline to the riverboats, but it had an16 anchor attached to it. What they did, of course, was have17 a 2-year moratorium before the first escalation of tax18 occurred and they provided for a total of 10 years before19 the 36 percent is effective. It will be effective next20 year.21 QUESTION: But it was -- it all came in in the22 same legislation, didn't it --23 MR. McCORMICK: That's correct, Your Honor.24 QUESTION: So they gave you something you never25 had before and it was pretty good, but you didn't --321111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. McCORMICK: The Iowa Supreme Court said what they did by that legislation was put us in a class the same as the riverboats with respect to slot machines, which was the main activity at both -- both venues, and that they treated us differently by imposing this draconian --QUESTION: Well, then to treat you the same, I think that they would have to raise the parimutuel betting from 5 percent, whatever it was, to 20 percent.MR. McCORMICK: Your Honor, the record here shows that parimutuel betting has invariably been a losing proposition at the tracks, and the legislature, when it passed this statute, specifically and expressly required that the riverboats use the revenue first to pay their debt, because they were in terrible circumstances, but secondly to subsidize the purses at the parimutuel betting and to promote the -- the horse industry. And such -- these are mandated goals which were -- which the legislature required.QUESTION: That the riverboats do that or that the tracks do that?￼that.MR. McCORMICK: No. That the racetracks doQUESTION: Oh, okay. You said the riverboats. MR. McCORMICK: I'm sorry. I meant the331111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 racetracks are required by the statute to -- to do those2 things. Parimutuel betting has -- has never been a source3 of net revenue in -- at least since the bankruptcy of the4 main racetrack in 1992.5 QUESTION: As I understand, the riverboats6 wouldn't make money either if they didn't have the slot7 machines.8 MR. McCORMICK: Well, that's certainly arguable.9 They've had them since they were initiated. Their problem10 in 1994 was getting rid of the betting and loss limits.11 But the -- the Iowa court -- and it's our12 contention that this was a matter that was within the13 prerogative of the court -- in ascertaining the14 legislative intent in this case, said it was not the15 intent of the Iowa Legislature to benefit riverboats at16 the expense of the racetracks.17 QUESTION: So how does this work? I mean, I18 thought there was a distinction between your trying to19 show in a case like this that the rational purposes that20 are advanced simply are not served -- that's a factual21 matter. And I take it that's Allegheny. They showed that22 the -- that this wasn't a way to bring about what they23 claimed.24 25341111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼MR. McCORMICK: Yes.QUESTION: All right. But it's not open to you1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425to show that the legislature didn't really have that motive for the reason that if the courts permitted you to show it, there would be no end to that. People would be arguing about legislative theories in State cases like this forever.So if that's right -- I -- I mean, you're not -- I don't think you can show the first. Maybe you can.MR. McCORMICK: Well, our contention is that -- QUESTION: Yes -- is you can.MR. McCORMICK: -- this Court left that open tous in Allegheny Pittsburgh.QUESTION: Yes. I think it did leave it open,but you see, they come in with some rational purposes, and you think you've showed here that -- that they don't -- that this -- this particular statute could not serve those purposes as a matter of the world of fact?I mean, one is, for example, they say if we don't have a lower rate -- you've heard it -- they'll go off to some other place, and they have one that went to some other place. And you don't deny they went to some other place.MR. McCORMICK: Well, the question is not only legitimacy of the goal, but whether there is a rational relationship and whether the classification involved is reasonably related to any differential treatment.351111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 As in Allegheny Pittsburgh, our complaint here2 is a comparative one. It's the comparative treatment for3 the same activity essentially in the same place because4 we've got racetracks in two of the cities that -- that are5 the cities where two of the three riverboats were in fact,6 and -- and on the same activity, which is what the Iowa7 Supreme Court found when it determined that for8 classification purposes, it saw no difference except that9 one was a facility that was fixed and the other floated.10 And then having -- having made that11 determination of the equal situation, the court looked at12 differential treatment too and said --13 QUESTION: But there was another factor that --14 that was part of it, isn't it? There was a 20 percent15 rate across everything, all the kinds of games that they16 have on the riverboat. So that's nice and17 administratively convenient. You don't want to have one18 rate for the slot machines and another one for blackjack.19 MR. McCORMICK: Yes, Your Honor. And that rate20 was in place in 1994. There wasn't any change in the tax21 paid by riverboats. The legislation imposed for the first22 time, because it authorized for the first time, a tax on23 slot machine usage and activity at the racetracks.24 QUESTION: May -- may I address a -- a slightly25 different argument that you were making, I think you were361111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 making a minute ago? And that is, now -- it had two2 premises.3 Number one, you said our own cases show that a4 -- a conceivable rational basis cannot be relied upon when5 the record indicates that in fact that was not the basis6 for the legislation. So fact limits what is -- what can7 be considered as conceivable.8 Number two, you said a moment ago that the Iowa9 Supreme Court made a determination about the -- the10 purpose of the statute, and -- and at least they11 determined that the purpose of that statute was not to aid12 riverboat 1314 that this15 the promotion of -- of riverboat development or river16 development because the Iowa Supreme Court hasgambling.So I take it your argument is you can't argue differential treatment is rationally related to￼17 definitively determined that that was not the case. Is18 that a fair statement?MR. McCORMICK: That's certainly part of our yes, Your Honor.QUESTION: All right. My -- my question I guess There is no question that the Iowa Supreme Court1920 argument, 2122 is this.23 in the construction of the Iowa constitution can approach24 matters that way. If this Court approaches matters that25 way, then in effect we're going to have two different371111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 methodologies, one for Federal cases, I guess, and -- and2 one for -- for State cases. And we're going to have to3 take every State case subject to fact determinations made4 by the State courts, and that's going to limit the5 application of this conceivable rational basis test.6 Why would it not be wiser for us to say, just to7 keep the systems running smoothly, look, we are not going8 to be bound by State court determinations of legislative9 intent or purpose? The State courts are perfectly free to10 do that under their own constitutions, but when it gets to11 us, we will not accept, for example, the determination in12 a case like this by Iowa that the purpose was not to aid13 riverboat gambling. Why wouldn't that be a sensible way14 for us to -- to go, leaving the State courts to run their15 systems any way they want to?16 MR. McCORMICK: We think, Your Honor, that the17 question of the meaning of State law has always been18 within the domain and prerogative of -- of the State19 courts.20 QUESTION: But this isn't a question of State21 law. It's a question of State fact in applying a Federal22 law, i.e., the -- the rational basis scrutiny under the23 Federal -- the Equal Protection Clause.24 MR. McCORMICK: Yes, Your Honor. I'd invite25 your attention to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company381111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 against Ward, which came out of Alabama, dealt with2 burdensome taxes placed on out-of-state insurers that3 wanted to do business in Alabama. That case, like this4 one, involved a summary judgment proceeding where5 information was put into the State court record. The6 State in that case advanced, as I understand it, something7 like 17 reasons as rational bases for that8 differentiation.9 Now, this Court reviewed two of them because the10 State court held that they were valid justifications under11 that summary judgment record. This Court reversed,12 finding that those justifications were not valid or13 supportable. They were not rational. But this Court did14 not go further than to look at the other proffered15 justifications by the State. The Court sent the case back16 for completion of the summary judgment proceedings.17 And what was being done in that Alabama case is18 exactly what we did in this case by looking at the summary19 judgment record.20 QUESTION: I thought that was -- involved21 interstate discrimination against out-of-state actors.22 MR. McCORMICK: That was the -- that -- that was23 the issue that was being reviewed on equal protection --24 QUESTION: But here you have everybody internal25 in the same -- the same State. So I think that's a391111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 different case.2 MR. McCORMICK: Excuse me, Your Honor?3 QUESTION: Well, you're not discriminating4 against out-of-staters, which is a Federal concern.5 MR. McCORMICK: Yes, Your Honor. I'm not6 talking about the -- the equal protection issue there.7 I'm talking about the manner in which the record was8 determined and the State court was given the prerogative9 of telling this Court what it determined the purposes were10 of the law.11 QUESTION: But if you're -- if you're right12 about how Iowa goes about doing things, then you go back13 and tell the Iowa court, the Supreme Court has this any14 conceivable purpose test. You have what's the real15 purpose test. So now say we'll apply our own State notion16 of what equal protection is and -- and that's the end of17 it.18 MR. McCORMICK: We're going to say that we19 thought the -- this Court would say if the record showed,20 whatever the record was, in this case our summary judgment21 record, that the rational speculation by the Government is22 not supported by the realities of the situation, then that23 the court -- that sort of justification is not plausible.24 We thought that's what this Court's view was.25 We certainly will argue to the Iowa court that401111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 it is within its prerogative initially first to decide2 what the legislative purposes were, as it does in many3 cases and as this Court has in many cases respected when4 it is doing Federal constitutional review where the5 meaning of a State law is a threshold issue. We'll be6 then inviting the Iowa court, if this Court remands the7 case, to reconsider the case under the Iowa constitution.8 QUESTION: Mr. McCormick, why isn't there a9 categorization problem in this case? I mean, there is no10 Iowa law pertaining to slot machines in particular. There11 is a law taxing table games at -- the revenues from that,12 at 20 percent. Right?13 MR. McCORMICK: Yes, Your Honor.14 QUESTION: Why isn't it perfectly reasonable to15 look upon these laws this way: Iowa is taxing a business16 which has nothing but table games at 20 percent on all the17 table games. It is taxing a business which has parimutuel18 betting plus slot machines at 5 percent for the parimutuel19 betting and 34 percent for the slot machines.20 I mean, you certainly wouldn't be complaining if21 they taxed racetracks at a combined rate of 15 percent or22 -- or a combined rate of -- of 30 percent for that. Now23 you -- you would have no complaint. So why does it make24 any difference if they simply, instead of picking one25 percentage, charge 5 percent on the parimutuel and 34411111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 percent on the slot machines? But they're two different2 businesses. One is just table games. The other one is3 horse -- horse racing and slot machines. They're --4 they're different businesses. They're taxed differently.5 MR. McCORMICK: Well, the -- at least the view6 of the Iowa court was that these two enterprises, the7 riverboats and racetracks, are engaged in the same8 business. They are in the same class. And singling one9 of those taxpayers out for differential treatment violates10 equal protection in the view of our court.11 The -- the --12 QUESTION: Your court is entitled to -- to view13 it that way from State law, but they were -- they've said14 that State law mirrors Federal law, and just because they15 choose to look at it that16 look at it that way.17 MR. McCORMICK:18 that's certainly correct.19 But in terms of20 think that the State court was warranted in finding that21 these two taxpayers are in the same class. Parimutuel22 revenues have -- have not, from 1994 -- actually23 immediately preceding that and subsequently, ever been a24 factor in the revenues of racetracks except a negative25 factor.421111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005way, that doesn't mean I have to￼No, Your Honor. That's -- the classification here, we1 The table games -- that's an advantage that the2 riverboats have over racetracks, not a justification for3 differential treatment for putting a heavier tax on the4 same activity at the racetracks.5 QUESTION: It's an odd6 there was no obligation whatever7 slot machines at racetracks, but8 have to be as generous to the racetrack as they were to9 the riverboats. What didn't come in as a discrete item10 came in as part of the whole gambling operation. It is11 strange to say not only -- once you give it to us, you12 have to give us the best deal.13 MR. McCORMICK: We're not -- we're not really14 saying that. We're saying that -- that any differential15 treatment cannot be of the magnitude that exists here and16 be consistent --17 QUESTION: But you'd have no equal protection18 argument at all if they didn't let you have the slot19 machines.20 MR. McCORMICK: That's correct, Your Honor.21 QUESTION: Iowa -- the Iowa court made the22 statement, as I understand it, that the Iowa Equal23 Protection Clause and the national Equal Protection Clause24 had identical requirements at least for the purposes of25 this case.431111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005position when you say for the State to allow if they allow it, they￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. McCORMICK: What they said was that they applied the same analysis as this Court.QUESTION: Okay.Now assume, for the sake of argument, that we don't accept the analysis for purposes of Federal equal protection. Do you understand the Iowa decision to be that there is -- despite that finding on our part or that conclusion on our part, that there is no question that what they said in that opinion does reflect the Iowa Equal Protection Clause and the result that they reached will be and -- and can be found on the basis of this opinion to be the result under the Iowa clause?MR. McCORMICK: Yes, Your Honor. We --QUESTION: So that what we do will make no difference in the -- in the ultimate result in this case.MR. McCORMICK: If the Iowa Supreme Court, if this case were remanded, determines through the use of the same analysis, the same result --QUESTION: Unless they change their rationale, there is no question, as I understand it, on the basis of this opinion what the result will be. Is that correct?MR. McCORMICK: Well, it -- I sure hope so.QUESTION: I mean, you're going to -- yes. I mean, that's what I --QUESTION: They can't blame it on us.441111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: No, that's quite right.QUESTION: I mean, right now they're blaming it on us, and if they want to take the blame themselves -- how -- how are they appointed? Are they appointed or elected?MR. McCORMICK: They're through a Missouri appointed, Your Honor.QUESTION: Missouri Plan appointed.PlanQUESTION: Well, the Supreme Court of Iowain its opinion in this case said that the Iowa Equal Protection Clause and the Federal clause were the same or subject to the same analysis, didn't they?MR. McCORMICK: Yes, Your Honor.QUESTION: And I suppose if we decide that it's wrong on the Federal section, it goes back to the Supreme Court of Iowa, they could just as easily say, well, our -- our State equal protection follows Federal equal protection.

McCORMICK: Well, what they said is the2 scope and the import of the two constitutional provisions3 are the same. Actually part of that -- if one looks at4 the history in Iowa, there's an old case, 1911 case, State5 against Fairmont Creamery. The Iowa court for years in6 interpreting the Iowa equal protection provision never7 made any reference to Federal law. And that case, for the8 first time in 1911, cited a couple of cases from this9 Court and10 decisions1112 that what13 convenience, because of the availability of the precedent14 of this Court, said we use the same analysis. And we --15 we do the same thing in antitrust law. We do the same16 thing in civil rights law, even though we have somesaid our decisions are in harmony with theof the United States Supreme Court.I believe the evolution shows and history shows the court has done since then is for￼differences.17 statutory 1819 different20 certainly21 not only under the Federal Constitution but the State22 constitution.But the court is still free to arrive at a result under that analysis, and in this case the court arrived at the decision that it did23 QUESTION: It would mean they were wrong twice,24 both in their interpretation of Federal law and also in25 their interpretation of Iowa law, right?471111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 MR. McCORMICK: I don't believe so, Your Honor,2 because I think what they have said is that they use the3 same analysis. They don't say the same result is4 foreordained. This -- our court, for example, doesn't5 follow the Lyon case on the issue of the good faith6 exception to the exclusionary rule. The court has been7 independent, treated State grounds as being adequate and8 independent in appropriate cases, even though generally,9 as it said here, it tracks with the Federal cases under10 similar provisions.11 One thing I'd like to mention to you because I12 think it is a little bit of a misinterpretation of reality13 to suggest that these riverboats were created in Iowa to14 -- to sit on our border rivers. The statute involved and15 the implementing regulations will allow a riverboat in16 Iowa on any river in Iowa, on any lake in Iowa, or on any17 reservoir. And -- and there is, in fact, as the record18 shows, a riverboat on a landlocked lake in southern Iowa19 such that for comparison purposes, comparing these20 racetracks, two of which are in river cities, and --21 actually all three of them in river cities, but two of22 them in river cities where there were also riverboats at23 the time of this --24 QUESTION: How do you get the boat to the25 landlocked lake?481111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425(Laughter.)MR.

We believe that this Court in reviewing past State court equal protection decisions and more recently in the -- in the tax area in Williams against Vermont and Hooper against Bernalillo County has -- has respected the -- the determinations that have been made by the State courts as to what legislative intent was, as we ask the Court to do in this case, and in those cases, and applying -- after that threshold determination, applying equal protection analysis, found the statutes under a rational basis analysis did not comport with equal protection. We think this is a case where the record will support this Court in finding that the Iowa Supreme Court got it right and that the State and Solicitor General have it wrong under this491111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 record. 234Thank you.QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. McCormick.Mr. Miller -- General Miller, you have four --MR.
