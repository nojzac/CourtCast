Tollefson.      Mr. Shanmugam.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAMON BEHALF OF PETITIONERMR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you, Mr. ChiefJustice, and may it please the Court:      Under the three strikes provision of thePrison Litigation Reform Act, a prisoner who has threeprior dismissals on prior occasions must pay the fullfiling fee before bringing suit.  While the threestrikes provision specifies what types of dismissalqualify as strikes, it does not expressly specify when adismissal counts as a strike.      The better view is that a dismissal does notcount until it becomes final on appeal.  That view isconsistent both with the text of the three strikesprovision and with the PLRA's underlying purposes.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does that include a petition for cert or is it only the first level appeal?MR. SHANMUGAM: The time for the filing of a petition for cert would count under our view, which is to say that a dismissal would not qualify as a strike3￼￼1 until that time is complete.2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So until there's a3 petition filed and it's denied or until the time expires4 to file the petition.5 MR. SHANMUGAM: That is correct. And that6 is a quite familiar rule, Justice Ginsburg. It is the7 rule that this Court has applied with regard to the8 running of limitations periods for habeas petitions, for9 example, in Clay v. United States.10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure, it is. But if ­­ if11 that were the case, why ­­ why would the statute have to12 refer separately to dismissals for frivolousness by the13 district court or by the court of appeals? You could14 just ­­ it could have just said, if he's had a petition15 dismissed for frivolousness period, and that would mean16 it would have to go all the way up.17 MR. SHANMUGAM: Justice Scalia ­­18 JUSTICE SCALIA: It separately says by the19 district court or by the court of appeals.20 MR. SHANMUGAM: It is certainly true that a21 qualifying dismissal by a court of appeals, like a22 qualifying dismissal by a district court, qualifies as a23 distinct strike. And so, therefore, a prisoner could24 get two strikes in a single case. But we would25 respectfully submit that that really tells us nothing41 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425about the separate question of when those dismissalscount as strikes.JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think on your theory, he wouldn't get two, he'd just get one.MR. SHANMUGAM: No, that is ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: The ­­ the dismissal is simply not final until the court of appeals acts, and that's one dismissal.MR. SHANMUGAM: But there would still be two dismissals. And let me explain how our interpretation works, because I think that this is an important ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: No. I understand what you're saying, but it doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make any sense for Congress to want a finality rule and yet to count it twice.MR. SHANMUGAM: I don't think that there is any inconsistency. And let me explain why that is so. In our view, the critical phrase in the statute is the phrase "prior occasion." And to be sure, an occasion is triggered at the point at which a dismissal is entered. But in our view, the occasion is not complete until the appellate process has run its course.      So in a case in which a district courtenters a qualifying dismissal, that is to say, adismissal on the ground that the action is frivolous or5￼￼1 malicious or fails to state a claim, the occasion is2 complete only when the appellate process runs its3 course. And so, too, when the court of appeals, if it4 enters a qualifying dismissal on those similar grounds,5 a separate occasion is initiated by the dismissal and6 it, too, ends when further review is complete. Now what7 that means ­­8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you say that? Where9 do you get that out of the word "occasion"? I would ­­10 I would think "occasion" means at any time prior,11 whether it's at the court ­­ whether it's at the12 district court or the court of appeals. You ­­ you read13 it. Why can "occasion" only mean what you suggest? Or14 mean what you suggest, period?15 MR. SHANMUGAM: We don't believe that it16 could only mean what we suggest, which is to say that we17 don't think that the text precludes an interpretation18 under which the occasion is coterminous with the act of19 dismissal. We simply don't think that is the only20 possible interpretation of the statutory language.21 For one thing, we think that it is notable22 that the statute does not provide that a mere affirmance23 of a district court dismissal qualifies as a distinct24 strike.25 So, in other words, in a case in which a6￼1 district court dismisses on one of the specified grounds2 and then the court of appeals simply affirms, I think3 everyone would agree that there is only one strike. And4 in our view ­­5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shanmugam, would you6 explain that distinction from the court of appeals7 level? So the district court dismisses for failure to8 state a claim. It goes up to the court of appeals.9 When would the court of appeals simply affirm and when10 would it say "appeal dismissed"?11 MR. SHANMUGAM: So, Justice Ginsburg, when a12 district court dismisses for failure to state a claim, I13 think that the ordinary course would be for a court of14 appeals to affirm. While the statute refers to15 dismissals on the ground that the underlying action is16 frivolous or malicious or fails to state a claim, we17 think that the failure to state a claim ground really18 only properly applies on the district court level.19 To come at it from another direction, the20 circumstances in which courts of appeals dismiss appeals21 rather than affirming are circumstances in which the22 appeal itself is frivolous or malicious. So in a23 circumstance in which a court of appeals merely affirms,24 there is no discrete strike at the court of appeals25 level.725 MR. SHANMUGAM:It is certainly true that￼1 And in our view, to get back to Justice2 Scalia's question, that fact, the fact that a mere3 affirmance does not count separately, in our view,4 strongly suggests that the dismissal and the ensuing5 appeal should be viewed as a single unit. The only6 circumstance in which a court of appeals action counts7 as a distinct strike is when the appeal itself is8 frivolous or malicious ­­9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Shanmugam, I find it as10 one of the appealing points in your argument that you11 have a dismissal for frivolousness at the District Court12 level. It's counted as a third strike, and then that is13 reversed on appeal. So that, you know, turns out it14 shouldn't have been the third strike. And I don't know,15 what do you do in the last case? In the next case he16 has only two strikes. That is a messy situation. How17 often does that situation arise? How often is it that a18 District Court dismisses for frivolousness and is19 reversed by the Court of Appeals? Do you have any idea?20 MR. SHANMUGAM: So, more often than you21 might think, Justice Scalia, and it’s for the simple22 reason ­­23 JUSTICE SCALIA: I hope so, because I don't24 think it happens very often.8￼1 there are not a lot of cases, as the Federal government2 points out, in which a Court of Appeals outright3 reverses. But I think it's important to emphasize, that4 a Court of Appeals can also modify a District Court5 dismissal. And so if, for instance, a Court of Appeals6 concludes that a District Court erred by determining7 that the action was frivolous, or malicious, it is not8 uncommon for a Court of Appeals to say, That9 determination was incorrect, we're going to remand for a10 determination about whether or not there was a failure11 to state a claim. We cite a number of those such cases12 in our reply brief.13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In a case such as14 that, is there anything preventing the Plaintiff from15 getting a stay of the District Court judgment? The16 third strike, seeking a stay of the judgment, and if in17 fact it is because of a failure to state a claim, so has18 more merit than one of the frivolous ones, I suppose the19 Court of Appeals could grant a stay, and the problem20 we're addressing would totally go away.21 MR. SHANMUGAM: So, neither Respondents, nor22 the Federal government suggest that that is a23 permissible solution. We have identified a couple of24 District Court cases where District Courts have entered25 stays. I would respectfully submit that the concept of9￼1 a stay is a little bit counterintuitive in this context.2 Because, I think what a District Court would essentially3 be doing is saying that it isstaying the grounds on which4 it disposes of the case.5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, but that's a6 problem that is always presented when you have to ask a7 District Court to stay its own judgment. But you can8 also ask the Court of Appeals, right?9 MR. SHANMUGAM: Right, but you're not really10 staying the dismissal in that circumstance. What you11 would really be doing is staying the consequences of the12 dismissal.13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, you just stay the14 judgment. Because the judgment ­­ I mean, that's the15 typical reason you ask for a stay is because the16 judgment is going to have some very adverse consequences17 that should be suspended pending appeal.18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. I'm a little19 confused here. There's no judgment to be entered if the20 prisoner can't file because of the third strike. There21 is no complaint to stay, and there's no judgment to22 stay.23 MR. SHANMUGAM: I think, Justice Sotomayor,24 if I'm understanding the Chief Justice correctly, that25 what the Chief Justice is suggesting is that a District1025 JUSTICE SCALIA:It says the dismissal will￼1 Court when it enters the potential third strike it2 somehow enter a stay of the disposition and what I'm3 submitting is a little bit counterintuitive about that,4 is that what the District Court would essentially be5 doing is entering the dismissal because after all, the6 dismissal would need to take effect but at the same time7 saying that in essence the collateral consequences of that8 dismissal are not immediately going to take effect.9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The remedy will be10 stayed in effect, of the third strike.11 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, but the only remedy is12 the disposition of the case and so,13 that is why this idea really hasn't14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:15 that the District Court cannot stay16 the case? Or that a Court of Appeals asked to review it17 or going to be asked to review it can't stay it?18 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, but the only19 consequence of the case here is the actual act of20 entering the dismissal. So this is not a circumstance21 in which, for instance a court affirmatively provides22 relief, whether it's a monetary judgment or injunctive23 relief, and then says that that is not going to take24 effect until the appellate process is complete.11again, I think thatgotten ­­Are you suggestingthe disposition of￼1 not take effect. Why can't it say the dismissal ­­ you2 know, we think you deserve to be dismissed but we’re going3 to enter a stay so you can go up and see if we were right.4 MR. SHANMUGAM: Yeah, again, I don't think5 that there is a lot of precedent for this even in the6 jurisdictions that have adopted respondents or the7 Federal government's interpretation. But let me just8 say one ­­9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I actually don't even10 ­­ I hadn't considered this, because we ­­11 appellate courts have no jurisdiction until there's a12 final judgment. There's no 54(b) ­­ there's no 54(b)13 standard that would be met and there's no anything14 standard that would be met.15 MR. SHANMUGAM: I mean, in essence what you16 have to do is to prevent the very judgment from becoming17 a judgment, because of course at the moment ­­18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, isn't19 that what stays do? They suspend the effectiveness of20 the judgment and by doing so you stay any collateral21 consequences of it?22 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, what they tend23 to do, Mr. Chief Justice, I think, is to really stay the24 relief that is being provided until the appellate25 process runs its course.12￼1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:2 that case. The problem here is the next case, if there3 is one.4 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, that is correct. And to 5   get back to Justice Scalia's question, because I just want 6   to make sure that all of the consequences of the various 7   interpretations are on the table.  I think that there 8   are actually two sets of pernicious consequences here. 9   The first is the one that you10   identified here, which I think is a problem both with11   respondent's and the Federal government's12   interpretation, which is what to do in a circumstance in13   which a prisoner is effectively barred as a result of an14   erroneous third strike, a third strike that is reversed or15 modified.16 I think with respondent's17   interpretation, there is a much more fundamental18   anomaly, which is this anomaly of precluding appeals of19 dismissals that count as the third strike. And so again we 20 are not arguing today ­­21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought in this case22 there was no such preclusion. I thought that the Court of23   Appeals said, yeah, we'll take the appeal on the strike.24   So that's ­­ that's ­­ you can't urge that issue because25   you prevailed on it.13The problem here is not￼1 MR. SHANMUGAM: But that is a problem,2 Justice Ginsburg, that I think inheres in the3 interpretative question that is before the Court. It is4 certainly true that petitioner is not in that position.5 In other words, we're not here trying to get the right6 to appeal from the third strike dismissal. But I do7 think that it is a problem that has to be dealt with in8 construing the statutory provision and it’s a problem that9 has been recognized by every court.10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it has to be dealt11 with under anybody's interpretation. Once you admitted,12 which you must, that in one case there can be two13 strikes, then if there's a second case, a third case, or14 no, a second case, but a third strike at the District15 Court level, you still have to face the question of16 whether there's a right to appeal ­­17 MR. SHANMUGAM: But, Justice Sotomayor,18 under our interpretation, all of these anomalies are19 dealt with for the simple reason that you wait until the20 end of the appellate process and even those courts, those21 two Courts of Appeals that have gone the other way on22 this issue have recognized this anomaly. It's really23 only respondents who think that this anomaly is no big24 deal.2514Now, there have been various solutions￼1 devised to this problem. The Sixth Circuit, the Seventh2 Circuit and Federal government have all come up with3 different interpretations of the relevant statutory4 language in order to address the problem.5 I want to specifically address the Federal6 government's proposed interpretation, because no one7 before this Court is defending the exact reasoning of8 either the Sixth Circuit or the Seventh Circuit. The9 Federal government argues that the phrase "prior10 occasion" should be construed to mean a prior dismissal11 in a different case. Now, that certainly addresses this12 anomaly, but we simply don't think that you can get that13 interpretation out of the phrase "prior occasion." And14 so while there may be textual ambiguity here,15 and I would certainly acknowledge as I did to16 Justice Scalia that the text of the statute does not17 unambiguously preclude respondent's interpretation, we18 do believe that it unambiguously precludes the Federal19 government’s interpretation.20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you saying the21 government is being illogical or inconsistent, because22 if strike number 3 is a District Court ruling, the23 government says, well, there's no bar to your appealing24 that. There's just a bar for filing a new District25 Court suit, and you would say that that's just illogical.15￼1 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we think that that is2 something that Congress could logically have done. We3 simply don't think there is any footing in the statutory4 language for that distinction.5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If prior occasion means6 what it means, then there's only two strikes anyway7 because there was or two prior cases or two prior ­­8 MR. SHANMUGAM: Under our interpretation,9 that is certainly true and, of course, it bears10 emphasizing that this is the interpretation of the11 overwhelming majority of lower courts who have considered12 the issue.13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:14 those courts count the time15 cert?16 MR. SHANMUGAM:17 all of the Court of Appeals18 dealt with that issue simply because the cases haven't19 quite been postured in that position. We think that20 that rule makes sense because that is the ordinary rule21 that is applied for instance when this Court is22 construing statutes that expressly require finality on23 appeal, and that's the Clay versus United States case24 that I referenced earlier.25 Of course that time is not likely to be all16    By the way, how many ofor rely on the time forYou know, I'm not sure thatopinions have expressly￼ 1   that extensive particularly in cases in which the 2   petitions plainly lack merit the time to resolution of 3   petitions of that variety is typically relatively short. 4   But my point here is simply that under our 5   interpretation, there really have been no identified 6   problems with administrability and after all ­­7 JUSTICE BREYER: Why not? I mean, what they 8   argue is if we take your interpretation, it has to be final 9   to become a strike, all that takes time, and if you have10   a really real frequent filer during that year, perhaps11   you will file 38 more cases or maybe a hundred and there12   will be no way to stop him really.  You'll have to pay13   for the ­­ you know, I mean, you see the problem.14 On the other hand, the evil that you're15   worried about, which is that there is a reversal of a16   strike on appeal, has happened precisely zero times.17   Ever.  So this sort of undermines the statute.  There's18   not a real need for it, your interpretation, and if19   there were by the way and it were reversed, he could20 proceed under Rule 60(b)5. So that's basically their21 argument. I would like to hear your answer.22 MR. SHANMUGAM: Sure. Well, Justice Breyer, 23 let me start with the problem that we are addressing24 here. And I would note that it's the two­fold problem. 25 Again, it's the problem of prisoners who are barred as a1725 JUSTICE SCALIA:Now, wait.  Wait, wait,￼1 result of erroneous third strike dismissals, and there2 are such cases. It's not a null set. Even the Federal3 government acknowledges that there are at least two4 reported cases in which that has occurred. And again,5 we point out that there are cases in which there have6 been modifications, and those modifications would also7 be cases where someone under the interpretations on the8 other side would go from having three strikes to two9 strikes.10 But let me address the perceived vices with11 our position as well. I think really the only vice that12 has been identified is this supposed floodgates problem13 that's going to ensue under our interpretation where a14 prisoner, on the eve of a third strike, is suddenly15 going to come in with a flurry of lawsuits. I would16 note at the outset, that that is a potential problem17 really with any interpretation.18 In other words, once you set the rules for19 what constitute three strikes a prisoner ­­ when the20 prisoner has two strikes, will have an incentive to come21 in with a number of different lawsuits. So I don't think22 that that problem really disappears under any23 interpretation. But again, that's not a problem that24 seems to have been borne out.18￼1 wait, wait, wait. I mean, what's distinctive about2 yours is you have to wait for the period of the appeal.3 You have to ­­ and, you know, that could take a long4 time. And you talk about floodgates. The reason this5 statute exists is because of floodgates, because these6 prisoners file one ­­ one frivolous appeal after7 another.8 MR. SHANMUGAM: Two points in response to9 that, Justice Scalia.10 First of all, even under Respondent's11 interpretation, where a prisoner has two strikes, a12 prisoner could come in with a flurry of lawsuits, and it13 seems to be undisputed that you assess whether or not a14 prisoner has three strikes at the point at which the15 prisoner submits the complaint. And so a prisoner could16 bring a flurry of lawsuits even under that17 interpretation.18 But second, and more importantly, I think19 there's a reason why this problem hasn't borne out in20 practice, and that is simply by virtue of the other21 provisions of the PLRA. Even a prisoner who is not22 subject to the three strikes provision still has to pay23 the filing fee, albeit in installments, and that filing24 fee, of course, is substantial. It's now $400 in the25 district courts. It's now $505 in the courts of19￼1 appeals.2 JUSTICE GINSBURG:3 this case just a casebook example of what the danger is?4 Because this Petitioner, as I understand it, filed not5 only the petition that's before us, but three more. In6 what span of time?7 MR. SHANMUGAM: Over the span of about a8 year and a half. But I would note that it took my9 client, who has been in prison in Michigan since 1983,10 25 years to get to three strikes even under Respondent's11 interpretation. So I think that this effort to ­­ to12 create the impression ­­13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but he's making up14 for lost time.15 (Laughter.)16 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, he did file four17 lawsuits. And as a result, he does have to pay the18 filing fee in installments for each lawsuit, and that's19 20 percent of his income. And in addition, district20 courts are not somehow left without tools in the event21 that those subsequent lawsuits are meritless.22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But ­­ but I don't ­­ I23 don't think that your earlier point that when he has two24 strikes he can file a flurry of suits is relevant.25 That's ­­ that's the grace period that the government20Mr. Shanmugam, why isn't￼1 has given him. The government has granted that with2 only two strikes, you can proceed. But now we have3 three, and that's quite different.4 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, and of course, that is5 the question. And the question really is whether6 Congress, in imposing this sanction, which is a7 considerable one in which of course applies to8 meritorious and meritless claims alike, whether Congress9 would have wanted to attach that consequence before10 ensuring that a prisoner, in fact, had three valid11 dismissals for pursuing meritless claims.12 And, of course, we have a statute here that13 does not specifically address that issue, and there are14 plenty of statutes that address that issue in both15 directions. And we also have no legislative history for16 those members of the Court who are interested in17 legislative history that speaks to this issue.18 And so the real question we would submit is19 that if the Court agrees with us that the language of20 the statute is at least ambiguous, which interpretation21 avoids anomalous consequences and leads to a rule that22 is easy for lower courts to administer?23 The great virtue of our interpretation is24 that once a prisoner has three strikes, the prisoner25 always has three strikes. You don't have this specter21￼1 of the possibility that a prisoner could go from having2 three strikes one day to having two strikes or fewer the3 next.4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you know if any of5 those courts, the majority of the courts except for two,6 have opted for addressing things your way? And ­­ and7 I have a slight leaning towards letting the majority of8 circuit courts figure out administrative ­­ the ease of9 administrative rules. How many of them thought of it as10 just being easier to do?11 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think that when you12 look at the court of appeals' opinions that have gone13 our way, a number of them have recognized that the text14 is ambiguous. So they have not just been, as Respondents15 and the Federal government suggest, somehow disregarding16 the language of the statute.17 The Fourth Circuit in the Henslee case18 specifically relied on the phrase "prior occasion" and19 said that, "The phrase prior occasion may refer to a20 single moment or to a continuing event to an appeal21 independent of the underlying action, or to the22 continuing claim, inclusive both of the action and of23 its appeal." And that's, of course, precisely the24 argument we're making today.25 But with regard to administrability, I just22￼1 want to be clear about how this works, because this is2 obviously a very important practical issue for district3 courts.4 Under our interpretation, all that a5 district court, or for that matter a court of appeals,6 need do is to look to see whether in a prior case there7 has been a determination that a prisoner has three8 strikes. If, in fact, that is so, that is the end of9 the analysis. And indeed, our understanding is that in10 many jurisdictions, the district court clerk's offices11 actually keep lists of people who have been subject to12 the three strikes prohibition.13 There's a decision from the Western District14 of Louisiana that refers to the keeper of the three15 strikes list, and our understanding is that that is16 actually a fairly common practice. And, of course,17 where a prisoner has not previously been subject to the18 three strikes provision, it will be relatively easy, and19 it's a familiar task for a district court to make the20 determination whether a prisoner's prior dismissals are21 final on appeal.22 Under Respondent's and the Federal23 government's interpretations by contrast, there is no24 such ease of application because a court will not be25 able to be sure that a prisoner, in fact, has three23￼1 strikes even if the prisoner has previously been barred.2 And under either of the interpretations on the other3 side, you will have to figure out what to do in a4 situation in which a third strike dismissal has been5 reversed or even modified.6 Now, the Federal government ­­7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Again ­­ again, that's a8 big problem depending upon how frequent that is. If9 it's once in a blue moon, you know, it's no big deal.10 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, everyone before this11 Court agrees that we're not exactly dealing with a large12 set of cases to begin with. And the question presented13 in this case is not going to affect a large number of14 cases in the aggregate. Though I would note that the15 issue has arisen in virtually every single one of the16 courts of appeals.17 My point is simply that you're dealing with18 a somewhat larger number of cases than the Federal19 government would suggest. When the Federal government20 says look, we've only been able to identify two cases21 where there have been outright reversals. And to the22 extent that the Federal government in its brief points23 to the reversal rate in civil actions by prisoners, the24 Federal government accurately represents that that rate25 is about 4 percent. I think it's important to emphasize241 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the fact that the overall reversal rate in the Federalcourts of appeals is only 7 percent.  And so it isn't asif the prisoner rate is, you know, somehow orders ofmagnitude lower.  And of course ­­JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I would think that the ­­ I would think the situation that we should be concerned about is the situation in which the dismissal, which is initially counted as the third strike, ultimatelyresults in some relief for the prisoner. And I don'tknow that there's even one of those.MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, but, of course, under the statute, the dismissal no longer qualifies even if the prisoner doesn't obtain relief. And I think everyone agrees that if there is either a reversal or vacatur of the dismissal or a modification to eliminate the grounds specified in the statute, that the dismissal no longer has any effect. And those cases, I would respectfully submit, are somewhat more common than my friends on the other side would have you believe.      And I would like to reserve the balance ofmy time for rebuttal.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.      Mr. Lindstrom.    ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. AARON D. LINDSTROM       ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS25￼25 MR. LINDSTROM:No, Justice Kagan, we think￼1 MR. LINDSTROM: Mr. Chief Justice, and may2 it please the Court:3 The plain language of Section 1915(g)4 identifies when a strike occurs. It occurs when an5 action or appeal was dismissed. The phrase "action was6 dismissed" has an everyday meaning and the ordinary7 meaning of "action was dismissed" does not. Action was8 dismissed and affirmed.9 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Lindstrom, I ­­ I10 understand that argument, and it seems to me a very11 natural reading of the statute. But the ­­ I'm troubled12 by the scenario where it's dismissed and then it's13 reversed, not for these practical reasons that people14 have been talking about. But it seems to me that if you15 were really reading the statute that way, that that16 would count as a strike, too, and that that strike would17 not go away even when it was reversed.18 And so I'm wondering whether the statute is19 actually a little bit more ambiguous than ­­ than you20 are suggesting, because at the very least, I mean,21 everybody agrees that you have to make an exception for22 that case, and it seems to me that on your reading of23 the statute, that case would be included. A strike24 would be a strike even if it's reversed.26￼1 the ordinary rules that apply to judgments apply. When2 Congress passed this statute, they weren't trying to3 change the ordinary rules of how judgments are applied.4 The ordinary rules in district court judgments matter5 until they're reversed. That's the ordinary rule in the6 res judicata context and in every other context.7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, but that's something ­­8 you're now appealing to some default principle that9 exists outside of the statutory text. I can't find any10 basis in the statutory text for that result.11 I mean, it's ­­ there have been three or12 more prior occasions in which either an action or an13 appeal has been dismissed. Now, one of those dismissals14 was later reversed, but it was dismissed. And so on15 your reading, we ­­ we really, you know, it's ­­ it's ­­16 your reading is kind of ­­ this is the natural reading,17 but we're not going to ­­ we're not going to apply the18 natural reading in a case where it obviously doesn't19 fit.20 MR. LINDSTROM: I think we're assuming that21 Congress is drafting against the ordinary background22 rules, and there's an ordinary meaning of what's23 dismissed, and that's what my colleague is changing ­­24 is challenging.25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:27The problem with the￼1 ordinary rule is that it really doesn't apply completely2 until the next case. It applies in that case, but it3 doesn't apply in the next case.4 MR. LINDSTROM: If you mean it doesn't5 apply, I guess I'm not sure what you're saying.6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Meaning let's talk about7 res judicata or collateral estoppel. If it's res8 judicata, it's the two parties. So that ­­ that's that9 case, essentially.10 MR. LINDSTROM: Yes, Your Honor.11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If it's collateral12 estoppel, it could be until a third party. But I think13 that that third party would be entitled to a stay of his14 or her action pending the adjudication of the main15 action.16 MR. LINDSTROM: But we do17 did want to cut off IFP status in the18 least some instances. If you look at19 Section 1915(a)(3), that specifically20 appeal may not be taken in forma pauperis status if the21 trial court certifies in writing that it was not taken22 in good faith. That's not ­­ that's setting aside the23 three strikes rule entirely. That could happen in any24 given case. And that shows that Congress specifically25 wanted to cut off IFP status on appeal in at least some28know that Congresssame case in atsays that an￼1 cases.2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:3 there's still a right to ask the court of appeals for a4 COA, and so there is an appellate process of sorts.5 MR. LINDSTROM: There ­­ there would be, and6 that's correct. But in terms of what the background7 rules are, I think the ordinary rule of the background8 interpretation would be you start with the plain9 language. Congress expects you to look at the word "was10 dismissed," figure out what that means.11 They would also expect you to apply the12 ordinary rules that apply to judgments, and the ordinary13 rule is that district court judgments matter. They have14 a legal effect immediately. You can see this from15 trivial matters, like when interest starts to accrue,16 and also through very significant matters, such as a17 criminal conviction. If somebody is a convicted of a18 criminal ­­ of a crime in Federal court, they get to go19 to jail, even though they're pending in ­­20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right. Answer ­­ answer21 Judge ­­ Judge Easterbrook's point, that there is no way22 to revive a subsequently filed case that was dismissed23 because of a third strike. Judge Easterbrook, and I24 think there's some force to his logic, says with this ­­25 this three­strike situation, when the next case comes to29Except that the ­­￼1 the court of ­­ to a district court, district court2 never files the complaint. There was nothing dismissed3 that can be revived. There was no judgment entered.4 MR. LINDSTROM: That wouldn't have barred any5 of the four lawsuits that Mr. Coleman could have brought6 in this case, because he could have brought all four of7 his lawsuits in State court. He could have filed each8 one of these in State court. So there is recourse,9 interpreting the statute according to the plain10 language.11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But ­­ but there's no12 remedy for the fact that subsequent lawsuits that13 were ­­ that were filed based on the erroneous third14 strike would have been turned back without the filing of15 a complaint.16 MR. LINDSTROM: In other words, it was never17 filed, so there was nothing to relate back, at which18 point ­­19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And nothing ­­ or to20 file a 60(b).21 MR. LINDSTROM: But, again, it ­­ there's an22 easy way for a prisoner to get around that, and the23 prisoner could have done that by ­­ once he's got three24 strikes and the last one is on appeal, he has to make25 the decision: Should I file my next four cases that I'm30￼1 going to file ­­ should I file them in Federal court, or2 should I file them in State court? And this statute is3 saying you shouldn't file them in Federal court.4 I think ­­ I'm not sure if I fully answered5 your point about reversal, but I think that's the6 ordinary background rule. Again, even though a prisoner7 would be convicted, they still go to jail even though8 there's the possibility that a reversal might happen. And9 the ordinary rule is that a reversal is something that10 is if it had never occurred.11 You can see that in the ­­ as some examples12 cited in the Federal government's brief about13 sentencing, if you have a conviction that is then14 reversed, it can no longer be used to enhance a later15 conviction. There's double jeopardy context, where if a16 conviction is reversed, then it's as if it never17 happened, which is why in Ball v. United States, this18 Court said you can retry the person.19 So the plain language, both in the "was20 dismissed" language and the action or appeal, they21 show that Congress is talking about the filing fees,22 that the context of this statute, I think, is really23 helpful. It's about filing fees.24 When you enter the district court, you have25 to pay a filing fee to file a complaint. And then on311 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425appeal, you have to pay a filing fee so you can fileyour notice of appeal.      So what Congress is doing is saying, theseare the two events we're talking about, and if you havebrought an action that was dismissed or brought anappeal that was dismissed, that lines up with these twostages of litigation.  It was trying to separate themout and treat them differently because Congress wastrying to deter not just frivolous actions, but alsofrivolous appeals.  It includes language, "action orappeal," in the statute.MR. LINDSTROM:Yes, I think they could file￼      JUSTICE BREYER:an appeal?     MR. LINDSTROM:costs $505.     JUSTICE BREYER:     MR. LINDSTROM:courts it's less.  So you'd have are that option, andyou also have the IFP status option in State courts aswell.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Sort of an interesting question, basically admitting that in terms of your time, the suits would still remain because they could file in State court?32 What does it cost to fileIn the Federal courts, it Sorry?$505, Your Honor.  In State25 MR. LINDSTROM:We don't think it does.  I￼1 in State court. That's what the plain language of the2 statute, it doesn't say anything about ­­ to preclude3 State court. And there's other outlets as well that4 would ­­5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do states have similar6 rules?7 MR. LINDSTROM: States do have similar8 rules. And Mr. Coleman has not run afoul, as far as9 we can tell and as far as he has reported in the10 complaints that he filed, which are all in the joint11 appendix. He hasn't filed anything in State court. So12 this would not have precluded him from filing all four13 of his lawsuits in this verycase.14 JUSTICE KAGAN: You know, I guess what15 I'm not quite sure about in your answer to my question,16 Mr. Lindstrom, is, if I understand you right, and tell17 me if I don't, you're basically saying that we look to18 these background principles and we decide that a strike19 doesn't happen if something is reversed on appeal, so a20 strike is kind of dependent on what happens on appeal.21 But when you say that, aren't you kind of giving up your22 best argument? I mean, aren't you then admitting that23 the notion of a strike encompasses what happens on24 appeal and encompasses finality on appeal?33￼1 think Congress is looking at the filing fee stages. It2 was looking at the fact that you're going to file a fee3 at the district court level and at the appellate court4 level. So the statute clearly draws a distinction5 between the two and wants them to be treated separately6 so that if you get the IFP status in the district court,7 that's one thing.8 Getting IFP status in the Federal court is9 another thing because what's going on here is Congress10 is granting a subsidy to prisoners to allow them to11 pursue further litigation, and Congress simply drew a12 line in the statute saying, We'll subsidize a certain13 number of these ­­ of IFP appeals and actions before we14 cut it off.15 There's other statutes that also show that16 if Congress wants to delay the legal effect of a17 district court judgment, it knows how to do it.18 Section 2244 which we cite in brief good example of19 this. It was passed by the same Congress that was20 considering the Prison Litigation Reform Act. It was21 considering it at about the same time throughout the22 1995­1996 time period. Congress was voting on both23 parts. And in Section 2244, it said something doesn't24 count, doesn't have a legal effect with respect to a25 statute of limitations until it's final by the34￼1 conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the2 time preceding such review.3 So the exact same Congress threw out the4 words that was dismissed, knew how to write a different5 rule and didn't do it here. And that's very telling,6 especially given how they were enacted within two days7 of each other.8 So this Court itself has stopped in forma9 pauperis status appeals, so some of the concerns that10 are being raised are the fact that district court11 decisions could be ossified errors. They could be12 depriving people of meritorious claims. But that13 concern would be worse with respect to petitions that14 are filed in this Court because if this Court cuts15 somebody off and says you can't16 file any more petitions, as it does under17 the Martin case. Then after that, there's a much18 greater case of ossification because those decisions may19 be precedential.20 So I think that our reading is consistent21 with what Congress is trying to do, which is to look at22 the great bulk of the cases and say 95, 96, some high23 percentage of cases, those are going to be cases where24 the original strike was affirmed, and so it's a very25 remote possibility. If the language were completely3523 24 25know how you would get around it.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under your position, Isuppose we don't have to ask about certiorari, pending36￼ 1   ambiguous, then you would still have to figure out which 2   one is closest to Congress' intent, and Congress' intent 3   would be to address the 95­plus percentage of cases, rather 4   than the case where my colleague admits there are not a 5   lot of them and hasn't really cited very many of them.6 JUSTICE ALITO: This is a question I 7   probably should have asked petitioner, but what do you 8   understand his ­­ what do you understand him to mean 9   when he says it has to be final on appeal?10 Suppose that there is an appeal pending in11   one of the prior strike cases, but it's perfectly clear12   that the notice of appeal in that instance was filed13   woefully out of time.  Would that be final on appeal?14151617   when the court would look at it.  So if it was filed18   late, the expectation would be if it's filed out of19   time, because you're looking at the time period for20   review, that time period has passed and it's final, I21   guess subject to reopening if there's a way to getMR. LINDSTROM: I think it would ­­ I assume his answer would be to look at, once the notice of ­­ I think he would say the end of the expiration of time is22   around that.  It would be jurisdictional.  So I don't￼1 whether or not that ­­2 MR. LINDSTROM: Yes, Your Honor.3 JUSTICE KENNEDY:4 the petitioner's problem, not5 MR. LINDSTROM: I6 don't think I need to address7 JUSTICE BREYER: What do you think about the8 government's argument about the third? You imagine he9 has ­­ the prisoner has filed one, dismissed as10 frivolous; appeal, the dismissal affirmed. That's one.11 Now he does it again. That's two. And he does it a12 third time. District court dismissed. And he says, I13 want to appeal that, and I don't want to pay the $500,14 505. And the government has to say ­­ could say, sorry,15 you have to pay the 505. That's the third, because he's16 a separate. Then he says, but it says, "on a prior17 occasion," and this is the same occasion. And therefore18 he doesn't have to pay the 500. What's your view of19 that?20 MR. LINDSTROM: I think that that reading21 takes the word "prior" and changes it from meaning22 "before" to meaning "before or after in a separately23 filed suit." So I think it's going too far with what24 the word "prior" could possibly mean.25 That "occasions" ­­ I mean, the whole point37You can say that that'syours.think that's right.  Ithat.25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:It seems to me you could￼1 of the statute is to identify what occasions are going2 to give rise to a strike. And those occasions are when3 an action was dismissed, which is a district court4 event, or when the appeal was dismissed.5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to6 me the government does give away too much in that7 position. The only question is whether that undercuts8 this whole argument. It gives a little bonus for the9 appeal of the ­­ if strike number three is the district10 court, the government doesn't count the appeal, as I11 understand it. It counts ­­ obviously it counts in a12 later district court suit, but not here.13 MR. LINDSTROM: Yes, Your Honor. And I14 should be quick to point out that they agree with our15 interpretation of the facts of this case, where he had16 three strikes and then he filed ­­ it's about the17 subsequent actions.18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why use the word19 "occasion" at all? Meaning: What meaning do you give20 to that word? Why didn't they just say "three21 dismissals"?22 MR. LINDSTROM: I think the statute ­­ I23 think "occasions" is just kind of a way of framing the24 long clause that follows after it.38￼1 have just said, if a prisoner has three dismissals,2 then ­­ three prior dismissals; not three prior3 occasions, three prior dismissals ­­ he can't get IFP4 thereafter.5 MR. LINDSTROM: I don't think that would6 change the outcome in this case, because that language7 still would remain. His action was dismissed ­­ or8 appeal. It was dismissed. So the language that draws a9 distinction between the court of ­­ the district court10 level and the appellate court level would still be11 there. I mean, "occasions" is just identifying those12 two, what those two occasions are.13 JUSTICE ALITO: What about the fact that14 this provision refers to a prior occasion on which an15 action was dismissed? If you put "prior" and "action"16 together, isn't there the suggestion that you’re talking17 about an action that is different from the action that18 is before the court of appeals in what is arguably the19 third strike?20 MR. LINDSTROM: That word would also carry21 through to prior appeal, apparently. I think the "prior22 occasions" is simply talking about the fact that it is23 an action that happened before. I don't think that that24 word would have to modify both. It doesn't make sense25 that it would modify "prior appeal" as well in a way that391 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425is distinguished from the appeal in this case.  In bothevents you'd be talking about anything that goes beforeit.      If there are no further questions, I willyield the time to my colleague from the federalgovernment.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kedem.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLON KEDEM  ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,SUPPORTING RESPONDENTSMR. KEDEM: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      If I could start with the issue of finalityand the normal background principles, the argument thatpetitioner makes, and this is echoed by the argumentthat he makes in pages 9 to 10 of his reply brief, isthat sometimes Congress specifies that finality isrequired and sometimes it specifies that finality is notrequired, and so we can draw no negative inference fromthe fact that Congress was silent here.      But if you look at the example of thestatute in which Congress specified non­finality that hegives, it's actually not a statute at all.  It's aFederal rule of evidence.  Moreover, petitioner40￼￼1 identifies no instance in which Congress has a statute2 in which it is silent about whether or not you require3 finality, like subsection G, and yet finality was4 implicitly read to be required; in other words, no5 instance in which a finality requirement was inferred6 rather than expressed. And even if you think that7 sometimes finality might be able to be inferred,8 Section 1915 is an especially bad candidate, because it9 distinguishes so repeatedly and so sharply between the10 trial and appellate stages.11 And that brings me to petitioner's single12 occasion theory, articulated most clearly in pages 18 to13 19 of his opening brief. It's the idea that a trial14 court dismissal plus the appeal from that dismissal15 constitute a single ongoing occasion. And if Congress16 had that in mind, presumably it would have used some17 sort of process­oriented language.18 JUSTICE GINSBURG:19 of appeals held here?20 MR. KEDEM:21 JUSTICE GINSBURG:22 you do get the appeal from the third strike.23 MR. KEDEM: Yes, the court of appeals said,24 we believe incorrectly, that the appeal from the third25 strike is the same occasion.41Isn't that what the courtPardon?       The court of appeals said￼1 JUSTICE GINSBURG:2 You ­­ I thought that this appeal is about the fourth3 case, and that you haven't ­­ you haven't contested the4 court of appeals' holding that you do get an appeal from5 the third strike.6 MR. KEDEM: We don't believe that's directly7 at issue and we can talk about it if the Justices are8 interested in that. But the question as to how to read9 "occasion" and whether it encompasses just the trial or10 the appellate stage, or both of them at the same time,11 is very much at issue in this case. And we believe that12 you could end up with overlapping occasions, not only13 the trial court dismissal, but on appeal, also a14 separate appellate dismissal, which, as Petitioner15 concedes, is an occasion in its own right.16 JUSTICE BREYER: But that's ­­ that's the ­­17 why I asked the question on page 25 of your brief; you18 say the bar goes into effect if the prisoners received19 strikes on three or more prior occasions.20 Now you say a prior occasion is not the21 district court dismissal in this third case. That's not22 a prior occasion. But when you look at the earlier two23 strikes, you don't consider it as a whole. So we24 consider this one as a whole, but we don't consider the25 others as a whole. That's why I asked the question.42But is that before us?￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. KEDEM: The question, Justice Breyer, is whether the prior occasions that might prevent you from appealing a civil action includes that very action, the one you're trying to appeal.JUSTICE BREYER: No, it doesn't ­­ yes, it does. Because the dismissal of ­­ by the district court of this lawsuit after it's done is a prior occasion.The present occasion isthe court of appeals.      MR. KEDEM:to consider the posturethat choice.      JUSTICE BREYER:policy or anything.  I'm just saying it's hard for me tosee how you can say the one and not the other.MR. KEDEM: Because at the time that you're making the decision, a new occasion hasn't started. You have to decide whether the prisoner is allowed to file the IFP appeal.JUSTICE BREYER: Good. And when we're in the second one, when you file the appeal from the first one, the new occasion hadn't started. So we're still in the middle of the occasion.MR. KEDEM: No. Justice Breyer, the prior occasion has concluded. It concluded with the issuance43your appeal of that dismissal toJustice Breyer, it's importantyou're in when you're makingI'm not saying it's goodJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:That's what my question￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425of the judgment of dismissal.  Let me provide an analogythat, hopefully, can articulate our position.      Imagine that a school had a policy that saidin no event shall a student retake a test if on three ormore prior occasions that student had taken and failed atest.  Now, I suppose you could read that policy to saythat the very test you want to retake is a prioroccasion that might prevent you from retaking it.JUSTICE BREYER: I'm going to fail this test because ­­(Laughter.)MR. KEDEM: We don't think that's the natural reading. And moreover, in order to give independent content to the word "prior," it can't simply mean before the very decision when you're making the IFP determination. Because, of course, you're only taking a count of strikes that are prior in that sense. You're not going to take a count of strikes that haven't yet happened.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Was it your brief that said there were very few cases ­­ you found only two published cases?MR. KEDEM: Only two cases, and that includes cases that are not published.44￼1 was, okay.2 MR. KEDEM: And, of course, it's important3 to emphasize, we're not just talking about the problem4 of a third strike reversal. In order for Petitioner's5 concerns to come about, you need a ­­ a prisoner who6 wants to file a fourth suit, one that doesn't qualify7 for the imminent danger exception and there has to be8 some risk of the statute of limitations running in that9 fourth suit while the third one is on appeal.10 Presumably, that's going to be11 extraordinarily rare, if it ever happens. And even if12 it does, we believe in that instance, Rule 60(b)(5)13 would allow you appropriate relief.14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then answer Judge15 Easterbook's point, which is, when the fourth case comes16 in, the court is just not granting IFP. It's not17 dismissing the case, it's just not filing it at all.18 It's just saying to you, I won't commence the19 litigation, I won't accept it without you paying IFP.20 MR. KEDEM: Well, what usually happens is21 what happened in this very case; namely, that the court22 says, I'm not granting you IFP status and I'm going to23 dismiss your case if you don't pay the filing fee. And24 so you could file Rule 60(b)(5) motion to have that25 reopened. Because Rule 60(b)(5) applies whenever a45￼1 litigant seeks to reopen a case that was dismissed on2 the ­­ or where the case was based on a prior judgment3 that was reversed or vacated, which4 here.5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:6 have to file ­­ pay a filing fee to7 motion? Is that a separate proceeding?8 MR. KEDEM: My understanding is that there's9 a circuit split as to whether if you're denied IFP10 status, you nevertheless are still on the hook for the11 filing fee.12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that would13 really make your position complicated.14 MR. KEDEM: Your Honor, I think if you are a15 prisoner who's three strikes barred and you still want16 to file a fourth suit, there might be some consequence;17 namely, that you might be on the hook if that third18 strike is ultimately affirmed, as most third strikes19 are.20 I'd like to address also the point that21 Petitioner makes that his position is much more easily22 administered. Because I actually think the inquiry is23 basically the same on either approach. It's true that24 if you only know that the prisoner is three strikes25 barred, then you can rely on that under Petitioner's46would seem to applyDo you ­­ do yougo with a 60(b)￼1 approach.2 But that's not normally what happens. What3 normally happens is what happened in this very case.4 Namely, the trial court lists the prior dismissals, plus5 what it knows about what happened to those dismissals on6 appeal, and it makes an IFP determination.7 And under either approach, the inquiry is as8 follows: For any appellate dismissal or a trial court9 dismissal that was affirmed on appeal, you can always10 rely on that going forward. And for any trial court11 dismissal where you don't know what happened on appeal,12 you simply have to check the appellate docket, something13 that, as Petitioner points out, courts are already very14 familiar with. So under either approach, essentially15 the inquiry is entirely the same.16 And finally, Your Honor, if you are simply17 not convinced by the textual arguments and you just want18 to know what makes practical sense, you should go with19 the approach that works in the vast majority of cases.20 And in the vast majority of cases, what happens is what21 happened in this very case. You have a third strike22 that was ultimately affirmed on appeal.23 Under Petitioner's approach, notwithstanding24 that affirmance, even though the Sixth Circuit said that25 strike was properly administered, he would nevertheless47￼1 be permitted to proceed IFP in those four additional2 suits that he filed. Under our approach, he would not,3 because the third ­­ he would not because he was three4 strikes barred. But if the third strike had been5 reversed rather than affirmed, he could have gone back6 to the trial court and asked for relief under Rule7 60(b)(5).8 JUSTICE KAGAN: And just to be clear,9 Mr. Kedem, if we say, you know, we're not buying this10 prior occasion thing, does your ­­ does the rest of your11 position stay your position?12 MR. KEDEM: It does. I think you would end13 up with Respondent's position. But one additional point14 on prior occasions. Although Petitioner disagrees with15 our reading of the phrase "prior occasions," he does16 agree with us that if Congress meant "prior occasions"17 to include an appeal ­­ to applying the situation from18 an appeal of a third strike, it would have said so19 explicitly. So if you simply go with that background20 understanding, you would still end up with our position.21 Thank you.22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.23 Mr. Shanmugam, you have four minutes left.24 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM25 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER48￼1 MR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you, Mr. Chief2 Justice:3 Justice Kennedy asked Mr. Lindstrom whether4 the inconsistency between Respondent's position and the5 Federal government's position undercuts the whole6 argument here, and we would respectfully submit that it7 does. Let me start with Respondent's interpretation.8 I don't think that I could put the problem9 with that interpretation better than the Federal10 government itself does in its brief where it suggests11 that "an interpretation, which precludes even an appeal12 from the very dismissal that counts as a third strike,13 would be inconsistent with quote, “common practice, in14 which a litigant is permitted an appeal as of right,15 from any adverse district court ruling that is final."16 One would expect Congress to have spoken17 more clearly if that had been Congress's intention. And18 while in Section 1915(a)(3), Congress specified certain19 circumstances under which an IFP appeal is not20 permitted, it conspicuously did not bar IFP appeals from21 third strike dismissals.22 Now, Respondents attempt to mitigate the23 harsh consequences of their position. Wisely, they do24 not make the argument that they did in their brief that25 a prisoner need only, quote, "buckle down" in order to49￼1 earn the $505 filing fee in order to pursue an appeal.2 All I heard Respondents suggest was, well, a prisoner3 can refile in State courts. But as Mr. Lindstrom wisely4 acknowledged, because Michigan itself has such a5 provision, many States following the PLRA adopted three6 strike provisions of their own. And so, I would7 respectfully submit that that provides cold comfort.8 Let me turn to the Federal government's9 interpretation.10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Including strikes in11 Federal courts?12 MR. SHANMUGAM: Some States do. I'm frankly13 not sure what the practice is in Michigan, but I know14 that many States count dismissals in both sets of courts15 toward the three strikes.16 Let me start with ­­ let me address the17 Federal government's interpretation very briefly. I18 think it is telling that my friend, Mr. Kedem, did not19 start with the government's interpretation of the phrase20 "prior occasion." He instead started with background21 principles. And that is, I would respectfully submit,22 for the simple reason that you simply cannot get this23 different suit distinction out of the phrase "prior24 occasion." It would lead to the odd result, as Justice25 Breyer highlighted in his colloquy with Mr. Kedem, that50￼1 a prior dismissal could count as a prior occasion in2 some circumstances, but not in others.3 Let me address the question of background4 principles because that was such the focus of Mr.5 Kedem's argument. We would respectfully submit that6 principles differ in the law whether as a matter of7 statute or whether as a matter of background principles.8 Congress can be explicit in both directions and,9 obviously, here Congress was silent. I think in terms10 of nonstatutory background principles, frankly, the11 primary principle on which the Federal government relies12 in its brief is the principle of claim preclusion. And13 it is certainly true that in some jurisdictions,14 consequences attach immediately upon judgment. That's15 not the rule in others. In California and Texas,16 consequences don't attach until the judgment becomes17 final on appeal.18 But that doctrine serves a quite different19 purpose. The whole point of attaching consequences20 immediately is precisely to ensure that a losing party21 does not get a second bite at the apple. Here, by22 contrast, you're talking about a provision that applies23 consequences in other lawsuits, however unrelated and24 however meritorious. And that just underscores, in our25 view, the point that there are different policy5125 JUSTICE ALITO:So a prisoner could at least￼1 justifications that may require attaching consequences2 to a judgment immediately or that may require attaching3 consequences only when a judgment becomes final on4 appeal.5 At bottom, recognizing that there is some6 ambiguity here, given the fact that you have three7 parties here who are offering different interpretations,8 none of which lines up with the interpretation of the9 court of appeals below. We would respectfully submit10 that considerations of workability and administrability11 ought to be paramount when construing a statute that12 governs the processing of Federal lawsuits. Our rule13 has been the rule ­­14 JUSTICE ALITO: Before15 your time runs out, can a case be final on ­­ can a case16 be final on appeal if there17 but the notice of appeal is18 MR. SHANMUGAM:19 circumstance, it probably would be until the Court of20 Appeals disposes of the case, because the Court of21 Appeals would, typically, eventually dismiss the appeal22 as untimely. But these are issues that lower courts23 deal with all the time and not just in the context of24 our interpretation of the three strikes provision.52is a ­­ an appeal pendinguntimely?We believe that in that￼1 temporarily put some of these strikes in abeyance by2 filing untimely notices of appeal.3 MR. SHANMUGAM: And I suppose that a court,4 if a court believed that that was a serious problem,5 could construe the finality rule differently. Our6 submission is simply that our rule has been the rule in7 the overwhelming majority of lower courts and there's no8 evidence that lower courts have had any difficulty. The9 interpretations on the other side are solutions in10 search of a problem. Thank you.11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.12 Case is submitted.13 (Whereupon, at 12:01 p.m., the case in the14 above­entitled matter was
