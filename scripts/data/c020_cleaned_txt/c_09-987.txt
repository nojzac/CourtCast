Winn, and the related case, Garriott v. Winn.General.ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYALON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERSGENERAL KATYAL: Thank you,Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:For 13 years, Arizona has permitted private citizens to contribute money to private organizations set up by private individuals and has let those organizations use that money towards scholarships when individuals apply for them. The Ninth Circuit erred first in finding that the taxpayer plaintiffs had standing, and second in striking the program down.On standing, this lawsuit fails each of the three necessary elements. Regarding injury in fact, the key point is this: Not a cent of the Respondents' money goes to fund religion. If you placed an electronic tag to track and monitor each cent that the Respondent plaintiffs pay in tax, not a cent, not a fraction of a4￼1 cent, would go into any religious school's coffers.2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Katyal, their point3 is that this tax money does belong to the State that the4 private individuals are using, because it is money that,5 even by the new amendment, says either you pay it to the6 State or you use it for this purpose, but it's the7 State's money, and it's giving you by its largesse the8 right to redirect it. That's their argument.9 GENERAL KATYAL: Right, and -­10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it would be the11 taxpayers' tax dollars being spent on religion, if they12 could sustain their claim.13 GENERAL KATYAL: There are two problems with14 that. One has to do with injury in fact. The other has15 to do with redressability. With respect to injury in16 fact, our point is, as you track the taxpayers' dollars,17 it doesn't actually fund any religious program, unlike18 the -- unlike Flast and other cases in which this Court19 has considered taxpayer standing for religion.20 Their complaint is not that the government21 is spending money that the taxpayers has been -- money22 that has been extracted and spent of the taxpayers.23 Their complaint is that someone else's money is not24 being extracted and spent enough. And the relevant25 language in Flast says that for taxpayer standing to5￼1 occur, that, quote, "his tax money" must be extracted2 and spent, and here that's not occurring.3 Now, with respect to the other argument, not4 injury in fact, but addressability and causation, our5 point is this: It's speculative as to whether or not6 that chain of events that you spelled out, Justice7 Sotomayor, would actually happen. As this Court said in8 Cuno, for example, when a tax credit is given, sometimes9 that actually reduces the amount of money the government10 has to spend. It doesn't increase it. And so that's11 different than the direct outlay that was at issue in12 Flast.13 JUSTICE BREYER: Then is it constitutional14 if we get a new system? Here's what the system will be:15 The taxpayers who are religious will be able to check a16 box, and the check that they send to the IRS -- it's a17 possible system -- what happens is that that check is18 cashed by an official, and the cash is given to the19 local priest to say prayers for the individual who20 contributed the money. And, in your view, there is no21 one who could challenge that?22 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, let me say two things23 about that. First is: That is not all that different,24 Justice Breyer, than what we have today with 501(c)(3)25 deductions.6￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: The difference is, of2 course, that in the one case it's a deduction, and in3 this case you're paying it 100 percent with money that4 would otherwise go into the coffer.5 GENERAL KATYAL: That -- that's -­6 JUSTICE BREYER: I understand that. But I'm7 interested in, conceptually, does the Government think8 that there is no one who could challenge that?9 GENERAL KATYAL: I don't think that any10 taxpayer could challenge that. That is, depending on11 the hypothetical, Justice Breyer, I'm not sure if the12 government is specifying which religious organizations13 might be eligible for the check box. But if the14 government is doing something that is under-inclusive15 and only giving tax credits to one set of religious16 organizations, that's a Texas Monthly problem, where17 this Court -­18 JUSTICE BREYER: So, if you go back into19 history, it could have been the case that the -- as long20 as they were fair to every religion, the first Congress21 could have funded prayers throughout the nation in22 churches for anyone to go and pray, and that would not23 have violated the Establishment Clause, or if it had,24 nobody could have challenged it.25 GENERAL KATYAL: No, Justice Breyer. Two7￼21 Establishment Clause will be22 recognize taxpayer standing?23 GENERAL KATYAL:24 Justice Ginsburg, in Flast.25 narrow exception for when someone's dollars are being81 things on that. First is: We're only talking about2 standing, not the merits. And with respect to standing,3 if the government funded only religious organizations or4 religious prayer, I do think that other organizations5 would have standing -- not as a taxpayer, because this6 Court has been very careful in Flast and in Hein to say7 there's an extremely narrow exception for taxpayer8 standing, a narrow exception to Frothingham, but other9 organizations would have Texas Monthly standing because10 they're -­11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General -- counsel, does12 anyone have standing, in your view, to challenge this13 scheme?14 GENERAL KATYAL: The way this scheme is set15 up, our answer is no. And I think that accords with16 this Court's general reluctance to confer taxpayer17 standing in this area.18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And if we leave out the19 fine points that you were discussing, isn't the20 underlying premise of Flast v. Cohen that the￼unenforceable unless weI -- I don't see that, I think Flast is a very8GENERAL KATYAL: JUSTICE BREYER: what?GENERAL KATYAL: is gone at all. JUSTICE BREYER: GENERAL KATYAL:Justice Breyer -­ If they had, theyJustice Breyer, IWhy?1 taken out of their pocket and spent by the government on2 religion, and I don't think that's happening here.3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you're right -­4 JUSTICE BREYER: Flast is gone; is that5 right? Flast is gone. There is no more -- nothing more6 to Flast, because it just happened that nobody7 thought of this system at the time of Flast.had910 have had -- 1112 think Flast 131415 government outlays to spend16 mean, that -­17 JUSTICE BREYER:18 because all you have to do to get around it is to create19 what we have here.20 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, I do think that that21 can get around it -- that can get around it in somecould don't￼22 circumstances. And, again,23 in a government program may24 taxpayer.25those who are under-included have standing, not as aof the day, Justice Breyer,But, at the end9-- when there is directon religion, like Flast. INo, but you don't need be,1 if that's the result, that's the result for every other2 clause in the Constitution. Taxpayer standing is the3 most narrow of exceptions, and -­4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it is -- there is a5 plaintiff -- we have a Bill of Rights, and most6 provisions have plaintiffs who are hurting, whose free7 speech is being suppressed, but this one doesn't have.8 It's in the Constitution like all the others, and I9 thought, to be candid, that that's what the problem was10 in Flast v. Cohen, and that's what the Court was11 responding to.12 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, I don't see that in13 Flast, Justice Ginsburg, but be that as it may, I think14 this Court in Valley Forge was very clear to say that15 if, at the end of the day, you can't find a plaintiff16 with standing, that is not an excuse to relax the -- our17 general requirements of Article III standing.18 And here, if you granted the plaintiffs19 standing, what you would be granting is, for the first20 time, a -- a tax credit which is a complaint about21 someone else's money not being spent to a high enough22 level.23 JUSTICE KAGAN: So if you are right, General24 Katyal, the Court was without authority to decide Walz,25 Nyquist, Hunt, Mueller, Hibbs, this -- this very case,10￼1 just a few years ago? That the Court was without2 authority to decide any of those cases, but that somehow3 nobody on the Court recognized that fact, nor did the SG4 recognize that fact. The SG participated, I believe, in5 each of those cases.6 GENERAL KATYAL: Right. So let me say two7 things about that.8 First is, I do think it's very much just9 like Frothingham, in which Frothingham had to deal with10 this exact problem. The Court had conferred standing in11 taxpayer standing case after taxpayer standing case, and12 then, when it was teed up and presented to the Court as13 a question about Article III standing, the Court said:14 No, we shouldn't have granted taxpayer standing in those15 cases. So my answer to you is yes.16 Now, I do think that this Court's decision17 in Hein, I think, reiterated some of the fundamental18 principles and the limits on Flast. And I think the19 Court -- the plurality made quite clear that it would go20 no further than the facts of Flast.21 And to grant standing here, you have to22 go -- tremendously depart from what Flast is about: a23 direct government outlay of funds out of -- taking money24 out of someone's pocket to fund religion.25 GENERAL KAGAN: But I -­11￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE KENNEDY: I just want to make sure I heard your answer to the -- you said the answer is yes. In other words, you agree with Justice Kagan's criticism of those cases, and you said, yes, she's right; those cases were wrongly decided.GENERAL KATYAL: They -- they could have gone out -- the results may have been the same. It just would have been -- would have been on standing instead of the merits. Mueller, for example, upheld the program. So the bottom-line decision would have been the same, but the way in which the Court got there would have been so that there was no tax -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you would have said there would have been no standing in those cases.GENERAL KATYAL: No taxpayer standing. Now, there may have been other forms of standing, Texas Monthly standing, that could have been alleged to challenge those programs, but yes.JUSTICE GINSBURG: But wasn't -- I don't remember whetherit wasn't -- itthe Governmentit came up under theparticipated in the Tax Injunction Act. GENERALfootnote -­Winn case whenJUSTICEKATYAL: We did, and in the firstGINSBURG: And there wasn't a word12￼1 from the Government about lack of standing.2 GENERAL KATYAL: The first footnote in the3 brief, Justice Ginsburg, acknowledged the fact that4 standing hadn't been pushed or pressed below. But I5 acknowledge that, particularly in the wake of Hein,6 should another case arise, the Government will -- will7 acknowledge the standing defects and brief them as we8 are here.9 Our point on redressability is not simply10 that the -- that the tax -- that the cost of the program11 is speculative. It's also that the relief that the12 plaintiffs are seeking in this case won't redress their13 problem. That is, if you gave the plaintiffs everything14 they're asking for, the very same religious schools and15 the very same religious STOs would continue to be16 funded. The very same religious STOs would continue to17 be funded because they would leave in place -- and this18 was my answer to Justice Breyer -- the tax deduction,19 the 501(c)(3) tax deduction. And so there would still20 be government revenue being spent in favor of these21 religious STOs under their program. It would just be at22 the level of one-third instead of 100 percent.23 I don't think that satisfies their problem.24 I don't think James Madison 's remonstrance would be25 satisfied if they were -- if Madison were told: Well,13￼1 you're not going to be taxed three pence; you'll be2 taxed one pence. The principle is what matters, the3 principle of Flast.4 If I could reserve the balance of my time.5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.6 Ms. Bickett.7 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAULA S. BICKETT8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS9 MS. BICKETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it10 please the Court:11 Arizona's tuition tax credit does not12 violate the Establishment Clause, because it's a neutral13 law that results in scholarship programs of private14 choice. It's neutral because, like the tax deduction15 that the Court upheld in Mueller, it's one of many16 tax-saving devices, including some 26 other credits that17 are available to Arizona taxpayers on a neutral basis.18 JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Bickett, could you19 explain something to me just -- I have been puzzling and20 puzzling over this scheme. Could you tell me why21 Arizona adopted this sort of scheme rather than the more22 typical tuition voucher scheme? In other tuition23 voucher schemes, the State just gives the -- the voucher24 or scholarship or what have you. This is so much more25 complicated and complex and unusual. And it just left14￼1 me wondering why it was chosen, or what the State thinks2 the advantages are of it now?3 MS. BICKETT: Yes, Justice Kagan. One of4 the things that is true in Arizona that was not true in5 Ohio is that, under the Arizona Constitution, any direct6 aid to private schools is prohibited.7 The other thing about the tax credit program8 is that it does encourage contributions not only from9 parents but from the community at large. And this -­10 this then provides money for low-income students,11 students from low-income families.12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the record show the13 extent to which there are donations by people who do not14 have students?15 MS. BICKETT: Could you -­16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the -- does the17 record show the extent to which there are these18 additional donations that you just referred to?19 MS. BICKETT: Your Honor, of course, it was20 at a motion to dismiss phase. What the record shows is21 that there's some reports that -- studies that have been22 done that show that there have been some children that23 have switched from public schools to private schools as24 a result of the program, that many of the scholarship25 programs are -- in fact, most of the scholarship15￼1 programs provide scholarships based on financial need.2 JUSTICE SCALIA: You haven't -- I don't3 think you answered his question. The question was, is4 there anything in the record that shows whether any of5 the money that's involved here comes not from parents,6 but rather from others who can contribute to the7 program?8 MS. BICKETT: Well, what the record shows is9 that there have been -- there's a large amount of10 contributions. There is $55 million. It doesn't -- we11 have Arizona Department of Revenue reports that list the12 number of contributors and who contributes -- or not the13 individuals who contribute. I -- it doesn't14 specifically line out who the contributors are, whether15 they are parents, or whether they are not parents.16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I suppose if some of17 the contributions are considerable, like a million18 dollars, that couldn't be just a parent, right?19 MS. BICKETT: You're right.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are there contributions of21 that size?22 MS. BICKETT: Again, the record doesn't show23 what the size of the contributions are. It shows the -­24 the number of contributions and the total amount of25 contributions.16￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You could only2 get -- if you give a million dollars, you still only get3 a $500 tax credit, right?4 MS. BICKETT: That's correct, Your Honor.5 The -- the programs are programs of private6 choice, because any aid that reaches religious schools7 does so after -- only after at least four levels of8 private decisionmaking. Arizona sets up the neutral9 rules for the -- this tax credit, and after that,10 private individuals and organizations take over. Anyone11 can form a school tuition organization, and the increase12 in the number and diversity of school tuition13 organizations over the 13 years that the tax credit has14 been in existence demonstrates, in fact, that -- that15 this is free for everyone to participate in.16 JUSTICE BREYER: Something that worried me17 in Zelman is this, and I might get your answer.18 Probably Arizona spends some billions of dollars on19 public schools, doesn't it? I don't know what the exact20 amount is.21 MS. BICKETT: Yes, Your Honor.22 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, let's take 30 or23 40 percent of that and spend it through this program on24 religious schools. Imagine that happens. At that25 point, people might get into considerable discussion17￼1 about what qualifies, when it doesn't qualify, whether2 it's a valid school, or is it just teaching religion,3 and what the rules and regulations are. How is Arizona4 dealing with this problem? By saying there are no5 regulations, by saying that we're not -- is there a6 system for dealing with the legitimacy and the7 circumstances under which a particular religion's8 schools qualify9 MS.10 program -­1112 MS.13 qualified private schools in order to participate in the14 -- in the tax credit.15 JUSTICE BREYER: And that must be a set of16 regulations and rules.17 MS. BICKETT: Primarily what it is, is that18 private schools in Arizona satisfy the compulsory19 education law as long as they meet the requirements that20 the public schools have in terms of providing21 qualitatively the subject matter that the public22 schools -­23 JUSTICE SCALIA: And those standards have24 nothing to do with this program. They are standards25 that any private school, religious or otherwise, must18for this program? Who decides and how? BICKETT: Well, under the tax creditJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.BICKETT: -- the schools have to be￼1 meet in order to satisfy the education requirements of2 Arizona?3 MS. BICKETT: That is correct, Your Honor.4 JUSTICE BREYER: And when do they teach the5 religious part of their program?6 MS. BICKETT: Excuse me?7 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, when does a private8 school -- normally the schools -- I mean, I'm not an9 expert, but what you have to do to be a school is a very10 complex thing, and you have all kinds of requirements11 that eat up quite a lot of the day. And I just wonder12 how the religion part fits in. Has there turned out to13 be no problem? When do they -- do they teach religion14 at 6:00 in the morning? Does it matter if the person's15 qualified? How does the -- I once had a case on this in16 the First Circuit, and it came out to be surprisingly17 complex, and I just wondered how -- if there turned out18 to be any problem at all in Arizona in this area.19 MS. BICKETT: Justice Breyer, the record20 doesn't reflect that, and I am not aware of any problem21 with private schools in Arizona and certainly not that22 have participated in this tax credit program.23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose that an STO -­24 this is a hypothetical case -- discriminated on the25 basis of race. No Hispanic or no white or no black can19￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425receive our money. And suppose there's no Federal statute on it, no State statute prohibiting this. Would there be a constitutional violation, a Federal constitutional violation?MS. BICKETT: If it was -- if it was a private institution -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, it's an STO.MS. BICKETT: And so that is a private organization.JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. There are no attributes of State action that would suffice to allow a discriminated person to bring suit, a person who has been discriminated against?MS. BICKETT: As long as there was not a Federal law that applied to the organization -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, the hypothetical is no Federal statute, no State statute. It's a pure -- it's a State action question, is what I'm asking.MS. BICKETT: And unless the discrimination could be attributed to the State, the State's direction, then -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, don't you think a strong argument can be made that it can be attributed to the State. The State has all sorts of rules about what an STO has to be. The State provides the mechanism20￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425through -- through the credit for the funding. JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Limits the funding.JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume that there's a tax deduction for contributions to churches.MS. BICKETT: Yes, Your Honor.JUSTICE SCALIA: And many churches discriminate on the basis of religion, don't they?MS. BICKETT: Yes, they do.JUSTICE SCALIA: Does that pose a constitutional problem, do you think?MS. BICKETT: No, Your Honor, it doesn't,and -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about -- what about -- what about the answer to my question?MS. BICKETT: Well, Your Honor, and I -­ because STOs are 501 -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're saying the STO -­ you're saying STOs are sufficiently private so they can do this.MS. BICKETT: Because they are -­JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was a case in this Court. The name of it was Bob Jones. It was a private school, and it discriminated on the basis of race. And the question was whether they could have a tax-exempt status so that there could be donations to them. Do you21￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425remember -­case?MS. BICKETT: Yes -­JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the outcome of thatMS. BICKETT: Yes, Your Honor. The -- the Court held that the Department of Revenue could preclude the university from having tax-exempt status because that -- that violated public policy, and, therefore, they were not entitled to 501(c)(3) status. And so too here. All of these organizations are 501(c)(3) organizations, so they would not be able to discriminate based on race.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Who would have -­JUSTICE KAGAN: Could I tryJustice Kennedy's question in a slightly different way?I'm assuming that you would agree that if this was just a straight tuition voucher program, the State could not give tuition vouchers on the basis of religion, could not say, if you are a Catholic, you don't get these tuition vouchers. But what the State has done here, apparently, is to set up a scheme that uses intermediaries that can make exactly that distinction, that can say, sorry, if you are a Catholic you don't get scholarships out of our STO.And the question is, why should the State be22￼1 able to do that? If the State can't do it itself in2 providing tuition vouchers, why should the State be able3 to set up a system using intermediaries that exist for4 no other reason than to administer this program that can5 make those distinctions?6 MS. BICKETT: Your Honor, the State is not7 making those decisions. It's private organizations, and8 anyone can set up a school tuition organization. School9 tuition organizations that support solely secular10 schools are in existence, and there has been no problem11 setting those up. Five of the top 10 STOs do provide12 scholarships to any -- any school of the parents'13 choosing -­14 JUSTICE KAGAN: But the plaintiffs15 contend -­16 MS. BICKETT: The private market -­17 JUSTICE KAGAN: The plaintiffs contend -­18 and this is a motion to dismiss, so we have to accept19 their contentions as settled -- that there are STOs that20 make these distinctions that clearly would be21 impermissible if the State administered the program.22 These are not pre-existing charitable organizations.23 They are not pre-existing schools. They're entities24 that are set up solely for the purpose of administering25 this program, and yet the State is saying it can make23￼1 distinctions that the State itself cannot.2 MS. BICKETT: Your Honor, if I might correct3 you, the -- there was one school tuition organization4 that pre-existed the tax credit, and certainly the5 private schools that participated in these for the most6 part did exist before this school tuition organization.7 What this program allows private8 organizations to do, it allows parents to get together9 with private schools and form school tuition10 organizations that then -­11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- you said there12 was an STO before this program, but it didn't get the13 benefit of money from taxpayers that would have gone -­￼14 that money went to -- to15 this scheme was created.16 MS. BICKETT:17 created, they would have18 Federal tax deduction and a State tax deduction,19 of a tax credit. But the difference -- there is20 significant difference between a tax credit and a tax21 deduction in terms of constitutionality. The only22 difference between a tax deduction is that, for purposes23 of a tax deduction, it depends on -- the value of it24 depends on the tax bracket of the taxpayer, whereas a25 tax credit, the value depends -- is -- is equal for all24Arizona, not to the STObeforeBefore this scheme was gotten a tax deduction,a instead not a1 taxpayers that owe taxes. And this Court has never made2 a distinction between tax credits, on the one hand, or3 tax exemptions, tax deductions.4 Under -- under Respondents' theory, any5 money that the government doesn't take in would then be6 the equivalent of State money, and that would then7 undermine 501(c)(3) corporations and all kinds of8 charitable organizations. What you need to look at9 in -- when Arizona decided to give a tax credit for this10 is it was thinking is this a worthy public purpose to11 not take in certain money that -- that the State would12 normally be entitled to if they give contributions to13 that purpose. So, it's not a question -- and that -­14 that type of purpose has been upheld by this Court in15 Walz, in Hernandez.16 And there, again -- there is not a basis for17 distinguishing here between what Arizona is doing and18 other 501(c)(3) organizations that have for years been19 able to enjoy the benefits of -- of tax savings, tax20 benefits, and help give scholarships to religious21 organizations.22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.23 Mr. Bender.24 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL BENDER25 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS25￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. BENDER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:I'd like to start with Mr. Katyal's statement that if we win this case, you don't get any relief because as much money would be -- would go into religious education as goes now. That shows he does not understand our claim.Our claim is not that money is going -- that State money is going to religious schools. Our claim is that State money is being given to the beneficiaries of a State spending program on the basis of religion. It's a claim about discrimination in the distribution of these State funds. It's not -­JUSTICE SCALIA: But there -- but there is a discrimination, I gather. The -- the school that seems to get the most money on the list doesn't appear to be a religious school at all. It's -- it's not even discrimination between religion and nonreligion, if you think that that is invalid, which I don't. But it doesn't favor religion at all.MR.

That would be unconstitutional?MR. BENDER: Let me try to clarify.JUSTICE SCALIA: So you must positively disfavor religion?MR. BENDER: No, you must not. You must give the money to the beneficiaries without taking the beneficiaries' religion into account. Suppose the government set up -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How does this take -- how does this take the beneficiaries' religion into account when the program works perfectly -- in exactly the same way if it's a nonreligious school?

It's how is it discriminating on the basis6 of religion if the STOs and the government money -- it7 doesn't care whether it goes to a religious school or8 not; it's treated the same?9 MR. BENDER: The STO -- most money is given10 out by STOs that do care whether it goes to a religious11 school.12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The State money13 going to the STO -- the State doesn't care whether it14 goes to a religious STO or a secular STO.15 MR. BENDER: That doesn't matter. If the16 State's grantee cares, that's unconstitutional.17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought we've held18 that when you have the decision is made by a private19 entity whether to use the money to go to a religious￼24 opposite in25 for religious purposes was made by the grantee, not made281 by the government. The government program in Bowen was2 completely religiously neutral. Grantees were given3 funds to educate adolescents in sexuality. The Court4 held -- Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote the opinion -­5 that, although the program was constitutional on its6 face because -- it wasn't unconstitutional because7 religious organizations could participate as grantees.8 It would be unconstitutional if those organizations9 distributed the benefits of the program on the basis of10 religion.11 Think about a Head Start program. Suppose12 the government sets up 50 Head Start programs in a13 particular community. They're all run by private14 organizations; some religious, some not.15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, could we16 get -- just to get back to Bowen for a moment.17 MR.

BENDER: Same as here, yeah.22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The entities are not23 -- in Bowen, were not identified.

There are some religious schools. Do we8 know that these religious schools do not admit people9 except of a certain religion?MR. BENDER: I don't understand. In Bowen, Court held, in the as-applied part of Bowen, grantees were to give out the -- theirthe basis of religion, that would violate10 MR. BENDER: Well, I think we do know that,11 and the complaint alleges that, but that's not the12 point. The point is not what the religious schools do;13 the point is what the STOs do. The STOs are government14 grantees. They are distributing government funds. The15 Constitution prohibits organizations that distribute16 government funds as part of a government spending17 program to do it on the basis of religion.18 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a great leap to say19 that it's government funds, that any money the20 government doesn't take from me, because it gives me a21 deduction, is government money. I mean, that's the22 first leap you make.23 MR. BENDER: This is money that the24 government takes from people.25 JUSTICE SCALIA: This money has never been30￼1 in the government's coffers.

No.311 With respect, Justice Kennedy, the money that's involved2 in this case is money that is generated by imposition of3 the State's income tax, not by non-imposition of it.

You can't keep it. It's not that all5 of your money is the government's money; it's that this6 $5,000 that you owe the government as income taxes is7 the government's money.8 JUSTICE ALITO: But why isn't that true of a9 tax deduction also? And this is a very modest tax10 credit. The tax deduction that a wealthy person would11 get by making a contribution to a college or university12 that has a religious affiliation is much more valuable13 than this $500 credit.14 MR. BENDER: It doesn't turn on whether it's15 valuable or not. It turns on whether when the taxpayer16 makes the payment the taxpayer is paying the taxpayer's17 own money or money the taxpayer owes to the government.18 When you make a charitable contribution, you're using19 your own money. That's not money you owe to the20 government. You don't know how much money you owe to21 the government until you figure out your taxes.22 This credit doesn't come into play until you23 figure out your taxes. And then if you owe the24 government -­25 JUSTICE ALITO: I completely don't33￼1 understand that. Somebody does know. It's December2 31st. They know -- they figure out how much tax they're3 going to have to pay for that year. They know exactly.4 They can know exactly what their taxes will be. And it5 will be X, and if they make a -- a deduction, then it6 will be X minus Y. What is the difference?7 MR. BENDER: The difference is -- that -- to8 me, the broad difference is that the tax deduction is9 given for charitable contributions. And I think the10 Court would decide if it faced the question -- I don't11 think it's ever had to -- that it is constitutional for12 the government to support private charity. And if the13 government is going to support private charity by14 letting you deduct charitable contributions, it can't15 leave religious charities out of that program. That16 would violate the Establishment Clause.17 So if you believe that the charitable18 deduction in the Federal income tax is a constitutional19 thing for the government to do, to support private20 charity by picking up part of the tab -- that's true21 when there's a deduction -- then you have to give the22 deduction to people who contribute to religion.23 So, yes, there is a government support for24 that private charitable contribution, but it's a25 charitable contribution.34￼1 The money in this case is not a charitable2 contribution. Mr. Katyal says that it's not the3 government's money. Whose money is it? Is it the4 taxpayer's money who gives the $1,000 contribution? No.5 If you don't take my word for it, look at what the STOs6 say on their Web sites about this program. One of them7 says quite frankly: Hey, you can give charity with8 someone else's money; it's a miracle. Another one says:9 It won't cost you anything; you can give charity with10 other people's money.11 JUSTICE BREYER: See, can I ask you -­12 MR. BENDER: Whose money is it?13 JUSTICE ALITO: What difference does it make14 what they say on their Web sites? There's a very15 important philosophical point here.

That's the whole point.MR. BENDER: It's not a contribution.JUSTICE SCALIA: They don't owe the tax to the extent that they have given money to one of these institutions.

BENDER: No.(Laughter.)JUSTICE SCALIA: So that it's a deduction before the line. This is a major lawsuit?MR. BENDER: This is a government spending program. Is there any doubt about that? The money in this program is not private charitable contributions.JUSTICE BREYER: So you assume that it is a -- I see your argument there.Now, in Zelman, the holding, I wouldthink -- which I was not in agreement with, but it's now law, that a government can have a -- a spending program. And what they did was the government spent money in the form of vouchers to be given to private individuals to use for such education as they wish, that met certain standards, including religious schools.So what's the difference between the program here and the one that was held constitutional in Zelman?MR. BENDER: The difference is that, in Zelman, the money went to the parents without any religious discrimination. Religion was not involved in the distribution of the money to the parents. The parents in Zelman got funds based on their financial need and the fact that their children went to school in37￼1 Cleveland, which was a failing school district. And the2 program was to give them -- based on their financial3 need, was to give them a voucher.4 In giving the parent a voucher, nobody said5 to the parent, what's your religion? Nobody said to the6 parent, are you going to send your child to a religious7 school? The Court said, as clearly as it could in8 Zelman, that that would be unconstitutional.910 parent, who11 religion?1213 scholarship. 1415 gives a scholarship only to Catholics -­16 MR.

BENDER: That's true.JUSTICE SCALIA: There -- there's no religious discrimination in that choice.MR. BENDER: Let me -- let me put it to you this way, Justice Scalia: Suppose the government in this case gave the money to the STOs directly itself, and the STOs then gave out the scholarships.

The people who6 get the -- who can claim the tax credit, the person that7 gets the scholarship cannot be a dependent of the person8 who gives the contribution.9 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, suppose they change10 one rule, and the rule that the STOs had was this: They11 said we will give you tuition if you otherwise qualify12 for your child to go to the school that you wish to go13 to, and if you are Jewish or you are Protestant and you14 want to go to St. Joseph's Catholic School, that's15 absolutely fine; they won't keep you out, and vice16 versa.17 Now, in your opinion, that then would be18 constitutional?￼19 20 21 2223 challenging24 will not give the scholarship to a Protestant to go to a25 Catholic school.MR.

BENDER: Yes.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought another part of your complaint was that the STOs were giving just to the religious schools.MR. BENDER: STOs don't give scholarships to religious schools.

That doesn't get421 you there, as Justice Breyer's interrogation indicated.2 JUSTICE KAGAN: But you're saying -- you are3 saying both, is that right, Mr. Bender? You're saying4 both of those things?5 MR. BENDER: Both of them, yes.6 JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes. Could I ask you: Is7 there -- do you understand the beneficiaries of this8 program?

The parent that -­25 the scholarships -- as Zelman said as clearly as it431 could, the scholarships have to -- in that case, the2 vouchers -- have to be available to parents on a3 religiously neutral basis. The scholarships are not4 allowed to be made available to parents according to5 their religion or according to whether they will send6 their child to a religious school, though both of those7 kinds of discrimination are going on here. I think8 there -­9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bender, can I go back10 to your point -- you were making a distinction between11 the taxpayer who makes a charitable donation. Well,12 that taxpayer has the whole universe to spend it on:13 Buying clothes, on gambling, on this charity, that14 charity. But your point here is this contributor does15 not have the universe to pick and is free to pick a16 charity. This one has -- you either give it to the17 government or you give it to the STO. That's -­18 MR. BENDER: Exactly. Right. Yes. It's19 not -- it's not the taxpayers' money. It's confusing20 because we're talking about two kinds of taxpayers here.21 We're talking about my clients, who are general22 taxpayers, whose money is being used to fund this23 program, and we're talking about the taxpayers who take24 the tax credit. There are two different kinds of25 taxpayers.44￼1 JUSTICE ALITO: So if Arizona had a statute2 that gave an income tax deduction only to individuals3 who make charitable contributions to educational4 institutions, there would be a problem there, because5 they -- it wasn't a general tax exception for charitable6 contributions?7 MR. BENDER: No, Justice Alito. I think it8 would be constitutional if it said that you get a9 deduction for making a charitable contribution to an10 educational organization and that that can include a11 religious educational organization, because if it12 didn't, it would be unconstitutional.13 You can't set up a program that gives you a14 deduction for giving to educational institutions but not15 to -- not to a religious organization. That would be16 unconstitutional. If you're going to support private17 charity, you have to support religious charity in the18 same way you support nonreligious charity. But19 if you're going to have somebody -­20 JUSTICE ALITO: I thought your answer to21 Justice Ginsberg was the difference between this and the22 Federal tax deduction for charitable contributions was23 that the Federal tax deduction is available for a broad24 range of charities, whereas this is available only for a25 very narrow range.45￼1 MR. BENDER: I may have misunderstood her2 question. I think her question was: At the time the3 taxpayer makes the charitable contribution that he is4 going to take a deduction for, the taxpayer could do5 anything he wants with that money. He could take a6 vacation. He could give it to a charity. He could -­7 he could buy clothes with it. He could buy food with8 it. It's a completely open system. Nobody tells the9 taxpayer what he has to do.10 In this case, when the taxpayer writes that11 check to the STO, the taxpayer can't keep that money,12 can't use it on a vacation, can't use it for buying13 food, has to either pay it to the State or, with the14 State's authorization, pay it to an STO.15 JUSTICE SCALIA: The same thing is true of16 charitable deductions. When you take a charitable17 deduction, you -- you don't have the money anymore. You18 have given it to a charitable organization.19 Now, you are allowed to give it to a20 particular religion, a particular church, and there21 seems to be nothing unconstitutional about that, right?22 MR. BENDER: Right. We -­23 JUSTICE SCALIA: So what -- what is24 unconstitutional here about the private -- the private25 decision to -- to give a benefit to a -- an organization46￼1 that only supports particular schools and, indeed, only2 supports people of a particular religion to go to that3 school? I don't see any difference.4 MR. BENDER: There's nothing5 unconstitutional about the taxpayers sending the money6 to an STO. If STOs did not discriminate on the basis of7 religion in giving that money out, there would be no8 unconstitutionality.9 JUSTICE SCALIA: But churches discriminate10 on the basis of religion. When I take my charitable11 deduction to give it to a particular church, that church12 discriminates on the basis of religion, but that's okay;13 isn't it?1415 you can pay16 pay them to17 only to people of a certain religion, I believe that18 would be unconstitutional.19 JUSTICE SCALIA: So it's how the government20 puts it, the idea? So it really is just that line in -­21 in the tax form that you are concerned about, and the￼22 only relief23 form?2425 charity andyou really need is -- is changing the taxMR.

It costs you money.In Arizona, if you make a charitable contribution of $1,000, it costs you $950 if you're at the maximum tax rate, because the maximum tax rate is5 percent. In Arizona, if you take this tax credit, it costs you nothing. It's not charity. Charity is something -- you give something of your own, I believe.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Excuse me. Just to follow on Justice Scalia's question, because I want to make sure you have the answer: If this system were set up exactly as it is now, but Arizona said contributions to STOs are deductible, you'd have no problem?MR. BENDER: Contributions to STOs are deductible from one's income tax?CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.MR. BENDER: And, yes. No, we would not have a problem with that.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the only difference is that Arizona set up this system where you get a tax credit instead of a tax deduction?MR. BENDER: Of course.JUSTICE ALITO: And that would be true if even if the -- if the top marginal rate was 90 percent?MR.

If the top rate is 90 percent, when you give that money, it's your money; you can use it for anything you want. And even if you're in the 90 percent bracket, you are giving some of your own money. You are engaging in charity. And the Constitution, I think, permits the government to subsidize private charity.And if the government's going to subsidize private charity, it can't leave religious charities out. So that's the dividing line. Is the government subsidizing private charity? In this case, the government is not subsidizing private charity because it49￼1 is not private charity, because the tax -­2 JUSTICE ALITO: If this is -- if this is3 government money, then why would it be constitutional,4 in your view, for this scheme to exist if -- for the -­5 if the STOs did not discriminate at all on the basis6 of religion?7 MR. BENDER: Because it's perfectly okay to8 use government money for non-religiously discriminatory9 purposes. You can get a tax credit for buying a solar10 water heater. That's a 100 percent tax credit. Now,11 that's a somewhat different kind of tax credit, because12 there, when13 the money.14 kind of tax15 used to pay16 has.1718 say we will19 for religious affiliated schools, but we will not20 discriminate on the basis of the student's religion.21 MR. BENDER: Right.22 JUSTICE ALITO: And if this is the23 government's money, you think that would be -- that24 would not be an Establishment Clause violation?25 MR. BENDER: No, no, no. If an STO50you buy the heater, you get something for It's -- this tax credit is a very strange credit. This is a tax credit that is only your taxes.

BENDER: No. I didn't. I hope I didn't. JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if you didn't -­ JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sure you did.JUSTICE BREYER: Let's suppose you didn't. MR. BENDER: Thank you for correcting me. JUSTICE BREYER: What's the problem with10 11 12 13 1415 that? That16 its money to put CAT scans in hospitals. And it has17 certain beneficiaries, and one group of beneficiaries is18 the Association of Catholic Hospitals, another is the￼is to say, suppose that the government gives19 Association Of Jewish Hospitals, another is a set of20 totally secular hospitals. So it gives the tax credits21 to all three. Now, of course, the Catholic group is22 going to give it to Catholic hospitals and so forth.23 What's wrong with that?24 MR. BENDER: I don't get your hypothetical.25 If the government -­511 JUSTICE BREYER: What they do is they have2 government money, just like you claim this is, and they3 say we are going to give it to some -- to umbrella4 organizations, like the Association of Catholics,5 Jewish, or secular hospitals, and we expect them to6 distribute it. And they will, of course, distribute it7 to those who are their members. And in some cases,8 their members are religious organizations, and in some9 cases, they're not. Now, what's the difference between10 that and what happens here, leaving the student out of11 it?12 MR. BENDER: It depends on who the13 beneficiaries of the government's program are.14 JUSTICE BREYER: The beneficiaries of the15 government -- Catholic hospital -- government CAT scan16 program will be Catholic hospitals, because they're the17 ones who belong to the Catholic hospital association.18 Money will also go to the secular hospital association,19 as it goes -- would go to a secular STO here. So I20 don't see that part. That's the last prong we're21 talking about.22 MR. BENDER: I'm not clear on your program.23 If it's a government program to benefit hospitals, that24 -- the benefits have to go to hospitals on a religiously25 neutral basis.52￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: The government says -­2 that's the difference -- the government says -- it does3 give the money away on a religiously neutral basis. It4 gives it to hospital associations. It turns out that5 some of those naturally are supposed to give it to their6 members, all of whom will be religiously affiliated.7 MR. BENDER: But the hospitals are the8 beneficiaries, Justice Breyer. That's the difference.9 The beneficiaries here are not the STOs; the10 beneficiaries here are the parents. The STOs are a11 conduit of government funds to the parents. The parents12 are the beneficiaries, and the Constitution requires13 that the benefits of a government spending program go to14 the beneficiaries on a religiously neutral basis. And15 so in Zelman, the beneficiaries were the parents, and16 the vouchers had to go to them -­17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry -­18 MR. BENDER: -- on a religiously neutral19 basis.20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- I don't21 understand the answer to Justice Breyer's question. His22 question was, you give it to a hospital equivalent of23 the STO, and then that gives it to hospitals on a24 religiously discriminatory basis. Why aren't the25 hospitals the beneficiaries of that program, just as you53￼1 say the parents are here.2 MR. BENDER: Well, if the hospitals are the3 beneficiary of the program, then the hospitals have to4 get the money on a religiously neutral basis. Suppose5 the parent -­6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they're the7 ones who get the CAT scan -­8 MR. BENDER: The analogy would be the9 patients are the beneficiaries of the program. The10 government wants to help cancer patients, and so it's11 going to give money to hospitals to help cancer12 patients. So it gives money to various hospitals under13 Justice Breyer's program. If one of those hospitals14 says we only treat Catholic cancer patients, that's15 unconstitutional. That's government funds -­16 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the other issue. We17 are trying to separate in your argument the issue that18 some of these organizations are religiously affiliated,19 from the argument that, moreover, they will only give20 money to individuals of a particular religion.21 Now, I understand your argument for the22 latter, but I must say I don't understand your argument23 for the former. Not if you accept these other -­24 MR. BENDER: If I go to get a scholarship25 from an organization and they say where are you going to54￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425send your child with this scholarship? And I say I haven't made that decision yet. And they say, well, we'll only give you the scholarship if you send your child to a Jewish school which teaches people how to pray in the way Jewish people pray and has a -- its education is Jewish religious education. That's religious discrimination.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Now, Mr. Katyal, you have 4 minutesremaining.REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYALON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAESUPPORTING PETITIONERSGENERAL KATYAL: Thank you.My friend said, I think I have this right,"we are talking about my clients whose money is being used to fund this program." That's a nice description of Flast. It is not a description of what's going on here. Flast recognized a special -- well, a special solicitude for taxpayers when money is taken out of their pocket and used to fund religion against their conscience. Here, even if you accept all of this public money discussion that has been happening, not a cent of their money is going to fund -­JUSTICE BREYER: But in Flast -- I've looked55￼1 at it again2 wonderfully3 4briefly, and it seemed to use thatprecise word "nexus."(Laughter.)JUSTICE BREYER: And you're quite right that5 in Flast that was the case. But why isn't it -- given6 that it's a nexus in Flast, what was in Flast, why isn't7 it also a nexus where you have this complicated system8 which is designed to make the ordinary taxpayer pay a9 little more in this kind of instance, where what you've10 done is directly subtract from the treasury $5,000 cash11 to turn over, in the view of12 forbidden religious purpose?13 GENERAL KATYAL:14 First, the relevant language15 It's not the nexus test; it's the definition of what the16 actual taxpayer standing claim is. And it requires17 that, quote, "his tax money being extracted was" -­18 JUSTICE BREYER: Was that -- was that in19 that instance in Flast? Does Flast rule out the20 possibility -­21 GENERAL KATYAL: And that's the general22 description, Flast says, about how taxpayer standing23 will go forward. If there's any doubt about that,24 Valley Forge makes that clear because the dissenters25 said exactly what you said, which is, look, let's just56the plaintiffs, to a purelyJustice Breyer, two things. of Flast is at page 106.￼1 look to economic effects, and that alone will be enough.2 And it's just Property Clause, Tax and Spending Clause,3 it doesn't really matter; it's the bottom line on the4 treasury. And this Court said no, that isn't the case.5 JUSTICE KAGAN: General Katyal, Flast could6 not have meant that it's your particular dollar. There7 would be no way to know it's your particular dollar, and8 that would be a silly and fictional thing to say as the9 plurality opinion in Hein makes clear. What Flast said10 was that taxpayer dollars, not your dollar, but taxpayer11 dollars are going to this activity in the same way that12 it's going to the activity here.13 GENERAL KATYAL: I disagree on two levels.14 First is I don't think that's what Flast is. I think15 Flast is about that micro-fraction of a cent that is16 coming from your pocket and being used to fund religion.17 And that's what Madison complained about. It may be18 very small; it may be 3 pence. But there's a special19 harm of conscience when it's your money, your￼20 hard-earned21 as to which2223 in the way that Justice Breyer said. And here, there's24 a taxpayer challenging a provision of the tax code,money, being used to fund a program directly you don't like.JUSTICE KAGAN: Flast talked about a nexus25 enacted pursuant to the tax and spending power, that -­571 that grants a tax benefit. That's as close a nexus as2 you are going to get using the language of Flast.3 GENERAL KATYAL: Again, I think that doesn't4 deal with the direct injury on the taxpayer, which is5 the language of Flast. Even if we -- even if you6 disagree with me, the relief -- the harm here is a lot7 more speculative, just like Cuno, because you have to8 posit, in order for the harm to exist to this taxpayer,9 that tax credits will cost the government money, not10 save it, that his tax burden will go up as opposed to11 someone else's tax burden, a corporation and the like,12 or you have to posit that the government won't cut13 spending in order to make up the shortfall in revenues14 that he says is going to exist. You're going to have to15 do all of those things, none of which you have to do in16 a Flast situation because it's just a direct outlay of17 funds.18 If I could just can spend a moment on19 Justice Kennedy's question about State action, which, of20 course, they didn't advance below as the Ninth Circuit21 said. I think this Court's precedents are quite clear22 in saying that the fact that the government regulates or23 funds something doesn't transform it into a State actor.24 If it did, then all 501(c)(3)'s would become State25 actors, and that, I think, would be an enormously58￼1 damaging precedent for this Court to follow. Rather, I2 think what Blum says is that it requires the performance3 of a traditional executive prerogative -- traditional4 government prerogative. And here all the STO is doing5 is just funding -- it's handing out money. It is doing6 so on a neutral basis. Anyone can form an STO, and7 anyone can fund one.8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General,9 counsel.10 The case is submitted.11 (Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the12 above-entitled
