ASARCO.      Mr. Streett.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON STREETTON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. STREETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      At the end of a bankruptcy case, aprofessional must file a detailed fee application.Numerous interested parties may object and the courtmust hold a hearing to resolve those objections and makean independent assessment of reasonable compensation.      Each of those steps is indispensable toaccurately determining the professional's core fees andthe estate's administrative expenses, allowing thetrustee to close the case and ultimately pay theestate's creditors.      Everyone agrees that preparing theapplication is compensable as reflected by Section330(a)(6)'s guidance for determining the amount of thatcompensation.  Defending the application againstobjections is an inseparable part of that samecode­mandated process.  There is no principle basis and3￼MR. STREETT: It would certainly not the vast majority of cases. For example, in the Chapter 7 case the trustee hires a professional, trustee wishes to pay the professional fully for good work, and the debtor comes in and objects.      By defending that application against thedebtor's objections, the professional is servingtrustee.  The same thing happened here where thedebtor ­­be intypicalthehisthe￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425certainly no textual basis for categorically banningcompensation for that next step.      To the contrary ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the principle basis, as I understand it, is that when you prepare it,you're ­­ you're serving the ­­ the trustee. You're serving his needs but when, you know, if he's disallowing it, you're, to the contrary, acting against the trustee's interest. Isn't that a principle distinction?JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay So you'd acknowledge it's okay if the trustee objects, then he doesn't have to pay, right?      MR. STREETT:Your Honor, but ­­      JUSTICE SCALIA:      MR. STREETT:I would not acknowledge that,   I didn't think you would.But that is the reason there4￼12345 no ­­ 610 example, the estate paid all of Baker Botts's core fees11 and wanted to pay all those fees, and you had ASARCO12 coming in as the reorganized company and objecting. So,13 again, I don't think that is true in the vast ­­ in14 many, many cases. And typically it's not the case in15 the Chapter 7 case. As the National Association of16 Bankruptcy Trustees point out as amicus, a trustee is17 not going to be able to retain competent and skilled18 counsel if the debtor is going to be able to dilute that.19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If you hired another law20 firm to fight this objection, would that other law firm21 have been entitled to fees too?22 MR. STREETT: It would possibly be entitled23 to fees through 330(a)(1)(b). I think in your24 hypothetical you're assuming that the other law firm25 would not be approved by the trustee as an estate5should not be a categorical ­­      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                                    But the trustee is not                              That's correct, and there's          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:7 as much money as it can to give to the creditors.8 That's the purpose, right?9 MR. STREETT: Well, in this case, forthe estate.      MR. STREETT:The estate wants to keep9 bankruptcy court can pay all of10 trustee has hired their lawyer?11 MR. STREETT: Yes.12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:their legal fees, if theApproved their lawyer?they have to assume the￼1 professional. So that's the on/off switch for2 compensation under 330(a), a compensation as a service3 rendered. So the only possible way they could be4 compensated would be as an expense for rendering a5 service to the estate professional.6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I just want to7 understand your rule completely. Anybody who prepares a8 fee application ­­ an accountant, an expert ­­ the13 But if the trustee hasn't, then14 costs of fighting ­­15 MR. STREETT: No, your Honor, that's not our16 position for two reasons. First of all, there's two17 ways to get compensated under 330(a). There's18 (a)(1)(a), which is compensation for services rendered19 by a professional hired by the estate. And then there's20 (a)(1)(b) which is expenses, and that's things like21 experts, outside contractors that the estate22 professionals hires to help him or her do the services.23 So in the context of an accountant who hired24 a law firm to prepare and defend its fee application ­­25 it happens all the time; accountants can't do it6￼1 themselves ­­ that outside law firm would be compensable2 as an expense to the accountant.3 Now, of course, ASARCO's position would4 categorically ban all compensation for law firms, even5 those retained by the trustee that defend their fee6 application; it would categorically ban compensation by7 the accountants.8 And the problem with ASARCO's position is9 that everything you can say about defending a fee10 application is also true about preparing a fee application11 in the context of a statute. They both are paid out12 of the estate. They both diminish the estate in that13 way. They're both something that the code requires ­­14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I take it you ­­ excuse15 me. If the trustee objects and there's a lengthy16 hearing, I take it you would still say that you get fees17 for participating in that hearing.18 MR. STREETT: Yes, that's correct.19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. So the fact20 that ASARCO came in is really irrelevant to the ­­ to21 this case.22 MR. STREETT: I don't think it's irrelevant23 because it shows the error of the Fifth Circuit's way in24 adopting a categorical rule that prohibits compensation,25 even when the trustee wants to pay the professional the7￼1 full amount. That's the only reason I really made that2 particular point.3 And that's the only argument that's before4 this Court, is a categorical ban under the statute on5 compensating the professional for defending his fee6 application regardless of who objects.7 And I think this Court has already rejected8 the distinction that Justice Scalia suggested between9 preparing and defending the fee application. In its10 opinion in Jean, where the Court said there's, quote, no11 textual or logical argument for treating so differently12 a party's preparation of a fee application and its13 ensuing efforts to support that application.14 And the Court ­­15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That was in the context16 of a fee splitting statute though.17 MR. STREETT: That's correct. And the fee18 shifting context is the proper analogy here. Of course19 we don't claim 330(a) is formally a fee shifting20 statute. We're seeking payment from the estate for work21 that the code requires us to do as part of our work.22 But the fee shifting analogy is accurate for23 a couple reasons. First of all, in the fee shifting24 statute and in the bankruptcy statute, the professional25 must file an application and have his fees approved by8￼1 the court. And as in the fee­shifting regime, the2 bankruptcy professional's application is opened up to a3 wide range of objectors who are not the professional's4 client. So all of this leads to, in both the5 fee­shifting and the bankruptcy regime, a concern that6 the professional's fees for his core work will be7 diluted by the professional being forced to defend those8 core fees.9 And, in fact, those concerns are heightened10 much more in the bankruptcy context for a few reasons,11 because in bankruptcy, the fee application is far more12 detailed and gives far more opportunity to ­­ to pick13 and ­­ and object and a far greater range of objectors14 are available, the U.S. trustee, the court itself, the15 creditors, the creditors committees. All of those can16 come in and object that do not exist in the fee­shifting17 context.18 And Congress recognized this concern in19 Section 330(a)(3)(f) by codifying the factor that20 bankruptcy professionals be compensated at parity with21 non­bankruptcy professionals.22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but just ­­ on23 the parity point, if you're not doing bankruptcy work24 and you send the client a bill and they don't pay it, if25 you've got to take litigation action or whatever, you9￼1 don't get paid ­­ you don't get those fees back. We2 follow the normal American rule and you pay your own3 fees and if you win, good; if not, you don't.4 MR. STREETT: That's right. And that would,5 of course, also be true of preparing the bill or the6 invoice which is compensable under bankruptcy. So7 Congress departed from that regime and, again, it gets8 back to the two reasons the fee­shifting cases are9 analogous because, outside of bankruptcy, a professional10 doesn't have to go to the court to have his fees11 approved. It's a structural parity difference. Outside12 of bankruptcy, the professional doesn't submit his13 application to ­­ to a gallery of potential objectors,14 and that's why bankruptcy is structurally different.15 And that's why Congress recognized in Section16 330(a)(4)(A)(ii) that services necessary to case17 administration do fall within the bankruptcy court's18 discretion to compensate.19 And when you read Section 330(a)(6)'s20 reflection that preparing the fee application is21 compensable, it's clearly not authorizing compensation22 for preparing it, ASARCO concedes that, it's23 authorized under Section 330(a)(1)(A) as a service24 rendered, and it's most naturally falls within25 Section 330(a)(4)(A)(ii) as a service necessary to case10￼1 administration. And that's because it assists the2 trustees. The trustee has to see the case all the way3 through to its completion. It has to make a final4 accounting of the case. It has to administer and close5 the case. And none of those things can happen until the6 fee application is not just prepared, but litigated.7 Section 330(a)(1)(A) reflects that not only8 the application must be prepared but there may be9 objections by either of the parties in interest, the10 trustees, or the court itself, and then the court must11 hold a hearing. That's all ­­ those are all textual12 bases for compensating the defense of the fee13 application. Those are things that the code requires,14 and they're all compensable for the same reasons as15 compensating the preparation of the application.16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Streett, do you have17 a position on enhancements? If ­­ if the creditors say18 that enhancement is ­­ you did a good job but it's not19 worth the enhancement, is defending the enhancement20 also, under your rule, compensable?21 MR. STREETT: We believe it would be22 compensable, in the sense that it passes by the minimal23 compensability threshold that puts it into24 bankruptcy court discretion. Now, bankruptcy courts25 must consider the (a)(3) factors in determining whether1125 JUSTICE BREYER:And you do it and it￼1 that will be actually compensated and the amount. And2 courts consider, for example, the nature and value of3 the service.4 And a court could reasonably conclude in its5 discretion that the nature and value of seeking an6 enhancement is not the same as the nature and value of7 defending the core fee application. Many courts have8 reached that conclusion. At the end of the day, that's9 where the courts came out here, and we didn't ­­ we10 didn't challenge that on appeal.11 JUSTICE BREYER: You practice in bankruptcy.12 I mean, you know it pretty well because what I was13 trying to think of, which is really balancing on the14 side, but the phrase "likely to benefit," it has ­­ it15 says "likely to benefit."16 Now, it seems to me there must be instances17 where you, representing the ­­ the debtor, hire18 accountants or various others to do technical work,19 conveying and where ­­ where, in fact, it's quite clear20 that it won't mean more money for the debtor. It will21 mean less money for the debtor, because it will discover22 all kinds of assets they didn't even think the debtor23 had, but that's part of your job.24 MR. STREETT: Correct.12￼1 benefits only the creditor. And I take it, it's rather2 clear, you get compensated for that.3 MR. STREETT:4 JUSTICE BREYER:5 just ­­6 MR. STREETT:7 Your Honor, and that's why there are two prongs within8 Section 330(a)(4)(A)(ii). Congress recognized that not9 everything the professional does is going to produce an10 immediate, direct benefit to the estate. In the11 legislative history we discuss at pages 37 and 38 shows12 that Congress added the prong compensating tasks that13 were necessary to case administration.14 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, then you're in15 trouble, because if ­­ if all those things ­­ I mean,16 there are a set of things, such that when you carry them17 out through accountants or conveyers or others, will in18 fact cost the estate a lot of money. Possibly more than19 they ever dreamt. And yet it's part of your job. Now,20 if that's not considered as being of benefit to the21 estate, but rather, part of the administration of the22 estate, then I don't see how this falls within benefit23 to the estate. I mean, if you're really making that24 distinction.25 MR. STREETT: The way ­­13Yes, and that ­­   Is that right?  Am IThat's absolutely correct,￼1 JUSTICE BREYER:2 the estate, then this would have to be administration of3 the estate. But this isn't administration of the4 estate, and therefore, it's left out.5 MR. STREETT: We agree that this is6 administration of the case for the ­­7 JUSTICE BREYER:8 administration. In other9 falls within (a). You're10 MR. STREETT:11 We think the most natural12 the administration of the13 structure of section 330(a)(4)(A)(ii) reflects that the14 professional's service need only be necessary to the15 administration of the case­­16 JUSTICE BREYER: I see.17 MR. STREETT: ­­ of the case or beneficial18 to the estate, because Congress recognized there are19 going to be a lot of things that a professional has to20 do, as Justice Breyer said, that may cost money in the21 short run. But they're necessary to carry out the22 administration of the case. We think that's where23 preparing the fee application comes in, under (a)1 and24 (a)(4)(A)(ii), and the very next inseparable step is25 defending the fee application.14If that's administration of   Oh, you're saying this iswords, you're not saying itsaying it falls within (b).It falls within either one.home for it is necessary tocase.  And Congress ­­ theMR. STREETT: I don't think ­­￼1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:2 important aspect of difference which is in everything3 else, you're acting for the estate. When you're4 defending fees, you're acting for yourself. There is a5 self­interest involved because you could just give up on6 the objections and walk away. The only reason you're7 fighting them is because it puts more money in your8 pocket.91011 money 1213 would14 The professional could just work pro bono or could15 decide to discount 20 percent of its rights on the ­­ on16 the fee application. All of those things are ­­ ASARCO17 has tried to say that preparing and defending the fee18 application are adverse to the estate because it takes19 money out of the estate. Well, that cannot be the test.20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, except that21 preparing the fee application: A, it's specifically22 allowed by statute; and B, if they compensate you for23 that, there's ­­ then you'll do a very careful job, and24 there will be less necessity to have to defend it. So25 it ­­ so there ­­ it is certainly a rational reason15JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:in the estate's pocket.Not because it puts moreMR. STREETT: Yes. But all of those things be equally true of preparing the fee application.You're ignoring one￼1 for the distinction.2 MR. STREETT: Well, let me take that3 question in two parts, because I think if Congress4 drafted the statute to say preparing the fee application5 is compensable, then we would have a very different6 case. But it didn't say that. It said any compensation7 awarded for preparing the fee application shall be8 awarded at this rate. So it presupposed that preparing9 the fee application was authorized under Section10 330(a)(4) ­­ (a)(1)(A) as ASARCO even concedes on 12 ­­11 on page 12 of its brief.12 So you can't draw any negative inference13 from the fact that it's mentioned for the purpose of14 limiting it, that defending a fee application would not15 also be compensable.16 But to your second point, Your Honor, we17 agree Congress wanted to encourage people to do a18 careful job preparing the fee application. Baker Botts19 did that here. But that did not stop ASARCO from coming20 in and ­­ and mounting a barrage of objections that eat21 up professional fees. So just the careful preparation22 of the application doesn't solve the question. And23 that's why Congress codified Section 330(a)(3)(F) and24 the parity factor, and that's why bankruptcy courts for25 decades have been responsibly exercising the discretion16￼1 that Section 330(a)(1) gives them. Congress could have2 enumerated all of the tasks that are compensable in3 bankruptcy, but it didn't do that. It's ­­4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But people know ­­ I5 mean, the American rule in the legal area is very6 fundamental, and it strikes me bankruptcy is one of7 those areas where they go into considerable detail8 telling you who pays what and when you can get it, just9 like you say here. You get compensation for preparing10 the fee at this particular level. And to say that11 somewhere in ­­ in all this, you sort of cut and paste12 these things together and you say, oh, there it shows13 that they meant fees on fees to be awarded. It seems to14 me that if they wanted to go against the basic American15 rule ­­ that’s the American rule, patriotic ­­ they16 would have ­­ they would have spelled that out a little17 more clearly.18 MR. STREETT: Congress certainly could have19 done that, but that's simply not the way it wrote20 330(a). You're right, Your Honor, it listed in many21 other statutes nine options for things, but in this, it22 just said, courts may award reasonable compensation for23 services rendered with very narrow and express24 prohibitions. The Fifth Circuit erred by superimposing25 a categorical ban on that flexible statute.171 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      And if I could reserve the remainder of mytime.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.      Mr. Fletcher.    ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. BRIAN H. FLETCHER   ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,        SUPPORTING PETITIONERSMR. FLETCHER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      We agree with Petitioners that when abankruptcy professional is seeking compensation underSection 330(a) successfully defends its fee application,the bankruptcy court may increase the amount of theaward to compensate for the time it reasonably spent onthe fee defense.  But we reach that result for asomewhat different reason.      In our view, preparing and defending a feeapplication are not themselves services rendered for aclient within the meaning of Section 330(a)(1)(A).  Andthey are not independent grounds for compensation.      Instead, compensation for the successfuldefense of a fee application may be appropriate becauseit ensures that the professional receives thestatutorily prescribed reasonable compensation for theservices it rendered in the underlying bankruptcy case.18￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE BREYER: Where does it fall within the (4)(A)?MR.

(4)(A) ­­JUSTICE BREYER: If it's not subject to (4)(A) at all ­­ I mean, (4)(A) forbids certain ­­ it says you can't ­­ cannot allow compensation for, and then, you know, it has the list there.

Our view is that when you are preparing and defending your own fee application, that does not fall within the category of services at all.JUSTICE BREYER: So where ­­ where is the authorization to give it then?MR. FLETCHER: In the authorization in Section 330(a)(1)(A) that says you can allow reasonable compensation for the underlying service that the bankruptcy professional has rendered in the bankruptcy case.      So here, for example, Baker Botts prosecuted19￼￼1 the ­­ the fraudulent conveyance action, among many2 other things. And the bankruptcy court applied the3 lodestar method and it determined that reasonable hours4 times reasonable rates required a certain amount of5 compensation in order to make Baker Botts ­­6 JUSTICE BREYER: Where does it say that you7 can get the money that's necessary for you to get the ­­8 the money you pay to get the reasonable compensation.9 Where does it say you get that?10 MR. FLETCHER: There's no explicit11 provision.12 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, then, I13 mean, suppose that you had to go through enormous14 trouble to get what they paid you. They paid you and15 you ­­ you know, some kind of Voltavian bonds or16 something ­­ you know, you imagine all kinds of17 circumstances where it costs a lot of money to get the18 money they paid you, and I just wonder where does it say19 you can do that.20 MR. FLETCHER: Well, Justice Breyer, what I21 think is different about this is that the things that22 you have to do to get paid when you're a bankruptcy23 professional that we're here concerned with here are24 things that are creatures of the bankruptcy system25 itself and 330(a) itself. Section 330(a) says if you're2025 JUSTICE ALITO:Why ­­ I'm sorry.  Go ahead.￼1 a professional and you want to get paid reasonable2 compensation, you have to submit a very detailed fee3 application. And then in order to ensure that that4 application meets the statutory requirements, we're5 going to open it to scrutiny by the judge, by the U.S.6 Trustee, and by the parties in interest, and allow them7 to raise objections. And all of that ­­8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:9 administration?10 MR. FLETCHER:11 MR. STREETT:12 be on either a service, or a benefit, or a need in the13 administration of the estate.14 MR. FLETCHER: So our view is that the15 problem with it is that sort of Section 330(a)(1)(A) is16 the sort of starting point, and it says reasonable17 compensation for actual necessary services rendered.18 And then (a)(4) limits which services are compensable.19 It says in order to be compensable, you either have to20 be necessary to the administration of the case or for21 the benefit of the debtor.22 We don't think that preparing and defending23 your own fee application is a service rendered at all.24 And so we don't think it's subject to the (a)(4) limits.21So why isn't that in the I'm sorry, Justice Sotomayor.Well, he claims that it could￼1 MR. FLETCHER: I was just going to say,2 instead, we think the question that the bankruptcy court3 should be asking is, do we need to provide some4 additional award to make the professional whole for the5 extra time and costs that they had to go through to6 vindicate their right to get their award of compensation7 for the underlying services ­­8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Sounds like a policy9 judgment. You're basically saying it's not in the10 statute, but this is how we do it and as Justice ­­ as11 the Chief Justice pointed out, normal attorneys outside12 the bankruptcy court don't get compensated for fee13 disputes.14 MR. FLETCHER: Well, we ­­ we do think it15 makes a good sense, the rule that we're advocating, but16 we also think it's grounded in the statute and in the17 way that this Court has addressed other statutes that18 also provide for awards of reasonable attorneys fees.19 JUSTICE ALITO: Why isn't the problem here20 better dealt with by sanctions? If a party like ASARCO21 makes frivolous objections, then they ­­ then sanctions22 can be imposed on them.

But we think that7 there can be a broad range of objections that while not8 frivolous or not sanctionable are still found to be9 meritless, and that unless the professional is10 compensated for the time it has to spend in responding11 to those objections, it's underlying ­­ its award of12 compensation for its underlying services is going to be13 diluted below a reasonable level­­14 JUSTICE SCALIA: No more so than ­­ than15 the ­­ the lawyer who submits a bill outside of16 bankruptcy to a client, and the client objects, and the17 lawyer has to ­­ has to litigate.

FLETCHER: But the Section 330(a)10 creates a structure where it's not just your client that11 you have to please, and the showing that you have to12 make isn't just that I perform services that are within13 the terms of our contract. You have to satisfy the14 bankruptcy judge and are subject to objections, not just15 from your client, but also from the U.S. Trustee and16 from lots of other parties in interest. And they can17 object not just on the grounds that18 within the meaning of the contract,19 grounds that you didn't satisfy any20 requirements of the Section 330(a).21 And we think that because that imposes sort22 of extra costs on bankruptcy professionals, the reasonable23 approach, and the approach that's consistent with the24 way that this Court handles and others have handled the25 same sorts of costs that are imposed on attorneys24you didn't performbut also on theof the many￼1 seeking fees under fee­shifting statutes, is to say that2 when you successfully defend your fee application, this3 doesn't apply when you fail, we don't ­­ we very4 strongly believe that if you are unsuccessful in5 defending your fee application, you should not receive6 an additional award.7 JUSTICE BREYER: What was your reason for8 not going with the administration of the estate? And my9 intuitive judgment of it, which is pretty not totally10 informed, of course, is there ­­ there are loads of11 things that ­­ that ­­ that lawyers do who represent a12 trustee ­­ who represent debtors, that it will cost the13 estate a lot of money. And you can't say all of them14 are for the benefit of the estate. And there are loads15 of things they do to help administer the estate and hire16 all kinds of people. And ­­ and paying their fees is17 part of the administration, I would think, normally.18 Why don't you see the paying of the lawyer19 as part of the administration of the estate? And if you20 see the part ­­ that part as part of the administration21 of the estate, then you'd see that the administrative22 expenses necessary to secure that payment are part of23 the administration.24 I mean, so you had some reason over there in25 the Justice Department of saying, no, we don't follow25JUSTICE BREYER:MR. FLETCHER:JUSTICE BREYER:No. Right.￼1 that route, and ­­ and I'm not. And so that ­­ of2 course, that creates a difficulty because I think, well,3 if your judgment is don't follow that route, then I ­­ I4 better be careful about following it myself. And ­­ and5 you know more about it in a sense, so ­­ so explain that6 to me. 78910111213141516171819202122232425MR. FLETCHER: Well, Justice Breyer, we ­­ we basically take an earlier term. In ­­ in our view, you don't get to (a)(4) in asking about the preparation of defense of a fee application because (a)(4) tells you which services are compensable.                             No, I understand yourargument, and all know that's true about it.  I justwonder you're ­­ you're studying this.  You're trying todevelop a position.

FLETCHER: So I ­­ I think if you were going to ­­ you disagree with our position and your view is that this is a service, and so the question is, Does it fall within either of the categories under Section 4 that make it compensable.

It's, frankly, because ordinarily,services are compensable whether the attorney wins orloses, and we are very concerned about making sure thatpeople don't get paid for unsuccessfully defending theirfee applications, and that's what's led us tothe position we’ve taken.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Oldham.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY OLDHAM       ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. OLDHAM: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      Section 330(a) of the bankruptcy codecompensates all types of professionals for theirservices rendered for the estate under Section 327(a).But when adversarial fee litigation arises and aprofessional either hires a lawyer or just happens to bea lawyer and engages in purely self­interested feelitigation work at the expense of the estate, that isnot a service rendered on behalf of the estate withinthe meaning of Section 330(a).  There is simply nothingin the statute that authorizes estate funds for aprofessional to engage in self­interested litigation,29￼￼1 particularly in light of the American Rule, which2 requires, and for 200 years plus, has required that3 Congress speak clearly when it wants to reallocate the4 costs of litigation.5 And I'd like to ­­6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:7 into this?8 MR. OLDHAM:9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:10 fee ­­ the fee preparation fee.11 MR. OLDHAM: And I want to go straight to12 that question. Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kennedy13 also put their finger on exactly the fundamental14 distinction between preparing a fee application and15 litigating over a fee application. And it's that when16 an accountant, for example, goes and hires­­ excuse me,17 does accounting services and then provides an itemized18 bill to explain to the ­­ to their client why they are19 charging what they're charging, that is a benefit to the20 trustee. The ­­ the "please remit to" line may not be a21 benefit, but certainly the itemized ­­ itemization in22 that bill is a benefit to the trustee and to the estate.23 And at that point, they're still on the same team.24 But when an accountant then gets into a fee25 dispute and has to go hire his or her own lawyer and is30So how does the fee fitI'm sorry?       The ­­ the fee, the￼1 in litigation against the estate, they're not on the2 same team anymore. There is no sense in which, at that3 point in time, the accountant is serving the estate.4 And I think that fundamental difference matters5 textually under Section 330(a), and it's very6 significant under the American Rule because ­­7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Oldham, why aren't8 they all tied together so you recognize that the9 application for the fee is compensable?10 MR. OLDHAM: Correct.11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's like the opening12 pleading. Then the objection is the answer to the13 application, and then the response to the objection is14 the ­­ the defense of it. It seems to me it's ­­ it's15 all one package, that it ­­ the application, and there's16 an answer to the application, and then there's a reply.17 It ­­ why don't those three things go18 together?19 MR. OLDHAM: Well, I don't think they go20 together because Congress didn't put them together.21 What Congress authorized under Section 330(a)(1),22 especially when read together with Section 327(a), is23 that professionals are entitled to compensation when24 they're working for the estate.25 But when ­­ when professionals have hired31￼1 their own lawyers or happen to be lawyers and are2 litigating adverse to the estate, that is not ­­ they're3 not on the same team anymore. And so under 330(a)(1)4 and 327(a), Congress has just simply not allowed5 compensation for that, which is the same as it would be6 outside of bankruptcy.7 And all we're asking for in this case is the8 same rule that generally applies outside of bankruptcy.9 Because outside of bankruptcy the American Rule controls10 and says that if you get into a fee litigation dispute11 with your client, then you pay your own way. And so the12 same rule should apply in bankruptcy.13 And I want to address why Congress might14 have authorized compensation for preparation services15 inside the bankruptcy context when that also is not16 compensable outside of the bankruptcy context. And that17 is because certainly in 1994, when Congress enacted18 Section (a)(6), there's a vast difference in the amount19 of time and the amount of effort that goes into putting20 together a fee application in bankruptcy and putting21 together a bill for the client.22 Now, certainly, it's ­­ as time has gone on,23 clients require more and more detail in bills and24 that ­­ that difference might be diminished. But there25 is ­­ because in bankruptcy a fee application is3225 JUSTICE KENNEDY:Well, I've ­­ I've been￼1 required to be filed, it made perfect sense for Congress2 to come in in (a)(6) and say you get compensated for3 that.4 But what's not different between bankruptcy5 practice and outside of bankruptcy practice is fee6 litigation. When fee litigation arises, the American7 Rule applies and says inside or outside of bankruptcy,8 you pay your own way. And so Congress did not need to9 say anything different about that in Section A ­­ in10 Section (A)(i).11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do lawyers these12 days actually charge private clients for fee13 preparation?14 MR. OLDHAM:15 extent to which overhead16 but certainly, no lawyer17 know, time spent preparing this bill, but the fact that18 they're not charging for it doesn't mean that it's not a19 benefit to the client because, again, when the ­­ I20 think most clients, when they get a bill and see that21 they have to pay, say, $100,000, it's a pretty good22 benefit to them to know why they have to pay $100,000,23 and to be able to object if they feel that there's, you24 know, an objection warranted to that bill for $100,000.No.  Well, there might be someaccounts for things like that,is going to put on a bill, you331 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425out of practice for half a century, but my ­­ my ­­ mythought was that ­­ that ­­ that lawyers do ­­ do chargefor the amount of time preparing the bill.  Maybe I'mwrong about that.out.MR. OLDHAM:JUSTICE KENNEDY:Well, again, I ­­     We can ­­ we can check it￼      MR. OLDHAM:lawyers do that is to the extent that ­­ that it's builtinto overhead.  But I don't think that generally, as apractice, otherwise, of lawyers marking down their timefor it, and I think that would probably be a shock tomost clients to hear that you ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You ought to think ­­ might want to think about it.(Laughter.)JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is ­­ is there any writing that says that when lawyers, outside bankruptcy, determine their ­­ their fee structures, that they include reimbursement for the risk that they might have to go into court to defend it? I've never heard that.MR. OLDHAM: Well ­­ and we ­­ we cite the Gibbons­Grable case in our brief, but there's ­­ there's a number of things that go into, you know, rate setting for law firms and one of them certainly is a risk of34I think the only sense in which￼1 nonpayment. Another one is a risk of collections.2 If you ­­ if you have a particular client3 where you're afraid of collections, you might also4 have ­­ want a retainer and things like that. But,5 yeah, rates account for a variety of things like risk of6 nonpayment and risk of collection. And I think that7 goes to an important point about bankruptcy practice,8 which is that bankruptcy lawyers use non­bankruptcy9 market rates. And so, to the extent that they are using10 a non­bankruptcy market rate, they're already getting11 some ­­ you know, some amount in their rates that12 accounts for the risk of dilution.13 JUSTICE BREYER: On that theory, if ­­ I14 mean, if ­­ if you're supposed to get some fees ­­ say,15 $100,000 ­­ and in that fee is ­­ is various risks of16 the extra money it'll cost to collect or the extra risk17 of you won't get it, you'll only get half and ­­ and18 you ­­ you set the rate at 100,000.19 And so now a different risk is eventuated ­­20 namely, you had to go to litigation ­­ and that wasn't21 in the 100,000. Well, then, if it's reasonable and22 everything, why shouldn't it be?23 I mean, why is ­­ you're ­­ you're trying24 to, in that 100,000, give the employer something for25 their ­­ for their time and their effort and also35￼1 compensate certain risks. And here was one that wasn't2 in the 100,000. It turned up later. But how would you3 draw a line between some and the other? I think that's4 the government's theory.5 MR. OLDHAM: That's right, Your Honor. And6 I think the American Rule draws the line, because if ­­7 if it were the case that anytime a damages award or8 anytime a fee award had to be defended, therefore, we9 need to give them more, the American Rule wouldn't10 exist.11 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, no, of course, it12 doesn't exist ­­ you're quite right ­­ outside of13 bankruptcy.14 But now you're saying that the 100,000 does15 include all kinds of ­­ for various payments for things16 that might make it more expensive to get the money. And17 then what I don't see is saying some and not others.18 MR. OLDHAM: Well, I think ­­19 JUSTICE BREYER: And this is just one of20 them, I mean, the ­­ that you have to go into court and21 litigate, is just one of them. You wouldn't object, for22 example, if the fee ­­ the judge says, look. We're23 going to give the firm 120, why not 100?24 Well, you know, there are risks in this; and25 one of the risks is they're going to have to go to court36      JUSTICE BREYER:      MR. OLDHAM:      JUSTICE BREYER:pursuing.      JUSTICE KENNEDY:    All right.­­ non­bankruptcy market.￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425and somebody will sue them and they have to go litigatethat.  So we'll give it to them upfront to pay for therisk, just as you pay for the risk of nonpayment.MR. OLDHAM: Well, I think we would object to that, Your Honor, and I ­­JUSTICE BREYER: Because?MR. OLDHAM: Because if ­­ if ­­ if the conscious decision is made that $100,000 is reasonable compensation for the services they're about to render ­­JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. It's ­­ it's not. Only ­­ actually, only 90 is. But it's reasonable compensation because 10 compensates for risks such as risks of nonpayment.Am I being clear? Do you see where I'm going?MR. OLDHAM: I do, Your Honor. If I can make two responses: The first is that, you know, building in for certain risks in a rate is one thing and the way that the bankruptcy system accounts for that is it looks to non­market ­­37Maybe this is not worth And that was ­­ that was1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425my question.  Can you tell me, if ­­ if a distinguishedlaw firm represents a trustee in bankruptcy, does thelaw firm charge its regular rate?MR. OLDHAM: Yes. Generally speaking, they will ­­ they will ­­ they will ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: The same rate that it would charge to a ­­ to a non­bankruptcy client.MR. OLDHAM: That's correct. I mean, Congress, you know, wanted parity in Section ­­ in ­­ in Section 330(a). And so, generally speaking, what ­­ what Congress effected in 1978 was to make clear that bankruptcy lawyers can get the same market rates that they would get outside of bankruptcy.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In the papers ­­JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Oldham, you ­­ you agree, don't you, that in this system, the court can do enhancements? Yes.MR. OLDHAM: Yeah, that's correct. Well, that ­­ that's not been ­­ certainly disputed in this case. Yes, that's ­­JUSTICE KAGAN: Yeah. So some of the things that we've said are permissible for enhancements are exceptional delays in payment, extraordinary outlays of expenses, and unusually protracted litigation ­­ okay? ­­ that those count as enhancements. We said that in38￼￼1 Perdue v. Kenny A. Why isn't this just like that?2 MR. OLDHAM: Well, there's ­­ I guess3 there's two responses to that. One is that when you're4 looking at enhancements and the ­­ the question when5 that was litigated below is not whether enhancements6 could be authorized, but instead, what the proper test7 was for enhancements in the bankruptcy context.8 Here, the whole question is under9 Section 330(a)(1), has Congress even authorized a10 district court ­­11 JUSTICE KAGAN: No, no, no. But I'm12 proceeding on the assumption of ­­ on the SG's13 assumption that what we're trying to do is to get a14 reasonable rate for the services that clearly have been15 authorized. And the question is: What's a reasonable16 rate?17 And it seems to me that what this statute18 does is to say "reasonable" can include, like, lots of19 things. It's highly discretionary. Right?20 And then on top of that, you know, it ­­21 included in "what is reasonable" is this idea of22 sometimes you can do performance enhancements, but we23 haven't said performance enhancements are just for24 super­duper work. We've actually said performance25 enhancements are for things like unusually protracted39￼1 litigation and lots of expenses and exceptional delays,2 sort of like this.3 You know, this is just an expense of your4 work, is having to go after the fees. So why doesn't5 that get into the mix, too?6 MR. OLDHAM: Well, I would agree with your7 characterization of the government's position that it is8 effectively authorizing a broad scope for ­­ for9 bankruptcy courts to just give enhancements. That is10 effectively what they're arguing for.11 And if I could respond to the government's12 position, because I think there's at least three things13 wrong with it. First is textually, the text simply will14 not permit their position.15 JUSTICE KAGAN: No, it does, because the16 text just says "reasonable." And then the question is17 what's reasonable? And "reasonable" can include, you18 know, you're getting the same hourly rate as some other19 lawyer, but "reasonable" is, also, you had to do this20 over a very extended period of time and "reasonable" is,21 also, boy, you had to spend a lot of money in order to22 get them to pay you anything at all. All of those23 things count as what's part of "reasonable."24 MR. OLDHAM: Well ­­ and if I could make one25 more point on the text. Section 330(a)(1), if it just40￼1 said "reasonable," that might be the right answer; but2 it says "reasonable compensation for services rendered."3 The government agrees with us that fee4 litigation work is not a service rendered. So when5 Congress says ­­6 JUSTICE KAGAN: Yeah, it's reasonable for7 all the other work you're doing. But then everything8 else goes into this question of reasonable, right?9 Is ­­ you know, I'll give you a hypothetical.10 Suppose I hire somebody to shovel my11 driveway, and I say, I'm going to give you reasonable12 compensation. And everybody knows that it's $10 an hour13 to hire my driveway, right? That's the going rate.14 But then I say, oh, did I not tell you ­­15 did I not tell you I'm going to make you go down ­­ come16 down to the court so that I can pay you the $10? And17 that costs another $5. All right?18 Now, it strikes me that if somebody said,19 what's reasonable compensation now, it would be $15. It20 wouldn't be $10. And it's the exact same thing here.21 It's like by the time you go through all this stuff that22 you have to go through to get paid, you should get paid23 more.24 MR. OLDHAM: Well ­­ and to respond to that25 hypothetical, I think the difference is under ­­ in your41￼1 hypothetical, to apply to 330(a)(1), would be Congress2 came in and said, you're going to get ­­ or you ­­ you3 told your ­­ you know, whoever is helping you, I will4 not pay you for bringing it to the courthouse. That is5 not something I pay for, but then turning around and6 nonetheless saying but you can get paid for it anyway.7 That's effectively ­­8 JUSTICE KAGAN: But it doesn't say you can't9 get paid for it. There's no exclusion. All, you10 know ­­ you know, I think you and the SG agree, it's ­­11 we're not counting this as the service. What we're12 saying is you have to be reasonably paid for the obvious13 services that you have performed, shoveling my driveway.14 And in my ­­ in my hypothetical, that means15 you also have to be paid for the cab fare. And16 similarly, here, it means you also have to be paid for17 the cost of, like, making them sign a check to you.18 MR. OLDHAM: Well ­­ and, again,19 textually ­­ I won't belabor ­­ but textually, I think20 it disassociates reasonable compensation for services21 rendered. I don't think textually that that works under22 a fair reading of the statute. But just to go beyond23 the text, the argument ­­24 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, it doesn't have to go25 be­ ­­ I mean, I just don't understand what that means.42￼1 It's this ­­ it's the clear service rendered, it's2 shoveling my driveway, it's doing the work for the3 estate. What counts as reasonable? What counts as4 reasonable is not just the hourly rate, but all the5 things I've put you through to get the hourly rate.6 MR. OLDHAM: And let me give you two other7 responses to that. One is that that argument is really8 just a straight shot at the American Rule, because it's9 true whenever there's a damages award, that if a damages10 award is given for, say, $1,000,000 and you have to11 spend a $100,000 going to defend that, every damages12 award will be diluted by that $100,000.13 But this Court has said ­­14 JUSTICE KAGAN: But here's the problem, I15 think, with that response. It's a reasonable response,16 but we're already out of the American rule here. I17 mean, the bankruptcy system puts you in a different18 universe than a statutory universe, and the question is19 what do those words of the statute say? It's not what20 would exist if the statute didn't exist.21 MR. OLDHAM: Well, the American rule applies22 to litigation, and so obviously, in bankruptcy, you have23 some litigation, you have some non­litigation. But when24 you have a fee litigation matter arise, the American25 rule certainly applies, and Section 330, doesn't ­­43￼1 because it exists, doesn't mean the American rule, you2 know, is tossed out the window. The American rule still3 controls and you have to look at what Congress actually4 authorized.5 And so I think, for example, the Court's6 decision in Cooter & Gell ­­7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, the American rule8 can't trump the statute. The statute has to trump the9 American rule. And if the statute says reasonable10 compensation for services rendered ­­ the obvious11 services rendered, and ­­ and the only thing that counts12 as reasonable is taking into account things like how13 protracted the litigation is and how much risk you've14 had and the exceptional delay, and the fact that you've15 had to contest a lot, a lot, a lot of meritless16 objections, all of those things make for something ­­ go17 into the question of what's reasonable. They don't have18 to. I mean, in 90 percent of the cases, it might be19 that it's like, no, that's just a normal part of the20 process. But in that other 10 percent, where it's not a21 normal part of the process and you wouldn't be22 reasonably paid unless they were included, it seems to23 me the word reasonable demands that they be included.24 MR. OLDHAM: Well, and I think if that's the25 rationale then this Court's decision in Cooter & Gell44￼1 would have come out the other way. That case dealt with2 whether, under Rule 11, an award for a reasonable3 attorney's fee ­­ or under Rule 11, whether you can get4 the cost for defending that on appeal. And the Court5 said no in interpreting that statute and ­­6 JUSTICE SCALIA: What about other statutes?7 I was thinking the same thing, there are other statutes8 that provide ­­ that undo the American rule, and they9 say you're entitled, if you're victorious, to reasonable10 attorney's fees. Do they usually include fees for11 getting the fees?12 MR. OLDHAM: Under ­­ under classics13 fee­shifting statutes where Congress ­­ the answer is14 yes, in a number of those cases, courts have said you15 get your fees on fees, but those statutes are very16 different textually, and, I think, in their rationale.17 Those statutes say that you get your reasonable18 attorney's fee incurred in an action. And so, fees on19 fees, when you have a dispute in that action fit within20 that express authorization by Congress, it is fees21 incurred in that action.22 So textually, that's very different from23 Section 330, but I also think it's very, very different24 when you're thinking about the purpose of those25 fee­shifting statutes. In the fee­shifting context what45￼1 you have is an award to a private party who has2 vindicated their statutory rights. And the award is to3 that party, there's an award of attorney's fees on top4 of that, and throughout that process the award comes5 from the opponent. And so you never have the dynamic6 that you have in the bankruptcy context, where the7 lawyer and the ­­ and the client get on opposite teams.8 They're always on the same team. They're fighting for9 an award, they're fighting for fees on fees, and they10 both benefit by the more, you know, fees that they get.11 That's fundamentally different from Section12 330, which is a very limited authorization that says,13 it doesn't depend on success in litigation, because14 that's not the rationale for compensation. The15 rationale for compensation is that you provide services16 that benefit the estate or that are on behalf of the17 estate. But because the estate is going to pay no18 matter what, you have this dynamic where, when fee19 litigation arises, the professional is suddenly on the20 opposite team of the estate, because it's always going21 to be at the expense of the estate. And I also want ­­22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:23 bankruptcy?24 MR. OLDHAM:25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:       Do you practice inI'm sorry?       Do you practice in46￼1 bankruptcy?2 MR. OLDHAM: Yes, Your Honor.3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And do you happen to4 know whether fee litigation is more common in bankruptcy5 than other fields?6 MR. OLDHAM: Well, there have been some7 studies that have tried to address that and see ­­8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay.9 MR. OLDHAM: ­­ whether ­­ I mean, I think10 the argument that we have seen is more of a logical one,11 that there are more potential objectors in bankruptcy12 because a ­­ a party has to file their fee application,13 and theoretically more people get to review it, but I14 think there's a very strong argument that some courts15 have accepted that, outside of bankruptcy practice,16 there's a paying client in every single case who has the17 full incentive, because they're footing the bill, to18 study and object and litigate if they want. And I think19 it's the rare case outside of bankruptcy and it's20 probably the rare case inside of bankruptcy, where you21 have full­blown litigation, but it certainly happens in22 both contexts and outside of litigation. And all we're23 asking for is for the same rule to be in bankruptcy as24 is out of bankruptcy.25 JUSTICE BREYER:47Well, all right, but if you      MR. OLDHAM:      JUSTICE BREYER:      MR. OLDHAM:Honor.      JUSTICE BREYER:Well, it's reasonable ­­    A reasonable compensation.For services rendered, Your￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425look at the fee­shifting statutes, we looked up a lot,we found quite a few which say that the court can awarda reasonable attorney's fee.MR. OLDHAM: Correct.JUSTICE BREYER: It's broader than here. But the words, basic active words are reasonable attorney's fees, and almost all of them have been interpreted to allow compensation for the reasonable fee. So they throw that in. And so, they're counting it as part of the reason ­­ they're counting it as part of a reasonable attorney's fees. And here, reasonable attorney's fee is the same. That language is the same.                             There is a reasonableattorney's fee.  But it's hard to make a lot out ofthat.MR. OLDHAM: Well, when you excerpt justthose parts, I agree with you, but I think you have tolook at the full language ­­JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah.MR. OLDHAM: ­­ which is in the fee­shifting context, it is reasonable attorney's fees and then48￼1 usually it says, incurred, and then it talks about a2 civil action, like in the Jean case, the Equal Access to3 Justice Act. It says fees incurred in a civil action.4 Well, it's within the express authorization to get fees5 on fees there because in that civil action, if there is6 a fee fight, fees were incurred in that civil action.7 So if Congress, in Section 330, had said ­­ instead of8 what it did say, if it had said professionals shall get9 reasonable attorney's fees in the bankruptcy proceeding,10 then that might be a different case, because there11 you're saying anything that happens in the bankruptcy12 proceeding you get compensation for. Congress didn't13 say ­­14 JUSTICE BREYER: But that happens later,15 everything's closed and they discover that through some16 odd thing they have to spend $10,000 to get the $90,00017 that was awarded to them. Any authority on that? You18 go back to court and say, Judge, I want $10,000 more.19 He says, But the case was closed. He says, Yeah, but I20 but to spend the $10,000 to get the $90,000. If there21 were such a case, one of you would have found it. Or22 somebody would have, I guess.23 MR. OLDHAM: Well, if you're asking ­­ I24 mean, certainly the ­­ the bankruptcy court maintains25 some jurisdiction for a party to go back.49￼1 JUSTICE BREYER:2 under all these other statutes, there is so many3 attorney's fees statutes that ­­4 MR. OLDHAM: There are, and let me just say5 that if we're going to, you know, sort of think about6 what rule might make sense, I think it's important to7 remember that the ­­ the fee­shifting statutes, just8 like Your Honors talked about, where it's true fee9 shifting, that is, there's a dispute that arises, the10 loser has to pay the, you know, the attorney's fees for11 the winner, Congress used that in the bankruptcy code.12 For example, in automatic stay. If there's13 somebody that commits a willful violation of the14 automatic stay, Congress identified that particular15 dispute and said that the loser in that particular case16 should have to pay it to the winner.17 And so if we're thinking about what rule18 makes sense, I think the government put their finger on19 it in their brief and talking about it today ­­ and this20 goes to a question that Justice Alito asked about21 sanctions ­­ what would make far more sense is for22 Congress to have come in and created a true fee shifting23 in which it said that if there's going to a be dispute24 over a ­­ you know, over a fee application, then maybe25 the, you know, the prevailing party should have to ­­50But there's no ­­ just￼1 should get the attorney's fees from the loser.2 Congress didn't do that here. There's3 nothing like that under Section 330 or any other4 statute. Instead, what Congress did is it authorized5 compensation to a professional for the work that they do6 for the estate.7 And I just want to emphasize too, because8 I've ­­ I've heard today that ­­ the suggestion that our9 rule is a per se rule, and that's not at all true.10 We're not saying that professionals can never get their11 fees and we embrace the discretion of bankruptcy courts12 to authorize fees under the long­standing exceptions to13 the American rule for sanctions such as for frivolous14 conduct or for bad­faith litigation misconduct. The15 argument has been made that those are, you know, two16 exceptional, but outside of the bankruptcy context,17 those longstanding exceptions to the American rule have18 stood alone as the only exceptions to the American rule.19 And there's never been any suggestion at all that those20 are not ­­ those are not sufficient outside of the21 bankruptcy context. And so I don't think there's any22 reason for a special rule just in the bankruptcy23 context.24 I think it's also really important to keep25 in mind that Section 330(a) is not just for attorneys.51￼1 It's for all professionals. And so in the context of,2 say, an accountant that has to go hire their own lawyer,3 this Court's decision in Lamie made very clear that you4 can only get compensation under Section 330(a) if you're5 approved under Section 327(a) for employment.6 It would ­­ it would candidly just go7 straight through that decision if it was okay for a8 Section 327(a) professional, to nonetheless go hire9 somebody, have them do professional services, and then10 just count it as, you know, the accountant's own11 professional services, or, as was suggested today, to12 simply call professional services necessary expense.13 Which goes against what Congress said in Section14 330(a)(1)(A), where it ­­ and (B), where it made a very15 distinct difference between a necessary expense and a16 professional services.17 And so, there ­­ there's ­­ the cases that18 have talked about this issue, about whether an19 accountant can hire a lawyer and get paid, have ­­ have20 ­­ more of them have said exactly what this Court said21 in Lamie, that you can't do that. Section 327(a) is the22 sole gateway to compensation for those professionals23 under 330(a).24 The only exception has been ­­ that some25 courts have identified, which we think would be521 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425inconsistent with Lamie and with Section 327(a), iswhere there's an engagement letter between the Section327(a) professional and the debtor, where the debtor hasagreed that the Section 327(a) professional is allowedto go and hire others to do particular work.   that,again, we don't think is sufficient, but that is adifferent context than ­­ than this case.If there's no further questions, thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Streett, four minutes.     REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF AARON STREETT      ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. STREETT: Thank you.      The bankruptcy code uses broad, open­endedlanguage and commits these questions to bankruptcy courtdiscretion, and that's no different than the feeshifting statutes.  We've said ­­ we've heard from myfriend on the other side that this is a direct shot ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Will you answer his last point? Why does it make any sense to say that the lawyer can get ­­ make his fee reasonable by getting his litigation expenses, but the accountant, who's also entitled to reasonable fees, cannot? If he has to sue, he has to pay his own lawyer, and you don't assert that that ­­ that that is compensable, do you?53￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. STREETT: We ­­ we do assert that would be compensable, either as an expense to the accountant or it could be included as part of the accountant's reasonable compensation for his underlying services on the bankruptcy, as the government argues.JUSTICE SCALIA:It does eat those costs.￼      JUSTICE SCALIA:didn't realize you ­­MR. STREETT:      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:earlier the trustee had to approve it.  And I'mwondering how the trustee could approve that, becauseit's for the benefit of the accountant,  not thetrust.MR. STREETT: The trustee would have to approve if those services were to be directly compensable, not if they were to be compensated as expenses or as part of the underlying reasonable compensation of the accountant. I think the hypothetical was, you have an accountant who is already a 327(a) professional, and it has to hire a lawyer. ASARCO wants to force that accountant to eat those costs.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there case authorities supporting the answers you gave?54Oh, you do?  Okay.  IYes, we ­­      I thought you said￼1 MR. STREETT: Yes, we cite one that surveys2 the entire case law on this point in our reply brief, I3 believe it's footnote 4.4 To get back to Justice Breyer's question,5 you cannot read "services" in isolation. You can't read6 "services rendered" in isolation from the rest of the7 statute. (a)(4) recognizes that there are services8 necessary to case administration, and (a)(3)(C)9 recognizes there are services that are beneficial toward10 the completion of the case. My friend on the other side11 read in a word, he said "services to the estate." It12 doesn't say that anywhere in the statute. It could be a13 service to the court, it could be a service to the14 trustee, which must administer and finally close the15 case.16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Except ­­ except that in17 Woods, looking at the predecessor statute, which also18 talked about services rendered, we held that the phrase19 "reasonable compensation for services rendered," quote,20 this is us, "necessarily implies loyal and disinterested21 service in the interest of those for whom the claimant22 purported to act."23 MR. STREETT: And I'm glad Your Honor24 brought this up, because the idea that litigating a fee25 application is adverse to the estate, cannot be right.55￼1 The code requires you to litigate the fee application if2 it's challenged. Now, think about what happens if we3 file an interim fee application under Section 331. We4 can do that four months into the bankruptcy. The second5 somebody objects and we have to respond to that6 objection, ASARCO's position is, we're immediately7 adverse to the estate and we're disqualified.8 But I did want to mention that all of the9 National Associations of Trustees support Baker Botts10 position on this point, because it's not just a small11 expense that can be counted as overhead. In Section ­­12 Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 cases, these National13 Associations of Trustees point out that the litigation14 costs will frequently eat up the entire core fee,15 because it's a modest core fee and all it takes is one16 debtor rendering an objection or the Chapter 13 trustee17 rendering an objection.18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you answer the19 question about suppose the objection to the fee is20 sustained? Does the lawyer, nonetheless, get the work?21 MR. STREETT: It would pass the minimal22 compensability threshold, but courts have consistently23 exercised their discretion for decades to deny that24 compensation, because the nature and value of25 unsuccessful defense is very different from that of a5619202122232425￼1 successful defense.2 And ASARCO is the one asking this Court to3 make a major change from the status quo that has4 prevailed across this country in the overwhelming5 majority of jurisdictions where courts have wisely and6 responsibly exercised their discretion to award fees7 where they are necessary to make the underlying fee8 reasonable, and to deny fees where the defense is9 unsuccessful or otherwise wasteful. Baker Botts is just10 asking this Court to allow the status quo to continue11 playing out in a way that's been effective for the12 bankruptcy system.13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
