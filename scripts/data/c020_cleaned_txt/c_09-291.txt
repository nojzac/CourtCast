North American Stainless.Mr. Schnapper.ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPERON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. SCHNAPPER: Mr. Chief Justice, and mayit please the Court:Section 704(a), Title VII, prohibits the useof third-party reprisals as a method of retaliating against a person who complained to the EEOC or otherwise opposed discrimination. The text of section 704(a) doesn't limit the types of retaliation which are forbidden. The elements of the statute are unrelated to that.The first requirement is that the plaintiff show that discrimination occurred with regard to the individual who engaged in a protected activity. In a case like that, like this, that's shown by -- would be shown by evidence that they singled out Ms. Regalado and Ms. Regalado's fiancé. They didn't go fire anybody else's fiancé. That was the basis on which this particular action was taken.3￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Secondly, the plaintiff must show that the conduct was discrimination against the person who engaged in protected activity. That language is easily applicable to a situation where you single out, say, a family member or a fiancé. The purpose of that, the complaint can fairly be read to allege, was to punish the person who had engaged in protected activity.There are a number of Federal statutes that use the word "against" in precisely this way. They say that actions cannot be taken to -- say, against a family member of a sitting judge or other Federal official where the purpose is to act against the official.JUSTICE SCALIA: Is Ms. Regalado still engaged to this fellow?JUSTICE GINSBURG: She's married to him.￼MR. SCHNAPPER: engaged to him?JUSTICE SCALIA: MR. SCHNAPPER: JUSTICE SCALIA: MR. SCHNAPPER:2-year-old daughter. JUSTICE SCALIA:she bring this suit?MR. SCHNAPPER:4I'm sorry. Is she stillYes.They're married.Oh, they're married. And they have a lovelyOh, good. Well, why didn't I -- I think, Your Honor,1 that your -- this Court's Article III jurisprudence2 would have precluded her from getting any remedy. The3 -- certainly most of the remedies that are needed here.4 She wouldn't have had Article III standing to win an5 award of back pay to -- to her now husband. She6 couldn't have gotten an award of damages to him. I7 think, if I'm right -­8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could she have gotten9 reinstatement on the grounds that his continuing10 inability to be employed by the company is an ongoing11 hurt to her?12 MR. SCHNAPPER: Perhaps. It would depend on13 the circumstances. In this particular case, almost14 certainly not, because of just the -- the course of15 subsequent events. But it's -- she subsequently left16 the company. At this point, they live nowhere near that17 town. It simply wouldn't work.18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose an employer -­19 suppose an employer dismisses an employee on an20 impermissible ground, impermissible under Title VII, and21 it's a very valuable employee. Can the shareholders sue22 on the ground that the shareholders are now injured23 because the company is worth less, having lost this24 employee, under Title VII?25 MR. SCHNAPPER: I don't -- I don't believe5￼1 so, Your Honor. I don't believe so. But the situation2 here is different than that.3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because you start with4 somebody who is -- who is unlike the shareholders.5 There's no Title VII violation as to them. Regalado is6 complaining of sex discrimination, and then she said,7 because I made a complaint, they retaliated against me.8 Shareholders are not in that position, because there was9 no initial charge there.10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, it's the same11 hypothetical. We'll just say Regalado, all the same12 facts, except she is very valuable to the company. The13 company is now worth less; shareholder sues.14 MR. SCHNAPPER: I think the thrust of your15 question was -- is: Are the shareholders like Thompson?16 And I think -- I think that Thompson's situation is17 quite different. He was the very target of the illegal18 act. The illegality occurs only by means of dismissing19 him.20 JUSTICE ALITO: The question is whether he's21 aggrieved within the meaning of Title VII, right?22 MR. SCHNAPPER: That is the other question.23 JUSTICE ALITO: And your argument is that if24 there's injury in fact sufficient to satisfy Article III25 of the Constitution, then the person is aggrieved.6￼1 MR. SCHNAPPER: The -- the Court's decision2 in Trafficante goes that far, and in practice it has not3 proved a problem under Title VIII. It's -- that's4 generally been its understanding of -- here.5 JUSTICE ALITO: But your -- is it your6 argument that we have -- that we should go that far?7 MR. SCHNAPPER: You do not -­8 JUSTICE ALITO: We should say9 injury -­10 MR. SCHNAPPER: You do not -­11 JUSTICE ALITO: We don't? We12 go that far?13 MR. SCHNAPPER: You do not need to go that14 far.15 JUSTICE ALITO: Where do we draw the line?16 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, I think -- I think the17 Government has -- I -- I think as far as you need to go,18 which is not the same as saying that's as far as the law19 goes, is the standard articulated by the Government, as20 in McCready, where the action against Thompson was the21 very method by which the law was violated, that that22 would satisfy the requirement of person aggrieved.23 JUSTICE ALITO: Where does that come from?24 Where does that test come from?25 MR. SCHNAPPER: Your Honor, I don't -- I7that there wasdon't need to￼1 think that's as far as you need to go in this case. I2 think the standard of aggrieved is broader than that,3 but the -- in -- as this has played out in the lower4 courts since Trafficante, there's a wide range of5 different kinds of circumstances under which the6 Trafficante rule has been invoked in Title VII cases.7 We're not asking you to address all of those.8 JUSTICE ALITO: I understand the argument.9 I don't really -- it's not too helpful, at least to me,10 to say as far as we need to go in order to reverse.11 That's really not how a statute ought to be interpreted,12 I would say. What does it mean? What -- now, I13 understand the argument that "aggrieved" means all the14 way to what's -- all that's necessary is what is15 necessary to satisfy the Constitution. And I understand16 that argument. It's a very broad argument with a lot of17 implications.18 But if -- if that's not correct, then what19 is the correct test and where does it come from?20 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, Your Honor, I think21 that there are two other limitations that would be22 applicable here, as indeed they would have been under23 Title VIII.24 First one is proximate cause, which will cut25 off a lot of injuries down the road. And Title VII is8￼1 adopted against a background of proximate cause rules,2 and there, I don't think -- we don't contend that in3 using the word "person aggrieved" they meant -- Congress4 meant to set those aside.5 Secondly, the -- I think a fair reading of6 the word "aggrieved" is that it is -- "aggrieved" is7 both, in ordinary English, frankly, broader and narrower8 than "injured." It is broader -- and that's, of course,9 not your concern -- in the sense that it covers people10 who haven't been injured yet but might be injured in the11 future.12 But it also has a second element which is13 that the action at issue involves some sort of a wrong.14 If someone deliberately knocks me down, I'm injured, I'm15 probably aggrieved, but not if I'm carrying a football16 in the middle of a football game. That's a legitimate17 thing to do.18 So I think that there has to be a wrong, and19 the wrong has to be the -- the basis of the -- of the20 plaintiff's objection. You could have a situation where21 the plaintiff really didn't care one way or another why22 -- why that harm had happened. It was -- but in this23 case, that's precisely why Thompson complains. He's not24 suggesting that he would be wronged if he were ever25 fired at all. He is aggrieved because he was fired for9￼1 a reason that was an improper reason. And -- and we2 think those are -- those are limiting principles.3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what do you do4 with the argument that says there's a middle step? You5 can -- you have the sex discrimination complaint, and6 then you have Thompson, who is aggrieved in the sense7 that he was8 no cause of9 action, for1011 just clearly wrong. The statute provides a cause of12 action.13 If I might go back to how that came up in14 the court of appeals, the court of appeals appears to15 have assumed that third-party reprisals are unlawful.16 It's not entirely clear. And then, in footnote 1, the17 court of appeals said that -- that Thompson was18 aggrieved.19 Notwithstanding that, they then went on to20 say that there's no cause of action in the statute -­21 they said in section 704(a). That really doesn't make22 any sense. The -- the statute provides an express cause23 of action. It says that individuals -- certain24 individuals, if the requirements are met, can bring25 lawsuits.10hurt, he was injured. But they say there's action, there's no statutory cause of Thompson.MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, the -- we think that's￼1 So the question is, as -- as Justice Alito2 put it and -- and it was put before, which is whether3 the plaintiff is aggrieved. But if he's aggrieved, he's4 clearly got a cause of action -­5 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose Thompson were not6 Regalado's fiancé at the time. Suppose they were7 just -- they were just good friends. Would -- and8 everything else happened, and he alleged that he was9 fired in retaliation for her engaging in protected10 conduct. The way the company wanted to get at her was11 by firing her friend. Would that be enough?12 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, the -- the plaintiff13 would have to prove two things. First of all, the14 plaintiff would have to prove that that was indeed the15 company's motive for picking him to fire him.16 Secondly, under this Court's decision in17 Burlington Northern, the plaintiff would have to show18 that this was a retaliatory action sufficiently serious19 that it was -- it would likely persuade a reasonable20 employee in Regalado's position -- dissuade her21 complaint. And -- and that's why we've agreed with the22 Respondent's contention that -- that they're entitled to23 an evidentiary determination about whether that standard24 was met here.25 So that's an important limiting principle,11￼1 and it has -­2 JUSTICE ALITO: How does that translate?3 How does that Burlington Northern standard translate4 into the situation in which there is some sort of5 relationship between the -- the person who engaged in6 the protected conduct and the person who suffers the7 adverse employment action?8 That's what's troubling to me about -- about9 the theory. Where it's a fiancé, it's -- that's a10 relatively strong case, but I can imagine a whole11 spectrum of cases in which there is a lesser12 relationship between those two persons, and if -- if -­13 unless there's a clear line there someplace, this theory14 is rather troubling.15 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, I think -­16 JUSTICE ALITO: Can you help -- can you help17 provide where the clear line is? Does it go to -- does18 it include simply a good friend? Does it include19 somebody who just has lunch in the cafeteria every day20 with the person who engaged in the protected conduct?21 Somebody who once dated the person who engaged in the22 protected conduct? Are these all questions that have to23 go to a jury?24 MR. SCHNAPPER: They wouldn't all have to go25 to a jury. I mean, the -- the problem, as you cast it,12￼1 is that's the standard in Burlington Northern -- no2 offense -- isn't a bright line. It is the standard,3 which it is. And the same question could arise about4 other methods of retaliation.5 What about -- you know, what about cutting6 someone out of 5 meetings or 10 meetings? But that same7 problem exists under Burlington Northern no matter what.8 JUSTICE BREYER: But why can't -­9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well -­10 JUSTICE BREYER: Why can't they get -- the11 first question, to go back, is just a confusion in my12 mind: Why couldn't she bring this suit? And she says:13 I was discriminated against because they did A, B, C, D14 to him, and the remedy is cure the way in which I was15 discriminated against. And to cure that way, you would16 have to make the man whole in respect to those elements17 that we're discriminating against her.18 Do you give him back pay? Do you restore19 him? You do everything you would normally have to do,20 because otherwise she is suffering the kind of injury,21 though it was to him, that amounts to discrimination for22 opposing a practice. What's wrong with that theory?23 MR. SCHNAPPER: I think that that kind of24 remedy would pose very serious problems under Article25 III.13￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: Why? Why?2 MR. SCHNAPPER: Because money isn't going to3 her.4 JUSTICE BREYER: So what? She's hurt.5 Suppose it was a child that they -- what they -- or6 suppose they robbed -- they robbed the -- the judge's7 wife in order to get him to do something? And -- and8 that's a crime, and suppose there was a civil statute.9 The judge says: The way you cure what you did to get me10 to do something is you make me whole. And in that11 instance, it requires making her whole. What's the12 Article III 131415problem?Well, anyway -­MR. SCHNAPPER: I don't -­JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know that this is￼16 crucial, but I'm -- I'm -- I'm just saying -­17 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, I think it -- I think18 it is of some -- some importance here. I mean, it -­19 it -- the -- ordinarily, Article III would bar me from20 suing for an award of money to be paid to somebody else.21 JUSTICE BREYER: But that's because the22 award of money to be paid for somebody else, their23 absence of money didn't hurt you, but where there -- for24 example, if you're a trustee, you certainly can sue to25 get the beneficiary put back. There are dozens of cases141 where you can sue to get somebody else paid back money,2 and -- 34 pursue5 things6and why isn't this one of them?But anyway, I'm not -- I don't want toit beyond a quick answer, because there are other in this case.MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, as I say, I think -- I 7 think Article III would be -- would be a major obstacle8 there.9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understood your10 brief, and certainly the Government's brief, to take a11 very expansive view of what type of retaliation would12 give rise to a cause of action by the -- the directly13 harmed employee.14 Now you seem to be suggesting that that15 employee would not have Article III standing to bring an16 action.17 MR. SCHNAPPER: I think we've got a18 situation here in which this violates the rights of19 Regalado, but Regalado's ability to herself bring a20 lawsuit and get a remedy is limited, and that -- that -­21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're not taking the22 position that she could not have sued for retaliation?23 It would be awkward because he is -- it's his injury24 that requires compensation. But are you saying that she25 could not have brought a retaliation suit?15￼1 MR. SCHNAPPER: It's possible she could2 bring a suit. The question would be whether she had3 Article III standing to seek the remedy that she was4 then seeking, which would often be a problem.5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let me -- because your6 time is running -- the Americans with Disabilities Act7 has an explicit provision that allows suits by adversely8 affected close relatives. You are essentially asking us9 to read that provision, which is stated expressly in the10 ADA -­11 MR. SCHNAPPER: If I might respond to that12 briefly, you're referring to section 12112(b)(4) of the13 ADA. That is a provision directed at a very different14 problem, which is not associations between employees.15 It's -- it's directed at employers who might refuse to16 hire a worker because, for example, he had or she had a17 child with a disability.18 The EEOC's commentaries on the regs about19 this explain it. It is -- it is not concerned with20 employee relations. It's concerned with a21 discrimination against a worker, prospective worker,22 typically because they have a family member who has a23 disability, and the employer has preconceptions about24 whether they'll be good workers based on that.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you -­16￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the Fair Housing Act has a definition of injury that would includeMr. Thompson, and that's not in this Act, that express language.MR. SCHNAPPER: That's correct, Your Honor. That -- that statute was adopted somewhat later.There are large numbers of statutes that general language like "person aggrieved." that, in the case of the Housing Act, thathave ratherBut I thinklanguage fairly describes the ordinary English meaning of "aggrieved." Sometimes Congress does that.There are other definitions in the Fair Housing Act like that, like the definition of"dwelling." It doesn't mean "dwelling"; it means something else everywhere else in the U.S. Code. Just, Congress, in that instance, decided to spell out what￼everyone, I have meant.think, would have understood the word toCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.Ms. Kruger.ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER,ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERMS. KRUGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:171 When an employer fires an employee as a2 means of retaliating against a relative or close3 associate who has filed an EEOC charge, the employee who4 has been fired is entitled under Title VII to go to5 court and seek appropriate remedies, even if he hasn't6 himself engaged in protected activity.7 JUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you this?8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -­9 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose -­10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead.11 JUSTICE ALITO: Put yourself in the -- in12 the shoes of an employer, and you -- you think -- you13 want to take an adverse employment action against14 employee A. You think you have good grounds for doing15 that, but you want -- before you do it, you want to know16 whether you're potentially opening yourself up to a17 retaliation claim.18 Now, what is the employer supposed to do19 then? They say, well, let's -- we need to survey20 everybody who is engaged in protected conduct, and now21 we need to see whether this person who we're thinking of22 taking the adverse employment action against has a,23 quote, unquote, "close relationship" with any of those24 people.2518￼So what do you do? Do you call everybody in1 from the company and you say, now, is -- you know,2 was -- are these people dating? Did they once date?3 Are they good friends?4 What are you supposed to do?5 MS. KRUGER: Justice Alito, we're not6 arguing for a test that would create a kind of7 protection for a so-called right of association under8 Title VII. It's not the case that so long as somebody9 is associated with somebody who has complained about10 discrimination, they would be automatically protected11 under the test that we're advocating.12 The reason the relationship is important in13 this case is because it tends to render plausible the14 argument that there's a causal connection between the15 adverse action visited on Thompson in this case -­16 JUSTICE ALITO: I understand that. I do17 understand that, but I wish you'd -- I'd like you to18 answer my question.19 Does the employer have to keep a -- a20 journal on the intimate or casual relationships between21 all of its employees so that it knows what it's -- it's22 opening itself up to when it wants to take an action23 against somebody?24 MS. KRUGER: No, I think it's actually quite25 the contrary. I think if the employer doesn't know19￼1 about the relationship, any allegation like the2 allegation that we have in this case simply isn't going3 to be plausible. It isn't going to be a plausible4 contention that there is a relationship between one5 employee's protected activity and an adverse action6 visited on the plaintiff.7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but you say -­8 but it won't be because of the degree of connection9 between the -- the retaliated-against employee and the10 means of retaliating.11 I understood your brief. I'm just looking12 at page 6. The limitation you propose is someone -­13 someone close to him. The anti-retaliation prohibition14 "prohibits an employer from firing an employee because15 someone close to him filed an EEOC complaint."16 And I guess I have the same concern that17 we've been discussing for a little while. How are we18 supposed to tell, or how is an employer supposed to19 tell, whether somebody is close enough or not?20 MS. KRUGER: Well, if there's -- I don't21 think that there's any reason for the Court to try to22 fashion a hard-and-fast rule that identifies some23 relationships that are close enough and others that24 aren't.2520￼The question in every case is the question1 that's posed by this Court's standard in Burlington2 Northern: Was this an action that a reasonable employee3 would have considered materially adverse? Would it have4 been deterred -­5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But Burlington6 Northern, of course, is quite different, because you're7 just -- you're dealing with the obvious plaintiff in8 that case. You -- your -- your concern is confined to a9 particular person.10 In this hypothetical, it's an unlimited11 universe that you don't have any reason to know where it12 ends.13 MS. KRUGER: Well, it's certainly going to14 be important, whenever a plaintiff brings a suit like15 this, both to establish that the employer knew of the16 relationship and the relationship was one that is of17 sufficient closeness that a reasonable employee might be18 deterred from making or supporting a charge of19 discrimination -­20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why does that matter21 under your theory? Let's assume the different -­22 slightly different, that they're just coworkers, but a23 coworker who has expressed sympathy for the24 discriminated person, has spoken about them in a25 favorable light or has tried to defend them. Would that21￼1 person be protected from being fired -­2 MS. KRUGER: Well -­3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- if the intent was to4 retaliate against the person complaining of5 discrimination by getting rid of their friend who's6 supporting them?7 MS. KRUGER: In that scenario, I think that8 that person would9 different reason.10 Under11 that person would12 who had opposed the discrimination and, for that reason,13 would themselves have engaged in a protected activity.14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So an opposer is anyone15 who -- who assists?16 MS. KRUGER: That's our understanding of17 what this Court held in -- in the Crawford case.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But let's assume they in private, but the employer knew it.

I want -- I want a safe harbor. I don't even want to mess with people that might -- that might be buying a lawsuit.And you're telling me, well, you know, I can't help you. You have to go before a jury and say if this person is close enough.Why can't we say members of family and fiancés? Would -- would that be a nice rule?MS. KRUGER: Well, I think that it would be an essentially arbitrary rule.JUSTICE SCALIA: I know.MS. KRUGER: At end of the day, when the question is just the question that the Court assigned under Burlington Northern, it's a question that turns on the specific facts and context of the -- a specific case.JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but as -­MS. KRUGER: But I think to the extent that23￼1 the Court -­2 JUSTICE SCALIA: As the Chief said, it -- it3 spreads much further than Burlington Northern.4 Burlington Northern -- at least you know who it is you5 have to be careful with -­6 MS. KRUGER: Well -­7 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the person who's -- you8 know, who has made a complaint. But -- but with what9 you're proposing -- my goodness, I don't know who it is10 I have to be careful with.11 MS. KRUGER: Well, an employer always is12 going to have to be careful to some degree not to visit13 harm on an employee for retaliatory reasons.14 JUSTICE ALITO: But you're -- you're a15 reasonable person. What would you say is the degree of16 closeness that's required?17 MS. KRUGER: I don't think that there's any18 way to fashion a hard-and-fast rule. The fact of the19 matter is that most of the cases that have arisen that20 have raised third-party retaliation arguments and which21 are indeed cognizable under a number of -- of employment22 statutes -- and I don't think Respondent disputes that23 they are rightly so -- have largely concerned24 relationships like the relationship between parent and25 child, between husband and wife.24￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425In one case under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, it's -- it's involved a relationship between very good friends in the workplace, whereas there is a D.C. Court of Appeals decision that holds that a merely professional relationship that doesn't exhibit that degree of personal affection isn't sufficiently close.JUSTICE ALITO: Very good friends is enough?MS. KRUGER: I think that a reasonable employee who knows that the consequence of making or supporting a charge of discrimination is going to be that their best friend at work is going to be fired may be deterred from engaging in protected activity.JUSTICE KENNEDY: And in -- in your view, could Regalado have brought this suit or brought a suit?MS. KRUGER: Yes, Justice Kennedy, we do think that Regalado could have brought a suit in her own right, because she, too, is a person aggrieved within the meaning of the statute.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if that is so, why doesn't that vindicate the purposes of the Act?MS. KRUGER: Well, for two reasons, Justice Kennedy.

That's an odd rule.MS.

You could very well10 have Eric Thompson as a spouse who is not employed. So,11 for example, if Mr. Thompson had been just -- let's make12 him a spouse, an even closer relationship than a fiancé,13 and suppose that he -- his job -- he ran an animal14 shelter in Carrollton, Kentucky, and it was a benevolent15 organization, but his only source of revenue was a16 generous gift from North American Stainless at17 Christmastime.18 And in 2003, after Regalado filed her claim19 with the EEOC, filed her charge, North American20 Stainless said: I'm not going to -- I'm not going to21 give money this year to the animal shelter, to Mr.22 Thompson, and I'm not going to do it because of23 Regalado, who is our employee, because she filed a24 charge of discrimination. I'm not going to do anything25 to help her. I'm not going to do anything to help him.34￼1 In that case, under Mr. Schnapper's2 standard, that any person aggrieved can bring a claim,3 that person, who is not even an employee, because they4 have some kind of injury could bring a claim.5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but his point6 was that "aggrieved" includes not only injury but7 wrongfulness. It may not be very -- I don't know, but8 -- nice, but there's nothing wrongful about North9 American Stainless deciding it's not going to fund an10 animal shelter because of some other reason.11 MS. LATHEROW: But it's -- but it's treating12 Regalado with discrimination. It is treating her13 differently than it might treat another employee because14 she brought the cause of action. That would be15 discrimination against Regalado because it's treating16 her differently, but under their analysis -­17 JUSTICE BREYER: But you couldn't win on18 that under Burlington. I mean, I think that there are19 three separate issues here that have to be kept20 straight.21 No one can win in court unless they show22 there was a human being -- in this case, the woman -­23 who suffered material -- who suffered serious harm,24 serious harm. And serious harm is defined as materially25 adverse action which might well have dissuaded a35￼1 reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of2 discrimination. So unless she suffered that kind of3 serious harm, nobody wins.4 Then the next question is suppose, in the5 course of that, somebody else was hurt. And the person6 aggrieved provision suggests, because of the history of7 the word "aggrieved," that more than just she can bring8 the lawsuit. That's our first question.9 And then our third question is, if the10 second question is yes, why can't the whole world do it?11 At least the barber who doesn't get the haircut anymore12 because the person fired doesn't have any money or the13 landlord who can't get his rent14 can go on indefinitely. Okay?15 MS. LATHEROW: Yes.16 JUSTICE BREYER: So17 second question?or the -- you know, wewhy don't we get to the￼18 The second question19 "aggrieved" has a history. I think it comes out of -­20 what's the case? It's -- I think it comes out of FCC v.21 Sanders Brothers, which is a 1940 case, which said that22 sometimes where there's a statute using the word "person23 aggrieved," that that means that a person can bring a24 lawsuit even though that person does not suffer injury25 of the type that the statute was meant to prevent36is -- the word1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425against.APA.MS.

LATHEROW: Absolutely, Your Honor.JUSTICE SCALIA: And doesn't the word "person aggrieved" bring that -- that whole lore along with it?MS. LATHEROW: I believe it does, Your Honor. In -­JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we go back to basics? First, you agree that it is unlawful to retaliate -- to retaliate against a person who filed a complaint, under Title VII, by dismissing a close relative? It is an unlawful employment practice; is it not?MS. LATHEROW: I believe it -- it could meet the standard under Burlington, yes, Your Honor.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you want to get back to Justice Breyer's question? I don't think you had a chance to respond to it.MS. LATHEROW: Yes, Your Honor. Thank you.Justice Breyer, I believe your question was the scope and what does this term "aggrieved" mean? And38￼1 in the Sanders case, the Court said that this term2 "aggrieved" means something broad, and it is intended to3 bring a lot of people in.4 But that case was interpreting the APA,5 which has specific language. Just like in Trafficante,6 the Court was considering the Fair Housing Act, both of7 which have very different -- than the statute in8 question. The APA says a person suffering a legal wrong9 because of an agency action or adversely affected or10 aggrieved by agency action within a meaning of a11 relevant statute is entitled to judicial review. And12 that's much broader than what we have in this case.13 So we have to be looking at whether14 prudential standing rules apply, and we know that15 Congress legislates against that prudential standing16 doctrine.17 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure it's broader.18 Why do you say it's broader? It says "adversely19 affected" -- "adversely affected" -- or "aggrieved20 within the meaning of the relevant statute." And it's21 that language that says, well, the statute was only22 meant to protect this group of people, and the fact that23 somebody else was incidentally harmed would -- would not24 be covered.2539￼I don't know why you say that's broader. If1 anything, it's narrower than what we have here. We just2 say "aggrieved." It doesn't say within the meaning of a3 relevant statute. You want us to read that into it?4 MS. LATHEROW: Yes, I -- I believe it should5 be read into Title VII, because that's the term6 "aggrieved."7 If someone -- if my husband calls and says,8 oh, my gosh, we've been involved in a car accident, I9 don't say: Honey, are you aggrieved? I say: Honey,10 are you injured? And that's exactly -- exactly the11 definition of "aggrieved" in the Fair Housing Act.12 So Congress recognized, just 4 years later13 after Title VII was adopted, when it enacted the Fair14 Housing Act, and it defined "aggrieved" and said15 aggrieved means or includes any person who claims to16 have been injured. I mean, that's really -­17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is not -- this is18 not an altogether novel question, because it has come up19 under some other statutes. You are suggesting that this20 is carrying "a person aggrieved" to new heights, but we21 have both the NLRB and we have OSHA, and both of those22 agencies have said that to take adverse action against a23 close relative is an unfair employment practice, and24 they've done that for some time; have they not?25 MS. LATHEROW: Yes, Your Honor. And, again,40￼89 101 we're not saying that discriminating against an employee2 in taking some kind of action against someone that they3 loved is not an unlawful employment action. It can be.4 That's not the position that North American Stainless is5 taking. The question is if the person who was not6 discriminated against, the person who was injured by the7 action -- can they bring the cause of action?JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. -­MS. LATHEROW: And Title VII -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Go on. I'm sorry. Finish11 your -­ 1213 makes clear14 the anti-retaliation provision, and that's what we're15 talking about.16 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's -- that's why17 this is -- see, what Sanders Brothers did is the18 interest to be protected against had nothing to do with19 protecting competitors from competition. The Court says20 that. And it says: But here is a competitor trying to21 protect himself from competition; can he bring a suit?22 Well, normally not. But Congress used the word "person23 aggrieved" or "adversely affected," and, therefore, they24 can. Now, that's the precedent that -- that -- that's25 harmful to you. I'm not certain.41MS. LATHEROW: Oh, I'm sorry. Burlington that the interests to be protected abut with￼1 What about the third part? I have a2 suggestion, and I'd like your response, because I'm just3 playing with the thought: That the way to limit this is4 to say that where a person is being used, person B is5 hurt because -- in order to retaliate against person A,6 okay? That that is a person aggrieved where person B is7 being -- is hurt. The injury, the injury to B, not to8 A, is the means of hurting A. But where it is a9 consequence of hurting A, that doesn't fall within the10 statute.11 That gets rid of the bowling alley, it gets12 rid of the landlord, it gets rid of the shareholder, it13 gets rid of all the people who -- who are not the person14 retaliated against, but they suffer injury because he15 was retaliated against. It keeps the people who are16 being used as a means. They can bring the lawsuit.17 MS. LATHEROW: And, I'm sorry -- and your18 question is?19 JUSTICE BREYER: If, in fact, you set in20 motion hurting Mrs. Smith, the child, the wife, even the21 coworker, though that would be hard to get past22 Burlington, if you do that in order to hurt A, to23 retaliate against A, B can bring the suit. But if B is24 a person who is injured only because you retaliated A,25 that really wasn't the means, B can't bring a suit.42￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MS. LATHEROW: But, Your Honor, respectfully, there's no basis in the statute to adopt that rule.theory.JUSTICE BREYER: That is the problem with my(Laughter.)MS. LATHEROW: I'm glad -­JUSTICE BREYER: But there are -- I do -- Ithink that it isn't so hard to find, in some of the sources that Justice Ginsburg mentioned and others, instances where the only kinds of suits that have been allowed are where it was like a family member or was being used as a means, and there never have been cases where they allowed somebody who was just suffering consequent injury. So it's quite possible I can be borne out, though I think your criticism is a pretty good one.(Laughter.)MS. LATHEROW: If we look at the kinds of cases, for example, the Trafficante case, and the other cases under the APA where Congress has used this broad language or has interpreted the term "aggrieved" broadly, those cases are -- the nature of those cases, such as with Bennett v. Spear, the Environmental Species Act, or the Blue Shield of Virginia case, which was a43￼1 Sherman Act case, the injury or the act, the violation,2 the violation in those cases had the potential to -- to3 inflict harm on a large group of people. So that, under4 Trafficante there were over 8,000 people who lived in5 the housing complex. Under Bennett v. Spear, with the6 Environmental Species Act, there was more than one7 person who was adversely affected or potentially was8 adversely affected. In Blue Cross -­9 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see where you're10 going. The employer has to fire three fiancés or a11 larger number of -­12 (Laughter.)13 MS. LATHEROW: No, my point is, is that if14 we're looking at trying to compare Title VII and whether15 or not we're going to impose some prudential limitations16 on the "aggrieved" language, those statutes are17 different than the statute that we have in question -­18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you know, I don't19 know what "aggrieved" means. I don't think anybody20 does. Why shouldn't we be guided by the EEOC, which has21 responsibility for implementing this statute? And22 they've come up with their theory of what it means, and23 we usually do accede to a reasonable theory proposed by24 the implementing agency. Why -- why shouldn't we do25 that?44￼1 MS. LATHEROW: Your Honor, this is not a2 situation like Holowecki, where the Court is trying to3 determine something about a procedure within the EEOC,4 and that is what does it mean for a charge, because you5 need some kind of special expertise. Here the Court is6 the expert on interpreting.7 And Thompson even disagrees with the EEOC.8 The EEOC would say Regalado and Thompson could bring the9 claim, but Thompson disagrees with10 for Thompson to come and say let's11 when he disagrees with it himself.12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But13 100 percent clear he does. He thought there might be an14 Article III impediment. But in -- in your brief, I15 think you suggested that the EEOC doesn't get a whole16 lot of deference, and you -- but the other agencies that17 I mentioned, where there is this claim that can be18 brought by a close relative, the NLRB gets a lot of19 deference; the Department of Labor, when we're dealing20 with Occupational Safety and Health Administration or21 the mine safety -- those agencies get a fair degree of22 deference, and they've come to the same conclusion.23 MS. LATHEROW: I -- I agree with that, Your24 Honor. And in this -- this -- I don't know, but I25 believe this to be true, that, for example, with the45that. So it's hard do what the EEOC saysit's not -- it's not￼5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But this is a -- an6 interpretation of the substantive meaning of the7 statute.81 NLRB and with OSHA, they have their own administrative2 agencies where there would be hearings within those3 agencies versus, with Title VII, the EEOC does not -­4 they're not a determiner of -­MS. LATHEROW: Yes, Your Honor.JUSTICE GINSBURG: It doesn't have to do evidence in a particular hearing. Can a person close relative sue on the grounds that he was deliberately so, in order to retaliate against910 with the11 whoisa12 injured,13 his spouse or his fiancée?14 MS. LATHEROW: Yes, Your Honor. I -- I15 don't know the distinction between relying on those -­16 those agencies versus the EEOC, but I do know that in17 the Burlington Court, this Court noted that the EEOC18 Compliance Manual -- and that's what we're talking19 about, is the compliance manual. We're not talking20 about a regulation. We're not talking something else,21 but a compliance manual. So, in your hypothetical, I22 don't know if we're talking about a compliance manual23 from the NLRB or OSHA, but this is a compliance manual.24 And, in Burlington, this Court noted that25 there were inconsistencies regarding the￼461 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425anti-retaliation within the compliance manual as to what an adverse action meant or what would constitute an adverse action.JUSTICE SCALIA: What's the function of the compliance manual? What does it do? Does it saywe'll -- we'll leave you alone if you do this?MS. LATHEROW: I don't know -­JUSTICE SCALIA: But they have to leave him alone. There's really nothing the EEOC can do to somebody, right, except -- what, can the EEOC take them to court?MS. LATHEROW: Yes, they can.JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, so can the Justice Department, but we don't defer, thank goodness, to the Justice Department's interpretation of the criminal law, do we?MS. LATHEROW: No.JUSTICE SCALIA: No.MS. LATHEROW: Your Honor, the concerns fromthe employment side in this case are substantial. Under Thompson's theory of the case, anyone who is injured -­ or what he says is "aggrieved" -- anyone who receives￼injury becomes a protected party. bringing the lawsuit, but it's the He's not even a silent47It's not just protected party. opposer in this case.1 There were -- there were concerns in Crawford about the2 silent opposer and how do we know who they are. He says3 it's based solely upon his relationship. He has engaged4 in no protected conduct. The silent opposer, assuming5 they can have -- bring a claim, at least engaged in some6 conduct, but Thompson has no protection under this7 statute. He could have very easily gotten the8 protection.9 In our joint appendix, we -- we've submitted10 the brief that Eric -- or the memo that Eric Thompson11 submitted to his supervisor just shortly before he was12 terminated. He complains in that memo about his13 compensation. And this is on page 22 and 23 of the14 joint appendix. He says -­15 JUSTICE SCALIA: 22 and 23 of -­16 MS. LATHEROW: The joint appendix.17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.18 MS. LATHEROW: He says in this memo: I am19 disappointed in compensation this year.20 At the time that he submitted this memo to21 his supervisor, his fiancée had a complaint or a charge22 with the EEOC pending. If he had only come forward in23 this memo, Congress says you would have gotten24 protection. If he had come forward and said, and by the25 way, I think the way you treat my wife is48￼1 discriminatory, he would have gotten protection.2 The -- the means by which employees get3 protection under the statute are not very difficult.4 All they have to do is to come forward and oppose.5 Thompson clearly had an avenue and a means to do that6 because he was taking -- he was taking action on his own7 behalf to complain. So Thompson wants to bring a claim8 under -- for Regalado, but he couldn't at that time come9 forward and step up to the plate and say to the10 employer, hey, I have a problem with this. But yet, he11 wants to come into court and to claim his rights -- or12 to claim her rights as a basis to bring this suit.13 According to the EEOC statistics, in 1992,14 when data first began being collected, 14.5 percent of15 charges filed with the EEOC were retaliation claims. By16 2009, that had risen by 31 percent.17 In the Chamber's brief on page 2, they18 submit -- or recite to a study that was published in19 1994 saying that the average cost to defend an20 employment litigation in 1994, when the study was21 published, was $120,000. In this case, what Thompson22 would propose is to give protected party to a wide range23 of people.24 And with respect to the Government's25 position today, at the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals49￼1 they advocated that there would be no limitation, that2 everyone would get the protection. That's a broad -­3 that is a lot of protection for people. And I can tell4 you that employers who are faced with someone in a5 protected party, they are -- employers are reluctant to6 take adverse decisions against them; they're reluctant7 to implement discipline; they will postpone implementing8 that decision because they know that at some point9 they're going to have to establish a legitimate10 nondiscriminatory reason.11 When we -- when we point out -- when we12 point this out in our arguments, the response by Eric13 Thompson as -- as to who gets the protection -- it's in14 his footnote on page 4 at his reply. He says that "the15 identity of individuals who might have a claim is a16 function of the employer's own intent."17 So, in other words, in order to determine18 whether someone has protection, you have to look at the19 employer's intent. So there are no protected parties20 anymore until the employer can establish that they had21 no intent -- or the other way. Everyone is a protected22 party until the employer can show that he had no intent.23 So what that means at the trial is that there will never24 be-­2550￼JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not sure why the1 employer's intent comes into this. A is the person who2 is being retaliated against, and the issue would be:3 Did the employer take such action against B as the A4 would think, quite reasonably -- he'd have to reasonably5 think that the action that the employer took was6 retaliation, was meant to be -- whatever those words7 were -- was -- might well have dissuaded a reasonable8 worker from making or supporting a charge of9 discrimination.10 MS. LATHEROW: But the position that's set11 forward by Thompson is you determine whether someone is12 a protected party by looking at the intent of the13 employer.14 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you'd have to show he15 had a retaliatory intent, that's true, but that's true16 however he retaliates.17 MS. LATHEROW: That's true at trial, though,18 after a plaintiff gets past his initial burden of proof.19 And in this case the plaintiff is going to be able to20 establish their burden of proof solely by saying that21 they were a protected party and there was intent on the22 other side. That is going to shift the burden to the23 employer at the outset of the case to prove that there24 was no retaliation, that there was no intent.25 Your Honor, in conclusion, the Sixth Circuit51￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Court of Appeals was correct. The Sixth Circuit determined that Eric Thompson, who was not discriminated against, had no protection under the statute. This Court clearly held in Burlington that the anti-retaliation provision of Title VII is designed to protect employees based upon what they do, based upon their conduct. In this case, Eric Thompson engaged in none of that behavior, he had no conduct, he did not come forward on behalf of anyone; yet, he is here asking for remedies, remedies that really should belong to Regalado.There's no reason that Regalado could not have brought this case. There -- if the concern is that employers are going to discriminate against employees, the response to that is employers will still be held liable and can still be held liable, and that is by the person who is discriminated against from bringing the suit.We ask that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals' decision be affirmed.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.Mr. Schnapper, you have 3 minutes remaining.

The argument was that you wouldn't have McDonnell Douglas anymore, and you wouldn't know how to proceed on this third-party claim.MR. SCHNAPPER: Your Honor, McDonnell Douglas -- the particular formula in McDonnell Douglas was for hiring cases. The courts have readily adapted it to other kinds of cases where the -- depending on the nature of the claim, the plaintiff produces some minimal amount of information, and the employer is required to -- to articulate a reason. But I don't think it would be a problem here.￼the -­Getting back to the question that was asked,JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure why not. MR.

What would be -- the prima facie5 case generally is they treated me differently than6 similarly situated people, I complained at a time close7 to my firing. There's -­8 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, there has to be -­9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- a whole series of10 prima facie elements.11 MR. SCHNAPPER: Right. There would have to12 be some evidence that could plausibly give rise to -- to13 an inference of motive. Even if I were complaining that14 I was retaliated against, I can't just come in and say I15 engaged in protected activity and was fired. I would16 need more than that.17 So you would need that additional amount18 here, plus you'd also have to have some evidence to give19 rise to an inference that this third party was selected20 as a victim. So it wouldn't -- you could -- you could21 adapt it.22 But getting back to what was asked earlier,23 there's no question the burden of proof is on the24 plaintiff at all times to establish motive; and as we25 get particularly far afield from family members, someone54￼1 closely associated with the plaintiff, it is going to be2 difficult to -- to establish, to meet that burden.3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What happens in4 the-­5 MR.

SCHNAPPER: I don't -- I don't -- I12 think this Court's decision in Burlington Northern makes13 it clear that the plaintiff wouldn't have to be an14 employee. In that case, one of the questions was, could15 you retaliate against an FBI agent by not protecting his16 wife from being murdered? I think that would be a17 pretty good way to -- to keep people from complaining.18 But I think the Burlington Northern19 limitation would -- you know, would have some traction20 in these cases. The animal shelter seems unlikely.21 But the burden of proof is there. As the -­22 as the relationship becomes more attenuated, once you23 get past family members, I think it's going to be24 difficult, even at summary judgment, for these cases to25 survive.
