WILLIAMS                ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER          MS. WILLIAMS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          The eight amendment requires that asentencing jury in a capital case must considermitigation, which this Court consistently has definedas related to a defendant's background, character, orthe circumstances of the offense.  The Oregon SupremeCourt in this case has broadly construed circumstancesof the offense to include evidence that is inconsistentwith the defendant's guilt.  That holding is notconstitutionally compelled and does not further thepurpose of having the sentencing jury considermitigation.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Can you --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Is it --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Can you --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  -- possible that theSupreme Court of Oregon misapprehended some of the 31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425facts in this case?          MS. WILLIAMS:  Justice O'Connor, it ispossible that the Supreme Court was not aware thatdefendant's mother had testified in the --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Right.          MS. WILLIAMS:  -- guilt phase, and that'sbecause defendant did not raise that issue in the trialcourt, did not move to have her alibi testimonyadmitted under the State statute that would have causedthe Court to address her prior --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Do we --          MS. WILLIAMS:  -- testimony.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  -- need to vacate thejudgment and remand for that, or --          MS. WILLIAMS:  No --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  -- do we just go ahead and--          MS. WILLIAMS:  No, Justice O'Connor, Ibelieve that there needs to be any change in theposture of the case in order -- in order for theto address the Federal issue, and that's becausesignificance of the Oregon Supreme Court ruling doesn'tturn on whether someone's testimony was admitted in theguilt phase, or not.JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, under Oregon law, is 41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-don'tCourt the￼1 it possible that some of the mother's testimony would2 be otherwise admissible at the penalty stage?3 MS. WILLIAMS: Under Oregon law, under the4 majority's holding in this case and the way they dealt5 with the grandfather's prior testimony, on remand6 defendant could have the mother's transcript from the7 guilt phase read, but what would be different about it8 under the Oregon Supreme Court holding, and what we're9 asking the Court to address, is what they can do with10 that alibi testimony, no matter what form it comes in.11 And that's the significant part of the Supreme Court12 holding.13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- may -- I want14 you, perhaps, to elaborate on that, as well. And15 perhaps the Respondent is the one to answer this16 question. Do you understand that they, on remand, if17 they prevail in this case, would want to introduce the18 mother's live testimony?19 20 21 22 2324 certainly25 It's very51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-MS. WILLIAMS:  I am not sure.  Under the --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  We're not sure --MS. WILLIAMS:  -- Oregon Supreme --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- all right.MS. WILLIAMS:  -- Court holding, they wouldbe free to introduce her live testimony.clear from the Oregon Supreme Court decision￼1 that any alibi evidence comes in, and that's not2 limited to evidence that was presented in the guilt3 phase, or even witnesses who had been in the guilt4 phase. And -- but coming back to what the court's5 holding focuses on is how that alibi evidence can be6 used in the remanded proceeding. And not only does it7 come in, and the primary statute on -- that they dealt8 with for the grandfather's testimony is really a9 statute that deals with admissibility of evidence --10 prevents the parties from having to go through making11 foundations and other showings in order to get evidence12 admitted. But, under the Oregon Supreme Court holding,13 defense counsel can argue, based on that evidence, that14 the jury should consider the possibility that defendant15 is innocent, as a mitigating factor in determining the16 sentence.17 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, can't you under --18 look, first imagine that they don't want to introduce19 one word from the mother's mouth that isn't already in20 that transcript. Imagine that's the circumstance. If21 that's the circumstance, then I should think there is22 no doubt, under Oregon law, that those words in the23 transcript are admissible. And I believe that under24 Oregon law -- and I'm not certain -- that, an ordinary25 case, a death-eligible person does have the right to61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 argue in the sentencing proceeding. Think back over2 that trial jury and you will see that there are doubts3 as to whether this man is guilty or not. Am I right --4 am I right on the first part? Am I right on the second5 part?6 MS. WILLIAMS: Justice Breyer, you are7 correct on the first part, but not on the second part,8 and that's because Oregon Supreme Court unanimously has9 construed Oregon's law on mitigation to say that what10 the Oregon Legislature intended was to have as11 mitigation only those pieces that are required by the12 eighth amendment.13 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. In other words,14 prior to this case, in the State of Oregon, where there15 was a death case -- maybe there weren't very many, but16 where there was one, under Oregon law -- we have the17 trial; immediately thereafter, the sentencing, and the18 lawyer had19 back about20 is guilty.21no right to argue, under Oregon law.  Thinkyour certainty as to whether this individualMS. WILLIAMS: That would be correct, Your 22 Honor, that --23 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, all right.24 MS. WILLIAMS: -- unless the eighth amendment25 --71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: And did the court say, here2 -- the Oregon court, in this case -- one, You can3 introduce evidence, which it seems to have been4 mistaken about, about not being there, but that,5 second, the Federal Constitution gives you the right to6 argue the residual doubt?7 MS. WILLIAMS: Yes, Your Honor. And that's8 most clear, from the dissent, as characterizing the9 question that the Court is addressing. And the Oregon10 Supreme Court opinion is in the -- excuse me -- the11 appendix to the cert petition. And at page 6812 of the appendix from the dissent, Justice Gillette13 writes, "The issue in this case is whether under the14 emphasized wording of that statutorily required jury15 instruction," referring to the mitigation question,16 "defendant was entitled to have the jury consider the17 evidence that he proffered. The majority says he was.18 I disagree."19 JUSTICE BREYER: Ah. "Consider the evidence"20 is different from "making an argument about the21 evidence." And what I didn't see in the -- Oregon's22 majority opinion, is a statement that not only can this23 evidence be introduced -- because, after all, in a24 normal case, the jury's heard it --25 MS. WILLIAMS: Yes.81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: It's the same jury. But I2 didn't see, anywhere, where they addressed the question3 about what kind of argument the defense had the right4 to make at the sentencing trial in respect to the5 residual doubt that they might have from what they just6 heard. Can you point, in that opinion, to where they7 made that statement that you just said they made about8 the argument?9 MS. WILLIAMS: About the argument. Where I10 read -- no, I cannot point to specific language in the11 majority opinion that says "and defense counsel gets to12 make an argument based on this, and the jury must13 consider that." That comes from this Court's case law14 of how mitigating evidence must be treated once it is -15 -16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You want --17 MS. WILLIAMS: -- required to be --18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You want us to hold that.19 You want us to say that a defense counsel can be20 admonished by the judge not to make the argument that,21 "Ladies and gentlemen, this is the final penalty. My22 client claims he's innocent. If, in 20 years, it turns23 out that there is evidence exonerating him, it will be24 too late. I want you to consider that and give him25 life." You can't make that argument.91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MS. WILLIAMS: Yes, Your Honor, I -- our2 position is that the eighth amendment does not require3 that as a mitigating factor, that that is not one of4 the circumstances of the offense, certainly not -- it5 doesn't go to the defendant's character or background.6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Williams, I don't -- I7 don't understand all of this discussion about what the8 -- whether the State law would have produced the same9 result, or not. We have never held, have we, that,10 where a State Supreme Court opinion clearly rests on a11 Federal ground, a Federal constitutional ground, we do12 not have jurisdiction if there is a possible State13 ground that would have left it -- led to the same14 result? Have we ever held that?1516 -1718 opposite,192021 of my question, of course. The thrust of my questionMS. WILLIAMS: No, Justice Scalia. In fact -JUSTICE SCALIA:  And we've said just thehaven't we?MS. WILLIAMS:  Yes, Justice Scalia.JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, that isn't the thrust22 is that if, in fact, this evidence from the23 comes in under State law, it comes in under24 because -- I have the cite; you know the --25 MS. WILLIAMS: Yes.101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  1-motherState law,Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: -- section I'm referring to.2 If it comes in under State law, and they're not trying3 to prove anything else, and the holding of the Oregon4 Supreme Court is about what evidence is admissible, and5 not about6 reason we7 the case.8what arguments to be made, I don't see whatwould have to reach an issue that isn't inMS. WILLIAMS: And, Justice Breyer, I think 9 the primary reason that the State is concerned with it10 is because of the broad holding that the Oregon Supreme11 Court has announced under -- about what eight amendment12 requires. When you combine that with what this Court13 has said about what that means when evidence is14 mitigating evidence, then I think a necessary corollary15 of the Oregon Supreme Court holding is that defense16 counsel does get to make that argument, and that the17 jury must 181920--CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But there's no --MS. WILLIAMS:  -- be permitted --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- reason that thecouldn't introduce other evidence in his21 defendant22 resentencing trial, is there?23 MS. WILLIAMS: Under the --24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, if he has25 other -- he says, "I have other witnesses that go to111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 the residual-doubt question," and I would -- you know,2 on retrial, if he prevails here, presumably he would be3 entitled to put in that evidence, as well.4 MS. WILLIAMS: That's correct, Mr. Chief5 Justice. The Oregon Supreme Court's conclusion is very6 broad, that any alibi evidence comes in, and, as the7 dissent notes, that it also would not be limited simply8 to alibi evidence, but any evidence that is9 inconsistent with the guilt verdict in this case that10 would form a basis for arguing that doubt about the11 defendant's guilt should be a factor that the jury12 considers13 --14 1516 case -- 171819 acknowledges that -- or stipulates, in effect, that20 he's not going to put anything in except what's already21 in the transcript? Then do we have a case?22 MS. WILLIAMS: I think you still have a case,23 Justice Stevens --24 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is it --25 MS. WILLIAMS: -- because --121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-in responding to the mitigation question thatJUSTICE KENNEDY:  Let me --JUSTICE STEVENS:  But what do we do with theJUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- ask you --JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- if your opponent￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- about the right toargue?  Is that what it is?          MS. WILLIAMS:  It's about the right to argueand what the jury is told to do with that.  And it'salso that the State is going to have to live with thisdecision in other capital cases, and other capitaldefendants --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes.  But our --          MS. WILLIAMS:  -- may not be willing to --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- jurisdiction is limitedto reviewing a final judgment in this case.          MS. WILLIAMS:  Yes.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  We can't give an advisoryopinion which would tell you what to do in other cases,which -- if that's all it does.          MS. WILLIAMS:  But I do not believe that aparty can force the Court into that position bystipulating that, although the State Supreme Courtholding permits it --the rightJUSTICE STEVENS:  But would they're --MS. WILLIAMS:  -- to do much more --JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- they would be giving upthat you claim you don't want them to have.MS. WILLIAMS:  But they would give it up in away that would basically lock the State into a box. We 131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 couldn't get --2 JUSTICE STEVENS: For other cases --3 MS. WILLIAMS: -- review here, we couldn't4 get --5 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- but not for this case.6 MS. WILLIAMS: -- review. Not for this case7 --8 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.9 MS. WILLIAMS: -- that's correct.10 JUSTICE STEVENS: That's why I'm concerned11 that perhaps we're being confronted with a request for12 an advisory opinion. I don't know. Maybe they haven't13 categorically agreed to what -- they may be going --14 willing to say that they aren't going to put anything15 else in. I don't really know that yet.16 MS. WILLIAMS: But I think their stipulation17 would have to have two parts -- one, that they wouldn't18 put anything else in that wasn't presented in the guilt19 phase; and, two, that they wouldn't argue that, based20 on that evidence, the jury should consider doubts about21 the defendant's guilt in deciding what the appropriate22 sentence is.23 JUSTICE STEVENS: We may -- we may not have24 held they have a constitutional right to make that25 argument, but do you -- do you think that State --141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that you did -- you don't think they could even make2 the argument as a matter of State procedure or anything3 at all?4 MS. WILLIAMS: Not on the mitigation5 question, Your Honor. And that's because of the way6 the Oregon Supreme Court has construed the mitigation7 question, and has construed it to mean that only that8 which the eighth amendment requires is to be presented9 to the jury. The Legislature adopted that provision in10 response to this Court's mitigation case law, and11 that's what they were intending to implement, and12 nothing more than that. I think States are free to do13 more, but Oregon has not, as a matter of how the Oregon14 Supreme Court has --15 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why is --16 MS. WILLIAMS: -- construed the statute --17 JUSTICE BREYER: What about Oregon revised18 stat 163.150? It says, "In a capital sentencing19 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that all20 evidence previously offered and received may be21 considered for purposes of the sentencing hearing."22 Now, that's Oregon law. It's long been there. What23 possible reason could Oregon have for having that24 provision, which is, "Jury, you shall consider all the25 evidence you just heard at the guilt phase of the151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 trial"? What reason could that be? How is it supposed2 to be relevant, "all evidence," unless it's relevant to3 the question of whether there is doubt?4 MS. WILLIAMS: Justice Breyer, I'd point you5 to the -- an earlier part of that same section of the6 statute that says, "Evidence may -- in the sentencing7 proceeding, evidence may be presented as to any matter8 that the court deems relevant to sentence." And their9 --10 JUSTICE BREYER: But that's a different11 provision. I'm now thinking of the "normal case,"12 where you hear the guilt phase, and now we're in the13 sentencing phase, and it says here, under Oregon law,14 "Judge, tell the jury that everything they previously15 heard at the guilt phase they may consider for purposes16 of what sentence they should impose." I just wonder17 what that sentence is doing there in Oregon law, unless18 the jury is supposed to think about whether this guy's19 really -- 2021 different22 you read the entire section, what it -- what it does23 is, it says that, first of all, parties may present24 additional evidence, if it's relevant. The -- they25 cannot present repetitive, or cumulative, evidence that"I'm completely certain he's guilty."MS. WILLIAMS:  There -- it does serve apurpose, Your Honor, and that is that -- when161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 had been presented earlier. And then, the court's2 supposed to inform that jury that what had come in the3 guilt phase may be considered in the penalty phase.4 And so -- and we've had the --5 JUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose that if that6 provision weren't there, the court would have to7 decide, item-of-evidence by item-of-evidence, which8 pieces, that the jury has already heard, were relevant9 to the penalty, and not to the guilt. Whereas, by just10 allowing everything in, but just telling the jury, "You11 only consider it insofar as it goes to the penalty, and12 not to the guilt," we -- the court does not have to13 enter into that item-by-item discrimination.14 MS. WILLIAMS: Justice Scalia, what it does15 is, it allows the jury to know that just because16 something hasn't been re-presented to them in the17 penalty phase, but came in, in the guilt phase, it's18 open for their consideration.19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Without any clue --20 MS. WILLIAMS: What it doesn't do --21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- without any clue22 whether there's a relevance test? I mean, here we're23 talking about alibi evidence. If the determination of24 guilt is final, then alibi is irrelevant at the penalty25 stage. That's why I found that statute so puzzling,171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that the jury doesn't have a clue. They're told,2 "Everything from the guilt phase comes in, you can3 consider," but it doesn't sort out, doesn't even tell4 them, relevance.5 MS. WILLIAMS: And, Justice Ginsburg, other6 jury instructions will inform the jury how to use what7 evidence. And this does not mean that evidence that8 has been presented is relevant for any purpose that9 anybody wants to put it to in the guilt phase.1011 which the 121314 that this15 Supreme Court might have decided this case. They did16 not decide it on that case -- on that ground. They17 decided that the jury has to be able to consider doubt,18 not because of that provision of the statute, but19 because of the eighth amendment. And --20 MS. WILLIAMS: Yes, Your Honor.21 JUSTICE SCALIA: And --22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, I wasn't suggesting23 anything other than what Justice Scalia said, but I was24 just curious about this statute that tells the jury,25 "You can consider everything," and gives them no181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-JUSTICE SCALIA:  That isn't the basis oncourt decided this case, is it?MS. WILLIAMS:  No, sir.JUSTICE SCALIA:  What we're saying here isis a possible basis on which the Oregon￼1 guidance, because some of it might be quite2 inappropriate for them to consider.3 MS. WILLIAMS: And the guidance does come4 from the other instructions that tell the jury what the5 specific questions are that they must answer in the6 penalty phase, and what they take into account in7 answering those questions.8 JUSTICE SOUTER: But --9 JUSTICE SCALIA: What has our constitutional10 law regarding the requirement of allowing the jury to11 consider all mitigating factors -- the requirement that12 they have to be allowed to be take into account of that13 -- what guidance has that provided? Has our14 constitutional law said what constitutes a mitigating15 factor?16 MS. WILLIAMS: In -- it has. And I believe17 that in Franklin versus Lynaugh, this Court came very18 close to deciding this question, that residual doubt is19 not one of those mitigating factors.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Apart from that, apart from21 the fact of whether the person's guilty or not, have we22 specified23 by way of2425 the Courtwhat factors the jury can take into accountmitigation?MS. WILLIAMS:  There are some factors thathas described as being required as19 Washington, DC 20005 1-1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400￼1 appropriate for mitigation. So, age, the mental state2 of the individual, the --3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't you think that if a4 State listed specific factors that could be taken into5 account, and no others, that there would be6 considerable doubt whether this Court would allow such7 a statute to stand?8 MS. WILLIAMS: I think certainly with respect9 to the background and character of the defendant, but10 the question here would be a fairly limited restriction11 to say that circumstances of the offense presume that12 the offense has occurred and that the defendant is13 guilty; and so, evidence inconsistent with that guilt14 is not a circumstance of the offense.15 And I'd like to reserve time for rebuttal.16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.17 Williams.18 Mr. Shanmugam.19 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM20 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,21 SUPPORTING PETITIONER22 MR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,23 and may it please the Court:24 It does not constitute cruel and unusual25 punishment to prohibit a capital defendant from201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 relitigating his guilt at sentencing. Contrary to the2 reasoning --3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have any view4 on whether this question is properly before us, given5 the Oregon statutes?6 MR. SHANMUGAM: Mr. Chief Justice, our view7 is that this Court certainly could reach the8 constitutional question presented. And, indeed, there9 are good reasons that this Court should.10 The Oregon Supreme Court squarely confronted,11 and resolved, the Federal constitutional question, and12 it is ripe for this Court's review. It is true, as13 Justice O'Connor suggested at the outset, that the14 Oregon Supreme Court appears to have been laboring15 under a factual misimpression -- namely, that16 Respondent's mother did not testify at the initial17 trial. That having been said, it appears to be clear18 that Respondent was seeking -- and is still seeking,19 even before this Court -- to introduce the live20 testimony of his mother.21 JUSTICE SOUTER: But --22 MR. SHANMUGAM: And the --23 JUSTICE SOUTER: But, based on what you have24 just said, which was my understanding, too, assuming25 the Oregon Supreme Court made the assumption that the211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 mother's testimony had not been admitted at prior2 trial, the only thing that the Oregon Supreme Court was3 ruling on was the admissibility of new testimony, and4 the use to which new testimony could be put, right?5 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, that is correct,6 Justice Souter.7 JUSTICE SOUTER: So that if the --8 MR. SHANMUGAM: I do think --9 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- if the other side says,10 "We totally give up any claim to introduce new11 testimony," then don't we have a jurisdictional12 problem?13 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think that we would14 agree with the State of Oregon that a necessary15 implication of the Oregon Supreme Court's holding,16 albeit unstated, was that a defendant is17 constitutionally entitled to argue residual doubt, as18 well as to present evidence of residual doubt. Were19 that not true, the failure to admit the evidence would,20 in some sense, be harmless, since it is true, certainly21 to some extent, that the mere presentation of the22 evidence might lead to the jury taking it into account23 even absent an argument or instruction to that effect.24 But, as a practical matter, this Court has never25 distinguished, in its consideration of mitigating221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 factors, between the presentation of argument or2 evidence and obtaining --3 JUSTICE SOUTER:4 MR. SHANMUGAM:5 JUSTICE SOUTER:6 possible for, it seems to7 possible that Oregon could say, "Look, we have a8 statute that says everything that was introduced at9 trial may be considered. That may be a good thing or a10 bad thing, but that's what our statute says, and they11 may consider it. But when the question comes, What new12 evidence may be admitted at the sentencing hearing --13 the sentencing phase only, then we're going to restrict14 that only to evidence which, in our view, is required15 by the eighth amendment."16 So, if that is, then -- we don't -- I don't17 know whether the Oregon Supreme Court took that view,18 or not. But if it did take that view, and, in this19 case, the Respondents say, "We no longer want to20 introduce any new evidence," then we would not have a21 case left, it seems to me.22 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think that that is23 true, to some extent, Justice Souter, but I do think24 that -- at least with regard to the question of what25 factors are relevant to the ultimate determination,231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1- Oh, we ---- an instruction -- -- have not, but it'sme -- for all we know, it's￼1 that is governed by a quite different statutory2 provision. And the Oregon Supreme Court construed that3 provision to limit the mitigating factors that the jury4 can take into account to those that are mandated by the5 eighth amendment.6789 point, itJUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, on that --MR. SHANMUGAM:  And I would further note --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- on that substantivedoes seem -- I assume a Governor could takeaccount in clemency?MR. SHANMUGAM:  Yes, certainly.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And I suppose the Governors10 this into 111213 can do more than juries can. But, still, it seems odd14 to me that a jury cannot consider that this is a close15 case. It's been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, of16 course. It goes at least to whether or not the17 defendant18 "I didn't1920 responsibility may present different issues, but we21 would submit that the fundamental problem with the22 constitutional rule that the Oregon Supreme Court did23 expressly adopt is that it would effectively allow24 jurors, at their discretion, to apply what is a higher25 standard of proof at capital sentencing than the241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-is obdurate in not accepting guilt.  He says,do it."MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, acceptance of￼1 reasonable-doubt standard, which, after all, is the2 standard that applies in all other criminal contexts.3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, no, the evidence goes4 to explain why the defendant is taking the position5 that he does. He said, "I wasn't there." Now, it's6 true, the jury, in the guilt phase, found that he was -7-8 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, the jury did --9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- at least it explains his10 attitude, his demeanor, his refusal to accept11 responsibility. There's a reason for that.12 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, the jury did determine,13 at the guilt phase, that the defendant was guilty14 beyond a reasonable doubt. And the fundamental point15 of the reasonable-doubt standard is that it is the16 highest standard of law -- of proof known to the law,17 short of absolute certainty. And I think, turning to18 this Court's case law in the mitigation area, this19 Court has, time and time again, limited mitigating20 evidence to evidence concerning the character or record21 of the defendant and the circumstances of the offense.22 And the reason for that, I think, is that the very23 concept of mitigating evidence really does presuppose24 that the defendant has committed the crime in the first25 place. To put it another way, mitigating evidence is251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 evidence that suggests that a defendant who has2 committed the crime is somehow less deserving of the3 death penalty. And going back to --4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it would follow from5 that, that if a State wanted to exclude the defense6 evidence on alibi from a sentencing jury's7 consideration -- let's assume it's a new -- a new8 sentencing jury -- they could do that.9 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we believe that that10 would be permissible. And I think, going back to the11 joint opinion in Woodson versus North Carolina, which12 was really where this constitutional requirement of13 mitigation was first recognized, this Court did not14 suggest in any way that, to the extent that15 individualized consideration at sentencing is mandated,16 a jury is entitled to consider any and all factors that17 it might think is relevant. Instead, the Court really18 recognized a category of mitigating factors that is19 limited to factors that are traditionally taken into20 account at sentencing -- namely, the character or21 record of the defendant and the circumstances --22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, that's true --23 MR. SHANMUGAM: -- of the offense.24 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- with respect to putting25 in new evidence. I understand your point. But there -261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425- as a realistic matter, do you think it's possible toprevent a juror from deciding, "I thought it was reallya closer case than beyond a reasonable doubt; and so,I'm a little hesitant about the death penalty"?There's no way to prevent that --          MR. SHANMUGAM:  I think --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- from happening.          MR. SHANMUGAM:  -- as a practical matter, itmay be very difficult to --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes.          MR. SHANMUGAM:  -- prevent it.  I'm not surethat it is necessarily desirable for jurors to do that. And there is some suggestion, in the empiricalevidence, that what actually goes on in the jury roomis that jurors with some level of doubt about adefendant's guilt will actually negotiate with otherjurors to ensure that a defendant is convicted, butends up not being sentenced to death.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there's -- used on theother side and as a policy model, the model penal code,I think, says it's okay.  It -- not really that it'sokay.  It should be considered.          MR. SHANMUGAM:  Justice Ginsburg, the modelpenal code does say that.  It was adopted, I think, in1962.  And I think that it is telling that, in the271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 years since 1962, since this Court recognized that the2 death penalty was constitutional again in the 1970s, no3 State has expressly adopted a statute that permits4 consideration of residual doubt in --5 JUSTICE SCALIA: When you --6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there are a number of7 States that do --8 MR. SHANMUGAM: To be sure, there are courts9 in several States -- I think we identified seven in our10 brief -- 111213JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Your --MR. SHANMUGAM:  -- that have --JUSTICE GINSBURG:   -- position is --MR. SHANMUGAM:  -- recognized --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- that it's up to thetake it, but it's not compelled by the eighth14 1516 States, I17 amendment.18 MR. SHANMUGAM: That's exactly right, Justice19 Ginsburg, just as it would be up to the States, at20 their discretion, to decide to simply adopt a higher21 standard of proof across the board in capital cases. A22 State could certainly decide to adopt an absolute-23 certainty standard. But I think my point is simply24 that no State has expressly permitted consideration of25 residual doubts. Courts have construed statutes in281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 some States to permit it, typically because those State2 statutes contain broad language either with regard to3 the definition of "mitigating factors" or with regard4 to the discretion the jury has in making the ultimate5 sentencing determination.6 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, you think -- you think7 the Oregon Supreme Court might well come out that way,8 if it wished, although not resting on the eighth9 amendment?10 MR. SHANMUGAM: Might come out that way with11 regard to the right of a defendant to, say, argue12 residual doubt?13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.14 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, there's no indication15 of that on the face of the opinion. And I think that,16 in some sense, it would be quite difficult for the17 Oregon Supreme Court to do that, having construed the18 statute that governs the determination that the jury19 actually makes at sentencing, to limit the factors that20 the jury can consider to those that this Court has21 recognized are constitutionally mandated under the22 eighth amendment. So, as a practical matter, I think23 the Oregon Supreme Court's reasoning in this case24 really forecloses that interpretation.25 If the Court has no further questions, we291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 would ask 2345678 Associate 9that the Court vacate the decision --Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.Mr. Wolf.  ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD L. WOLF      ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTMR. WOLF:  Thank you.  Mr. Chief Justice,Justices, may it please the Court:Hopefully, I can simplify this matter for the10 Court. As is set forth in our brief, and in our motion11 that was recently filed, Mr. Guzek does disclaim any12 reliance on the eighth amendment of the United States13 Constitution as a basis for admitting, at his retrial -14 -15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that16 doesn't matter. I mean, the question is what the17 Oregon Supreme Court did, and it's quite clear that it18 based its decision on the eighth amendment, not these19 various provisions of Oregon evidence law.20 MR. WOLF: Well, with all due respect, Mr.21 Chief Justice, if Mr. Guzek does not intend to rely22 upon the eighth amendment, I think that this would moot23 the case and that the -- this Court could then vacate24 that portion of the Oregon Supreme Court's opinion.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You argue in -- an301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 eighth amendment case in the Supreme Court, you win on2 the eighth amendment, then you leave the courthouse and3 say, "Well, I don't want it anymore," and you think4 that moots the case?5 67 decision,8 admit any9MR. WOLF:  Well --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's still abinding in this case, giving you the right toevidence on residual doubt in the retrial.MR. WOLF:  Well, I respectfully disagree.  In10 -- because, in fact, we didn't really argue, in the11 Oregon Supreme Court, that we were entitled,12 necessarily, under the eighth amendment. Our argument13 was primarily under the statute, that this statute says14 any evidence which came in should be admitted in the15 retrial.16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you don't17 question, or doubt, that the State Supreme Court18 decision was based on the eighth amendment.19 MR. WOLF: That's correct.20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.21 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, if we vacate it and the22 case is remanded on that ground, I assume it's still23 open for you to point out to the Oregon Supreme Court24 that they were in error about the -- about the status25 of the testimony that you tried to get in, and have it311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425admitted on that ground.  Why isn't that the way tohandle the matter, rather than your --          MR. WOLF:  That --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- as you express it,"mooting the case"?          MR. WOLF:  Well, that -- we believe that weare entitled to present it under State law, and wethink that is the resolution.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, that -- therewould still remain -- whether you mooted the case, orwhether we vacated and then it was left to the OregonSupreme Court whether to let this evidence in -- therewould still remain the question of what kind of aninstruction the jury can be given regarding theconsideration of this evidence for purposes not ofdetermining whether a guilty person should not be giventhe death penalty, but, rather, for purpose ofconsidering whether the guilt is clear enough.  I mean,that's -- that issue would still remain, wouldn't it?          MR. WOLF:  Well, not necessarily.  I --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why wouldn't it?          MR. WOLF:  Well, I think, under Oregon law,we are entitled to put on -- well, first we have todistinguish between these unitary juries and theseretrial juries, because, of course, the retrial jury321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 has not heard the evidence from the guilt/innocence2 phase, from the original trial. And in the event that3 a retrial jury is hearing -- they're hearing this4 evidence for the first time, and the State should not5 be permitted to just put on the evidence that they6 think helps aggravate the case.7 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I understand, but what8 are you -- what are you going to argue to that jury?9 Are you going to argue to that jury, you know, that,10 "Yes, my client has been convicted, but the evidence of11 his guilt12 take that13 14was really not all that clear, and you shouldinto" -- don't you want to make that argument?MR. WOLF:  Well, that's a potential argument.JUSTICE SCALIA:  And the Oregon Supreme Court15 says you can make that argument, because the eighth16 amendment17 argument.18 19requires you to be able to make thatMR. WOLF:  But we think --JUSTICE SCALIA: And what the State says is, 20 "No, the eighth amendment requires no such thing." So,21 the issue hasn't gone away. It's still here. It's22 here in this very case.23 MR. WOLF: Well, we think we're entitled to24 make it, under Oregon law, in a -- regardless of25 whether we're entitled to make it under -- 331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SCALIA:  What the --          MR. WOLF:  -- eighth amendment.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, no, no.  You're entitledto get the evidence in, under Oregon law, but thequestion of how that evidence can properly be used bythe jury has been decided by the Oregon Supreme Courtonly on the basis of the eighth amendment, not on thebasis of any Oregon statute.          MR. WOLF:  I disagree, Justice Scalia,because the court has said that this evidence,regardless -- with respect to the grandfather --regardless of its substance, is to be admitted.  And ifit's to be admitted, it is to be considered.  Thestatute with --JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  But considered --MR. WOLF:  -- which Justice Breyer --JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  -- for what?  That's theI mean, here is someone who's been foundproblem.guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.          MR. WOLF:  Correct.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  And I don't see how it'srelevant to go in at sentencing and say, "Oh, but thereare all these doubts."  I mean, by finding "beyond areasonable doubt," there isn't a reasonable doubt left.MR. WOLF: The -- 341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: You -- I don't see how2 that's open to argument. You can say, "Consider the3 evidence that shows he's a good person underneath it4 all," or, "There -- he has some moral values that ought5 to be respected," or something like that, or, "He's6 capable of doing good things." But I don't see how you7 can argue doubt.8 MR. WOLF: Well, first of all, we never did9 argue doubt. The words "residual doubt" never occurred10 in this -- in the trial court, they never appeared11 before the Oregon Supreme Court. Lingering residual12 doubt was never argued. But in the hypothetical case,13 the defendant is entitled, and the statute instructs14 the jury, to consider the evidence from both phases of15 the trial for all -- for the sentencing purposes. And16 the Oregon statute is sui generis in the sense that we17 have a statute that has four questions the jury must18 answer beyond a reasonable -- the first three must be19 answered beyond a reasonable doubt. And these are20 factual questions related to the crime. Did the21 defendant act deliberately? So, in essence, what we22 have is -- a case which is charged as an aggravated23 murder does not make the defendant death-eligible at24 that point. The defendant is not death-eligible until25 he is first convicted of aggravated murder beyond a351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 reasonable doubt, and then, in the penalty phase, he is2 found to have committed the act deliberately, he is3 found to have -- the victim should not have -- did not4 provoke him, and his response5 JUSTICE SCALIA: In6 MR. WOLF: Correct.7 JUSTICE SCALIA: In8 MR. WOLF: It has not --9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Hasn't that already been found10 in the guilt phase?11 MR. WOLF: No. No, Your12 penalty phase --13 JUSTICE SCALIA: You --14 MR. WOLF: -- questions.15 JUSTICE SCALIA: You can16 murder when you didn't intend to kill?17 MR. WOLF: No, you must be found guilty of18 intentional murder. But, in the penalty phase, the19 very first question in our statute, which appears in20 the appendix of the State's brief, is whether the21 conducts of the defendant that caused the death of the22 deceased was committed deliberately and with the23 reasonable expectation that the death of the deceased,24 or another, would result. So, it's additional mental25 state, a factual determination, that goes beyond361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-was unreasonable to that.the penalty phase.the penalty phase?Honor.  Those arebe found guilty of￼1 whether you intentionally caused death. That--2 JUSTICE SCALIA: That seems to be very strange,3 because I think our cases require -- require that for4 death eligibility, and --5 MR. WOLF: Well, I don't disagree with you,6 Your Honor, and -- however, our petition in this matter7 was not granted. But the -- this -- that is the -- the8 point is that our statute is very unique. I don't know9 of any other --10 JUSTICE STEVENS: I have two questions, if I11 may. One -- of course, that wouldn't -- the alibi12 evidence would already have been rejected, whether13 there was deliberateness or not, so that would not14 support putting in the alibi evidence. But the second15 question I have -- I wanted to be sure we're clear on -16 - do you intend, on the future hearing, to introduce17 anything other than the transcript of the prior18 proceeding? Do you intend to introduce live witnesses19 under -- as you may, perhaps, be able to, under Oregon20 law?21 MR. WOLF: Well, first of all --22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Because I got the23 impression, from your motion to dismiss the writ as24 improvidently granted, that you did not. But I don't25 see anything unequivocally establishing that in the371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425record.          MR. WOLF:  Well, we believe that we areentitled to -- clearly, under the --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  To --          MR. WOLF:  -- statute, to --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  To put in --          MR. WOLF:  -- put on the live testimony ofthe  -- of the --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Oh, okay.          MR. WOLF:  -- of the mother.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  But is that --          MR. WOLF:  The statute --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  So, there definitely is acase before us, then.          MR. WOLF:  Well --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, do you intend to --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Then there was really nobasis for your motion to dismiss the writ asimprovidently granted, if that's true.          MR. WOLF:  Well, perhaps not as improvidentlygranted, but if there is -- if the evidence comes in,under Oregon law, and we are disavowing any reliance onthe --          JUSTICE BREYER:  But under --          MR. WOLF:  -- eighth amendment --381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- Oregon law, what is notclear is -- you want to put the mother on the stand.          MR. WOLF:  Right.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, do you want to go intoanything at all that wasn't raised at the trial?          MR. WOLF:  Well --          JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, that --          MR. WOLF:  -- for us to go into anything thatwasn't raised in the original trial, that wouldbe otherwise relevant.          JUSTICE BREYER:  That's right.  So --          MR. WOLF:  And so, for example, if --          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- that's why I wantthat.  That's what's ambiguous.          MR. WOLF:  -- if mom --have toto know          JUSTICE BREYER:  Look, you only get to gointo something if it was not otherwise -- if it isotherwise relevant; and, therefore, if you want to.The reason they think it is relevant is because of aconstitutional holding of the Oregon Supreme Court.So, if you want to go into something, we have to decidewhether it is, or is not, otherwise relevant.  If youwant to ask the same thing, that's just a question ofwhether you have to have a transcript or a livewitness.  And I don't know that that's a question that391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425depends on their constitutional holding.  So, I want toknow, Do you want to go into things that are not therein the original trial, yes or no?          MR. WOLF:  Well, no.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I don't understand thatanswer, in light of the previous discussion about thedeliberate -- deliberately.          MR. WOLF:  Well, the deliberateness, YourHonor -- to this --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Did the Oregon courts takethe position that, in the sentencing phase, the"deliberately" requirement must be judged just by whatwas in -- introduced in the guilt phase?          MR. WOLF:  No, it -- it's -- additionalevidence can be put on.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I thought that --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- you told us additionalevidence on deliberation can be put in the -- in thesentencing phase.  But then you're saying that you'renot going to do that.          MR. WOLF:  Well, I guess it depends on thenature of -- if it is to impeach the codefendant'stestimony, if that's deemed to be additional --401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. No, I'm not2 saying that. I -- look, until this minute, you might3 have been equivocal. You're quite right, I was leading4 you.5 [Laughter.]6 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, that doesn't mean you7 can't say yes or no. You can decide right now. So,8 decide. And I'm -- I will be bound by the answer, as I9 think we all are. And if your answer is, "Yes, I want10 to go into otherwise relevant things," I'd like to know11 that. And if the answer is no, I want to know that,12 too.13 MR. WOLF: Well --14 JUSTICE SCALIA: I would pass, if I were you.15 [Laughter.]16 MR. WOLF: Well, I didn't --17 JUSTICE BREYER: No, if you pass -- if you18 pass, I will think you do. And as long as you do, I19 think we have to decide whether it is, or is not,20 otherwise relevant. I'm being totally open and honest21 with you.22 [Laughter.]23 MR. WOLF: Well, as a matter of Oregon law,24 we think we can -- we could put mom on, she could25 testify verbatim from her original trial, and she could 411111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425be asked, or she could say, "And I love my son.  Pleasedon't kill him."JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, I'm not being tricky I want to know if we have to go to the words relevant" in the Oregon statute -- relevant," particularly in respect to thisabout it."otherwise"otherwisequestion of residual doubt.          MR. WOLF:  Well, the -- it -- I'd ask --          JUSTICE BREYER:  I really would like ananswer, if possible.          MR. WOLF:  Well, it -- the answer, YourHonor, is, I'd ask the Court to look to page 3 of ourbrief, where the statute is set forth, and lookcarefully at the way that statute is worded, whichsays, "Either party may recall any witness whotestified at the prior trial or sentencing proceedingand may present additional relevant evidence."          JUSTICE BREYER:  Right.  And they said thatrelevance is -- of residual doubt is relevant.  And thereason that it's relevant is because the Constitutionof the United States requires the jury to hear it.          MR. WOLF:  No --          JUSTICE BREYER:  That is what I am focusingon, and I want to know if you want to go into"otherwise relevant," for that reason.421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR.

And residual doubt was never argued to thetrial court, to the Oregon Supreme Court; and,therefore, whether or not it can come in --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It said that youralibi defense, that had been rejected by the priorjury, was relevant under the eighth amendment.          MR. WOLF:  It did say that.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.          MR. WOLF:  But it's relevant to this idea ofdeliberation.  For example, if the defendant -- thecodefendants have testified that the -- Mr. Guzek isthe mastermind of this, and that he helped plan this.If the alibi goes to whether or not he was present forall of those events that relate to this issue --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That --          MR. WOLF:  -- of deliberation --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- that brings up aquestion I have.  Particularly under the resentencingprovision, it looks like the sentencing trial is goingto be just a rerun of the guilt trial, because yourmain evidence that you want to put in is alibievidence, "I didn't do it."  So, you're going to say,"Here's" -- the mother is going to say, "I -- he was at431111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 home." And then, presumably, the State gets to put on2 all of its witnesses, saying, "No, here are the people3 who saw him do it," and blah, blah, blah. And so, it's4 just the same trial all over again.56 different7 --8 91011 know, that's the whole problem here. Your client has12 been tried as to whether he committed the offense, and13 found guilty, and now you --14 MR. WOLF: Right.15 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- now you want to16 relitigate the same matter. I don't --17 MR. WOLF: Not --18 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't --19 MR. WOLF: -- not that the same matter.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: And on the basis that the21 Constitution requires you to be able to relitigate the22 same matter two times in the same criminal proceeding,23 that doesn't seem, to me, right.24 MR. WOLF: Well, but the -- but the factual -25 - there are factual determinations to be made in the441111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-MR. WOLF:  It could be.  But it could be atrial, such as we would propose in this caseJUSTICE SCALIA:  They used to have --MR. WOLF:  -- in the sense that --JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- two trials.  I mean, you￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425sentencing proceeding that are a continuation of theoriginal trial.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So, let's go to theconstitutional --          MR. WOLF:  Okay.          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- issue.  Now, let'simagine we have a trial.  And at the trial, we have alot of evidence about the alibi.          MR. WOLF:  Right.          JUSTICE BREYER:  And what the State Courtsays, "This is our law.  When a person is" -- now go tothe sentencing phase, the jury has heard it --          MR. WOLF:  Right.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay?  So, they take it intoaccount.  And, moreover, we tell them they have toconsider it.          MR. WOLF:  Right.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay?  That's a State law.Now, what happens when there's an appeal in the middle,and now we go back just to the sentencing?  Here's whatwe do.  We introduce the transcript.  And, moreover, weintroduce some live witnesses to say what they saidbefore, but nothing else.          Now, you're saying there is a constitutionalright to present an additional witness on the matter451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425     that has already been litigated to go into things that     were not there in the trial before.               MR. WOLF:  Well, if --               JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, my goodness, if you had     real evidence of an alibi, why didn't you put it in the     first time?  And if, in fact, you -- it's not such good     evidence, and so forth, why does the State have to     waste its time to hear some more about the alibi that     you didn't put in the first time?  I mean, you know,     that's what you're saying the Constitution protects.     I'm being a little skeptical.  I want to know what your     answer is.               MR. WOLF:  Well, we did put it in the first     time in this case, and we don't necessarily need to     rely on the eighth amendment, we believe, to put it in,     if --               JUSTICE BREYER:  No, I'm agreeing with you --               MR. WOLF:  Right.               JUSTICE BREYER:  -- insofar as you have a     right to put in what you've put in the first time.               MR. WOLF:  Right.               JUSTICE BREYER:  I agree with you on that     one.  But you said you wanted to do something else.     You wouldn't say, "We don't want to do something else."You --461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. WOLF:  Well --          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- want to do more.          MR. WOLF:  If --          JUSTICE BREYER:  And, in the "more" part,where does the Constitution protect you?  I'm willingto, at least hypothetically, go with you on theprotection for what they already heard.          MR. WOLF:  The Constitution protects us inthe sense that it allows us to rebut and respond andreply to evidence offered by the State in aggravationof a sentence of death.  And if they're offeringevidence that he is -- he acted deliberately, we have aright to respond to that.  We don't have to sit therewith our hands tied behind our back.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And your --          MR. WOLF:  And --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- response is that hewasn't there.  It's one thing to say, "It wasintentional, but you didn't prove deliberate."  Theother thing is to say, "He wasn't there.  He didn'tcommit the crime in the first place."  Those are twoquite different things.          MR. WOLF:  Well, but it's also a question of,"How much of it was he there for?" -- as in Green.  Washe there when he -- was he there for the planning471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425stage?  Because the jury is to consider all of theevidence.  So, if he --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought -- well, I guessit  -- I guess it depends on what you mean by an"alibi."  If all you mean by an "alibi" is that, forpart of the offense, he was somewhere -- I thought analibi meant, "I am not guilty, because I was notthere."  That's what I thought an alibi was --          MR. WOLF:  I think "alibi" means, "I wassomewhere else at the time of the offense."  But ifwhat the jury --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  But it sounds --          MR. WOLF:  -- has considered --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  -- like you're trying torelitigate that question at the sentencing hearing.And, certainly, the eighth amendment does not requirethat.MR. WOLF: No.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  So, to the extent theOregon Supreme Court thought that, and rested itsholding on that, we ought to reject it out of hand.          MR. WOLF:  Well, but our statute requires thejury, in the sentencing phase, to make these additionalfactual determinations about the offense.JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, that's up to the 481111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 court, on remand, but it ought to be straightened out2 that the eighth amendment does not require relitigation3 of where the defendant was at the time of the murder.4 That was the basis for the "beyond a reasonable doubt"5 finding of guilt.6 MR. WOLF: Of guilt, but not necessarily of7 the -- but if the evidence of deliberation occurred at8 other events in the chain of events, than the alibi is9 relevant to the sentencing question the jury must10 decide. It's also relevant to -- perhaps, to11 provocation. So, there are factual determinations that12 the sentencing jury has to make.13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you put it -- make it14 concrete for this case? Because I don't see that there15 would be -- I mean, if the action is intentional, and16 the question was whether it was deliberate, what17 planning here would have gone on in some different18 timeframe?19 MR. WOLF: Well, there was -- there was a20 timeframe of -- there was evidence that they -- the21 codefendants testified that the -- the three of them22 planned to do another burglary of a different house,23 and then -- the codefendants' timeframes are rather24 fuzzy, but then they went back, at some point, to the25 defendant's father -- house to obtain weapons, and then491111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 went on to the ultimate victim's house. So, to the2 extent that this deliberation includes events that3 occurred before the actual homicide, it's relevant to4 this deliberation question.5 And, additionally, the --6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I still don't -- I still7 don't understand. You say that there was -- there had8 to be proof for conviction and guilt -- of guilt of9 intentional conduct. And this is a simple story that's10 told: they wanted to go to one house, too many lights11 on in that house; they were frustrated, they wanted to12 go someplace else, so they came upon the aunt and uncle13 of the defendant's former girlfriend.14 MR. WOLF: Well, it was a much longer15 timeframe than that. There was testimony that they16 went back to town, and went to the father's house and17 obtained weapons before they went to the house where18 the homicides occurred.19 The other issue is that there has been20 subsequent evidence, since the first trial. These21 codefendants have recanted certain statements. They22 have recanted --2324 in? 25CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You want to put thatMR. WOLF: Yes. We believe that that's -- 501111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425we're entitled to do that to rebut --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   Any new -- any newevidence relevant to alibi or degree of guilt.          MR. WOLF:  Not to -- no, I wouldn'tcharacterize it as to alibi.  Any evidence that goes tothe sentencing questions the jury must consider, todeliberation, to --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And you -- and youwant to retain the right to put in whatever evidence isrelevant on those questions.          MR. WOLF:  Absolutely.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, then what wasall the discussion about the mother's having -- then,when you go back, you can put on anything, whether itwas presented before, or not, right?  Because theeighth amendment requires that, according to the OregonSupreme Court.          MR. WOLF:  Well, whether it's required underthe eighth amendment, or not, is for you to decide,obviously, but we think --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.          MR. WOLF:  -- that it's whether or not Oregonlaw also requires it.  And we believe, under Oregonlaw, we're entitled to put this on, we're entitled torebut this.  For example, Justice Kennedy was talking511111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 about a scenario -- and, in this very case, the joint2 appendix, at page 92, the prosecutor in this case --3 this is an excerpt from the trial -- was trying to get4 in evidence that the defendant was being manipulative.5 And, at this point, the alibi evidence had been6 excluded. And so, the fact that the defendant was not7 taking responsibility, perhaps was being deemed as8 manipulating people by trying to get them to come9 forward to say, "I wasn't there," then alibi is10 relevant to respond -- to rebut and respond to that11 kind of an argument.12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Whatever Oregon law might13 say, or not say, it appears that this Supreme -- Oregon14 Supreme Court was acting under what it thought was the15 compulsion of the eighth amendment. If it's wrong16 about that, you can make your argument about what17 Oregon law should be, without any eighth amendment18 constraint.19MR. WOLF:  Correct.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it does seem that thisoperating on the assumption that the eighthrequired it to let in this alibi and other2021 court was22 amendment23 evidence.2425 Oregon Supreme Court went farther than it needed to inMR. WOLF: And we think -- we agree that the 521111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425this case in order to decide the issue, because, underOregon law, mom testified --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But, you know, we're beingasked to decide whether Oregon Supreme Court correctlyinterpreted the Federal Constitution.  And you seem tobe making most of your argument to the effect, "Well,we don't really need that holding.  We can prevail onOregon law."          MR. WOLF:  Uh-huh.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But are you going to makeany argument in support of the decision made by theOregon Supreme Court?          MR. WOLF:  No, not as long as the State ofOregon agrees that this statute operates in anevenhanded fashion.  In other words, if they get torecall witnesses who originally testified, or presenttranscript testimony, then we should have the sameright.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, this is --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  -- so odd.  It -- almostas though we should appoint some amicus here, Counsel,to argue in support of the merits.          MR. WOLF:  Well --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  I mean, you don't seem to531111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 be doing that.2 MR. WOLF: Well, Your Honor, on the merits,3 we --4 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: It's very strange.5 MR. WOLF: Well, we think that the -- that6 the Oregon Supreme Court decision was correct in -- on7 the -- on the eighth amendment. And we think it's --8 but it's -- not necessarily for the reasons stated by9 the Oregon Supreme Court. And the fact is that if the10 Oregon Supreme Court held that we have a right to -- we11 believe that we have a right to respond to any evidence12 they offer on aggravation.13 JUSTICE BREYER: What about -- what about --14 for example, the single most important feature leading15 juries to recommend against death, apparently, from the16 studies, is their residual doubt. Every juror who17 hears sentencing matters directly after a trial18 automatically takes that into account. Therefore,19 those who are resentenced and have a new jury should20 have the same kind of right. Otherwise, it's cruel and21 unusual.22 Now, I made that argument. You didn't23 make it. But it seems to me that there are several24 arguments that you might make in favor of the Oregon25 Supreme Court's approach if, at least, you concede that541111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 it is up to Oregon to control, through its evidentiary2 rules, whether a matter is relevant, what form it comes3 in, et cetera.4MR. WOLF:  Well, we think that if -- bythat the jury consider all evidence in boththe trial, it must be relevant.  Why else5 directing6 phases of7 would they instruct the jury to consider such evidence,8 unless it was relevant to the sentencing questions9 the jury must answer? And obviously I agree with you,10 Justice Breyer, that if the -- if a defendant must run11 the gamut of having -- we have to remember that the12 first trial was set aside because it was defective in13 some way. And it would be an anomalous result for the14 resentencing jury to not be entitled to hear what the15 first jury heard when the defendant had an16 unconstitutional, or a defective, trial. So --17 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Wolf, in view of the18 direction this discussion is going in, I want to go19 back to something that I really think we all thought we20 had passed but I would like to go back and get clear21 on. My recollection is that you stated, in your answer22 to Justice Stevens, that you currently maintain that23 you have a right to recall the mother to the stand at24 the -- at the sentencing proceeding.25 My question, which is prompted by your motion551111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 -- my question is, Is it your present intention to call2 the mother to the stand, or is it your present3 intention to use the mother's testimony, which we all -4 - I understand to be admissible? Are you going to call5 her, or not?6 7 8 9MR. WOLF:  Well, we would intend to call her.JUSTICE SOUTER:  You do intend to call her.MR. WOLF:  Because we think it's important --JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, I'm not asking why.  Ito know whether you are.  And your10 just want11 representation to me is that you do intend to call her12 as a live 131415witness as the -- at the resentencing.MR. WOLF:  Yes.JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.MR. WOLF:  And I'd like to answer the reasonbecause we think the jury is entitled to see16 for that,17 her demeanor and gauge, based on how she testifies, how18 believable she is. We think it's much -- we think it's19 better for a jury to be able to see a live witness than20 hear a cold transcript being read by surrogates.21 And so, of course, in -- as we know, in -- if22 she were to stray from what she testified at the23 original trial, of course she would be impeached with,24 "Well, you didn't testify about that the first time."25 But the jury, we think, as the statute clearly561111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425indicates, should allow witnesses who testifiedoriginally to be recalled, unless, for some reason,they're unavailable --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Wolf, I --          MR. WOLF:  -- in which case --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- I had misunderstoodsomething.  There's going to be a new sentencing, butthere also is going to be a new trial, is there, onthe merits?          MR. WOLF:  No.  There --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Why -- because youmentioned, earlier, about the defect in the trial.          MR. WOLF:  The convictions -- well, thedefect was in the penalty phase.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Oh, okay.          MR. WOLF:  And so, the convictions areaffirmed.  The jury is going to be instructed, "Thedefendant stands convicted, has been found convictedbeyond a reasonable doubt."  It is to decide these fourquestions:  Did he act deliberately?  Does heconstitute a future danger?  And, to the extent theGovernment puts on evidence that addresses thoseconcerns, we believe we have the right to respond tothat.And also -- we also have to remember that the 571111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 -- that the alibi in this case was -- really was2 offered as impeachment of the codefendants. The3 codefendants are really the only evidence that links4 the defendant to these crimes. And so, to the extent5 that -- it's impeachment by contradiction. So, while6 they may find that if the codefendants say, "He did A,7 B, and C," and mom says, "No, he was with me," it8 doesn't necessarily mean that he was with mom, only9 that they should disbelieve the codefendants. And that10 is a -- although it seems incongruous, that's standard11 impeachment by contradiction. The jury is given an12 instruction that they're to consider it for the limited13 purpose of whether or not to believe the codefendants,14 but not necessarily as substantive evidence of alibi.15 And that happens in trials every day. So, we don't16 think it's that unusual for the -- if the evidence17 relates to the sentencing questions the jury must18 consider, then it should come in.19 So, the other point that I think is important20 in this case is that the -- you know, the -- it's21 really not unlike this -- cases that this Court has22 held, Sumner versus Shuman, and Skipper. If the23 Government puts on evidence --24 I see my time is up.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel. 581111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          Ms. Williams, you have 2 minutes remaining.         REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARY H. WILLIAMS                ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER          JUSTICE SCALIA:  General Williams, I have onequestion.  I'm not sure it goes to our eighth amendmentquestion before us, but I honestly don't understandwhat your statute is all about.  It says that afterhaving been convicted of aggravated murder --aggravated murder -- the sentencing jury shall bepresented with the following questions.  Number one,whether the conduct of the defendant that caused thedeath of the deceased was committed deliberately andwith the reasonable expectation that death of thedeceased,find thator another, would result.  Don't you have toin order to convict of aggravated murder?MS. WILLIAMS:  Justice Scalia, we copied fromTexas on those special issues.  And so, in theguilt phase, what you have to establish is thedefendant acted intentionally.  And that's what'srequired as far as a constitutional state of mind.And the deliberateness question is sort of anintentional-plus.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Plus, okay.          MS. WILLIAMS:  It's from an additional --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- I gotcha.591111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MS. WILLIAMS: -- finding, beyond2 intentional, that the State has to then establish in3 the penalty phase.4 Two quick points. First, on how this5 evidence was offered. It was not offered as6 impeachment evidence. It was not offered under any7 State statute. If you look in the joint appendix, the8 second volume, at page 94 is the notice of intent to9 rely on evidence of alibi as mitigating evidence. And10 then there's an accompanying memo that follows. And,11 also, at page 88 of the joint appendix, there's a12 colloquy between defense counsel and the trial court,13 where defense counsel says, "Your Honor, I made it14 very clear that alibi is being offered as mitigation.15 It goes to the circumstances of the crime. It's16 mitigating evidence that someone is not there." And,17 later, circumstances of the offense is part of the18 fourth question, which, in Oregon, is the mitigation19 question. If the --20 JUSTICE BREYER: Is the 2:16 a.m. alarm clock21 in the original trial, or not?22 MS. WILLIAMS: The mother's testimony about23 the time from --24 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.25 MS. WILLIAMS: -- 2:10 a.m. to 4:20 is in the601111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425guilt phase of the trial.          And again from the colloquy, "If you're notthere, that is certainly mitigating."          And let me just mention, in terms of thetiming of the alibi evidence, the grandfather's alibicovered from 9 o'clock at night until 2 o'clock in themorning; the mother's, from 2:10 in the morning til4:20.  The crimes occurred in the early morning hours. And so, there isn't any way to parse this out and saythat the alibi testimony might have been relevant, insome small piece, on deliberateness.          To the extent that the State puts onadditional evidence to establish deliberateness, ofcourse defendant can respond to that additionalevidence, but the State doesn't make the question ofwhether the defendant was there wide open again in thepenalty phase.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Ms.Williams.          The case is submitted.          [Whereupon, at 11:08 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.]1111 14th Street, NW Suite 40061 1-Washington, DC 20005
