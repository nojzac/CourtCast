CARPENTERON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. CARPENTER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:In multistate power systems, each retail rake -­ratemaking body has incentives to impose cost allocations that benefit its residents, and the only way to assure that the power pool recovers a hundred percent of its generating costs is for a neutral body to referee disputes among the States and to fix the allocations.This case arises in the energy system where five subsidiaries provide retail service in four different States, where FERC has found that Entergy's cost allocations generally can't affect its net revenues and where FERC has thus approved a tariff that gives Entergy authority to calculate the inter-company equalization payments that allocate costs with a FERC complaint as the sole remedy if the rates and allocations are believed to be unlawful.31111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Though we --QUESTION: What is -- what is the source of the rule that this is the sole remedy?MR. CARPENTER: It's the sole remedy under the tariff itself, Your Honor.QUESTION: The -- so the tariff itself providesthat.MR. CARPENTER: Yes. Under the tariff itself, the only right that is reserved to the -- this is section 4.12, joint appendix 11a. The only right that is reserved to the operating companies is to seek amend -- if there's a dispute over the rates, is to seek amendments in the tariff or changes in the rate from the regulatory body that has jurisdiction.There's no question here that the LPSC doesn'thave jurisdiction to order amendments to the service schedule or changes in the rates. Their claim is only that they can disallow the costs that were incurred.QUESTION: Is -- is the tariff provision meant to preclude any sort of a judicial remedy?MR. CARPENTER: Yes, it would preclude a judicial remedy. It operates as a -- as a -- as, obviously, a limitation on the operating companies' remedies and as a forum selection clause in the event of a dispute.41111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Well, there would be a judicial2 remedy if they disagreed with the -- with -- with FERC's3 determination. They could -- they could appeal that to4 the court.5 MR. CARPENTER: Oh, absolutely, Your Honor. I'm6 sorry. I--7 QUESTION: They just couldn't go straight to the8 court.9 MR. CARPENTER: Yes. No, I'm sorry, Your Honor.10 I -- I meant that they can't go -- they couldn't go11 straight to court, and it means that -- for the same12 reason that a State retail ratemaking body can't disallow13 the costs because under -- under this rate schedule, the14 rate calculated by the energy system is the filed rate and15 binds everybody unless and until a complaint is filed with16 FERC and FERC holds otherwise.17 And in fact, the Louisiana commission here18 brought a complaint for the period ending in August of19 1997, and FERC denied relief on the ground that although20 the tariff didn't authorize it, it was just and --21 nonetheless just and reasonable for Entergy to calculate22 equalization payments by including certain units that were23 in extended reserve status because FERC found that those24 units benefited Louisiana and the entire system.25 QUESTION: Can I ask? The -- the section of51111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the -- of the agreement that you -- you referred us to, 4.12. It says each company reserves the right to unilaterally seek amendments or changes from any regulatory body having or acquiring jurisdiction thereover. Why didn't they just say from FERC?MR. CARPENTER: Well, at the time this --QUESTION: I mean, if as you say it's only FERC, why didn't they just say from FERC?MR. CARPENTER: Well, it was -- it was fairly prescient because this -- this language I think dates from 1953, when there was the Federal Power Commission. So, it--QUESTION: Oh, I see. I see. Yes.MR. CARPENTER: But the -- the key thing here is that it's undisputed that the LPSC can't amend the service agreement.QUESTION: Got you. No. I was just wondering whether --MR. CARPENTER: Yes.QUESTION: -- that was so clear to the parties at the time, and you say it is and -- and what they --￼what theywere anticipating is a change in the Federal -- MR. CARPENTER: Yes.QUESTION: -- body that had jurisdiction.MR. CARPENTER: Right.61111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 QUESTION: Okay.2 MR. CARPENTER: But -- but in the aftermath of3 the FERC order that found that these charges were just and4 reasonable, despite a finding of the tariff violation, the5 Louisiana commission entered an order that said that6 FERC's determination bound it only for the precise period7 that FERC had addressed, and then entered an order that8 prohibited the petitioner, Entergy Louisiana, ELI, from9 recovering the same wholesale costs in retail rates for10 the immediately succeeding period, beginning August 5th,11 1977.12 QUESTION: Could -- could you explain one thing13 to me? And that is, why was the period so defined? Is it14 simply that it was, with respect to that period, that15 actual figures were introduced before FERC?16 MR. CARPENTER: That became the period because17 that was the date of the FERC order.￼QUESTION: The date of the --MR. CARPENTER: Yes.QUESTION: And so, in effect, that it at that --18192021 done with 2224 QUESTION: But -- but was there --25 MR. CARPENTER: -- of Louisiana Public Service71111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005MR. CARPENTER: Yes. That was the 23 the -- the theory ---- FERC was -- that was1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Commission.QUESTION: Was there any question in the termsof the order that the order was intended to operate prospectively until FERC changed it?MR. CARPENTER: Oh, no. No question at all.QUESTION: So the difference is unlike a filed rate, which is a number, here is not a precise number.MR. CARPENTER: That's right. Here the filed rate is a formula that is --QUESTION: And it -- and it's going to change constantly.MR. CARPENTER: That's right. It can change -- it can change I believe monthly, or the -- the rate calculated under the formula can change monthly. And -- and FERC approves formula rates, you know, in circumstances where it believes that it will better promote the overall goals of -- of the act, and it imposes terms and conditions that will assure that the overall goals of the act are promoted.And here a critical term and condition was that the determinations of the amount of the payments is centralized at FERC and the only remedy, if there's a disagreement, is to go to FERC and file a complaint. As I point out, that's clear from the terms of the tariff, and that's what FERC said in each of the orders in which it81111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 authorized the formula rates.2 QUESTION: But it -- from the point of view of3 the public service commission, they have to approve the4 local rates periodically, and how does the timing of the5 thing work? If the public service commission has to go to6 FERC and then there's a proceeding, and by that time the7 year is over.8 MR. CARPENTER: Yes. But the -- if FERC were to9 agree with the public service commission that we violated10 the tariff, that the result was unjust and unreasonable11 and a refund was appropriate, all the interests would be12 protected because the -- they would order a refund at the13 wholesale level with interest that the Louisiana Public14 Service Commission could flow through to retail rate15 papers -- 1617 would the18 standing to come to FERC? I mean, to come back to the19 agreement, it says each company -- the companies who are20 parties to the agreement -- reserves the right to21 unilaterally seek amendments or changes.22 MR. CARPENTER: Yes. Well, they have standing23 under the act itself. Section 305 I believe it is.24 QUESTION: So this provision doesn't govern what25 they can seek then.91111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005rate payers.￼QUESTION: Well, wait, wait. How would -- how Louisiana Public Service Commission have1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. CARPENTER: No. But -- but they -- but -- but what it does mean is that they cannot premise a -- a prudence disallowance on the ground that -- that ELI could have refused to pay the costs or -- or required that the equalization payments be calculated on a different basis.QUESTION: Well, sure, they can. They could say the company was at fault for not going to FERC.MR. CARPENTER: Yes. But -- but -- sure, they could say that. It was imprudent not to go to FERC. But they can't speculate about what FERC would do in the event a complaint was filed. That's clear from the Arkansas Louisiana Gas case of this Court. So while it's theoretically possible they could say that it was imprudent not to go to FERC, no remedy could be predicated on that finding of imprudence because they can't speculate about what FERC would do if a complaint were filed.QUESTION: But can they go to FERC as an intervenor? I --MR. CARPENTER: Yes.QUESTION: -- I take it that was their status. MR. CARPENTER: Absolutely, absolutely. QUESTION: So they could go in and say, look,they should have complained -- MR. CARPENTER: Yes.QUESTION: -- and therefore you should do what101111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 you would have done if they had complained.2 MR. CARPENTER: Absolutely. They can do that.3 And the point I was trying to make to Justice Ginsburg is4 it -- when that procedure is followed, all legitimate5 interests are protected because if FERC agrees and orders6 a refund, it will be -- it can then be flowed through by7 the Louisiana Commission to the retail ratepayers.8 Conversely, under their procedure in which they9 can disallow costs pending a FERC determination on the10 precise -- on the precise issue, you have exactly the --11 the interference with commerce that the Federal Power Act12 was designed to prevent. You've got duplicative13 litigation of this issue. Here in -- could be in five14 different retail ratemaking bodies.15 And the effect can be a trapping of costs that16 we never get back because if FERC -- you know, they --17 they trap the costs pending the FERC order. FERC then18 says -- reviews it and says what we did was fine, just and19 reasonable. Then obviously FERC doesn't do anything at20 the wholesale level. In the meantime, our costs have been21 trapped at the retail level, and we can't get the money22 back under the general rule barring retroactive ratemaking23 unless an exception were somehow made to that rule.24 QUESTION: Well, what is the function and25 province of the State commission's prudence review?111111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 What -- what can they do that's proper? And I assume they2 can do a number of things that increase costs and3 therefore change rates, or am I wrong about that?4 MR. CARPENTER: Well, what they -- what they can5 do is they can regulate the -- the prudence of -- of6 decisions that the -- the utility had to make. So in7 circumstances where a FERC tariff provides a choice to8 the -- to the retail utility, which was the situation in9 the Pike County case, then -- then the -- the State10 commission can find that it was imprudent to exercise the11 choice in one fashion or another.12 But the point here is there was no choice. The13 equalization payment bound the -- bound ELI unless and14 until it was found to be unlawful by -- by FERC. So this15 is a situation where under the filed rate doctrine and16 under this Court's decisions in MP&L and Nantahala, the --17 the State commission was required to treat the resulting18 expense as a retail -- as a just and reasonable expense19 and pass it through to retail ratepayers unless and until20 FERC ordered otherwise.21 There's obviously a range of other issues that22 aren't -- aren't governed by FERC rate schedules at all,23 as to which State utility commissions can examine the24 reasonableness of the decisions of the -- of the retail25 body. But they can't say that -- that following your121111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425duties under a FERC tariff is unjust and unreasonable. That's a question for FERC.QUESTION: In -- in the course of that regular examination that they -- that they do, can they find certain actions that require refunds to the -- to the consumers?MR. CARPENTER: Oh, absolutely, Your Honor. Absolutely, Your Honor. They can disallow -- they disallow charitable expenses. They disallow expenses all the time. There's a citation --QUESTION: But never if it's in violation of a tariff or a FERC policy?MR. CARPENTER: Right. They cannot, consistent with the Federal Power Act, say that it was imprudent to do -- to -- to do what the FERC tariff required the utility to do. That's the clear teaching of MP&L and Nantahala and -- and other decisions.QUESTION: Would the State commission have authority to argue that the formula was incorrectly applied?MR. CARPENTER: In the context of the retail ratemaking proceeding?QUESTION: Yes.MR. CARPENTER: No, Your Honor. That's an issue exclusively for FERC because, as I pointed out131111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 before, if the rate is believed to be too high, under2 the tariff, the -- the only remedy the operating company3 would have would be to go to FERC and -- and complain,4 and the operating company has -- has no -- no right to5 refuse to make a payment on the ground that there's an6 allegation that the equalization formula was improperly7 implied.8 But as I -- as I just said, the filed rate9 doctrine clearly, you know, prohibited the order here, and10 even if it didn't apply, this is an issue that -- the11 issue of the -- the reasonableness of rates and the12 practices affecting rates is an issue that the Federal13 Power Act clearly allocates to FERC. So even if the14 tariff here didn't, you know, clearly preclude ELI from15 doing what the LPSC found a prudent company would have16 done, the -- the filed -- the Federal Power Act preempted17 the -- the State from addressing the issue.18 And the facts of this case sort of illustrate19 why States shouldn't get involved in -- in this because20 the decision that was made here sort of exemplifies the21 parochialism that the Commerce Clause and the Federal22 Power Act was designed to prevent. It was acknowledged by23 the Louisiana Public Service Commission that the -- the24 units in question, the out-of-state units in question,25 benefited Louisiana and the entire system, increased the141111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 efficiency of the entire system. But it said that was2 irrelevant. In fact, it said that was evidence of3 imprudence because the effect was to increase the costs4 that ELI incurred and thus to increase retail rates, and5 that's a -- the kind of parochialism that the6 Commerce Clause prevents and the Federal Power Act was7 designed to draw a bright line that would eliminate any8 need to even adjudicate questions whether the conduct9 violates the Federal --10 QUESTION: Well, what's left of public service11 commissions then, if -- if you're right, so far as12 policing imprudent acquisitions and that sort of thing13 for a multi -- multistate company?14 MR. CARPENTER: Well, they -- they can't15 regulate issues involving, you know, the exchanges16 of power within power pools, but there are a range17 of other issues that, as I said in response to￼18 Justice Kennedy's question, that the States can --19 can decide.20 QUESTION: Such as.21 MR. CARPENTER: Well, the -- you know,22 whether -- whether expenses not dictated by a FERC23 rate schedule are just and reasonable. There's a whole24 range of other expenses that --25 QUESTION: The cost of -- the cost of power is151111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005-- FERC1 justoneofthe--oneofthe--2 MR. CARPENTER: Yes, just one of the expenses3 that a retail utility would incur. And -- and so there's4 a range of issues that they can decide. What they can't5 do, though, is -- is decide that it was imprudent to incur6 a cost that a FERC rate schedule required the utility to7 incur, and that's the issue here.8 QUESTION: Am I -- am I correct in assuming,9 as I have throughout the -- reading the briefs here,10 that the -- the costs that a given operating company11 incurs within its power pool is essentially the same12 issue as the wholesale rate that a -- that a totally13 independent company might pay when it -- when it bought14 wholesale off the -- the grid? Is -- is that a -- it15 seems to me in -- in each case, the operating company16 is buying power at wholesale, whether it does it within17 its group or whether it does it on an open market, and18 that's what in each case FERC is regulating. Is -- is19 that fair?20 MR. CARPENTER: Well -- well, FERC regulates the21 transactions within power pools --22 QUESTION: And when one of those transactions23 is the -- is the -- in effect, the acquisition of power by24 a local operating company, that transaction is25 economically, I guess, the equivalent of buying wholesale161111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425by an independent company that is not part of a power pool.MR. CARPENTER: Yes, but FERC's jurisdiction depends on the fact that -- jurisdiction depends on the existence of wholesale sales which -- which exist in the context of a power pool because each retail utility is simultaneously, you know, providing power to the pool at the set rate. So it's --QUESTION: Oh, no, I understand that. And -- and -- but FERC also has general authority over wholesale interstate sales.MR. CARPENTER: Absolutely, Your Honor. Absolutely, Your Honor.QUESTION: So that -- so that in relation to what a -- the reason I'm getting at it is, in relation to what a State utilities commission can do, the State utilities commission, I take it, is in the same position vis-a-vis ELI that it would be if ELI were a totally independent company buying wholesale off the grid. Is that correct?MR. CARPENTER: That's right. If it were -- if it were subject to the identical rate schedule.If there are no further questions, I'd like to save the balance of my time for rebuttal.QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Carpenter.171111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Mr. Schlick, we'll hear from you. ORAL ARGUMENT OF AUSTIN C. SCHLICKON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERMR. SCHLICK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:Under Nantahala and Mississippi Power & Light, the regulation of wholesale rates for electric energy in interstate commerce is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Federal jurisdiction is necessary to ensure that multistate utilities, like Entergy and other utilities, are able to carry out their FERC-regulated transactions, to plan and carry out those transactions without the interference of potentially conflicting State regulation.The facts of this case highlight the need for exclusive Federal regulation. The dispute in this case involves the correct allocation of costs incurred for the common benefit of five utilities in four different States. The Louisiana commission believed that the costs allocated to Entergy Louisiana were too high, but the consequence of the Louisiana commission's rate decision would be to reallocate those costs to ratepayers in Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi or else to render them trapped and entirely unrecoverable.181111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Well, does that -- is that a death sentence, so to speak, if you find that the costs are trapped and unrecoverable? May not that ever happen to a utility legitimately?MR. SCHLICK: That's correct, Your Honor. Under this Court's decision in Nantahala, a charge that is federally approved or that is within FERC's exclusive jurisdiction to approve may not be trapped and disallowed by the -- by the State regulatory --QUESTION: You're -- you're not talking about costs -- trapped costs generally. You're just talking about this particular kind of trapped cost.MR. SCHLICK: That's right. I'm -- I'm talking about costs that contribute to the wholesale rate that -- that is within FERC's jurisdiction.QUESTION: So the -- the problem is that -- not that the costs would be trapped, but that FERC has said it's not trapped. That's -- that's the point. I mean, lots of utilities lose money because costs are trapped.MR. SCHLICK: That is -- I -- I think that --that --QUESTION: So the real point is here FERC has said they can do it. That's -- that's the only point that you're making, isn't it?MR. SCHLICK: There are two points. There --191111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 there is the general prohibition on trapping, but also in2 this case we have a FERC-approved rate schedule that3 determines how the allocation should be carried out.4 There's a question whether or not Entergy complied with5 that rate schedule, but the resolution of that question6 involves what the wholesale rate is or should be, and7 that's a question within FERC's jurisdiction.8 QUESTION: And that's a FERC question, period.9 MR. SCHLICK: That's right. Only FERC can10 decide that question.11 Unlike the cases on which respondent relies,12 this case does not involve a State contract action about a13 matter that is within the State's concurrent jurisdiction.14 In the first place, there is no contract dispute between15 the parties in this case, the Entergy operating companies16 and the holding company.￼Rather, this case arose in the same context as and Mississippi Power & Light, a retail rate And the dispute involves the correct division operating companies in multiple states of costs1718 Nantahala19 setting.20 among the21 of operating the system. Just like Mississippi Power &22 Light, that's a cost -- that's a -- a question that only23 the FERC can determine.24 It's worth mentioning that --25 QUESTION: Could -- could this be201111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 characterized as a question of a reasonable interpretation2 of the tariff, or you couldn't characterize the issue that3 way?4 MR. SCHLICK: There -- there is a -- an5 interpretation, an underlying question of interpretation,6 of the tariff, but beyond that, there's the question of7 whether the resulting charge was just and reasonable. And8 that's the important reasonableness question. That's the9 question that only FERC can decide.10 Here the Louisiana commission assumed both that11 there was a procedural violation of the system agreement12 in -- in the documentation of the operating committee's13 decision --14 QUESTION: But --15 MR. SCHLICK: -- and that the resulting charge16 was unjust and unreasonable.17 QUESTION: But what Louisiana is saying, they --18 they're conceding that FERC has the authority, the19 exclusive authority, to prescribe what the division would20 be. However, they're saying if, in fact, there's a21 violation of that division, the States ought to be able to22 adjudicate the violation. They're still giving FERC all23 of -- all of its power. They're saying FERC decides what24 the division will be, but the State agency can determine25 that the division has not been carried out the way FERC211111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 prescribed.2 What is there in the act that -- that says that3 FERC is the exclusive adjudicator of whether its4 directives have been complied with?5 MR. SCHLICK: In the context of what the6 wholesale charge is or should be, the provision of the act7 is section 824d and -- and 824e. The underlying principle8 was established by this Court's decision in Attleboro,9 which is that States are entirely disabled from regulating10 wholesale rates. That was implemented through the Federal11 Power Act in 1935. It was confirmed in this Court's12 decision --13 QUESTION: They're not regulating the14 wholesale rates is what -- is the argument that will15 be made by the State. They're -- they're leaving it to16 FERC to regulate it, but they're adjudicating whether￼17 the rates18 the rates1920 were regulating the wholesale charge. The necessary21 determination of the Louisiana commission's order was22 that the costs pass through under the Federal rate23 schedule to Entergy Louisiana. The specific costs24 allocated on the rate schedule were too high. It was25 imprudent in the Louisiana commission's judgment for221111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005prescribed by -- by FERC have, in fact, been charged.MR. SCHLICK: Justice Scalia, in fact, they1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Entergy Louisiana --QUESTION: I thought the Court said inMississippi Power & Light that once FERC sets a wholesale rate, a State may not conclude in setting retail rates that the FERC-approved wholesale rates are unreasonable.MR. SCHLICK: That -- That's correct. The -- QUESTION: So I guess that's the law, isn't it? MR. SCHLICK: -- the only additional step thatneed be taken in this -- in this case is to determine whether the fact that there is a dispute as to whether or not the FERC rate schedule was violated somehow puts the case within the State's jurisdiction. That was the question that only FERC can answer.QUESTION: But how is that different from the State determining that a retail rate is unreasonable? MR. SCHLICK: We believe it's precisely thesame.QUESTION: So then there is nothing extra.MR. SCHLICK: Our -- our answer to that question is there is no difference.QUESTION: So I have to see what the other side would say.MR. SCHLICK: That's correct, Justice Breyer.QUESTION: I -- I take it you agree withMr. Carpenter that the State can be heard on this issue as231111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425an intervenor who may raise the issue before FERC. Is that correct?MR. SCHLICK: Not just as an intervenor. Under section 825e of the act, the State could actually bring a complaint --QUESTION: I see.MR. SCHLICK: -- to FERC. It could bring the issue directly to FERC. And --QUESTION: In any case, it can get to FERC if it has a gripe.MR. SCHLICK: The order 415 proceeding in 1997 -- that was resolved in 1997 -- shows exactly how this should happen. The --QUESTION: No, but the answer to my question is yes, isn't it?MR. SCHLICK: Oh, yes, absolutely.QUESTION: That's all I'm -- that's all I'm -- QUESTION: Well, it seems to me it's quite adifferent question. Question one is whether the allocation was unreasonable, and the State here is saying we're -- we're not questioning the reasonableness of the allocation. That's up to FERC. But we don't think that we were charged that allocation that -- that was given to us. And that's -- that's not challenging FERC's decision of what the allocation should be. It's challenging the241111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 factual question of whether the allocation was carried out2 the way FERC prescribed.3 MR. SCHLICK: Justice Scalia, the order 4154 proceeding shows precisely the problem with that. In that5 case, FERC said that there was a violation of the system6 agreement, analogous to the one that's being claimed here.7 But it also said that the resulting charge was just and8 reasonable. In fact, ratepayers benefited overall from9 what was done by Entergy.10 QUESTION: Must be a section of the FERC rules11 or regs or tariffs which says the company may -- must --12 or must pass over to the company that has the higher13 number of generators a charge equal to the amount, da, da,14 da, that this particular thing we have before it gives the15 allocation for.16 MR. SCHLICK: Well, the -- the rate schedule17 has been approved --18 QUESTION: Yes.19 MR. SCHLICK: -- by FERC and --20 QUESTION: All right --21 MR. SCHLICK: -- there's a requirement --22 QUESTION: -- it says that in the rate schedule.23 MR. SCHLICK: -- and there's a requirement to24 the comply with rate schedule.25 QUESTION: So the rate schedule of FERC says251111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425charge a rate --MR. SCHLICK: That's right.QUESTION: -- based on this allocation.MR. SCHLICK: That's right.QUESTION: All right. All right. I'll ask theother side. I don't see any room for the question that was just raised.MR. SCHLICK: If the Court has no further questions.QUESTION: I -- I do. I mean, what -- what happens if the -- the State says, they haven't charged itaccordingto that allocation?QUESTION: Then Mississippi --QUESTION: Well, let counsel answer. (Laughter.)MR. SCHLICK: Justice Scalia, what -- what￼happens is then the question becomes was the resulting charge just and reasonable. In order 415, FERC determined the resulting charge after a violation of the rate schedule was just and reasonable. In fact, ratepayers in Louisiana benefited from what Entergy did, notwithstanding that it wasn't in compliance with the terms of the rate schedule at that time.QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Schlick. Mr. Fontham, we'll hear from you.261111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. FONTHAM ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSMR. FONTHAM: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:The issue in this case is the following. The FERC approved a contract amendment that established conditions, procedures before a utility could bill an affiliate for units in mothballs. The utility failed to follow the procedures, failed to consider the conditions, and failed to record the decision in its minutes, as it was required to do, and then said to the LPSC --QUESTION: We're -- we're within about 15 feet of you, Mr. Fontham. You don't have to speak up.(Laughter.)MR. FONTHAM: Thank you, Your Honor.And then said to the LPSC, you must take thecharges anyway.QUESTION: Yes, I think that's right under the law, isn't it?MR. FONTHAM: No, it's not, Your Honor. QUESTION: Because?MR. FONTHAM: Because the issue in this case isa drastic departure from what this Court held in MP&L or in Nantahala. In that --QUESTION: Because? Okay, that's exactly --271111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. FONTHAM: In those cases --QUESTION: Yes. To get the question very precise, that is the question. In MP&L, it said once FERC sets a rate, which means, I take it, that they have the terms that we've just described in the tariffs, a State may not conclude in setting retail rates that the FERC-approved rates are unreasonable.MR. FONTHAM: That's correct.QUESTION: All right. Now, what's the difference between that and what you just said?MR. FONTHAM: The -- the difference is that the FERC set the rate. The utility couldn't bill for the units because it hadn't gone through the procedure under the FERC rate. The utility billed anyway. It says if the rate said 5, the utility sends a bill for 10. 10 shows up in the retail rate case.The question is, can the State agency, looking at the FERC tariff and looking at what the utility billed, make the decision, instead of the utility making the decision, in the State proceeding that it's wrong.QUESTION: That's the question --QUESTION: Maybe -- maybe it can if FERC has not previously adjudicated that very question.MR. FONTHAM: And it hasn't.QUESTION: I mean, here what -- what they're281111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 contending is that FERC not only prescribed the formula,2 but that in order 415, it adjudicated that the formula had3 been properly applied or, if improperly applied, close4 enough for Government work is what they said. And once5 they decided that, their contention is, it's not up to the6 State to second-guess them.7 MR. FONTHAM: Well, Your Honor, I don't -- that8 may be what they're saying, but that's not what happened9 in the case. The -- in the case the FERC did refuse to10 order refunds. It held that the utility had invalidly11 exercised its, quote/unquote, discretion to violate a12 clear and ambiguous tariff for 10 years.13 Then it said, we're going to have a new tariff.14 We're going to curb the utilities' discretion. We're15 going to require the utility to have a procedure. We were16 saying it is too -- it was too vague, but no, no. The17 utilities said, our discretion will be curbed. The FERC18 said, their discretion will be curbed. The Court of19 Appeals for the D.C. Circuit said their discretion will be20 curbed.21 QUESTION: Didn't FERC -- didn't FERC also say22 that the rates that had resulted during the period prior23 to the amendment were just and reasonable rates?24 MR. FONTHAM: The FERC said that looking25 retroactively, in effect, retroactively --291111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Absolutely. They're looking2 retroactively.3 MR. FONTHAM: Yes, sir.4 QUESTION: And having done so, and having set5 the rate, how then is a State utilities commission, in6 effect, able to go behind that determination?7 MR. FONTHAM: Because the costs that were8 incurred and are at issue here -- actually, I lost that9 issue before the LPSC. The LPSC, as to all the charges up10 until August 1997, said since the FERC retroactively11 effectively changed the filed rate -- I don't know how12 they can do that, but they did -- they retroactively13 approved a new filed rate. You -- we can't touch that.14 Then the LPSC said, okay, now we've got a new15 contract amendment that operates prospectively. And what16 does it require? Take a look at what it requires. This17 was in -- litigated issue. And the LPSC says, well, they18 didn't follow the conditions again.19 QUESTION: But wait. Can you please go back and20 explain to me my question?￼2122232425 that whatMR. FONTHAM: Yes, Your Honor.QUESTION: To use your example --MR. FONTHAM: Yes, sir.QUESTION: -- we have, I mean, it sounds to me you're saying is a revolution in rate conditions301111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 or setting in the United States. I've always understood2 it to be, because of the sentence of MPL that I read to3 you, that if FERC says we have a piece of paper here that4 either directly or through a formula makes clear that $55 of your cost, your total cost for the consumer, is correct6 way to determine an interstate part of it, then when the7 local commission looks at the $10 rate to the consumer, it8 candowhatitwants,butithastotakethat$5asa9 given.10 MR. FONTHAM: We did that.11 QUESTION: Now, if the commission thinks that12 the $5 that the company put on its line as part of the13 interstate payment did not comply with every condition,14 did not satisfy the law because it was unjust and15 unreasonable, their remedy is to go to FERC and to say,16 FERC, they didn't comply with your conditions. They17 let -- got an unreasonable rate. That the commission's18 remedy -- the local commission -- is not to readjudicate19 that itself.20 And the -- the legal authority for what I've21 just said I've always thought was the sentence I read to22 you out of MP&L. Now, where am I wrong in that?23 MR. FONTHAM: You are wrong, Your Honor, in24 this. MP&L says that the State commission has to take25 the 5. If the tariff says 5, it has to take the 5.311111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: That's what I said.2 MR. FONTHAM: We're dealing with the3 extra 5 here. We're dealing with the overcharge, the4 overbilling, the violation of the contract.5 QUESTION: The extra 5. Now, I thought what we6 were dealing with here was a formula set out by what I7 used to call the FPC, which -- which formula said that8 the 5 is made up of many things. One of those things is9 a charge that the Louisiana company is to pay to a company10 in a different State to reflect the fact that that company11 in the different State has generators in reserve capacity12 that serve everybody, and among those generators are13 generators that were put in mothballs provided that they14 noted in the minutes of the joint company, et cetera that15 this is a mothballed generator available for reserve16 capacity if necessary.17 All right, and if I understand it correctly and18 I've said it correctly, then the cost at issue here is19 part of the 5, not part of the other 5.20 MR. FONTHAM: I'll give you that, Your Honor.21 The -- but the -- but the problem and the difference is22 that -- there was a little more in the tariff condition.23 It said you have to have a plan to return the unit to24 service.25321111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼QUESTION: Yes.1 MR. FONTHAM: Did they have that? No. It2 said --3 QUESTION: No, but now we're repeating because4 I -- I just said that if you think that the minutes were5 not filled, if you think one of the other conditions that6 was put forth in that particular tariff, which I guess7 is--whatis--page57orsomethingofthe--of--but8 if you think one of those was not fulfilled, then your9 remedy is to go to the FPC -- the FERC rather.10 MR. FONTHAM: And then -- and that poses the11 question beautifully because we're in a State ratemaking12 proceeding and now we know the question. Does the State13 get to interpret the tariff and decide what it means and14 what it says, or does the utility? Because the FERC is15 not here to tell us. So the question is, what goes into16 rates today? The utility's decision based on a violation17 of the tariff which was litigated through the Louisiana18 courts? They got to eat the cake, but now they're back19 because they didn't like the taste of the cake, to put20 it--21 QUESTION: Mr. Fontham, I'm a little confused on22 who is the they because my understanding was that the23 Louisiana company, ELI, had no say in this, that it was24 the Entergy, the -- the holding company -- the -- for all25 of these five companies, that gave the instructions. And331111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 it wasn't as though ELI could say, well, we think you2 allocated too much to us. You're making us pay too much.3 The -- each unit is bound by what Entergy says. So the4 they seems to me to be Entergy, but the Louisiana Public5 Service Commission has only ELI before it.6 MR. FONTHAM: That's true, Your Honor.7 QUESTION: So how can it say that ELI was at8 fault for something that ELI is locked into by virtue of9 being part of this multistate --10 MR. FONTHAM: What -- what the commission says11 is that ELI is at fault in the sense of any utility, going12 back to -- to Justice Souter's reference to two13 independent companies in a wholesale power transaction.14 Now, we all know you can go to court to enforce a15 wholesale tariff, and that's where most people go.16 In the case of a parent-subsidiary relationship,17 well, obviously the parent gets to tell the subsidiary18 what to do. That's true in everything. It's true of many19 cost allocations that we see. We see hundreds of millions20 of dollars of cost allocations coming into Louisiana based21 on Entergy's decisions under innumerable types of22 allocation schemes, including the Federal tariff.23 And ELI has an obligation, even though it's24 owned by a parent, to make sure the parent follows the25 terms of the tariff, just as the wholesale buyer of341111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 power --2 QUESTION: I'm beginning to understand your3 argument. Is this what it is? That you'd -- imagine we4 have a Federal FERC rule, and it says you can include in5 your -- in your charge to the wholesale company the charge6 of sending a salesman to the foreign State to tell him7 about your product. All right? And now we have -- now we8 have -- you go before the State commission and the company9 says, and it costs me $117 to send Mr. Smith to do that.10 And you want to say, I, of course, am forbidden11 from arguing to you, the State commission, that they12 violated the tariff. But I can tell you that this13 salesman, named Murphy, actually spent most of his time in14 a chicken restaurant, and therefore, what he did for that15 117 fell outside the tariff. It didn't violate the16 tariff. It fell outside the tariff.17 And similarly, you want to say here that the18 cost of the generator in mothballs did not violate the19 tariff to include it, but rather fell outside the tariff20 because they never had the minutes, et cetera. Is that21 what you're arguing?22 MR. FONTHAM: I'm arguing both, Your Honor,23 because --24 QUESTION: Well, what's both? If you say --25 MR. FONTHAM: Well --351111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: If you say you're arguing it violated2 the tariff, you have an additional problem which is that3 the Louisiana Public Service Commission itself said that4 the staff wants us to say this violated the FERC tariff,5 but we have no power to do that.6 MR. FONTHAM: No. That -- that was as to the7 refunds. That was as to the period going up to 1996.8 QUESTION: No. No.9 MR. FONTHAM: But -- but, Your Honor, let me --10 let me take this and put it in -- in context here. When a11 State commission decides issues of intrastate ratemaking,12 it decides all kinds of questions of Federal law. It has13 to decide14 to decide15 It has to16 SEC.what the Internal Revenue Code requires. It has what the consolidated tax return provides for. decide SEC allocations that are filed with the￼So along comes a situation that's completely18 within its expertise. What does a FERC tariff require?19 And it makes so many decisions involving millions and20 millions of dollars in which it -- it decides as -- as any21 other State court. You apply Federal law, you apply State22 law. It's the whole body of law that you're dealing with.23 QUESTION: Except that FERC specifically24 addressed this question.25 MR. FONTHAM: No, Your Honor. The FERC did not361111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005171 address this question. This is tariff 2. Tariff 1 the2 FERC did address and it said the utility violated the3 tariff.4 Now we're on tariff 2, and tariff 2 was5 designed, according to the FERC, to curb the utility's6 discretion. And -- and that tariff 2, designed to curb7 the utility's discretion, the utility then immediately8 proceeded to ignore. And even in their reply brief, they9 say, we did nothing more than we ever did before. That's10 on the first page of their reply brief.11 QUESTION: But isn't the way to look at the12 problem this way? FERC says you may charge a certain13 tariff. We're not coming up with the actual number now --14 MR. FONTHAM: No.15 QUESTION: -- because it depends on facts that16 will vary over time. You may -- we -- we are approving a17 tariff. You supply the number and you must supply the18 number according to certain conditions. And what the19 Louisiana commission is now saying is, the number that you20 supplied was a number that violates those conditions.21 MR. FONTHAM: Right. That's true.22 QUESTION: The fact remains that on the face of23 it, FERC has said, if you come up with the number, that's24 the tariff. So if you are going to challenge that number,25 aren't you, in effect, challenging a FERC determination?371111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 And to do that, don't you have to go back to FERC and say,2 they didn't follow your conditions, and therefore you,3 FERC, should tell them that that number is, in fact, wrong4 and they can't charge it?MR. FONTHAM: Your Honor --QUESTION: What's wrong with that analysis? MR. FONTHAM: -- I -- I don't think that's I do think that your predicate is correct.5 6 78 correct.9 They -- they -- the FERC gave them a tariff. That's the10 tariff. The utility's decision doesn't become the tariff.11 It's like any contract case. If I have a contract with12 you, and I can charge you 5, and I send you a bill for 10,13 that doesn't -- my 10 doesn't become the tariff.14 QUESTION: Right, except that in this case --15 and -- and maybe this is where I'm going wrong. Tell me16 if I am. In this case, I thought FERC did not say the17 number is 5.18 MR. FONTHAM: Yes. It said -- what it said19 was -- is, you go through this process, step 1, step 2,20 step 3 --21 QUESTION: Right.22 MR. FONTHAM: -- step 4. The utility did none23 of that.24 QUESTION: No, but -- but at the end -- but what25 FERC is saying is, if -- if you go through that process,381111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the number you get at the end of the process is what our tariff guarantees you to charge.MR. FONTHAM: Yes, that's true.QUESTION: And in this case, you're saying -- so that -- so that the -- FERC is not saying what the number is in advance. It's setting the process in advance.MR. FONTHAM: Right.QUESTION: And what you're saying is, sure, they came up with the number, ostensibly what FERC told them they could do, but they didn't go through the right process to get it, and therefore the number's no good. But in order to say the number is no good, you're still challenging something which, at least on its face, has been authorized by FERC. And therefore, why isn't the appropriate action for you to take, to go back to FERC and say, the number they're claiming under your authority is the wrong number, tell them it's the wrong number?MR. FONTHAM: Okay. I'll -- I'll answer the last question first. The reason the appropriate action for the LPSC to take is not to go to FERC is because the LPSC has the authority as part of its State ratemaking authority, as part of State law to make --QUESTION: Yes, but that's the question here. That's the question here.MR. FONTHAM: That's the question.391111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Do they have it or is it preempted?2 MR. FONTHAM: Well, it wasn't preempted --3 QUESTION: And one question as to whether it's4 preempted, I would think, would be can they go back to the5 Federal ratemaker and -- and, in fact, get the relief that6 they want. That's something we ought to consider.7 MR. FONTHAM: And, Your Honor, the -- our8 position is -- and I believe it's correct -- that there's9 nothing in the Federal Power Act that preempts the State10 from doing this, that the only FERC jurisdiction to decide11 enforcement issues didn't even -- they created it in 198012 approximately. They were told in 16 U.S.C. 825m that if13 they found a violation of a tariff, they had to go to14 United States District Court.15 And there's nothing in the Federal Power Act.16 In fact, the Senate had a provision in the Federal Power17 Act that the FERC can award remedies for violations of its18 orders. It was pulled out.￼QUESTION: In other words, they --QUESTION: Okay. You're talking about the today, and what you're saying today is, whenever a tariff that leaves the bottom line number to in later, a State utility commission in a19 2021 condition22 FERC sets23 be filled24 ratemaking proceeding may challenge that bottom line25 number in its own bailiwick.401111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 MR. FONTHAM: No, Your Honor. We're saying that2 if there's a tariff --3 QUESTION: I thought that's what you were doing.4 MR. FONTHAM: -- and it sets forth objective5 requirements, and it -- and the utility doesn't follow6 those objective requirements, then they're not entitled to7 bill for the units. That's all we're saying. We're8 not -- this is not --9 QUESTION: All that you're saying is that10 Justice Souter was wrong to limit it to places where the11 Federal tariff is open. It's just as applicable to12 instances where the Federal tariff is specific. And13 you're saying that Congress in the Federal Power Act set14 up an act where you have a single central Federal body to15 provide tariffs for, let's say, the billions and billions16 of kilowatt hours made every year, but that each State --17 50 or 51 different local service commissions are going to18 adjudicate whether or not those millions of words are, in￼19 fact, violated20 decisionmaking21 been violated.22 Now,23 act, and we don't mean to do that. But it would be an24 awfully surprising thing for them to want to do.25 MR. FONTHAM: They did say we don't want to do411111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005and what we will have is 51 separate bodies to determine when a FERC tariff hasI grant you Congress did not say in the1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that. It's in -- it's in the introduction.QUESTION: Well, if they said they don't want todo it, then why are you arguing to the contrary?MR. FONTHAM: I'm saying that they -- well,maybe I misunderstood what they don't want to do, Your Honor.QUESTION: I mean, don't want to do that is -- means that they don't want 51 bodies --MR. FONTHAM: Okay, they didn't --QUESTION: -- adjudicating the correctness of the application of rules for wholesale rates that are contained of thousands or millions of words filed before the Federal Power Commission.MR. FONTHAM: They -- they --QUESTION: I've always thought that the Federal Power Act did not want to have 51 adjudicative bodies, but rather wanted to have one centralized body that States were free to use.MR. FONTHAM: Not -- not at all.QUESTION: No, okay.MR. FONTHAM: What the Federal Power Act says isthere's one central body to make the rate, to establish the reasonable and just terms of the rate. All the courts in the United States can decide whether a tariff is violated, including the State courts, and that's the way421111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425it always has been. In fact, the FERC wouldn't hear the cases until 1979.If there was a case of a tariff violation pending in State court, you had the potential, this potential of possible loss of uniformity, which never really happened. As a matter of fact, this is a high-profile case. Where are the conflicting decisions? And the reason is we have an objective tariff. They violated the objective tariff. Nobody can really dispute that. It was litigated in the lower courts.QUESTION: Mr. Fontham -- Mr. Fontham, there are five States in this and there could be more in a regional organization.MR. FONTHAM: Yes, Your Honor.QUESTION: If each State's public service commission can do what the Louisiana commission has done, you could have chaos.MR. FONTHAM: No.QUESTION: One will say, my utility was underpaid. Another one will say, ours was overpaid. And each one could do exactly what the Louisiana commission has done. It -- it seems to me that that just cries out for having the one decisionmaker, FERC.MR. FONTHAM: Well, Your -- Your Honor, I -- I will respectfully disagree that this as big a problem431111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 as -- as you are suggesting. And I'll -- I'll tell you2 that literally billions of dollars of costs are split up3 by Entergy among its companies, only a very small sliver4 under the Federal Power Act. Now, they split up these5 costs from Energy Operations, which is a nuclear company;6 Energy Services, which is a service company, by allocating7 them into the jurisdictions. Anytime there would be a8 conflicting decision, you could have -- supposedly you9 could have chaos. What really happens is the utility10 tries to shove as much costs as it possibly can into the11 jurisdictions which are reviewing the rates frequently.12 QUESTION: But -- but your answer to Justice13 Ginsburg and your earlier answer to Justice Breyer, with14 reference to whether there is a preemptive effect in the,15 what we might call, the enforcement --16 MR. FONTHAM: Right.17 QUESTION: -- or interpretation phase of the --18 of the tariff, it seems to me is contrary to what we said19 in Mississippi Power. We -- we actually were quoting20 Nantahala. There we said the Mississippi Supreme Court21 erred in adopting the view that the preemptive effect of22 FERC jurisdiction turns on whether a particular matter was23 actually determined in FERC proceedings. We have long24 rejected this sort of case-by-case analysis of the impact25 of State regulation upon the national interest.441111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. FONTHAM: Yes, Your Honor, and -- and bear2 in mind what Justice Stevens was addressing there. The3 issue of prudence -- and the Court were addressing, but4 the issue of prudence is an issue is that comes up in5 making the rate. The FERC in the Federal Power Act is --6 is authorized to establish just and reasonable rates. If7 you're going to raise prudence, you raise it in the8 proceeding where the just and reasonable rate gets9 established. We admit they have that.10 Then you have the next question. If they start11 violating their contract, is that something that the12 States can't look at? And there's nothing in the Federal13 Power Act that suggests that States --14 QUESTION: Well, but it was violating the15 contract in -- in a context where FERC had -- had looked16 at that -- that specific violation, and it -- and it17 announced the remedy.18 MR. FONTHAM: No. The prior violation. This is19 the second tariff, Your Honor. This is a new tariff that20 sets conditions which were supposedly designed to curb21 their discretion.22 But going back to MP&L, this Court's decision23 affirmed the decision of the Mississippi Public Service24 Commission. It reversed the Mississippi Supreme Court.25 It affirmed the Mississippi Public Service Commission.451111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 In -- in that decision of the Mississippi Public Service2 Commission, 327 million will be incurred under the FERC3 tariff. They -- they had to actually estimate what would4 be incurred.5 Now, if you hand the utility the right to tell6 the State public service commission that, oh, it will be7 500 million, do they have to pass it through? If this8 Court is going to give the sword of preemption to9 utilities, and basically, there's a test, you know. We've10 got concurrent jurisdiction. The test for concurrent11 jurisdiction or exclusive jurisdiction is unmistakable12 intent of Congress. Congress had it in there, pulled it13 out of the -- in the Senate report. The FERC can -- can14 hear violations. It was in the Senate version of the bill15 in 1935. If you look on page 6 of our brief, you'll find16 that the Senate pulled it out. The FERC had no -- no --17 jurisdiction to hear tariff violation cases. It could go18 to court. That's 16 U.S.C., section 825m.19 In about 1980, the FERC said, well, you know20 what? We're going to infer the power to do that. And for21 the first time ever, because up until then, the FERC had22 been refusing to hear cases that were pending in State23 court, wouldn't even exercise primary jurisdiction. Now,24 obviously, if you have exclusive jurisdiction, there's no25 need for a primary jurisdiction doctrine.

They left it to the State courts, all the State courts.Now, if you leave it to the State courts, what is -- how can you possibly say a State ratemaking agency, which decides issues of Federal law, contracts, all the time, has to interpret allocations, has to decide if they're right -- how could the Federal Power Act have taken away their power when the Federal Power Act was passed --QUESTION: Well, I want to be sure I get a response to this, though, because you said before -- and this very interesting argument might be cut short if the paragraph that I read to you is applied to the 19 -- post-1965 costs, which I -- aren't they the costs that were at issue when -- when the staff was talking about disallowing costs?MR.

FONTHAM: That's correct.QUESTION: All right. Then they say, LPSC staff argues that the MS-1 overpayment should be disallowed because the decision violated the FERC tariff. As ELI argues, this commission is preempted from determining whether the terms of a FERC tariff have been met, for the issue of violation or compliance with a FERC tariff is peculiarly within FERC's purview. Any allegation of a violation of a FERC tariff should, therefore, be brought before FERC.All right. I read that and thought they seem not to have decided this on the basis that you've been arguing it.MR. FONTHAM: Your Honor, I believe they did decide it on the basis that I've been arguing, but I'll concede that that language is sitting in there. It's wrong. And --QUESTION: You mean it's wrong as a matter of law? It's wrong at describing what they thought?MR. FONTHAM: It's wrong. I think it relates to the refunds, but it's wrong as a matter of this Court's law, the fact that there was a primary jurisdiction doctrine, the fact that the States have always had the491111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 power to decide this, the fact that the FERC had to2 infer jurisdiction to decide tariff violations in the --3 in around4 exclusive5 violated.67 case that8 courts.

FONTHAM: Only by virtue of the fact that Entergy -- not under the contract, not because the contract says so. They don't have to take an illegal charge. But as a matter of practice, I admit that the big boss of Entergy can tell the operating companies what to do, and they're not going to lose their jobs over it. So they'll take the charge if it's an overcharge. You're darned right. But not becausethe contract says so, Your Honor. Not at all.QUESTION: Is this contract the contract that has been accepted by and approved by FERC and, in effect, incorporated into the tariff?MR.
