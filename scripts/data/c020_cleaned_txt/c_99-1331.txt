DRIPPS, III                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. DRIPPS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          Both the Jones Act and the Limited Liability Actcan and should be given effect in this single-claimantcase, yet respondent seeks to use the Limited LiabilityAct to destroy rights conferred by Congress on Lewis as aseaman.  The Jones Act incorporates the provisions of theFederal Employers Liability Act guaranteeing the employeea choice of a State or Federal forum.  In addition, itguarantees him the freedom from removal to Federal courtin the event he chooses a State court forum.          QUESTION:  That's true of both the Jones Act andFELA, is it?          MR. DRIPPS:  Yes, sir, and that statutory remedyis saved to Lewis by the saving to suitors clause, yet itcan only be preserved in this case by dissolving theinjunction against State court proceedings.  This Court's3                                                                                             1    decision in the 1931 Langnes case held that the 2    injunction, even without stipulations, should be dissolved 3    to allow the State court suit to proceed, and that the 4    admiralty court would resume jurisdiction only in the 5    event that the State court judgment exceeded the amount of 6    the limitation fund. 7              QUESTION:  Well, under what circumstances could 8    the district court exercise its discretion and not 9    dissolve the injunction and require litigation of10    liability in Federal court?11              MR. DRIPPS:  Justice O'Connor, it would be only12    in a multiple-claimant excess fund situation, and even13    then under the Jones Act there might be a question with14    regard to preserving multiple suitors claims under the15    Jones Act, but generally in a non-Jones Act multiple-16    claimant excess fund situation the vessel owner does have17    the right to maintain the exclusive jurisdiction of the18    admiralty court.19              QUESTION:  Well, what if you have excess funds,20    multiple, and the Jones Act?  Are you saying that the21    Jones Act would prevent a liability determination in all22    of those situations?23              MR. DRIPPS:  Not necessarily.  I'm saying that24    it's a question that potentially could be raised, but it25    hasn't been.  That's, of course, not this case.  This is a4                                                                                                                                 1    single-claimant case, and part of the court's discretion 2    at the district court level certainly was finding that it 3    could be a single-claimant case, which the district court 4    order did note in footnote 3. 5              QUESTION:  Do you think that the courts and rule 6    (f) preclude a single-claimant exception? 7              MR. DRIPPS:  Oh, absolutely not, Justice 8    O'Connor.  I think that was made clear in the Langnes 9    case, because in the Langnes case the district court in10    fact exonerated the vessel owner, and were that -- were11    rule (f) to preclude dissolution of the injunction,12    certainly the court would have simply relied on the13    exoneration finding.1415    invalid?1617    this clear, the Court need not reach that issue if it18    simply follows the Langnes analysis.  The Rules Enabling19    Act analysis only comes into play in this case if the20    respondent's position is adopted, in that they say that we21    have no right to go to State court.  At that point, I am22    forced to attack the rule which gives them the right to23    have a liability and damage determination made in the24    Federal court, which I do say is invalid as violation of25    the rulemaking powers of this Court.5                                                                                                                                QUESTION:  But you think that rule (f) isMR. DRIPPS:  I do.  However, and I want to make 1              QUESTION:  But it's possible to rule for you 2    here without holding that rule (f) is invalid just as a 3    matter of interpretation, isn't it? 4              MR. DRIPPS:  Mr. Chief Justice, I agree 5    completely that if the Court simply follows the Langnes 6    case and says that the Jones Act allows this case to be 7    brought in State court, and that that statutory remedy is 8    preserved by the saving to suitors clause, and that the 9    injunction should be dissolved on that basis, the Court10    need not reach the issue of the invalidity of rule (f) in11 this case.12              QUESTION:  But it might not -- but it might not13    go that far if you had a mass disaster and there were many14    sailors injured and the vessel wasn't worth enough to15    cover all the claims.16              MR. DRIPPS:  Justice Ginsburg, I think that in17    that case the plain language of the limitation statute in18    anything other than fire requires the vessel owner to19    admit liability and cannot use the limitation statute as a20    method to shift the forum and then contest liability.  The21    shipowner has a choice of one or the other in that22    circumstance.23 24 25          QUESTION:  How does it work in practice?  Youhave a single claimant, and there's adequate, adequatefunds to cover the claim and it goes to the State court.6                                                                                             1    Then 6 weeks later somebody else has a slip and fall, and 2    then there's another suit.  Does that make everything 3    start all over again?  How does this work in -- it seems 4    to me that there's great merit to your position, but that 5    on the other hand there's going to be problems down the 6    line when you have subsequent claims, or is that maybe not7 a problem? 8              MR. DRIPPS:  Justice Kennedy, I don't believe 9    that's a problem, because normally when you have a case10    like this you have separate or serial funds.  Each time11    the vessel owner wishes to file a limitation case there's12    a separate valuation made, and it's a separate proceeding.13              Now, the seaman's claims will become liens in14    priority of the time they arise, but that's a separate15    issue, and I --16              QUESTION:  Okay, so the priority is what solves17    the problem, then.18              MR. DRIPPS:  Exactly.  There's a priority based19    on chronology.20              QUESTION:  And also --21              QUESTION:  A chronology of when the claim was22    filed, or when the injury occurred?23              MR. DRIPPS:  I believe that it is of the time of24    the judgment, except for wages, when it's a -- wages are a25    lien that accrue as of the time --7                                                                                                                                 1              QUESTION:  Well, then I think there might be a 2    problem with successive claims.  We need not get into it. 3    It's in the background, it seems to me, of the rule we 4    must make, because if we ship it all off to the State 5    court, and then there are going to be subsequent claims, 6    you might have to start the -- stop the State proceeding7 midway. 8              MR. DRIPPS:  Well, Justice Kennedy, I believe 9    that would only be a problem if the vessel owner tenders10    the vessel to a trustee rather than posting security for11    value, which is what was done in this case.12              If, in fact, the vessel is turned over to a13    trustee, though, the likelihood is that it's not going to14    be employed by the owner, and so that owner won't be15    allowed to have a subsequent claim, and if they post16    security for value, I think that solves the problem,17    because there is a fund posted, and we won't be in a18    situation where we have competing claims for the same19    fund.  In other words, they will be different funds.20              QUESTION:  Do I understand the limitation21    correctly?  I mean, the typical use would be if you have a22    collision and lots of people are hurt, but this is a23    single -- this is a tripping on wire, so we know it24    isn't -- it isn't disputed in this case, is it, that we're25    dealing with a single-sailor accident?  There was -- he8                                                                                                                                 1    tripped over a wire on the deck. 2              MR. DRIPPS:  There is no dispute concerning 3    that, Justice Ginsburg.  In the motion to dissolve the 4    restraining order, which is in the joint appendix on page 5    70, and I believe it's at page 71, paragraph 6, Lewis made 6    the specific claim that this was a single-claimant 7    accident.  That claim has never been rebutted or 8    contradicted by the opposing side, by the vessel owner, so 9    this is clearly a single-claimant case.10              Now, what your question suggests then, is why11    was this case filed, and it was filed simply as a forum-12    shifting device.13              QUESTION:  But you sued later.  Oh, you think14    that they came in precipitously so that the forum would be15    where they wanted it, rather than where you chose to sue?16              MR. DRIPPS:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, I wouldn't17    use the term precipitously, but the complaint was filed on18    March 24 of 1998.  Normally, in the case of a mass19    disaster, for example, there would be immediately a motion20    for an injunction and a notice to potential claimants that21    goes out.  That was not done in this case until May 11, 622    weeks or so after the initial complaint, and it was not23    done until after the State court case had been filed.24              What they did was, they filed a limitation case25    in the Federal court and then sat on it, waited to see if9                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9Lewis was going to institute suit or not.  When he did,they obtained the injunction restraining prosecution ofthe suit, and --          QUESTION:  And their limitation proceeding wasfiled in which court?          MR. DRIPPS:  It was filed in the EasternDistrict of Missouri, United States District Court for theEastern District of Missouri, across the river fromMadison County, Illinois.          QUESTION:  And --          QUESTION:  There was -- seemed to be aconcession that if only you had asked for a jury trialyou'd be home free, because you can't get a jury trial inadmiralty and that's what the savings to suitors clause1011121314151617    saved.18              MR. DRIPPS:  And I think the Linton case from19    the Fifth Circuit in 1992 addresses that point          MR. DRIPPS:  Rather than filing it in theSouthern District of Illinois.20    specifically, Justice Ginsburg, and they say that the21    saving clause saves a nonjury Jones Act case because22    that's part of the seaman's remedy under the Jones Act.23    The Jones Act's election language says the seaman has the24    right to maintain an action at law or -- with or without a25    jury and, by incorporating the Federal Employees Liability10                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Act, he can do it in State or Federal court.          QUESTION:  The defendant cannot ask for a jurytrial in that situation?          MR. DRIPPS:  That's true, Chief Justice.  The --and I think the Linton case goes on at great length todiscuss that, and the significance of that I think isperhaps made more clear by the antiremoval provision in 28U.S.C. 1445(a).  The defendant cannot remove that case toFederal court where he would be able to trigger theSeventh Amendment and get a jury trial.          QUESTION:  Yes, but it's one thing to say, forCongress to say it can't be removed, but it seems to meit's quite another, a separate thing for Congress to saythat the plaintiff can have a nonjury trial and thedefendant cannot move for a jury.          MR. DRIPPS:  That is what the Linton case said,and that point wasn't specifically brought up in thebriefs, although I believe this Court has addressed thatissue.  I'd have to go outside the briefs to give you acase cite.          QUESTION:  Yes, well, it certainly isn'tdirectly involved here, is it?          MR. DRIPPS:  No, sir.  No, sir, but this Courthas addressed it.          QUESTION:  Well, we said in Singer, that Singer                            11                                                                                             1    case, in the criminal case that the Government can move 2    for a jury trial even though the defendant doesn't want3 one. 4              MR. DRIPPS:  And in this case Congress has 5    specifically said that the injured employee has the option 6    of determining whether or not it should be a jury or 7    nonjury trial.  That's what this Court said in the Panama 8    Railroad case v. Johnson, from 1920.  The Linton case 9    simply followed that, and said that the fact that the10    seaman chooses the nonjury remedy in State court does not11    transform the case into something that is now removable12    because it's outside the scope of the saving to suitors13 clause.14              And that ties in with this Court's decision in15    the Red Cross Lines case, where it concluded that16    statutory remedies are saved remedies, and in this case17    Mr. Lewis is a seaman invoking his rights under the Jones18    Act, which is a Federal statute.  Accordingly, that remedy19    is saved to him by the saving to suitors clause, and20    Congress' decision to confer the right to select the forum21    and the form of trial on the seaman is also saved by the22    saving to suitors clause.23              In contrast, the vessel-owner's rights in this24    case have been fully protected by Lewis' stipulations.25    We've guaranteed their right to seek the exclusive12                                                                                                                                 1    jurisdiction of the Federal admiralty court, and in that 2    case their Federal statutory rights are fully protected, 3    but by precluding us from being able to preclude in State 4    court, they are destroying the rights that Congress has 5    conferred upon us in the Jones Act and preserved from the 6    exclusive Federal jurisdiction through the savings clause. 7              QUESTION:  Well, what have you conceded with 8    respect to the limitation forum, because there'll be 9    nothing -- there'll be nothing -- the only -- this is the10    only lawsuit, this Jones -- this is the only claim, so11    they have a shell of an action, but there's nothing to12    fill the shell because this case will go on in the State13    court, there'll be a decision, there's more than enough14    money in the till to pay the judgment, so what have you15    conceded by letting them keep the limitation action?16              MR. DRIPPS:  Justice Ginsburg, what we've done17    is guaranteed that their limitation action will be18    successful.  They have limited their liability.  They've19    capped their liability.20              QUESTION:  That your -- that's your concession,21    that your claim is for less than the --22              MR. DRIPPS:  Absolutely, although -- and I don't23    think that's necessary, though, to a resolution of the24    case.  If we look back at the Langnes case, which was a25    Jones Act case, the Court's decision simply hinged on13                                                                                                                                 1    applying the saving to suitors clause so that both 2    statutory doctrines could be implemented, which is what 3    I'm asking this Court to do now, rather than to pick one 4    in an effort to destroy the other, and that is the goal, I 5    think, of this case. 6              QUESTION:  Well, your -- what's left of the -- 7    what's in the shell, I guess, is a kind of interrorum 8    jurisdiction to, in effect to guarantee the concessions, 9    and it may never have to be -- presumably it will never10    have to be exercised, but you're conceding that it could11 be.1213141516171819202122232425          MR. DRIPPS:  Justice Souter, that's right.The -- in the event that a State court judgment would beentered in excess of the limitation fund I think they havean absolute right to go back into the Federal court andsay, wait a minute, Lewis agreed that in order to get toState court his -- our liability would be capped, and atthat point the Federal judge would have the right to enteran order limiting their liability.  I don't think there'sany dispute about that.          QUESTION:  All right.  To keep it simple, on resjudicata they could simply enjoin collection beyond theconceded limitation. MR. DRIPPS:  Sure. QUESTION:  Yes.14                                       1              MR. DRIPPS:  But they don't have the right to go 2    beyond capping their liability, which is what they're 3    seeking to do.  They're seeking to shift the forum from 4    the State court, which has been guaranteed to us by 5    Congress, into the Federal court so that the liability and 6    damage determination can be made there, and that's what we 7    say is improper. 8              QUESTION:  Do I correctly understand the picture 9    on this exoneration that would go on if you -- say you did10    have a collision, would go on in the admiralty forum, that11    the function is served by the defense that the shipowner12    can put into the Jones Act claim that is, there was no13    negligence here, and that is effectively what the14    exoneration plea would do?15              MR. DRIPPS:  In some ways, Justice Ginsburg.16    Now, if I understand the question correctly, I don't17    believe that the exoneration rule is an incorporation of18    Congress' allowing them a defense under the Jones Act.  I19    think that defense has to be taken in the context of the20    statute, and they can choose to defend and require us to21    put on our proof of negligence, but only in the context of22    the forum grant that is given to the employee by Congress.23              QUESTION:  From the shipowner's point of view,24    it's one thing to say the shipowner itself had no25    involvement in the negligence, it was the other deck15                                                                                                                                1    hands.  It's a respondeat superior situation.  That's one2    thing.3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          Another thing is, there was no negligence byanybody at all, and I thought that that was the equivalentof the exoneration plea, that nobody was negligent at all,as distinguished from, maybe we have respondeat superiorliability, but we should be allowed to limit that.          MR. DRIPPS:  That's true, that is the essence ofthe exoneration claim, and that's what they want theFederal court to decide.  The two responses to that are,first of all, the Langnes case from this Court essentiallyheld that the exoneration claim was not sufficient topreclude dissolution of the injunction because, as I notedearlier, in Langnes the district court had, in fact,exonerated the vessel owner.  This Court nonethelessrequired the injunction to be dissolved and the case to goback to State court.          QUESTION:  Well, that I don't follow, because ifthere was a determination of exoneration, that is, noliability at all, not limited but no liability at all, whywouldn't that have been preclusive in State court?          MR. DRIPPS:  If it had not been reversed by thisCourt it would have been preclusive.          QUESTION:  Ah.          MR. DRIPPS:  But this Court said that16                                                                                             1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8    1880. 9              QUESTION:  But if the Federal court had made the10    determination first, and that -- and hadn't been reversed,11    then that would be preclusive.12              MR. DRIPPS:  Yes, it would, but the Court13    reversed it because the determination should have been14    made by the State court in the first instance rather than15    the Federal court, and that's the essence of the Langnes16    holding, that we're implementing the Jones Act's grant to17    the seamen, preserved through the saving to suitors18    clause, of the right to proceed in State court, rather19    than be forced into Federal court by the shipowner, and20    that holding was made without the presence of any21    stipulations regarding res judicata, and this Court said22    that the case will go back to State court for that23    determination.24 25 The other -- QUESTION:  Well, that sounds like, entirely in17                                      determination has to be made in State court and not inFederal court.QUESTION:  What determination?          MR. DRIPPS:  The determination of liability anddamage, and once it's made in State court, it ispreclusive of the exoneration claim in Federal court underthe rule of the Benefactor, which this Court decided in 1    sync with my suggestion that the defense of no negligence 2    at all, which can be put into the Jones Act proceeding, is 3    the equivalent of getting, in the Federal court, 4    exoneration. 5              MR. DRIPPS:  That's absolutely true, Justice 6    Ginsburg.  They have the right in State court to defend, 7    require the plaintiff to prove negligence, causation, and 8    damage.  They will be getting in the State court the 9    benefit of that defense that they seek to assert in10    Federal court.11              They are not being deprived of any rights by12    proceeding in State court, and their Federal right of13    limitation will be guaranteed to them by the stipulations14    that we filed waiving res judicata with regard to the15    issue of limited liability and stipulating to the16    exclusive jurisdiction of the district court to decide the17    limitation issues.  Those protect their Federal rights,18    and their right to defend and require proof of negligence19    and the other elements of the plaintiff's case are all20    things they can assert in the State court.21              The other reason that the exoneration rule22    should not be permitted to control disposition of this23    case and we're required to be brought into Federal court24    is because at that point we do get into the rules enabling25    analysis and I simply wanted to mention the Henderson case18                                                                                                                                 1    that this Court decided in 1996, which set forth four 2    factors that the Court considers in determining whether or 3    not a provision is substantive or procedural.  Rule (f) 4    meets each and every one of those. 5              The Henderson Court indicated that the factors 6    are, who may sue, which is answered by rule (f)(1), which 7    says any vessel owner, on what claims, the amount of all 8    demands in conflict, tort or otherwise, rule (f)(2), for 9    what relief, exoneration, or limitation from liability10    under rule (f)(2), and within what limitations period, not11    later than 6 months after receipt of a written notice12 of --13              QUESTION:  When you say it meets every test. It14    meets every test for being procedural, is that what you're15 saying?16171819202122232425          MR. DRIPPS:  For being substantive.          QUESTION:  For being substantive?          MR. DRIPPS:  Yes, Your Honor, and that's why Isay that if the Court adopts the analysis that therespondent has offered, then we need to grapple with theRules Enabling Act analysis, and in that case theprovision of conferring a substantive right to sue by ruleviolates the Rules Enabling Act because it conflicts withthe congressional statutory scheme of the Jones Act byabridging or modifying Lewis' right to sue in State court19                                                                                             1    and enlarges the vessel owner's right to seek limited 2    liability in Federal court. 3              QUESTION:  I'm not following your argument to 4    this extent.  I thought all this came up originally not 5    because of statutes, but because of court-made doctrine in 6    admiralty, and then that doctrine gets reflected 7    eventually into rule (f).  It's not a like a rule in place 8    of a statute, where I would follow your argument very 9    well, but it is taking what was, indeed, substantive law,10    but substantive law originally made up by courts.11              MR. DRIPPS:  Well, normally, Justice Ginsburg, I12    would agree with you that that is what the rules do.  In13    this particular case, however, this Court's decision in14    the Benefactor specifically said that the fifty-sixth rule15    in admiralty, which was the predecessor of current rule16    (f), was designed to circumvent the prevailing English17    rule requiring the vessel owner to admit liability.18              So in fact the rule has done the opposite of19    what you suggest.  It has created a substantive right to20    sue for a determination of liability and damage, where in21    fact the common law, or the prevailing admiralty law,22    required the opposite, that the vessel owner admit23    liability, and that was the decision specifically of this24 Court. 25                                                                                                                                If there are no further questions, Mr. Chief                  201 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9Justice, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.          QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Dripps.          Mr. O'Brien, we'll hear from you.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES V. O'BRIEN                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MR. O'BRIEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          The issue that is presented on certiorari grantfrom this Court in this case is whether the district courtin this case abused its discretion in lifting theinjunction that was imposed upon the filing of thelimitation of liability case and allowing the claimant toproceed with a nonjury case in Illinois State court, wherehe was a single claimant in the limitation and where thefund was, at least after the initial filing, deemed10111213141516    adequate.17              The Eighth Circuit answered this question in the18    affirmative, and held that since the remedy sought by the19    claimant, a nonjury trial, was already available in the20    limitation of liability court, that there was no saved21    remedy.  In other words, there was no statutory right of22    the claimant implicated, and therefore the Federal23    district court in the limitation case was bound by its24    grant of jurisdiction under Article 3, section 2 --25              QUESTION:  Well, do you think the district                                  21                                                                                                                                 1    court's view would have been different had the right to 2    jury trial not been given up? 3              MR. O'BRIEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, our position in 4    the case, and I believe the position of the Eighth Circuit 5    was that if a jury trial had been requested, then a remedy 6    that was not available in the district court would have 7    been sought and therefore a saved remedy would have been 8    sought, and therefore the stay, assuming the single 9    claimant exception and the adequate fund exceptions were10    met, would have been allowed to proceed in Illinois State11 court.1213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  So this case hinges, in your view atany rate, on the fact that the plaintiff had waived theright to a jury trial.          MR. O'BRIEN:  To a large extent it does.  If Imay --          QUESTION:  You say that because you say, wellthen he doesn't need the State forum because he can get anonjury trial in admiralty, but wouldn't one say equally,once the Jones Act plaintiff stipulates that he's notgoing to seek more than X amount of damages, you don'tneed the limitation proceeding?          MR. O'BRIEN:  Our position takes a step back,and our position looks back at the original origin of thesingle claimant exception that was set forth by this Court22                                                                                             1    in Langnes v. Green, and what we say is that we know a 2    number of things about what this Court -- what the 3    district courts have to do under the Limitation of 4    Liability Act. 5               Unlike some of the cases cited by the 6    petitioner, where there is no limitation case, we know 7    that when there's a limitation case on file there is 8    exclusive Federal jurisdiction, and we know that the 9    district courts are therefore bound to -- exclusively to10    administer the rights of the limitation claimant and11    all -- the limitation petitioner, excuse me, and all those12    claimants who make claim.13              The only way for any given claimant to exit from14    the limitation case is if they can, for lack of a better15    word, trump the limitation petitioner's rights to an16    exclusive determination in the Federal court with some17    statutory right, and in this case that would be -- the18    source of that right would be 28 U.S.C. section 1333, the19    saving to suitors clause.20 Now --21              QUESTION:  I'd like to back up a little bit,22    because I don't think I followed you that far down the23    trail.  That is, as I understand it, the whole reason for24    being of a limitation action is so that the shipowner will25    be able to limit the extent of his economic loss to the23                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425value of the ship.          Now, once it is certain that that will in factbe the case, that there is no exposure beyond the value ofthe ship, what function does a limitation proceedingsave -- serve, other than to block what would ordinarilybe a garden-variety Jones Act case from proceeding inwhatever forum the sailor chooses to sue in?          MR. O'BRIEN:  Because the Limitation ofLiability Act has more than just to limit liability.  Italso has the purpose of allowing an exoneration to bepursued by the shipowner and, indeed, in Langnes v. Green,the seminal case that started this exception, the Courtwas very clear, this Court was very clear that thelimitation court had both the power to decide exonerationand limitation.Now --          QUESTION:  What provision of the limitation actgives you the right to have an exoneration proceeding?          MR. O'BRIEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, we believe thatthe entire act construed by this Court in the Norwich v.Wright case provides that right.  Specifically, section183, but also read in conjunction with section 185 and theentire statute.          QUESTION:  And where is that in the appendix?          MR. O'BRIEN:  Well, the --24                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  I see it's at pages 1 and 2 of thepetition for certiorari.          MR. O'BRIEN:  Yes, Your Honor.  Well, thestatute itself, of course, is in the United States Code,and under section 183 of title 46 the vessel owner isentitled to pursue the limitation of liability, and is --          QUESTION:  But pursuing the limitation ofliability is one thing.  Getting an exonerationdetermination is another.          MR. O'BRIEN:  Yes, sir.          Your Honor, going back to Norwich v. Wright,this Court on at least a dozen occasions since 1871 hasdecided that exoneration is a fundamental right under thestatute and is part and parcel of the limitation101112131415    proceeding.16              QUESTION:  Were any of those cases single-17    claimant cases where the fund was adequate to cover the18    injury, or were they all what one thinks of as limitation19    case, a rather larger disaster?20              MR. O'BRIEN:  The early cases, Justice Ginsburg,21    typically involved a petition to limit after a judgment22    had already been obtained in a district court.  Indeed,23    the Norwich case that is the case cited in both briefs,24    and the original seminal case in limitation liability,25    involved such a proceeding, and the Benefactor, the second                                  25                                                                                                                                 1    case after Norwich, also involved a shipowner that came in 2    after a finding of liability in the district court. 3              But when those early decisions came out 4    construing the Limitation of Liability Act, for the first 5    time -- it had been passed in 1851 -- they had to decide 6    what it meant, and there is an extended discussion in 7    Norwich v. Wright about it, and in that case this Court 8    stated that the American Limitation of Liability Act 9    represented a departure from English law, because the10    English chancery courts, which had earlier heard11    limitation cases in England, lacked the power to12    investigate claims in admiralty, and therefore under13    English admiralty law the shipowner was required to admit14    liability.1516171819202122232425    se.          In the American courts, and under the limitationact as construed by this Court in Norwich v. Wright, adetermination not only of limitation was undertaken, butalso exoneration, and from that time forward --          QUESTION:  But wasn't that only on theassumption that there was jurisdiction under -- just toseek limitation?  As part of the proceeding they couldseek exoneration, but was there any case where the onlyissue was exoneration versus liability? MR. O'BRIEN:  Not per se, Your Honor.  Not per26                                      1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  And the word exoneration is not inthe statute itself, is it?          MR. O'BRIEN:  It is not found in the statute,although it does state -- the statute does state that thevessel owner's liability shall not exceed the value of thevessel --          QUESTION:  Right, but that's quite differentfrom saying it shall not exist.          MR. O'BRIEN:  Well, it also does not deny thedistrict court -- the same statute that gives thejurisdiction to decide limitation of liability does notdeny to the district court the ability to decide10111213    exoneration.141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  But wouldn't all these cases fittogether if we simply held that in an appropriate casewhere the limitation of liability proceeding involvesmultiple claimants and an original intent to get morethan the gross value of the ship, that in such a case,the -- among the things the shipowner can do is seek acomplete defense of a nonliability?  Wouldn't all thecases fit together if we just held that's where theexoneration is appropriate?          MR. O'BRIEN:  Well, certainly that's one option.          QUESTION:  Yes.          MR. O'BRIEN:  And I -- we would certainly urge27                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that on the Court, and I believe it's part of thelimitation act that the shipowner should be entitled toseek exoneration in any case in which it seeks alimitation as well.          QUESTION:  The Norwich, for example, under theNorwich was decided long before the Jones act was passed.          MR. O'BRIEN:  Yes, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Do you think the Jones Act affectsthe holding in Norwich in any way?          MR. O'BRIEN:  We do not.  It's clear that therights that the seaman has under the Jones Act aresubordinate to -- in general to the rights of theshipowner to limit liability.  In other words --          QUESTION:  Now, why do you say that?          MR. O'BRIEN:  Because -- for the reason thatit's clear that if it had been a limitation proceedingwith multiple claimants in a case where the claimsasserted exceeded the value of the vessel --          QUESTION:  Yes, but Langnes says the singleclaimant is different, does it not?          MR. O'BRIEN:  Well, what -- Langnes really restsupon three distinct factors.  Langnes says, first you haveto have a limitation of liability case.  Langnes sayssecond, you have to have a single claimant, and third youhave to have a request for a jury trial.  Those, in our28                                                                                             1    view, are the three pillars upon which that case was 2    decided, and -- 3              QUESTION:  Do you think the request for a jury 4    trial was essential to the holding in Langnes? 5              MR. O'BRIEN:  Your Honor, I do, and the reason 6    is because it's the request for a jury trial that 7    implicates a saved remedy.  The request for a jury trial 8    is what implicates a right under the saving to suitors 9    clause, which in that situation exceeds the interest of10    the vessel owner in staying in Federal court.11              QUESTION:  As I read it, you're trying -- you12    seem to be trying to make the tail wag the dog.  These13    early cases say, well, you know, if you're in Federal14    court, shipowner, trying to limit your liability, because15    we've had a collision and there are 42,000 plaintiffs and16    you've got to deal with this and just limit it to the17    vessel, well, as long as you're there, we'll try out18    whether you're liable at all.  We'll try out exoneration.19              The only reason we're doing that -- they didn't20    do it in England, but the Court says -- we say, from time21    immemorial it was done in every other country, right?22 So --23              MR. O'BRIEN:  Yes.24              QUESTION:  So we'll do it.  But if you're not25    here, what's the point of doing it, and you're not here if29                                                                                                                                 1    there's a single plaintiff or if there's an adequate fund. 2    I mean, the reasoning of it would seem to me to be, if 3    you're not here, and you can't get here because there's an 4    adequate fund, for example, there's no reason for us to 5    snatch the issue of liability away from the State court. 6              MR. O'BRIEN:  Justice Breyer, I think it's key 7    to look at Langnes v. Green and see in that case that this 8    Court stated emphatically that the procedure under the 9    Limitation of Liability Act was to first look at10    exoneration and then, if liability was found, to look at11    limitation issues.12              QUESTION:  Of course that's true, provided that13    you are properly in the Federal court limiting your14    liability.  My point is, suppose you're not, as is true15    here, for the reason that you already have an adequate16    fund.  You have no basis to get into the Federal court if17    there's an adequate fund.  Your only basis could be that18    we want to exonerate, but exoneration is there in case19    you're in anyway.20              MR. O'BRIEN:  Well, let me state that21    initially -- the initial claim filed in this case did22    exceed the limitation fund, and so that at the time the23    vessel owner instituted the proceeding, that was certainly24    in play and, indeed, when the initial claim was filed --25              QUESTION:  How did you know that, because the30                                                                                                                                 1    Federal suit was filed second.  You had your limitation -- 2    if I remember the chronology right, you sought limitation, 3    and then a week later the Jones Act case was started. 4              MR. O'BRIEN:  The short answer is that we know 5    in this jurisdiction, where the State court suit could 6    have been brought, that tripping over a wire could lead to 7    a judgment in excess of the value of the vessel, and so 8    therefore the -- 9              QUESTION:  But this plaintiff --10              MR. O'BRIEN:  -- vessel owner had a good faith11    reason for pursuing limitation.12              QUESTION:  This plaintiff hadn't made any such13    claim then.  You're basing it on other claims that were14    made against this shipowner?15              MR. O'BRIEN:  No.  I believe the vessel owner,16    based on its experience, and based on its knowledge of the17    situation, felt that an accident had occurred during this18    voyage which might make its vindication under the19    Limitation of Liability Act a realistic legal possibility,20    and so a petition was filed.21              There's no rule that prevents a vessel owner22    from coming in before the claims are filed, just as23    there's no rule that prevents a vessel owner from coming24    in while claims are being filed or after they're filed, so25    the timing of the filing of the limitation of liability31                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9proceeding is really --          QUESTION:  I brought it up in answer to yourassertion, we knew that he originally had a claim inexcess of the value of the vessel.  You didn't know thatspecifically with respect to this plaintiff.          MR. O'BRIEN:  Well, knowing, I think, and havinga good faith belief that the proceeding might be in thevessel owner's interest are too different things.  I don'tthink there was any way to predict the future at the timethe petition was filed, but certainly --          QUESTION:  But you didn't have to make anyprediction a week later.          MR. O'BRIEN:  That's true, because we shortlythereafter had a claim in excess of the value of the101112131415    vessel.16171819202122232425          QUESTION:  And the prayer for relief was for inexcess of $450,000?          MR. O'BRIEN:  Yes.  By stipulation, I think inthe joint appendix at 69 the record reflects that theinitial claim was in excess of the value of the vessel,and by stipulation --          QUESTION:  The question really is whether thatdid not satisfy the purposes of the limitation ofliability proceeding.          MR. O'BRIEN:  Well, Justice Stevens, our                            32                                                                                             1    position is that once the jurisdiction of the limitation 2    code is validly invoked, which it was in this case, that 3    jurisdiction attaches, and under the Constitution and laws 4    the district court is obligated to decide all those 5    issues, and the only way to escape -- for the claimant in 6    this case to escape that jurisdiction is to point to a 7    definite statutory right that allows him to defeat Federal 8    jurisdiction. 9              Now, in this case it would be --10              QUESTION:  But the statutory right that he's11    talking about, there's two ways to define it.  One is the12    savings to suitors clause itself is a statutory right.13    He's entitled to invoke that, and it doesn't really say,14    only if he's seeking a jury trial.15              MR. O'BRIEN:  That's true, and -- but we know a16    number of things about the saving to suitors clause.  We17    know that the rights under it are not absolute, and we18    know that because, number 1, a Jones Act claimant can have19    his case -- excuse me.  A limitation claimant, not a Jones20    Act claimant, can have his case removed to Federal court.21    We know that the saving to suitors clause doesn't protect22    the right of a bank, say, to sue a lender or a debtor on a23    first preferred ship mortgage.  We know those kinds of24    cases are committed to the Federal court and can't be25    brought in a State court.33                                                                                                                                1              QUESTION:  Well, what about the practical2    advantage of a plaintiff who thinks he's going to get a3    better verdict in Madison County, Illinois, than he will4    in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of5    Missouri?678910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  I thought so.          MR. O'BRIEN:  The vessel owner is entitled topursue limitation where it believes the purposes of theact will be furthered, in other words, where it sees thatit has an opportunity to invoke exclusive Federaljurisdiction to adjudicate the rights from some accidentoccurring -- occurring during some voyage.          And if I may address a point from --          QUESTION:  Do I understand you, then, that thevessel owner in every case where the sailor chooses to suein State court and not ask for a jury trial the vesselowner can always pick the forum instead by filing alimitation proceeding?          MR. O'BRIEN:  Unless he pursues a right, theclaimant pursues a right that is preserved under thesaving to suitors clause I would agree with that.34                                                                                                      MR. O'BRIEN:  Well, that is his right, to suewhere he thinks he can obtain the best verdict, unlessthere's some kind of illegal forum-shopping going on, butthat really is what this case is all about. 1              QUESTION:  Well, what -- you told me that the 2    only thing that's preserved is jury trial, not the Jones 3    Act claim, which is what I would have thought that -- I 4    would have thought, apart from entertaining your position 5    that it's not the Jones Act claim, and the choice of forum 6    that Congress has provided, but it's only the device of7 jury trial. 8              MR. O'BRIEN:  Well, it's really -- what it is 9    is -- let me refine my comment.  What I'm really saying is10    that if the remedy is already available in the Federal11    court, and what the Eighth Circuit decided was that if the12    remedy's already available in the Federal court in the13    limitation proceeding, there is no saved remedy to pursue14    elsewhere, and so the -- I think the issue for this Court15    is not so much jury versus nonjury in the abstract sense.16    The question is whether or not the specific remedy17    requested is available in the Federal court where18    exclusive jurisdiction is found.19              QUESTION:  Well, why isn't the remedy the20    courthouse that's closest to my home that's most21    convenient for me?   Why isn't that the remedy that is22    saved, the ability to choose, irremovably, the venue?23              MR. O'BRIEN:  Well, the answer to that is that24    the rights under the saving to suitors clause are not25    absolute, and they never have been by this -- held so by35                                                                                                                                 1    this Court or by any other Federal court.  They're always 2    going to be subject -- 3              QUESTION:  But your position was that that 4    wasn't saved at all, because you could get a nonjury trial 5    in the admiralty forum. 6              MR. O'BRIEN:  Well, I don't think the decision 7    whether or not the nonjury trial is saved or not is 8    necessary to this Court's decision, nor was it addressed 9    specifically -- in fact, it was reserved specifically by10    the Eighth Circuit.  You don't need to get that far, and11    the reason is because under the rubric adopted by the12    Eighth Circuit, if the remedy sought is available already13    in the limitation court, the claimant's not allowed to go14    back, and it was already available, i.e. a nonjury trial,15    so the court below never needed to address whether a16    nonjury trial was specifically a saved remedy or not, nor17    does this Court need to decide that for --18              QUESTION:  So practically what the position19    you're urging on us comes down to is that the Jones Act20    plaintiff can get his choice of forum as long as he21    insists on having a trial by jury.  If he doesn't insist22    on having a trial by jury, he doesn't preserve his right23    to choose the forum.24              MR. O'BRIEN:  That's correct.25              QUESTION:  That's your position?                                  36                                                                                                                                1              MR. O'BRIEN:  That's correct.2              QUESTION:  Why would that be?  I mean, let's3    suppose that a Jones Act plaintiff does -- could go -- he4    could get into Federal admiralty court.  He could get in,5    or he could do what he'd prefer to do, which is to file in6    the State.  Why shouldn't he be able to file in the State7    unless there's some Federal reason that prefers the8    Federal tribunal?9              MR. O'BRIEN:  Well, the Federal reason that10    prefers the Federal --11              QUESTION:  No, no, I mean, you're making both12    arguments.  One argument is that there is a Federal reason13    and the Federal reason is the exoneration, and that's14    countered with the argument that there is no Federal15    reason where there isn't an independent reason for being16    in the limitation action, all right, so I'm taking the17    other part.  Let's assume there is no Federal reason.  If18    there is no Federal reason -- he has the right come in the19    door, but there's no Federal preference.  Why shouldn't he20    be able to go to the State court?21              MR. O'BRIEN:  Well, Justice Breyer, I -- number22    1 -- my first response is, I don't believe that's our23 case. 242537                                                                                                                                QUESTION:  All right, yes.MR. O'BRIEN:  We do have a Federal reason for1 being here. 2              QUESTION:  Okay. 3              MR. O'BRIEN:  And the second response -- 4              QUESTION:  But if you didn't, if there were no 5    reason favoring the Federal court, then would you say, 6    give him his choice? 7              MR. O'BRIEN:  Well, I suppose that would be 8    true, except that Congress has spoken to the situation 9    when they've committed limitation of liability acts to the10    exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal courts.11              QUESTION:  Okay, but if you're prepared to go12    that far, then the case turns on whether there is a13    Federal reason, and the Federal reason you say is14    exoneration, so I understand that.15              And then I'm back to the question I had before,16    which I'm not sure I had a satisfactory answer to totally,17    that really what this exoneration is is the tail and it18    follows the dog into the Federal court, and the only19    reason it's ever there was, historically in England they20    did this, what the courts thought were absurd, to force21    the shipowner to give up his right to exoneration in order22    to get in Federal court, and our court years ago said23    that's silly, no other country does that and we're not24    going to do it.25              MR. O'BRIEN:  Well, I would prefer to think of38                                                                                                                                 1    exoneration not as the tail, perhaps the other set of legs 2    of the same dog.  I think that the right to exonerate is 3    half of what you have under the statute.  The right to 4    limit is the other half of what you have under the 5    statute, and one can't be divorced from the other.  You've6 got -- 7              QUESTION:  You have the statute, but it doesn't 8    appear in the statute, and what is your response to the 9    fact that if the only reference to it is in the Federal10    rules, that's ultra vires?11              MR. O'BRIEN:  Well, my response, Justice Scalia,12    is 130 years of decisions from this Court and others, at13    least a half-dozen cases from this Court holding that in a14    proceeding under the Limitation of Liability Act itself15    now the court determines exoneration as well as16    limitation.  It would be almost impossible for this Court17    to write exoneration out unless it were prepared to18    overrule all those cases.19              QUESTION:  Well now, are you saying that in the20    single-claimant, stipulated claim less than the value of21    the vessel, we would have to overrule cases in order to22    rule against you here?23              MR. O'BRIEN:  No.24              QUESTION:  Well, I thought that's what you just25 did say.39                                                                                                                                 1              MR. O'BRIEN:  No.  No.  What I'm saying is, what 2    Langnes v. Green tells us, and what Lake -- which is the 3    single claimant exception case, and what Lake Tankers v. 4    Henn tells us, which is the multiple-claimant case, or, 5    excuse me, the adequate fund case, what those cases tell 6    us is that when the claimant seeks a jury trial that it 7    has been deprived of him in the limitation court, that 8    under those circumstances there is enough of a -- there's 9    enough rights there for that claimant to trump the10    shipowner's right to be in Federal court, and they will11    then allow him to go back to State court assuming that on12    the one hand there's a single claimant, or on the other13    hand there's an adequate fund.14              But you can't look back at Lake Tankers v. Henn15    or at Langnes v. Green and write out of the Court's16    decisions the references to a jury trial being requested17    by the plaintiff.  That is what in my view was the, really18    the moving force in those decisions that allowed those19    plaintiffs to go back.20              QUESTION:  Well, of course, can't you just read21    that as the -- this is a particularly strong reason for22    vindicating the plaintiff's right to choose his own forum,23    that in one forum he gets a jury and in the other he24    doesn't?  That makes it a very appealing case, but I don't25    think you can necessarily deduce from that the conclusion40                                                                                                                                 1    that he wouldn't also have a right to pick the forum of 2    his own choice without that feature. 3              MR. O'BRIEN:  Justice Stevens, I don't think 4    we'd be here if the courts had routinely held that you got 5    a right to a forum.  They haven't.  What the courts have 6    held, this Court and the Federal courts, and what the 7    commentators have talked about for decades, is the right 8    to a remedy, and the right to a remedy does not 9    necessarily entitle him to go to a State court.  It10    entitles him to a remedy.11              QUESTION:  Well, he gets the same remedy whether12    it's a jury trial or a bench trial.  He's seeking damages.13    That's the remedy.14              MR. O'BRIEN:  Well, the remedy, as the Court15    stated in Shilendez v. Luckenbach, the remedy is the means16    employed to seek the redress and in our view, and I think17    the cases bear this out, a jury trial is a specific form18    of remedy, a nonjury trial is another form of remedy.19    It's the means employed, and I think that there's really20    no question under the case law that a jury trial is in a21    class separate from a nonjury trial as far as the saving22    to suitors clause goes.  They're different remedies.  Now,23    they both seek judgments, but in a different way.24              If I may briefly address the rule (f) argument,25    the position urged by petitioner that rule (f) should be41                                                                                                                                 1    declared invalid is in our view extreme and not warranted 2    by the case law.  This Court in the Henderson case did not 3    announce a general test for the determination of when a 4    Rules Enabling Act rule would be ultra vires.  It instead 5    decided that rule 4 trumped the Suits in Admiralty Act 6    provision requiring forthwith service of process on the 7    basis that the rule was purely procedural. 8              But if I may, under rule (f), three of the four 9    items that petitioner urges are contained in rule (f) and10    that mandate that it's a substantive rule are found in the11    limitations statute itself, namely, who may sue, when they12    may sue, and the object of the suit and so therefore, even13    under the test that petitioner cites, rule (f) clearly14    does not meet the standard of a substantive rule that15    would be struck down under the Rules Enabling Act.16    Indeed, the limitation act addresses those items.17              And I turn again back to the original decisions18    by this Court in the Benefactor, in the Norwich v. Wright19    case, in which this Court had occasion to construe the act20    and, if you follow the language closely of those decisions21    the Court was not construing rules that it promulgated.22    The Court was construing rules that it promulgated.  The23    Court was construing the act itself, and the original24    admiralty rules that were promulgated by this Court in the25    Norwich case, the original 50-some admiralty rules from42                                                                                                                                 1    1871, were rules, but they were in themselves 2    interpretations of the act as seen by this Court, and they 3    included the right to exoneration. 4              Now, if the limitation petitioner can come into 5    court, and if he can pursue a limit -- exoneration as well 6    as limitation, then by definition the Court has exclusive 7    jurisdiction over both of those subject matters and the 8    limitation claimant, in this case the Jones Act seaman, 9    can return to State court only if he demonstrates that the10    remedy he wants is not available in the Federal court.11              If there are no further questions --12              QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. O'Brien.13              MR. O'BRIEN:  Thank you, Your Honor.14              QUESTION:  Mr. Dripps, you have 6 minutes15    remaining.16171819202122232425          REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROY C. DRIPPS, III                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. DRIPPS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.          Mr. O'Brien indicated that three of the fouritems that are in rule (f) are in the statute.  What heneglected to mention is, as what Justice Scalia askedearlier, the one that's not in the statute is the onethat's critical to his analysis, which is the exonerationprovision, and that's not in the statute.          Mr. O'Brien relies heavily on the Benefactor,                            43                                                                                             1    and I would simply refer the Court to the quote from the 2    Benefactor.  It's at 103 U.S. 241.  It's at page 16 of the 3    reply brief, and the Court said that hence, this Court, in 4    preparing the rules of procedure for a limitation of 5    liability, deemed it proper to allow a party seeking such 6    limitation to contest any liability whatever. 7              That is not the statement of statutory 8    construction.  That is a statement of legislative intent. 9    We're adopting these rules so that the party can contest10    the liability.  Now, that is exactly what is forbidden by11    the Rules Enabling Act, yet that is what this Court said12    it was doing in 1880.13              Justice Stevens and Justice Breyer both asked14    about, in essence, whether there would be a right to a15    pure exoneration claim in Federal court, and I do want to16    point out that both the Fifth Circuit in the Fect v.17    Murkowski case and the Seventh Circuit in the Joyce v.18    Joyce case have said no, that unless there is a viable19    claim for limitation you cannot come in and ask for20    exoneration, and I think that is the rule that this Court21    should adopt.2223    noted --2425    right. The Langnes decision, as Justice Stevens QUESTION:  Well, I -- go ahead.  That's all44                                       1              MR. DRIPPS:  -- as Justice Stevens noted does 2    not require a jury trial, but it simply said that a jury 3    trial is one aspect that makes the State court forum 4    desirable, and that's part of the Jones Act remedy to 5    allow the injured employee that option of choosing either 6    State or Federal court, and whether or not to have a jury 7    trial in either forum. 8              To get to the respondent's not-otherwise- 9    available test, this Court is going to have to say that10    the saving clause does not protect statutory remedies,11    particularly the statutory remedy afforded by the Jones12    Act, which allows the employee to choose the forum that13    the case will be tried in.  That, however, is exactly what14    the saving clause was designed to do, and that is why this15    Court should reverse the Eighth Circuit's decision and16    reinstate the decision of the district court dissolving17    the injunction.18              CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Dripps.19              The case is submitted.20              (Whereupon, at 11:58 a.m., the case in the21    above-entitled matter was submitted.)22 2324 2545
