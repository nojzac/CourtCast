BROWNING, JR.               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MR. BROWNING:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          The issue in this case is whether Congressexpressly provided for a limitations period forretaliatory discharge action under the Federal FalseClaims Act.          The 6-year limitation period set out in section3731(b) of the act is tied to a violation of section 3729,that is, the submission of a fraudulent claim to theGovernment.  The triggering event to start the statute oflimitations running under section 3731(b) is a violationof section 3729.  Because a violation of section 3729 isnot an element of the cause of action for retaliatorydischarge, Congress did not intend to provide alimitations period in section 3731(b) for a retaliatorydischarge action.The Government in its amicus brief argues that 31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 Congress must have intended a uniform limitation period so2 that all three actions created by the False Claims Act3 could be brought in the same proceeding. The -- the4 Government's argument undermines the very purpose of the5 Federal False Claims Act and the retaliatory discharge6 provision.7 The retaliatory discharge provision, section8 3730(h) of the False Claims Act, not only protects people9 who blow the whistle, the initial whistleblower, but it10 expressly protects people who testify at trial. And we11 have seen time and again in many of these cases the12 Government will keep a case under seal for 5, 6, 7 years.13 We've seen repeatedly situations, because of the14 complexity of the underlying violation of the false claim,15 that it might take a decade from when the complaint is16 filed to when the case actually is put before a jury.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Browning, this argument18 that you're making, where you seem to be having great19 solicitude for the -- for the whistleblowers, for the20 people who might be retaliated against -- the respondent21 and the Solicitor General answer your argument by saying22 in all the years that 3730(h) retaliation claims have been23 available, there has been no instance of qui tam plaintiff24 barred because the retaliation occurred outside the 6-25 year limitation. Yes, one could hypothesize these cases,41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 but are there any actual cases where the retaliation in2 fact fell3 the false45 to a specific situation where that has occurred, and the6 Government, you're right, makes very much of the argument7 that this is simply hypothetical. But it is a very real8 and concrete problem when you have cases that go to trial,9 that it takes so long to go to trial, and those people whooutside the 6-year, dated from the submission ofclaim?MR. BROWNING:  Justice Ginsburg, I cannot cite10 are testifying at trial have no protection because it's11 more than 6 years from the violation of section 3729. I12 -- I would --13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Maybe they don't get14 retaliated against if they testify at trial.15 MR. BROWNING: Well --16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And if the question is17 whether there is a problem out there in the real world on18 -- for people whose interest is certainly not identical to19 yours.20 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, I recognize that, but21 you have to look at the statute as a whole to construe it22 in its proper context. And there are many situations23 where there -- a number of years pass from -- from when24 the complaint is filed to when the testimony takes place25 at trial. And -- and as the amicus brief of the National51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 Work Right Institute points out, an organization that's2 designed to protect the human rights of employees, an3 organization that's a spin-off of the American Civil4 Liberties Union, that organization clearly views the5 interpretation advocated by the respondents and adopted by6 the Fourth Circuit as detrimental by employees.7 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. All that's true,8 but the question that I think Justice Ginsburg asked was9 you have on your side the whole National Defense10 Industrial Association. You have the Equal Employment11 Advisory Council that represents dozens and dozens, I take12 it, of businesses. We have your own client. We have you13 in the firm. Everybody. I imagine you all racked your14 brains to say has there ever been such an example, and I15 take the answer is no, never. Not all of you could even16 find one instance where this happened. Now, am I right?17 Because that's what I think unless you provide the18 example.19 MR. BROWNING: I cannot cite a specific example.20 Justice Breyer, I would direct your attention to the case21 in the Eleventh Circuit, Childray v. UAPGA, in which 4-22 and-a-half years had passed between when the initial23 allegation of --24 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So -- so what would be25 so unreasonable about a Member of Congress concluding the61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 following? We want these things to end after 6 years, you2 know? And there's never been an example of this horrible3 that you think of, and so we are going to end them all4 after 6 years from the time the thing took place, the5 cheat took place. And that's it. And if there's some6 other problem of the kind you're worried about that comes7 up, we will worry about that later through amendment,8 tolling, et cetera. Why is that an -- we don't want 30-9 day statutes of limitations or 90-day statute of10 limitations. We want 6 years. That helps most people.11 And if there's an odd case that doesn't, we'll worry about12 it. What's the answer to that?13 MR. BROWNING: Well, Your Honor, if Congress had14 said that, they certainly could have15 but it would run completely contrary16 of precedent from this Court that as17 limitations period does not begin to18 of action even comes into existence.19 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, that's true, it would be.20 And the reason we're doing it is because there's a period21 of time when somebody lies to the Government and we don't22 want actions that are related to that. We'll have to go23 into that proof to take place more than 6 years later.24 Now, that would be the reason, and I agree it would be25 contrary. But the difficulty for me is the language seems71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-made that decision,to almost 200 yearsa general rule, therun before your cause￼1 to point to that reason.2 MR. BROWNING: Well --3 JUSTICE BREYER: And I can't find that reason4 idiotic.5 MR. BROWNING: Well, Your Honor, I -- I don't6 think the language points to that because the language of7 the limitations period, 3731(b), which is set out in the8 appendix to the cert petition at page 135a -- the language9 of the statute is a civil action under section 3730 may10 not be brought more than 6 years after the date of the11 violation 1213 statutory14 is not an1518 MR. BROWNING: The -- the action is brought19 under 3730(h), and Justice Stevens --20 JUSTICE STEVENS: So it is literally within the21 plain language of the statute.22 MR. BROWNING: Well, it is and it isn't. It is23 clearly in 3730(h), but when you look at the False Claims24 Act, Congress has used the phrase, an action under 3730,25 to mean different things in various portions throughout81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-of section 3729.There are two material aspects of -- of thelanguage:  the violation of section 3729, whichelement of the cause of action--don't mean tocivil action               JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, I -- I16 interrupt, but it is true that this is a17 that's brought under 3730(h), is it not?￼1 the False Claims Act. Congress has used that phrase on2 six different occasions, and I would particularly direct3 the Court's attention to 3731(c). In -- in that4 provision, Congress has provided that in an action brought5 under section 3730, the United States must prove the6 elements of the cause of action by a preponderance of the7 evidence. The respondent and the Government say you must8 have this literal reading of section -- the phrase, an9 action under 3730, and it means all three causes of action10 in 3731(b), but that -- but when you turn to 3731(c), that11 virtually identical phrase appears and you have to read12 that statutory provision in context, and read in13 context --14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It seems -- it seems if you15 read a provision like this, it says what the United States16 would be required to prove. Implicit in -- in that is in17 any action brought by the United States under 3730. I18 think -- think (c) is clearly talking about cases in which19 the United States is bringing the action.20 MR. BROWNING: Exactly, Justice Ginsburg. You21 have to read it in context, and I think when you read22 3731(b) in context and that limitations period is tied to23 a violation of section 3729, it is clear that Congress did24 not intend the phrase, an action under 3730, to -- to25 include a retaliatory discharge action in which a91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 violation of section --2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I don't think that's at3 all as clear as that (c) is directed to cases brought by4 the United States for the reason that Justice Breyer just5 explained. Congress might want to have one 6-year6 limitation and say, well, maybe there would be this7 hypothetical case that you're worried about, but for the8 most part, 6 years will take care of everybody.9 MR. BROWNING: And, Justice Ginsburg, my point10 is just as section 3731(c) is not intended to cover all of11 the causes of action under the False Claims Act, 3731(b)12 is not intended to cover all of the actions under the13 False Claims Act as well, that it's only intended to cover14 the causes of action in which a violation of section 372915 is an element of the cause of action.16 The -- the Government makes17 you need a uniform limitations period18 be tried together, but the Government19 that a qui tam action or an action brought by the20 Government is a completely different cause of action than21 an action for retaliatory discharge action. They involve22 different substantive claims.23 JUSTICE STEVENS: That's true, but is it also24 not true that some of the people who get retaliated25 against may be the same people who bring the qui tam101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-the argument thatso these actions canignores the fact￼1 action?2 MR. BROWNING: In some cases, that is -- is the3 case, Justice --4 JUSTICE STEVENS: So if they don't get the --5 recover as being the victim of retaliation, they may still6 get a very handsome reward for what happened to them.7 MR. BROWNING: That is the case, but -- but I8 also want to point out that in many cases, the person who9 brings the qui tam action is a completely different10 plaintiff than the person who brings the retaliatory11 discharge action. The example of someone who is12 retaliated against for testifying at trial -- in that13 situation, it's clearly going to be a different plaintiff14 than the plaintiff who brought the original qui tam15 action.16 It can also be a different defendant. Section17 3730(h) is intended to preclude an industry from18 blacklisting an employee. So if an employee brings a qui19 tam action while at one employer and subsequently leaves20 and go to -- goes to work for a second employer, when the21 second employer recognizes or -- or learns that this22 employee had previously been involved in an investigation23 under the False Claims Act, that second employer is24 precluded from retaliating against the -- the employee.25 So --111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE SOUTER: In the real world, do we have2 such cases?3 MR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor. I cannot cite4 to a specific case, but I'm aware that that is very much a5 issue that practitioners face day in and day out.6 JUSTICE SOUTER: Another real-world question.7 Do we -- do we have any -- do you have any experience that8 you can rely on either to show that in fact these9 subsection (h) claims are brought customarily with the10 main qui tam action or, conversely, that they are brought11 separately? Do we know what's going on?12 MR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor. It is a real13 mix, that on many cases you will see a retaliatory14 discharge action brought independently, and in other cases15 you'll see the qui tam action and the retaliation action16 brought simultaneously.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In connection with what's18 included and what isn't included, the -- in that same 373119 provision in (d), (d) is limited to (a) and (b) and so20 excludes (h). And if Congress had meant that with respect21 to the 6-year period, they could have said the same thing,22 that it relates to (a) and (b) and not (h).23 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, I would recognize24 that there is different language that Congress could have25 -- have chosen to state this in a different way, but --121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 and you're right, that in section 3731(d), Congress did2 specifically reference section 3730(a) and 3730(b), but3 Congress did not use that precision in drafting throughout4 the Federal False Claims Act. Just -- there are a number5 of ambiguities that exist throughout the Federal False6 Claims Act. Congress even referred to the General7 Accounting Office as the Government Accounting Office.8 JUSTICE SCALIA: They could have done the same9 in 3731(c) also. Instead of just saying any action10 brought under section 3730, they could have said any11 action brought under -- which one? (a) of -- of -- which12 is the one that allows the Government suit?13 MR. BROWNING: 3730(a), Justice Scalia.14 JUSTICE SCALIA: (a). They could have said (a),15 and they didn't. They said all of 3730.1617 take from 1819202122 to look at the context. You have to look at the meaning,23 and when you're dealing with a statute that is drafted in24 a way that's sloppy, you have to look at what Congress25 really intended, and when Congress --131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-MR. BROWNING:  Yes.  So -- so all you can reallythe statute is that the phrase --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Sloppy --MR. BROWNING:  Yes.JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- is what you can take.MR. BROWNING:  Yes, Your Honor.  That you have￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask -- may I ask you aquestion about the alternative?  If we don't follow thisstatute, you -- you refer to State law for the correctcause -- statute of limitations I guess.          MR. BROWNING:  Yes, Your Honor.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  And I imagine because thereare different forms of retaliation -- sometimes it's adischarge, sometimes it might be slander by defaming theperson for his next employer, it might be a tort, theybeat him up or something, there could be a lot ofdifferent kinds of retaliation -- each of which would giverise to a different statute of limitations under Statelaw.  Does that seem reasonable?          MR. BROWNING:  Well, Your Honor, this Court hasfaced that situation with 1983 in a variety of contexts,and there are a number of --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  We had to make up a rule tofill a gap.          MR. BROWNING:  And -- and in North Carolina it'seasy.  It is basically a 3-year statute of limitations foreverything.  And for a retaliatory discharge action, youlook at the -- in North Carolina, you look at thelimitations period for --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But what about Wisconsin,Michigan, Illinois, and -- and Florida?  Maybe they all141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425have different statutes and they have different kinds ofcauses of action that may be relevant in the retaliationcase.          MR. BROWNING:  Your Honor, that is certainly anissue.  With respect to the parties in this case, that isa matter that is clear and simple because North Carolinayou look to a retaliatory discharge action --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  No, but in our construction ofthe statute, we have to think about its applicationthroughout the United States, not just in North -- NorthCarolina.          MR. BROWNING:  Yes, and a rule that would applythe residual limitation period for personal injury wouldcertainly be appropriate for a situation like this.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is it -- is it a necessaryelement of a successful action for retaliatory dischargethat -- that the action under the False Claims Act havesucceeded?          MR. BROWNING:  No, Your Honor.  The courts haverepeatedly held that for a retaliatory discharge action,it is not necessary to have a violation of section 3729.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  What does the Governmentcontend is to be done under (b)(1) when no violation ofsection 3729 is committed?MR. BROWNING: Well, the way I read the 151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 Government's brief is they want to modify the language of2 section 3731(b) by inserting the phrase alleged before the3 phrase, violation of section 3729.4 JUSTICE BREYER: But don't we have to do that5 anyway when -- when in fact a person brings an ordinary6 claim? I mean, Joe Smith brings a claim that XYZ company7 cheated the Government. Now, that doesn't mean it was8 committed. It just means he says it was committed. After9 all, he might lose.10 MR. BROWNING: But -- but, Justice Breyer, when11 the jury renders its verdict, if there is a violation of12 section 3729 that's proven to exist, but that -- that13 proven violation is beyond the 6-year period, the14 defendant would be entitled to judgment based upon the15 affirmative action --16 JUSTICE BREYER: You mean if in fact the17 plaintiff loses because the jury finds for the defendant18 in the qui tam action, then it should have been dismissed19 on statute of limitations grounds.20 MR. BROWNING: No, Your Honor. What I'm21 saying --22 JUSTICE BREYER: No, of course not because --23 because the word is committed there refers to the claim of24 a plaintiff. Doesn't it?25 MR. BROWNING: What I'm -- what I'm saying is161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 you have to look at the facts that are ultimately proven2 at trial, and if the fact of the violation is more than 63 years from the filing of the cause of action, clearly4 that's going to be barred by the limitations period. The5 word alleged does not appear in the statute, and the6 Government tries to -- they essentially confuse the issue7 by saying, well, you -- you could never -- a defendant8 could never prevail on a motion to dismiss because you9 have to look at the allegations for a motion to dismiss.10 But that's the very nature --11 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it seems to me that if12 -- if there's no violation, then there's no triggering13 event to start the statute of limitations running.14 MR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor. That -- that's15 the real problem, that even under the Government's16 reading, that there is not a triggering event. So when17 you look at 3731(b) as a whole, when you try to discern18 congressional intent, Congress intended a -- the19 triggering event to be a violation of section 3729 which20 doesn't apply to a retaliatory discharge action.21 Your Honor, the -- the statute here is worded in22 such a way that throughout the Federal False Claims Act,23 there are a variety of ambiguities, but when you look at24 the statute as a whole, when you look at the stated25 purpose that Congress had of protecting people who testify171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 at trial, there is only one way to read the statute in a2 way that's harmonious, and that's to read it so that3 3731(b) only applies to section 3730(a) and 3730(b) --4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Browning, is it proper to5 consider in the calculus that if you use 6 years from the6 date the -- that the false claim was made or was alleged7 to be made, then you don't have to get into the question8 which State's statute of limitations, the choice of law9 question, and then when you identify that State, which10 limitation period within that State? I mean, those are11 two inquiries which can sometimes be rather complicated.12 They are obviated entirely if we take the 6 years from the13 Federal statute.14 MR. BROWNING: Justice Ginsburg, you're15 absolutely right, that if the respondents' and the Fourth16 Circuit's reading of the statute is correct, that Congress17 did intend this bizarre result to take place for all three18 causes of19 law cause2021 Court has22 expressly23 appropriate vehicle is to look to the24 analogous State law cause of action.25 one of the comparable situations here181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  1-action, then you don't have to look to a Stateof action to fill the gap.But there are many circumstances where thisrecognized that you do -- when Congress has notprovided a limitations period, the mostmost closelyAs a matter of fact,is ERISA.Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SCALIA:  We've done it for severalhundred years, haven't we --          MR. BROWNING:  Yes.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- for all Federal causes ofaction?  We've -- we've looked to State --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  When there is no statute oflimitations.          MR. BROWNING:  When -- when --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The question is Federalstatute.  Is there one?  And my question is deciding isthere one -- this is not something drawn from thin air.There is a 6-year period right in the statute.          MR. BROWNING:  There -- there is a 6-year periodand if that is applied by this Court to a retaliatorydischarge action, there will still be difficulties becauseyou will have situations where there is no violation ofsection 3729.  So when do you start the limitations periodrunning?          The respondent would argue in their brief thatyou start it running from when they believed that theviolation took place.  So your -- the respondent isarguing you're looking to the mental impression of thelitigant that would be the triggeringlimitations period.Your Honor, if there are no 19device for thefurther questions,Washington, DC 200051111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425I'd reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Very well, Mr.Browning.          Mr. Hurt, we'll hear -- we'll hear from you.                ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK HURT                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MR. HURT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleasethe Court:          The text of this statute could not be more clearon this issue.  A retaliation claim is a civil actionunder section 3730, and a civil action under 3730 issubject to a 6-year limitations period.          Petitioners argue, in effect, that the Courtshould disregard the plain language here and claim thatCongress really meant that only two of the three causes ofaction under section 3730, should be subject to the 6-year limitations period, those brought under sections (a)and (b), and that Congress told us this indirectly bychanging the limitations trigger -- this simply makes nosense for two reasons.          First, there is no reason why Congress wouldhave limited the scope of the limitations period in such acryptic manner.  In paragraph (d) as Justice --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Sloppiness.  Sloppiness.  Howabout that as a reason, sloppiness that appears throughout201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the rest of this -- of this piece of legislation?          MR. HURT:  Well, I -- I would propose that ifCongress really wanted this trigger, wanted that uniformlimitations period, they really couldn't have done thisparticular provision, (b)(1), in a more clear way.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you -- do you know of -- ofany other situation in which a -- a time limit is imposedthat has nothing whatever to do with the -- with the actthat the individual is complaining about, nothing whateverto do with the act --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And -- and where the timelimit begins to run even before the act occurs?          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Before the act occurs.          MR. HURT:  The answer is no, but --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And the time limit could haveexpired before the act occurs.  Right?  So you get freeretaliation after 6 years.  Is that right?          MR. HURT:  Sometimes equitable doctrines mightapply, but the --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, wait.  What kind of anequitable doctrine?          MR. HURT:deliberately waitedpast, that could be For instance, if the employerto retaliate until the 6 years hasan instance.But the important thing is the retaliation 211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 provision in the False Claims Act is unique because it's2 designed to be a companion or an add-on action to the qui3 tam action. That's -- if you look at the reported cases,4 the vast majority of those cases show the two actions5 brought together.6 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that one of the major7 things they were concerned about was retaliation against8 witnesses in the qui tam action, and that will always9 occur after. I mean, the -- the suit for retaliation will10 then always occur after the qui tam action.11 MR. HURT: I believe the core concern is to12 incentivize the whistleblower. But take that particular13 situation, the witness, and that concern. There are other14 laws and other causes of actions that will protect the15 witness in that situation. For instance, section 1985.16 This Court in Hadel v. Harrison ruled that a witness who17 is retaliated against at a Federal trial does have a18 section 1985 action.19 Here, Congress was focusing on the20 whistleblower, encouraging him to bring this qui tam21 action. In fact, he's only protected for activities that22 are -- the -- the statute says, in furtherance of an23 action under this section. That is pointing to the qui24 tam action.25 And there's all kinds of problems that arise if221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 these two actions are not brought together if the2 retaliation action must be brought first.3 First, if you accept the petitioner's view,4 you're going to have situations where as little as 1805 days -- they have 180 days like in Florida to bring this6 retaliation action. Once that's gone, the -- the7 whistleblower has possibly 6 years to bring this qui tam8 action, but no incentive from the retaliation action,9 which was1011 go back a12 between an answer that you gave and one that Mr. Browning13 gave. He said it's a mixed bag, the litigation of whether14 it's brought in one action and the whistleblower is making15 both claims or whether the retaliation claim is saved out16 and brought in a separate action. You said the vast17 majority of the cases involve the whistleblower asserting18 both claims in a single action. Which characterization is19 right? Mixed bag or vast majority?20 MR. HURT: Well, the SG's office informed us21 that they did a search of the reported cases. In the22 majority of those cases, the -- the claims were brought23 together. The SG, I think, can give you the details on24 that.251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-one of the --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Hurt, can you -- can youfew steps?  Because there was a differenceJUSTICE GINSBURG: All right. 23￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're now saying majority, notvast majority.          MR. HURT:  Okay.  I think it --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, wait for the SG.          (Laughter.)          MR. HURT:  But they point out -- they realized,I think, petitioners, that this is a problem that -- thatthis is a unique act, and they -- and they point out --they make the claim that the Major Fraud Act somehowrenders this not unique.  That's a criminal statute and itdoesn't have a qui tam action.          Every retaliation claim is going to be based inpart on an alleged violation of section 3729.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you're reading alleged into-- into (b)(1).  Right?  Sure, it will always be based onan alleged violation.  So it doesn't have to be aviolation.          MR. HURT:  Well, no.  I think that ignores howstatute of limitations are actually construed by courts.You can write a statute basically two ways.  You can putthe violation as the trigger or you can put the act,alleged to be a violation.  Courts apply thoseidentically.          And for instance, if you have a summary judgmentmotion by a qui tam -- qui tam defendant, which we always241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 agree that this statute (b)(1) applies, all the defendant2 has to do is point out the act alleged to be a false claim3 falls outside of the 6-year period, and he wins. He4 doesn't have -- no one has to show whether the actual5 claim itself was false or not. So I think, you know, as6 Justice Breyer points out, this is the way you universally7 construe statute of limitations.8 Having the same trigger for all three 37309 actions means the limitations period starts for all three10 at the same time. This makes it easier for the11 whistleblower to bring both their qui tam and retaliation12 actions together. If she's forced to bring the13 retaliation action first, then if she misses that, then14 she's got no incentive to then go on and bring the qui tam15 action from the -- the incentive from this whistleblower16 action, which is the key purpose of it.17 Also, if she has to bring the18 action first before the qui tam action,19 happen, if she's not ready to bring the20 these can be very complicated allegations, complicated21 defense contract -- then what will happen is she will most22 likely have to split her claim. And that exposes the23 whistleblower to all kinds of -- of pitfalls. For24 instance --25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hurt, what -- what about251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1--- the retaliationthen what willqui tam action --￼1 the argument that unlike most retaliation situations, here2 if you take that 6-year period, which is much longer than3 the general run of retaliation statutes take it, then you4 would have a qui tam plaintiff who waits while the back5 pay is mounting, and so you can have an exorbitant6 application both with respect to the amount of back pay7 and the claim for reinstatement. 5 years down the road --8 I haven't worked with this company now -- I'm going to9 insist they take me back, be reinstated. That -- that10 concern, that on your reading there is the potential for11 much larger damages and much more disruptive reinstatement12 than is usually the case.13 MR. HURT: I think that that type of situation14 is just so highly unlikely. It doesn't really comport15 with the realities of what whistleblowers are thinking16 about. For instance, in this case, Ms. Wilson didn't come17 forward until she saw no one else would come forward and18 remedy what she saw as theft from the U.S. Government.19 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but isn't -- isn't Justice20 Ginsburg's question raised by your very argument, that you21 don't want whistleblowers having to bring their22 whistleblower actions before they are ready to bring their23 main actions? And if it's going to take -- you've just24 said how difficult it may be to prepare one of these qui25 tam cases. If in fact you're right and it may take a261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 couple of years from the time the employer gets wind that2 something is going on and fires or does whatever, then in3 exactly that situation, the -- the whistleblower damages4 are going to be mounting during that period of 1 or 2 or5 whatever years it may be before the qui tam action starts.6 So on your hypothesis, it seems to me, you're going to get7 just the situation that Justice Ginsburg raised.8 MR. HURT: I think that -- I think there's a9 split in the lower courts about how the mitigation will10 apply.11 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let's -- let's first see12 about your argument. Isn't that what your argument13 implies?14 MR. HURT: I think that -- that that is a15 possible case, but I think that that's -- the priorities16 for the Government and -- and Congress in drafting this17 law was to get money back for the Government. That's18 their number one concern here and to incentivize that19 whistleblower. If it so happens that the whistleblower20 takes much -- takes a long time to prepare his qui tam and21 brings his -- his retaliation action at the same time and22 ends up getting some more damages, I -- I think that ranks23 low on the list of Congress' priorities in drafting this24 retaliation provision. It's the -- getting the25 Government's money back, giving the whistleblower271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 protection and an incentive to bring that qui tam claim is2 really Congress' core concern here.3 And I think these other issues about damages4 mounting can be readily addressed with the mitigation5 defense and -- and dealing with that that will take care6 of double damages so -- so if the whistleblower is just7 sitting around waiting for that, then the mitigation8 defense would take care of that.9 Also, I think the petitioner raised the idea10 that this is some kind of -- the -- the retaliator can11 bring some kind of nebulous fraud allegation if it doesn't12 -- isn't really tied to a specific false claim. I think13 that the courts are not interpreting it that way because14 this is a False Claims Act retaliation claim, not just a15 generalized fraud claim. So in a typical case, there will16 be a claim that -- that the whistleblower will -- will be17 able to point to and say I think that this claim is false.18 I have a good faith belief that it is false, and then it19 -- and that's what the trigger would be based on.20 I mean, in summary, if there's no further21 questions, I'd like to just summarize.22 I think this Court should uphold the plain23 language of the statute. While the limitations trigger is24 unusual, it is the one that Congress set forth in the25 statute. It makes sense. It reflects the unique281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425considerations of encouraging -- the goal of encouraging awhistleblower to bring his qui tam claim with hisretaliation claim.          19 years of experience have shown that the plainlanguage works in the typical cases that arise, and thatnone of the reasons given by the petitioners come close toproviding a justification for this Court to discard theplain language of the statute.  None of the reasons --this statute does not rise to the level of absurdity thatwould justify this Court disregarding the plain language.          Thank you.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Hurt.          Mr. Driemeier, we'll hear from you.        ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER              ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,        AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT          MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court:          Section 3731(b) provides the statute oflimitations for, quote, a civil action under section 3730.There is no question that Ms. Wilson's claim ofretaliation is a claim under section 3730.  Petitionerasks the Court to construe section 3731(b) to include animplicit limitation to claims under subsections (a) or(b) --291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: What he's saying is it should2 be read to include only those causes of action under 37303 that the rest of (b) makes sense as applied to, just as in4 (c) the phrase, brought under section 3730, should be5 interpreted to -- to include only those causes of action6 that the rest of that provision applies to, namely, those7 -- those actions under 3730 that involve the United8 States. I mean, that's -- that's a perfectly9 reasonable --10 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Section 3731(c) does11 not require, in its application, the Court to construe a12 civil action under section 3730 to mean anything other13 than what its words import because it only relates to the14 United States' burden of proof.15 The petitioner suggested that it implicitly was16 limited to an action under 3730(a). Well, that's17 certainly not true because if -- if an action is brought18 under 3730(b) and the United States intervenes, section19 3731(c) establishes the standard of proof. If Congress20 were to amend section 3730(h) to allow the United States21 to bring a claim on behalf of the employee who was22 retaliated against, section 3731(c) would, by its terms,23 establish the burden of proof that the United States would24 have to meet. So there is no inconsistency there.25 JUSTICE SCALIA: You think -- do you think301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 Congress is more likely to amend 3731(b) to say clearly2 and non-sloppily what it means if we find for the3 Government here or if we find for the -- I mean, for --4 for the side that the Government supports or if we find5 for the other side?6 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor, I7 think that 3731(b) is capable of application exactly as8 written, and in fact, as we say in our brief, that that is9 the statute of limitations which most serves the purposes10 of the statute unlike the alternative the petitioner --11 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what about this as a12 general -- as a general principle of construction? A13 court should not, unless there is no reasonable14 alternative, construe a statute of limitations provision15 in such fashion that the statute can expire before the16 cause of action arises?17 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well --18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that a reasonable19 proposition?2021222324 me. 25MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  No, sir.JUSTICE SCALIA:  No?MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  There are any --JUSTICE SCALIA:  It seems to me reasonable toMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Many States have 311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425adopted statutes of repose, and they apply to a cause ofaction that under State law accrues for purposes ofstatute of limitations upon the discovery of the injury.But a statute of repose can come in and instead tied tothe act, say, for instance, in which the date that aproduct was first sold into the market.  And so the causeof action, for purposes of statute of limitations, willnot arise in many instances until after the statute oflimitations has run because of a statute of repose.  Sothat it's certainly not unheard of in the law.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And that was the point thatthe Seventh Circuit made clear in -- in its --          MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  That's right, JusticeGinsburg.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- statute of repose.          JUSTICE BREYER:  What about an action ofejectment, an action of ejectment that arises only afterthe adverse possession statute of limitations have run?          MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  That's right.  There --          JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not sure it is right.          MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  -- there other examplesof -- of cases in which the time in which a claim can bebrought may have expired before the cause of actionaccrues.JUSTICE SCALIA: But we don't run forward to 321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 create situations like that, do we?2 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well --3 JUSTICE SCALIA: My -- my point isn't that it4 couldn't exist. I just said you should not interpret a5 statute of limitations if it is reasonably possible to6 avoid it in that fashion.7 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, in the Bay Area8 Laundry case and in the Reiter case, the Court has9 acknowledged that there is a general rule that statutes of10 limitations start to run when the cause of action accrues.11 But in each of those case -- cases, the Court was very12 clear that that was the rule that applied in the absence13 of contrary indication by Congress. And here we have a14 very explicit contrary indication by Congress, that the15 statute of limitations for any civil action under section16 3730 runs from the date on which the violation of section17 3729 was committed.18 In other words, Congress has opted here to19 establish a single uniform statute of limitations for all20 claims that might arise under the False Claims Act. And21 as I said before, that serves the purposes of the False22 Claims Act better, far better certainly, than petitioner's23 alternative.24 As we have pointed out, many State statutes of25 limitations, assuming that one can determine which one331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 applies of the many that might be offered, are much2 shorter than the statute provided for bringing the qui tam3 action. As a practical matter, then an employee might be4 forced to split their claims. If they split their claims,5 any number of adverse consequences follow.6 First, they could find themselves barred from7 bringing a subsequent qui tam action on behalf of the8 United States by the public disclosure bar of the False9 Claims Act. The Eleventh Circuit has a rule that says10 that the two claims are one for purposes of res judicata.11 So in the Eleventh Circuit, apparently they could be12 barred by res judicata from bringing a qui tam action.13 The disclosures in the course of the wrongful14 termination of retaliation claim action would, of course,15 alert the defendant to the scope and extent of any16 Government investigation.17 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, he's already alerted to18 the extent that he's taking retaliatory action as true.19 He may not whole -- know the -- the whole extent of -- of20 what the employee knows, but he's already been tipped off.21 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, as a practical22 matter, oftentimes the employer fires the employee as soon23 as the employer has a sense that the employee is on to24 something. He doesn't have a full knowledge of what the25 employee knows and certainly doesn't know that the341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 employee might have told the Government and that the2 Government is investigating. And that's the purpose of3 the under seal requirement of the False Claims Act, to4 allow the Government to conduct a full investigation of5 the claim, talk to other employees about what was going6 on. Sometimes the employee really has identified fraud,7 but may only have identified a portion of the larger8 scheme of fraud that's going on. And the Government gets9 to investigate that while the claim is under seal.10 But in the course of discovery in any wrongful11 termination suit or retaliation suit, all of that12 information would become available to the employer. And13 so the sealed provisions of the FCA would be defeated in14 large extent.15 There's also the fact of just the litigation16 efficiencies of litigating the two claims together.17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask you --18 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- will be the same.19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask you another textual20 question? You -- you want us to say that (b)(1) must21 apply to all civil actions under section 3730. Must22 (b)(2) apply to all civil actions under 3730 as well?23 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The -- the most close24 reading of the text would be that any25 3730 can be brought within 3 years of351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  1-civil action underwhen the official ofWashington, DC 20005￼1 the United States -- now, we differ from the Ninth Circuit2 on this. We believe that is only a Government official,3 in particular a Department of Justice official -- knows of4 the facts relevant to bringing a cause of action that the5 United States could bring, i.e., the cause of action under6 3730(a). But we think that 3 years from that date in the7 action under 3730 could be brought, including the qui tam8 action or including a retaliation action.9 But that reading is not essential to the10 position that we advocate here.11 JUSTICE SCALIA: So that -- that could exclude12 even a retaliation action by an individual who -- who13 doesn't -- who doesn't know when the -- when the14 individual -- the official of the United States found out15 about those facts. That -- that doesn't seem to me very16 reasonable.17 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, of course --18 JUSTICE SCALIA: That provision is very -- very19 reasonable as applied to qui tam actions. It doesn't seem20 to me to make any sense as applied to a retaliation21 action.22 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor, it --23 it does make sense applying it to a retaliation action24 because it could be, for instance, the employee who was25 the individual who informed the Government official361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 charged with responsibility to act of the facts that would2 warrant the United States in filing an action under3 3730(a).4 JUSTICE SCALIA: It might be, but maybe the5 United States found out before -- before that individual6 came forward. Maybe there was an official in the United7 States.8 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's -- that's9 possible.10 JUSTICE SCALIA: And so he's -- you know, he's11 -- he's out of -- out of time before he even knows about12 it.13 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, there may be14 events that --15 1617 where the18 advantage1920 considered and rejected a virtually identical argument.21 That case -- the statute of limitations also was stated in22 the alternative, and the second one was 3 years after the23 information necessary to the claim had arrived. And the24 party who was opposed to the position the Court ultimately25 adopted said that the Court's interpretation of the first371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-JUSTICE SCALIA:  Strange.MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  There may be instancesemployee would not know that they could takeof that provision.But in the Bay Area Laundry case, the Court￼1 of the two alternatives would render the second2 superfluous. And the Court said, it may be superfluous to3 this category of claims, but it's not superfluous to other4 categories of claims, and so that does not prevent us from5 construing the first provision in the way that we are.6 So likewise, even if the Court were to conclude7 that 3731(b)(2) is unavailable to a retaliation claim or8 unavailable to a qui tam claim, as some courts of appeals9 have held, it would not mean that 3731(b)(1) is10 unavailable, just as holding that 3731(b)(2) is11 unavailable to a qui tam relator would not mean that12 3731(b)(1) is unavailable to a qui tam relator.13 A couple of Justices, Justice Souter --14 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but it -- but it would mean15 that just as 3731(b)(2) can be selectively applied to some16 categories and not to others, so also, by parity of17 reasoning, (b)(1) can selectively be applied to some18 categories of violation and not to others.19 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, again, we believe20 that the best, most faithful reading of the text is that21 (b)(2) is available to all causes of action under 3730.22 The -- Justice Souter asked a question about23 statistics and the frequency with which the claims are24 litigated together. In a review of court of appeals25 decisions, there were 51 court of appeals decisions381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 actually involving a 3730(h) claim. Of those, in 32 the2 qui tam -- a qui tam claim and a retaliation claim were3 paired. They were litigated together. In only 5 were4 both a qui tam action and retaliation claim brought, but5 brought in separate litigation. So 32 to 5 is the6 relevant comparison there.7 JUSTICE SCALIA: What about the rest?8 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: In -- in --9 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's --10 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- 14 claims an11 individual brought a retaliation claim but never brought a12 qui tam suit. It may be that the Government had sought this --13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I would county that as14 being brought separate. I think you should add that with15 the other 5.16 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor, in --17 in fact, if we -- if we look more closely at those 1418 cases, 5 of them were dismissed because the plaintiff was19 not even involved in protected conduct under the statute.20 So the closer you get to the core of what Congress had in21 mind, when it enacted the statute, of -- of pulling out22 employees who have the information that only they have23 that the Government needs in order to recover fraud, the24 closer you get to that core, the more likely it is that25 the claims that are going to be litigated together. And391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that's the way the Court ought to apply the statute. It's2 the way Congress wrote the statute, to serve those3 purposes.4 The -- I -- I think that the alternative of5 applying State statutes of limitations raises -- North6 Carolina does not dispute that, for example, in Florida7 the -- the analogous statute of limitations under Florida8 law -- it's the Florida State False Claims Act which has a9 retaliation provision -- would be 180 days. 180 days is10 far too short to put together the complicated qui tam11 complaint that is called for under the False Claims Act.12 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, apparently13 Florida didn't think so.14 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Excuse me, sir?15 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Apparently Florida16 didn't think it was too short.17 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Florida may have18 made an alternative policy decision in terms of wanting19 the claims to be litigated together or apart. The20 Congress has established a single uniform statute of21 limitations which allows the claims to be litigated22 together, and as I've said, that is in fact the practice23 that when someone is going to bring a qui tam action, they24 almost invariably -- there -- there are 5 exceptions --25 bring the cases together.401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          If there are no further questions, thank youvery much.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.Driemeier.          Mr. Browning, you have 8 minutes remaining.     REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER G. BROWNING, JR.                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. BROWNING:  Thank you.          The Government argues that there will beproblems that will arise from splitting the qui tam actionand the retaliatory discharge action.  And one of theexamples that the Government use -- uses is the publicdisclosure doctrine which is set out in section3730(e)(4)(A) of the False Claims Act.  The publicdisclosure doctrine, however, is a red herring herebecause the public disclosure doctrine is designed to keep-- to avoid parasitic lawsuits where information is in the-- the public domain, somebody taking that information,and then filing a -- a qui tam lawsuit.          The -- the public disclosure doctrine,3730(e)(4)(A), also provides that when someone is theoriginal source of the information, even if the basis forthe lawsuit has been made public through a congressionalhearing or elsewhere, that person can still bring anaction if they're an original source.  So it's a complete411111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 red herring here.2 The other red herring that was put forth is a3 statement that there's a rule in the Eleventh Circuit4 relating to claims splitting. And forgive me, I cannot5 recall the name of the case that the Government is6 referring to, but it is a decision by James C. Hill. And7 that specific case involved a situation where the qui tam8 action was brought, a settlement was reached, and then9 well after the fact, the plaintiff said, oh, and I have10 this retaliation claim. It makes perfect sense in that11 situation to -- to apply principles of res judicata.12 What the Government is ignoring is there are no13 reported decisions anywhere where a retaliatory discharge14 action was brought and then res judicata was used to bar15 the qui tam action filed at a later date. And there's a16 perfectly logical reason for that because they are17 different causes of action, and they involve different18 parties. A retaliation claim is personal to the individual.19 A qui tam action is an action brought on behalf of the20 Government.21 One final point that I'd like to make is the22 respondent takes the position that the False Claims Act is23 unique. Well, it's not unique. It's not unique in that24 when you look at the Major Fraud Act, there is a25 retaliatory discharge provision that is virtually421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 identical to the False Claims Act, and in the Major Frauds2 Act -- with respect to the Major Fraud Act, Congress made3 a -- a conscious decision not to include an express4 limitations period.5 It's not -- the False Claim Act is also not6 unique when you compare it to ERISA. ERISA --7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Just go back to what you8 said. In -- in the Major -- whatever it is -- is there9 any limitation at all, or just the limitation on the qui10 tam and as here, as you contend is so here?11 MR. BROWNING: The Major Fraud Act is a criminal12 provision that provides a retaliatory discharge provision13 for anyone who assists the Government in bringing the14 criminal prosecution. There -- there -- in the Major15 Fraud Act, there is a specific limitations period of 716 years in which the prosecution has to be brought by the17 United States.18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Oh, that's -- that's a19 criminal proceeding.20 MR. BROWNING: But -- but there is -- it -- but21 the criminal statute provides for a civil remedy for a22 retaliatory discharge, and with respect to that23 retaliatory discharge provision in the Major Fraud Act,24 there is no limitations provision.25 One other point that I want to make is that the431111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 False Claims Act is not -- not unique when you compare it2 to ERISA. ERISA is a statute that has essentially a3 retaliatory discharge provision as well in section 510 of4 ERISA, 29 U.S.C. 1140. And courts -- the Federal courts5 have consistently held that there is no express6 limitations period for section 510, so we have to look to7 the limitations period under the most closely analogous8 State law cause of action.9 On the other hand, ERISA has numerous10 provisions, numerous other aspects of the statute, that do11 have a limitations period. The limitations period for an12 action for breach of fiduciary duty is a 6-year period13 with a 3-year tolling provision. So ERISA is a prime14 example of a statute where Congress has made a decision15 that when you have a retaliatory discharge provision, not16 to apply the statute of limitations period, that you look17 to State law, even though that Federal statute in other18 aspects has other limitations provisions.19 If there are no further questions, we would rely20 upon our briefs.21 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.22 Browning.23 The case is submitted.24 (Whereupon, at 11:58 a.m., the case in the25 above-entitled matter was submitted.)441111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-
