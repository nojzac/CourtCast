McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro.Mr. Fergenson.ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR F. FERGENSONON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. FERGENSON: Mr. Chief Justice,and mayit please the Court:Because J. McIntyre did not directany activity at residents of New Jersey either itself or by3￼directing its distributor MMA to do so and had no awareness or knowledge that the distributor took the action that it did toward New Jersey, New Jersey lacked adjudicative jurisdiction.JUSTICE SCALIA: When you say "its distributor," was this distributor at all controlled by the defendant?MR. FERGENSON: No, Your Honor. It was not. And both under Ohio law, Wells v. Komatsu America, and under the Restatement (Second) Agency, section 1(1), the right to control is essential to ascribe actions to create an agency, and it's on a per-purpose basis.JUSTICE SCALIA: It might be better to refer - Subject to Final Review1 to it as the company that distributed its product,2 rather than 345 me.calling it "its distributor."MR. FERGENSON: Very good, Your Honor. JUSTICE SCALIA: It's loaded, it seems toMR. FERGENSON: Very good, Your Honor. JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fergenson, in your6 78 question presented to this Court, you ask whether9 there's personal jurisdiction -- and I'm quoting here -­10 "solely because the manufacturer targets the United11 States market for the sale of its product."12 So I'm taking from that, that you13 acknowledge that this manufacturer, McIntyre, a British14 manufacturer, targeted the United States market for the15 sale of its product. That's correct, yes?16 MR. FERGENSON: Your Honor, that's what the17 New Jersey Supreme Court held, and that's how we18 fashioned the -­19 JUSTICE KAGAN: That's your question20 presented.21 MR. FERGENSON: -- the test.22 JUSTICE KAGAN: Did this -- well, I'll just23 ask you, then: Did this manufacturer target the United24 States market? Did it want to sell its products in the25 United States?4￼ - Subject to Final Review1 MR. FERGENSON: Yes, Your Honor.2 JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. So what does that3 mean, exactly, Mr. Fergenson? Because the United States4 is the United States. It's made up of 50 States. So I5 assume that6 to sell its7 right?8910 product in a few States?11 MR. FERGENSON: No, Your Honor. It wanted12 to sell its product anywhere that the distributor could13 find. The distributor was the market manager.14 JUSTICE KAGAN: Right. Anywhere. So if the15 distributor came up with California, that was great. If16 the distributor came up with a customer in New Jersey,17 that was great. As many as possible, more the better,18 all over the United States. Is that right?19 MR. FERGENSON: As many as possible,20 wherever the -- the distributor could find a customer,21 yes, Your Honor.22 JUSTICE KAGAN: Exactly. So you targeted23 New Jersey no less than you targeted California or New24 York or Illinois or Massachusetts or anything else.25 MR. FERGENSON: Well -- what that means is the manufacturer wanted products in each of the 50 States. Is thatMR. FERGENSON: No, Your Honor.JUSTICE KAGAN: It only wanted to sell its5￼ - Subject to Final Review1 JUSTICE KAGAN: You targeted the entire2 United States. Why shouldn't there be jurisdiction in3 each of the States you targeted?4 MR. FERGENSON: Well, Your Honor, because,5 first, this Court's jurisprudence looks to a direct act,6 from World-Wide Volkswagen and even before, as it7 brought forward Hanson. As this Court has applied8 World-Wide Volkswagen, Burger King and Justice9 O'Connor's concurrence in Asahi and the other10 occurrence -- concurrence, Justice Brennan's concurrence11 in Asahi, look toward a specific State -­12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Fergenson, I suppose13 you could say the same thing about any United States14 manufacturer -­6￼151617 his product 181920 foreign manufacturer is therefore suable in any State21 would mean that any American manufacturer is suable in22 any State, which -­23 MR. FERGENSON: Yes, Your Honor.24 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- none of our cases hold.MR. FERGENSON: Yes.JUSTICE SCALIA: -- who would desire to sell in any of the States that would buy it.MR. FERGENSON: Yes, Your Honor.JUSTICE SCALIA: And to say that this25 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suable in any State 7 claim based8 for a claim9on that accident? Not generally, but just based on that accident.Didn't even Justice O'Connor -- you - Subject to Final Review1 where the incident arises. This is not general2 jurisdiction. This is specific jurisdiction. So the3 question is, when you target the entire United States4 and each of the 50 States within that and an accident5 occurs within one of those States, are you subject to6 jurisdiction in that State for that accident, for a10 referenced the Asahi opinions, but Justice O'Connor said11 as long as there's purposeful availment, there is12 specific jurisdiction, and there is purposeful availment13 when there's an active effort to target a market.14 MR. FERGENSON: Well, Your Honor, in Burger15 King, in Hanson, in World-Wide Volkswagen, the16 purposeful availment is defined as conducting activities17 within the forum State. The -- this Court, through18 those opinions, foreseeability, clear notice, reasonably19 anticipate -- all converge.20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In all of those cases,21 there was a forum in the United States where someone22 injured in the United States could sue. Your23 proposition is that a company can deliberately send its24 products, wants to exploit a U.S. market. But I take it25 that there is no place in the United States, because New 7￼ - Subject to Final Review1 Jersey is no different than California or any other2 place -- is it your position that there is no forum in3 which McIntyre can be sued, even though it set up this4 distribution arrangement for the very purpose of having5 its machines in as many locations in the United States6 as it could? Is there a forum in the United States7 where it could be sued?8 MR. FERGENSON: Yes, Your Honor.9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Which one?10 MR. FERGENSON: Ohio. It could have been11 proceeded against in Ohio.12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It could be reached in13 Ohio. Now, does that make a whole lot of sense? Is it14 any more convenient for McIntyre to come to Ohio than15 New Jersey? It's a lot less convenient for16 Mr. Nicastro, who had his fingers removed by this17 machine.18 But you -- you are conceding that there is a19 forum where this British company can be sued on a tort20 that occurred in New Jersey. Explain to me why, since21 there is a forum in the United States, the logical one22 isn't New Jersey rather than Ohio.23 MR. FERGENSON: Well, Your Honor, first, the24 issue of convenience, choice of law, conflict of law, as25 a determinative factor was rejected by this Court -- 8￼ - Subject to Final Review1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm asking you -­2 MR. FERGENSON: What?3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the question:4 can it be sued? Well, something happened in New5 The machine, allegedly defective machine, caused6 there. What happened in Ohio? What basis for specific7 jurisdiction is there in Ohio? There was no tort in8 Ohio.9 MR. FERGENSON: Well, Your Honor, under Ohio10 law, the -- there can be an assignment. There was no11 written contract between MMA and J. McIntyre. There can12 be an assignment in return for a release of a common law13 indemnification right.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't understand.15 JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, but, Mr. Fergenson,16 just picking up where Justice Ginsburg left off, Ohio is17 a perfectly good place for jurisdiction over a claim18 between the British manufacturer and its distributor in19 Ohio. Any kind of contract claim, a claim based on the20 agreement between the two -- Ohio is the appropriate21 place for jurisdiction. But Ohio does not seem the22 appropriate place for jurisdiction -- and again, we're23 talking about specific jurisdiction, not general -- as24 to a claim based on an accident that occurred in New25 Jersey.Where Jersey. a harm9￼ - Subject to Final Review101 The entire idea of specific jurisdiction is2 that you need a relationship between the defendant and3 the forum and the claim. And here the claim arose in4 New Jersey and was in fact not related to Ohio.5 MR. FERGENSON: Well, Your Honor, Ohio6 explicitly provides, and they -- it's arisen in statute7 of limitation cases, and it goes back to Travelers8 Indemnity v. Trowbridge, that an action under both9 express and common law indemnity arises under contract.10 So, upon the assignment -- and there need11 not be a judgment under Ohio law; that's Fort Defiance12 Construction v. Village of Grover Hill -- there can be13 an assignment of a common law indemnity under strict14 product liability.15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What kind of common law16 indemnity are we dealing with here? Where does17 Mr. Nicastro sue? He hasn't got any assignment, any18 indemnity. Mr. Nicastro is injured in the United States19 by a machine manufactured in England, and he wants to￼20 sue, understandably, in the United States. Why21 talking about assignments, indemnity? That has22 to do with Mr. Nicastro.23 MR. FERGENSON: Yes, Your Honor, it24 Mr. Nicastro had an action under strict productare we nothingdoes.25 liability. I want to come back to more fully answer the - Subject to Final Review111 why question that you asked: Why is it just and right2 that he go -- that he to Ohio?3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, I would just like to4 know first -- you said there is jurisdiction in Ohio and5 not in New Jersey. In New Jersey, it's the place where6 the accident occurred; and in Ohio, there's nothing but7 the relationship between the distributor -- there's a8 contract between the distributor and McIntyre. So why9 does Ohio have jurisdiction over this New Jersey tort?10 MR. FERGENSON: Ohio has New Jersey -­11 jurisdiction. There -- as Your Honor noticed, there are12 three places that Mr. Nicastro, in looking over this,13 could have chosen: United Kingdom, which he is now in,14 in filing a claim in the liquidation proceedings; Ohio;15 and New Jersey. The accident occurred in New Jersey.16 That's a forum non conveniens issue that's -- ­￼JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's a forum what?MR. FERGENSON: That's a convenience issue, conveniens issue. And Justice Brennan was17 1819 a forum non20 clear before Burger King that that's what he wanted to21 see the law22 that.2324 Shoe,go in the direction of.

FERGENSON: And -- and the cause of - Subject to Final Review5 action, yes. There -- the one place where both the6 distributor, who would upon suit and then a claim over7 under product, strict product liability, would disappear8 -- that's why you could get an assignment -- the9 distributor is in Ohio, and so too is the contract10 relationship.11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I still don't -- I don't12 follow how Mr. Nicastro gets involved with assignment,13 indemnity. Mr. Nicastro has a claim against -- well, he14 sued them both, but the distributor is now bankrupt.15 And he says, well, this is specific jurisdiction;16 specific jurisdiction, as International Shoe teaches, is17 where the claim arose. International Shoe, it arose in18 the State of Washington because that's where the shoe -­19 the people who were promoting sale of International20 Shoe's -- International Shoe's shoes worked every day.21 So it was a claim relating to a tax owed by22 International Shoe based on the events that occurred in23 California. It was not all-purpose jurisdiction.24 And your suggestion that Ohio somehow is a25 proper forum for Mr. Nicastro's tort claim, I really 12￼ - Subject to Final Review131 don't follow that.2 MR. FERGENSON: It -- Your Honor, it is.3 Mr. Nicastro could have contacted MMA, and stated I have4 a strict product liability action, or the trustee in5 bankruptcy. The statute of limitations was 2 years in6 both cases. Ohio would have applied New Jersey strict7 liability law.8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Your answer to Justice9 Ginsburg -- I don't want to make your argument for you,10 but it seems to me rather strange. All of a sudden11 you're talking about how Ohio law will help you out. I12 thought the question was, from the standpoint of the13 defendant at least, whether the defendant purposefully14 availed itself of the forum. And you would say the15 defendant here purposefully availed itself of Ohio by16 choosing an Ohio distributor. But you don't make that17 argument. You're talking about a contract, an18 indemnity, which seems to me another step. That's19 choice of law and applicable law.20 MR. FERGENSON: I agree, Your Honor; it is21 choice of law. And -­22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Also, I don't think it's23 worth your time, because frankly it doesn't make a whole24 lot of difference to me whether they can sue in Ohio or25 not. You really think that that's -- ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. FERGENSON: And, Your Honor -­JUSTICE SCALIA: What about in the United States? Would the United States have jurisdiction?MR. FERGENSON: No, because -­JUSTICE SCALIA: The United States would not? They surely targeted the United States.MR. FERGENSON: Well, Your Honor, in the -­ in Justice O'Connor's footnote on national contacts in Asahi, which was not disputed and I think essentially accepted by Justice Brennan -- in that footnote, it states that national contacts is for the national sovereign to decide.JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. But if the national sovereign, the United States, provided by statute that Federal district courts would have jurisdiction over any -- any tort suit by a person injured by a foreign manufacturer that targeted the United States, would that be proper?MR. FERGENSON: This Court has not evaluated under the Fifth Amendment what circumstances it may be, and this is speculation, how Congress would establish it. It may be that Congress -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course. It's a hypothetical.MR. FERGENSON: Yes, sir.

FERGENSON: I think that -­JUSTICE SCALIA: How do you speculate about - Subject to Final ReviewMR. FERGENSON: Yes. Your Honor, I think that, without Klaxon and with a reasonable choice of venue, Congress could establish a uniform system to bring -- to bring foreign defendants into this country.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you say the same thing if, hypothetically, since we're engaging in a hypothetical, the distributor were in France -- machine manufactured in England, distributor is in France, and the distributor then selects the United States and then the same facts, New Jersey? United States would be an appropriate jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause, but not New Jersey?MR. FERGENSON: I think that, with that onestep -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Assuming the statute that Justice Scalia hypothesizes.MR. FERGENSON: Yes, Your Honor. I think that, with that one step beyond -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a little odd that theStates, which have residual sovereignty, which are not15￼ - Subject to Final Review161 limited sovereigns, would not have jurisdiction, but the2 United States, which is a limited sovereignty other than3 in the foreign affairs area, which may be relevant here,4 does have jurisdiction. That seems backwards.5 MR. FERGENSON: Well, Your Honor, I think6 that if one looks at this as part of the Congress's7 power to control, let's say, imports, then as a8 condition -- and this is what the proposed Foreign9 Manufacturers Legal Accountability Act looks for.10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, Congress has power to11 control the jurisdiction of Federal courts, and Congress12 says Federal courts have jurisdiction over this matter.13 MR. FERGENSON: Yes, Your Honor.14 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fergenson, could I try15 another hypothetical?16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the question is why17 the State can't make the same choice that the Congress18 does. The State lacks foreign affairs power, to be19 sure. Is that the only distinction? That doesn't sound20 to me like due process. What we're talking about is a21 source of authority, not fairness to the defendant.22 MR. FERGENSON: Well, Your Honor, I think -­23 and I go to two words in particular in Burger King, one24 taken from Hanson, which is "essential": It is25 essential in each case that there be a purposeful ￼ - Subject to Final Review171 availment of the privilege of conducting activities2 within the forum. And then the other -­34 question is5 here you're6 States -- is purposeful availment. So let me -- let me7 just try a different hypothetical.8 Suppose you had the same arrangement with9 your distributor in Ohio, but the arrangement was not toJUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Fergenson, the whether seeking to serve a market -- and seeking to serve a market in each of the 5010 serve the entire United States market. Instead, the11 arrangement was to serve only five States in the12 Midwest. That's what you wanted, your client wanted,13 the market to be. So it was going to be Ohio and14 Indiana and Illinois and Michigan and Iowa, all right?15 So now a machine blows up in Illinois. Is there16 jurisdiction in Illinois?17 MR. FERGENSON: Yes, Your Honor.18 JUSTICE KAGAN: There is jurisdiction in19 Illinois, even though your relationship with your20 distributor was in Ohio. But there's jurisdiction in21 Illinois because the machine blew up there and you were22 seeking to serve the market; that's right?23 MR. FERGENSON: Because there was a24 direction of the distributor to go into the State where25 the accident occurred.￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314151617181920212223242518 JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. Now we have -- now wesay this is working very well. Let's get another nine distributors on board. We'll give each of them five States, all right? Now, if I understand you correctly, now you're liable all over the United States because you've had this relationship with 10 different distributors, each of whom are going to serve 5 States. So there's personal jurisdiction in any State where a machine blows up.MR. FERGENSON: If the -- yes, Your Honor, if the States are assigned by name.JUSTICE KAGAN: And now I say: Let's forget these 10 distributors. Who needs 10 distributors? I'll just have one distributor.Why is there any difference?MR. FERGENSON: Because that distributor -­ unless that distributor is told you must go -- like a traveling salesperson, you must go into each State, you must personally go into each State -- that's purposeful availment.JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fergenson, with respect, this distributor was told to sell as many products as it could in as many States as it could.MR. FERGENSON: No, it was not, Your Honor.It was not told to do anything more than to sell - Subject to Final Review￼ - Subject to Final Review191 products, not in as many -­2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me, counselor -­3 counselor, going back to -­4 MR.

Isn't -- doesn't the record show that the9 English company traveled to the trade shows with the10 American company? Wasn't your president, your English11 president, present at the Las Vegas show in which this12 New Jersey company first saw the machine? Is that13 correct?14 MR. FERGENSON: Yes.15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I know there's a -­16 MR. FERGENSON: Yes, Your Honor.17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. And you18 approved all marketing efforts. You had to approve -­19 according to the findings of the court below, you20 approved all the marketing materials that the American21 company -­22 MR. FERGENSON: No, Your Honor. There is a23 letter that's undated that speaks about we have24 advertised under your direction and per your25 suggestions.￼ - Subject to Final Review201 That letter also states that we've spent2 $350,000 and we performed the -- we performed repairs3 and warranty service without seeking reimbursement from4 you, and that's consistent with the distant relationship5 here.6 Your Honor, we asked for the names of the7 customers. We didn't get it. We didn't get -- we8 didn't drop-ship. And that would obviously have been a9 lot less expensive in cost rather than shipping it to10 Ohio. They were the market maker. They controlled the11 relationships with the individual customers.12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then why was your number13 and name both printed on the machine and in the warranty14 book? The American -- obviously, some customers had to15 be reaching out you to because all the materials they16 received directed them to the English company, not to17 the American company.18 MR.

And in international Shoe, the5 salespeople were controlled by International Shoe.6 JUSTICE BREYER: Right. Can I ask you -­7 MR. FERGENSON: Yes, Your Honor.8 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, first, the word9 "distributor" hurts you, so I'm going to take that out,10 and I imagine a hypothetical -- I know your case differs11 from that, but I'm going to ask them how it differs, not12 you, okay?13 Now, a person walks into a shop in either14 West Virginia or the country of India where they make15 pots. They're very nice pots made, actually, in West16 Virginia. And the potter makes several thousand a year,17 and this individual says: Mr. Potter, I want to sell18 your pots; send me a thousand each year. Where are you19 going to sell them? Everywhere. Great.20 Okay? That's it. Now, suppose that the law21 were, as it could be perhaps, that it is sufficient for22 jurisdiction throughout the United States that the23 distributor or independent buyer said good, I'm selling24 them everywhere I can. And two or three end up in New25 Mexico, but it doesn't matter where they end up.22￼ - Subject to Final Review231 Suppose that was sufficient to find jurisdiction.2 You've prepared for this case. I want to3 know in your opinion, if that were the rule -- that's4 all that's necessary -- what cases in this Court in your5 opinion would that conflict with? I mean, I'm thinking6 of the facts. I'm not thinking of statements of law or7 whatever, but you can bring those in, too. I want to8 write those down because I want to read those cases, and9 you know them better than me.1011 the -- that12 they're law13 -- which you apply to the facts, I believe that the14 rejection of the convenience test by this Court in15 World-Wide Volkswagen, Savchuk, and in Shaffer, where16 Justice Brennan posited that there be a convenience17 test, that those -­18 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know what a19 convenience test is. Assume I'm very ignorant, which20 isn't too far from the truth. I would like you to tell21 me, are there any cases which we would actually be22 conflicting with were we to say all that's necessary to23 assert jurisdiction in every State is that a buyer walks24 into a shop where the manufacturer of pots makes pots25 and tells the potter I'm going to sell everywhere I can,MR. FERGENSON: Your Honor, I believe that the principles of law as stated, because and they're applied in each case, it could￼ - Subject to Final Review1 and the potter says good, okay. Now --2 pots.3 Now, if that were the rule,4 case that that actually conflicts with?5 MR. FERGENSON: I believe that that6 conflicts, Your Honor, with Asahi.7 JUSTICE BREYER: Asahi, okay.8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Asahi -- Asahi,9 Mr. Fergenson, was a litigation between a Japanese10 component part manufacturer and a Taiwanese finished11 product manufacturer. What -- how in the world could12 you compare that case, which really has nothing at all13 to do with the United States? It's -- it's a Japanese14 valve manufacturer sells the valve to a tire maker in15 Taiwan, and there should be -- that suit should go16 forward in the United States?17 I can see it going forward in -- in Japan,18 but it has no connection with the United States. And19 how can you possibly compare that with this case where20 somebody was injured by a machine that malfunctions,21 allegedly?22 There was something very interesting you23 said in your brief. And you said the U.K., which you -­24 you say -- now you've added Ohio, but you said U.K.25 would be the place for Mr. Nicastro to go. It provides and he buys the can you find a24￼ - Subject to Final Review1 a trusted legal system.2 What would be your answer if the3 manufacturer, same arrangement with a distributor, sell4 anyplace in the United States you can, is from China?5 Would you give the same answer?6 MR. FERGENSON: Your Honor, I would have to7 look at -- and -- and the answer would not be, off the8 cuff, the same. It would not be flatly the same.9 There's been a recent decision by Judge Chasanow on10 melamine in which Chasanow applied the availability law11 that this Court has set forth in Piper and Gulf Oil12 and -- and the other cases that follow, and determined13 that China was an available forum for the plaintiffs14 suing for the harm to their children from tainted milk.15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- you made a point16 about the trusted legal system. Well, let's say it was17 Russia, Mexico -- you may pick any one. The machine is18 manufactured in one of those countries where it's not so19 certain that there's a trusted legal system.20 MR. FERGENSON: That's correct, Your Honor.21 And so under Piper, Gulf Oil -- and I can't remember the22 name of the other case that Judge Chasanow relied23 upon -- they are difficult cases, and the ability of the24 court to determine whether the other forum is available25 is quite cabined.

ROSS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"All we wish to do is sell our products in the States and get paid." That's what the British manufacturer said.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if he said we want to do that, but we don't like New Jersey, so don't sell our products in New Jersey, and the Ohio company nonetheless does so? Can you get them -- can you hale them into court in New Jersey?MR. ROSS: I would say under those circumstances, yes, because the purpose that -- this particular manufacturer purposefully availed themselves of the entire U.S. market.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But he said: But Ihave no intention of selling in New Jersey; I'm afraid Imight get sued there, and I don't want to get sued - Subject to Final Review26￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314151617181920212223242527there.

I think we'd meet all those examples under the circumstances of this case.JUSTICE SCALIA: What if a manufacturer tells a distributor: You have internationaldistribution authority; you can sell my machine anywhere in the world, sell as many as you can anywhere in the world -- that would include the United States, right?MR.

ROSS: Correct.JUSTICE BREYER: What I have written down inthree of the it as, toa firm17 cooperative in southern India or whether it's the18 biggest company in the world, okay? That's the first19 thing.20 The second thing is that an executive of21 that company went to seven trade shows in the United22 States.23 And the third thing is that two, three, or24 four machines ended up in New Jersey.25 Now, is there anything other than that? And 10 potter. One thing that happened, we have to take11 I think, an independent company, whether you want12 call them a distributor or not. I didn't see a13 difference there.

ROSS: You do, Your Honor.5 JUSTICE BREYER: I do. Now, then my6 question following from that, if I have those are the7 three facts, what worries me is the exact opposite of8 what the New -- the New Jersey Supreme Court said. It9 said in worldwide markets this is a good thing. I think10 I worry about it, because I'm worried about the woman's11 cooperative in India, I'm worried about the Chinese12 development, I'm worried about development everywhere.13 We have a lot of small businesses. And I'd worry -­14 now, maybe the worry is legally irrelevant -- but I'd15 worry about a rule of law that subjects every small16 business in every developing company -- in every17 developing country to have to be aware of the law in 5018 States simply because they agreed to sell to an￼19 independent company who is going to sell to America,20 plus your two factors.21 And really the third is none, because if it22 hadn't ended up somewhere, there'd have been no23 accident.24 25MR. ROSS: I would say -­JUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's my basic - Subject to Final Review1 concern here.2 MR. ROSS: I would say in -- in response to3 your hypothetical question, that because there was4 purposeful availment where they came to the United5 States, attended trade shows in an effort to sell their6 product to anyone who would come to that trade show7 throughout the United States, and those sales were in8 fact consummated, then in that case I think that the9 manufacturer has done more than just intend to sell.10 They have taken certain positive steps.11 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Okay, but you see12 what my -- my problem is a sort of policy problem that13 may be irrelevant, but I -- I don't see how the world's14 going to work or develop if in fact every small business15 everywhere in the world has to know, you know, the law16 of every 50 States and hire lawyers and come here,17 rather than making the accident victim go there.18 Now, it's tough on the accident victim, but19 the other is also tough.

That's the way I'd like to -­JUSTICE KAGAN: And, Mr. Fergenson, isn'tthat what Justice O'Connor said in Asahi, that thecomponent manufacturer may have all the knowledge in the - Subject to Final Review49￼ - Subject to Final Review501 world -- for Justice Brennan, that was enough; for2 Justice O'Connor, it was not enough, that knowledge was3 insufficient, that there had to be purposeful availment,4 that there had to be an active decision, a choice to5 seek the market. And -- and I understand that, on your6 view, McIntyre made that choice.7 MR. ROSS: Exactly.8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How can there not -­9 how can there possibly not be purposeful availment if10 the manufacturer of the 25-inch blade knows it's only11 going to be used in McIntyre's machine and it knows that12 McIntyre is trying to sell its machine in the United13 States?14 MR. ROSS: Because the manufacturer of that15 blade did not specifically target the United States16 market. He -­￼1718 product that is only going to be -- that he knows is19 going to be sold in the United States.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He put it in a2021 designed for them. And that -- that machine is not22 specifically designed for the U.S. market. That23 machine -­24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have a25 partnership. One of the partners makes the shell of the MR. ROSS: But it's not specifically - Subject to Final Review511 machine; the other partner makes the insides of the2 machine. Are they, as individual companies -- are they3 availing themselves of the United States market?4 MR. ROSS: Now, under those circumstances, I5 would think there would be a difference. I think there6 would be a difference because they are combined in7 joining to market into the United States. But if this8 is a -- a manufacturer of blades in Birmingham, England,9 and the manufacturer of blades in Birmingham, England,10 sends it to Nottingham, England, and then something11 happens in New Jersey, and all the facts are the same, I12 would say Birmingham is off the hook.13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose the company in14 Nottingham only sells to the United States. It's the15 only place its machines are -- are marketed.16 MR. ROSS: That would be different then.17 Then there -- there is more than that. There -­18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Then the component19 manufacturer would be liable in New Jersey?20 MR. ROSS: Because he is basically21 piggybacking on the actions of the manufacturer.22 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. What about23 today, is there any difference between the trade show -­24 and he did show up at seven trade shows. I -- I mean,25 the manufacturer here had a representative at several ￼ - Subject to Final Review521 trade shows, you're right.2 MR. ROSS: Twenty-six.3 JUSTICE BREYER: That's right. Twenty -­4 no, well, the record said seven.5 MR. ROSS: There were 26 trade shows.6 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that in the record?7 MR. ROSS: Yes, it is. Joint Appendix 1148 to 117a.9 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. All right. Is there10 a difference between that, do you think, and -- I just11 read in the paper the other day there's some Ethiopian12 or some foreign country -- it's a very poor country -­13 and they're selling goats, and they're sending some to14 the United States for some kind of festival purpose or15 something. Now, he said I have a site on the Internet.16 All right.17 Now, all of these people, however small, I18 mean, many, many will have Internet sites, and some of19 them might have an Internet site that's accessed by20 American buyers, as this man did.21 MR. ROSS: Right.22 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Is there any23 difference between that and your trade shows?24 MR. ROSS: And if the goat poisons someone25 in the United States and the -- and the person who ￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425raised the goat -­JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.MR.

ROSS: I think if there's purposefulavailment and if the Internet is being used to marketspecifically into the United States and the product - Subject to Final Review53￼ - Subject to Final Review541 causes harm to someone in the United States -­2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there -- there are3 some cases just beginning -- at the beginning stages,4 aren't there, involving sales through the Internet?5 MR. ROSS: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. I believe6 that those cases say if there's an interactive Web site;7 in other words, if the person sitting in the United8 States can press several buttons on its computer and9 interact and make -- consummate the transaction, if you10 will, with the foreign manufacturer, then under those11 circumstances, I believe, the trend of the cases seems12 to be that there would be jurisdiction.13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but you were cut14 off before you finished your answer. I want to make15 sure I understood it. I -- I make the inference that16 you -- you would say that if there is an advertisement,17 not a sale, just an advertisement on the Internet,18 replacing the trade show, that that is a significant19 availment -- a purposeful availment, and there can be20 jurisdiction in New Jersey. Same factors here -­21 somebody who doesn't go to the U.S. trade shows, but he22 does put it on the Internet, the same result?23 MR. ROSS: That was one of the four examples24 that Justice O'Connor gave us in Asahi, advertising25 for --￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE KENNEDY: I want to know what yourposition is. - Subject to Final ReviewMR. ROSS: Yes. My position is yes, because they are -- they are attempting to sell into the United States with advertising. But the trend of the decisions has been that it has to be an interactive Web site.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can -- maybe everybody knows this except me. Do you -- are Web sites targeted to the United States? Don't you -- you can -­ let's say they put it on their Web site in England. Can't you -- can't -- can't I access that from here?MR. ROSS: Yes, you can.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So they don't even have to send the Web site to the United States? They just have to have a Web site?MR. ROSS: If it's an interactive Web site where you can sit in New Jersey, order a product, the product is then delivered by the foreign manufacturer into New Jersey, and the product then chops off four fingers of someone's hand -­55￼interactive?CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it has to beMR. ROSS: Yes, Your Honor.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it's just -- whatif it says, here, we're McIntyre -- on a Web site -- we1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425make these machines; give us a call at this number if you want to buy one?MR. ROSS: Not enough.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not enough?MR. ROSS: That's like a billboard. That'snot enough. That's just a pure advertising; not enough. But if the additional steps that I just mentioned are taken and a sale occurs -­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And this distinction is somewhere in the Due Process Clause?MR. ROSS: I believe that the Due Process Clause requires the additional conduct. The purposeful availment, which is what we have in your hypothetical, and the actual transaction, the sale, then we have jurisdiction.JUSTICE KENNEDY: But was the sale here negotiated in -- or part of the sale negotiated in Nevada or the person just -- the New Jersey manufacturer just was interested in the machine and then later contacted the Ohio distributor?MR. ROSS: In this case, the manufacturer said that they own the machines until they're paid for in full. The machine was not paid for in full.JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, I'm -- I'm trying torelate what happened here to the Internet hypothetical. - Subject to Final Review56￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425I have the -­MR. ROSS: Right.JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- Internet hypothetical where there's just an advertisement.MR. ROSS: Right.JUSTICE KENNEDY: And, at first, I thought you were saying that's sufficient. Now you say no, because they have to be part of the contract. I'm trying to make the Internet equivalent to the trade show.MR. ROSS: If the Internet Web site is interactive, so you can sit in New Jersey, order the product, complete the transaction, send money, and in response to the money coming, you get a product -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay. But not just an advertisement?MR. ROSS: Not just an advertisement.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Even though that's the cause for the buyer's interest in it and he pursues -­ pursues his -- his transaction after finding out all the information on the Internet, but he phones the Ohio distributor?MR. ROSS: It's not enough, in my judgment,if -- under the Internet example that you just gave. Ifthere's an interactive Web site where the person in New - Subject to Final Review57￼ - Subject to Final Review581 Jersey can press buttons on his computer and complete2 the transaction with the result that the product comes3 to New Jersey, under those circumstances, I would say4 there is jurisdiction.56 to complete 7891011 these numbers, and we will send you an application for a12 machine? Is that not enough, because he's got to13 complete the transaction?14 MR. ROSS: I would say, under those15 circumstances, that that's part of what the manufacturer16 requires, but the end result is that the machine winds17 up in New Jersey through this contact between the person18 and the manufacturer. Then I would say that would be19 enough for jurisdiction.20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that if they say21 fill this out, and contact this person, McIntyre,22 whatever, in Ohio, that's where you can get one of our23 machines -- that's enough?24 MR. ROSS: I would say, in that case, they25 have deliberately targeted the entire United States CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Complete? He's got the transaction?MR.

Justice Breyer, I would -- in response toyour concern, I would ask you to look at page 29 of the States' amicus brief: "Ignorance of the fact that New Jersey is a State within our union, or of the specifics of New Jersey products liability law, should not allow Petitioner to avoid jurisdiction.

FERGENSON: And the New Jersey Supreme14 Court said that there was a suggestion that some trades15 could have been by consignment. I believe that that is16 outside of this -- taken out of this case by an17 admission in the brief -- at least for this sale -- in18 the brief in opposition to defendant's motion to19 dismiss, at 19-20, filed October 11th, 2006, where they20 state -- where Respondent states it was sold by us to21 MMA, and it 2223 consignment 24was sold by MMA to Curcio Scrap Metal.So, there is no consignment. There's no under 9-102, which Ohio has adopted. JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's a different25 question than I asked. There was no consignment on this  - Subject to Final Review611 machine?2 MR. FERGENSON: Yes.3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you're not claiming4 that there might not be on others?5 MR. FERGENSON: The evidence in the record6 under 9-102, which Ohio has adopted, I think can only be7 reasonably viewed -- and this Court obviously treats it8 as de novo, on a jurisdictional review -- can only be9 viewed as not a consignment because MMA was in the10 business of selling the products to others.11 Let me say that for the -- there was no12 interaction in the record with anyone from New Jersey by13 MMA or by J. McIntyre. It was the booth, and then there14 was an order. And if you look at the invoice, it says15 verbal order. There was an order by the son of the16 owner of Curcio Metal Works, and that's it. The order17 was fulfilled.18 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fergenson, Toyota,19 Honda, Volkswagen -- pick your car company -- sells many20 millions of cars to the United States. They start21 blowing up here. They operate through independent22 distributors only. Can they be subject to jurisdiction23 in any of the States?24 MR.
