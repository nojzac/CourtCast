Samuel Francis Patane.Mr. Dreeben.ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBENON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:Before this Court's decision in Dickerson v.United States in the year 2000, it was the uniform rule in the lower Federal courts that the failure to issue Miranda warnings meant that the unwarned statement was not admissible in the Government's case, but that there was no requirement to suppress physical evidence that was derived from those unwarned statements.Following this Court's decision in Dickerson, which affirmed that Miranda has constitutional stature, the majority of the Federal courts of appeals to address the issue continued to adhere to the pre-Dickerson rule that physical fruits of an unwarned statement were admissible.In this case, the Tenth Circuit broke ranks with that uniform body of authority and held that, as a result3, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 of Dickerson's ruling that Miranda has constitutional2 stature, there is a derivative fruits suppression3 component to the Miranda rule. That holding should be4 reversed.5 Miranda stands as a rule that implements the6 Fifth Amendment, not by requiring the compulsion that the7 Amendment literally speaks of, but by providing an extra8 level of protection for the core of the Fifth Amendment9 right, the right for the defendant's own statements that10 are incriminating not to be used against him in a criminal11 trial.12 QUESTION: Is it a Fifth Amendment right or not a13 Fifth Amendment right?14 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, as I understand it,15 it is a right that implements the Fifth Amendment's16 protection.17 QUESTION: It - it has to be based on something18 in the Constitution or we would have had to respect the19 statute enacted by Congress in Dickerson. So it is -20 there is obviously some provision of the Constitution that21 enabled us to disregard that statute. What - what22 provision is that?23 MR. DREEBEN: The Fifth Amendment. What the -24 QUESTION: All right. It's a Fifth Amendment25 right then.4, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. DREEBEN: What the Court concluded in Miranda2 and then reaffirmed in Dickerson is that the traditional3 totality of the circumstances test for ascertaining4 whether a statement is voluntary or has been compelled by5 the Government is not adequate when the statements are6 taken in the inherently pressuring environment of7 custodial interrogation. And to provide an extra layer of8 protection to avoid the violation of the defendant's Fifth9 Amendment rights, the Court adopted a prophylactic10 warnings and wavier procedure.11 QUESTION: Whether it's prophylactic or not, it12 is a constitutional right, is it not? It is a13 constitutional right.14 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, it is a15 constitutional right that is distinct from the right not16 to have one's compelled statements used against oneself.￼1718 not to be 192021 of the coerced confession at trial, but we don't22 distinguish between the two, do we?23 MR. DREEBEN: Oh, I think you do, Justice Scalia.24 That is a violation of the core due process right not to25 have substantive violations of one's liberty interests.QUESTION: Well, so is the constitutional right pistol-whipped in order to - to confess.MR. DREEBEN: Well -QUESTION: That's distinct from the introduction5, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 What we're talking about in this case is not a substantive2 violation of the defendant's rights, but a procedural3 violation of the Fifth Amendment that this Court has4 defined in Miranda, but has defined it in a way that is5 highly distinct from the basic, textually-mandated rule of6 the Fifth Amendment that compelled statements may not be7 used.8 QUESTION: Let me - let me take out the pistol-9 whipping. It - it - it is a coerced statement because of10 the application of mental coercion. Now, that is not a11 violation of the Fifth Amendment, I suppose, until the12 product of the - of the coercion is introduced at trial.13 Will you say the same thing?14 MR. DREEBEN: I would - I'm not sure, Justice15 Scalia, that your question addresses what Miranda16 addressed. What Miranda addressed was a situation in17 which it was extremely difficult for the courts to sort18 out whether a statement was coerced or not coerced, and to19 avoid the risk that an actually coerced statement would be20 used in evidence against the defendant, thus violating the21 core Fifth Amendment right. The Miranda Court, as this22 Court has later explained, adopted a presumption, a23 presumption for a limited purpose. In the government -24 QUESTION: May - may I ask a - a modified version25 of Justice Scalia's question? Supposing that the6, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Government used official powers, such as a grand jury2 subpoena or a congressional committee subpoena, to - to3 get a confession out of a person under threat of contempt4 of court, so it was clearly just a Fifth Amendment was a -5 he made an answer that revealed the existence of the gun6 andthenhe-wouldthatbea-wouldthegunbe7 admissible or un - inadmissible in that scenario?8 MR. DREEBEN: If your hypothetical, Justice9 Stevens, presupposes an assertion of the Fifth Amendment10 right and actual compulsion of the -11 QUESTION: The threat of contempt, yeah.12 MR. DREEBEN: - information, presumably under a13 grant of immunity, then the gun would not be admissible,14 because this Court has defined a violation of the Fifth15 Amendment that involves actual compulsion as entailing two16 different evidentiary consequences. One evidentiary17 consequence is that the statements themselves may not be18 used. The other evidentiary consequence is that nothing19 derived from the statements may be used. But the critical20 feature of that hypothetical and its distinction from21 Miranda, is it involves actual compulsion. Miranda -22 QUESTION: Mr. Dreeben - Mr. - Miranda itself23 said, but unless and until such warnings and waivers are24 demonstrated by the prosecution at trial, no evidence25 obtained as a result of interrogation can be used against7, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 him, no evidence as a result of interrogation. That2 sounds like a - a - a derivative evidence rule to me.34 there are5 stood the6 they extended the implications of Miranda far beyond where7 this Court has gone. And let me be precise about this.8 The rule, at the time of Miranda and today, is that if9 there is actual compulsion, the Government may not makeMR. DREEBEN: It does, Justice Ginsburg, and many things in the Miranda opinion that have not test of later litigation in this Court, because10 use of the actual statements that are taken or their11 evidentiary fruits. The Government may also not use that12 statement13 exception1415 actual compulsion if it's a situation where the police16 knowingly engage in conversation hoping to pick upfor impeachment, and there is no public safety that could -QUESTION: Well, how are we going to determine￼17 information without giving the Miranda warnings, and then18 the minute they start hearing something useful, give the19 warnings, but then rely on what they learned earlier to20 further that information gathering. How - how do we parse21 that out?22 MR. DREEBEN: Justice O'Connor, the determination23 of whether the statements reflect voluntariness at the24 outset and then a knowing and - and intelligent waiver of25 Miranda warnings later on after they are given needs to be8, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 determined based on the totality of the circumstances.2 But this Court has recognized, in allowing the3 use of unwarned statements for impeachment and in adopting4 the public safety exception, and in permitting a second5 warned statement, as the Court did in Oregon v. Elstad, to6 be admitted into evidence, notwithstanding an earlier7 unwarned statement, that there is a difference between the8 Miranda presumption and a finding of actual compulsion.9 QUESTION: May I ask you - you mentioned the10 public safety exception. We wouldn't - we really don't11 need a public safety exception if you're correct in this12 case, do we?13 MR. DREEBEN: No, we still do, because the14 crucial thing about Miranda that is not challenged here is15 that a failure to issue Miranda warnings, followed by16 custodial interrogation, means that the unwarned statement17 is inadmissible in the Government's case in chief. That18 is the core ruling of Miranda.19 QUESTION: But the core ruling of the public20 safety exception, as I remember it, is that you can use21 the gun.22 MR. DREEBEN: No, the core ruling of the public23 safety exception is that you can use the statement. The24 Court held, in New York v. Quarles, that when pressing25 public safety needs justify the conduct of custodial9, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 interrogation without prior issuance of Miranda warnings,2 that situation falls outside of the Miranda paradigm, and3 the statements themselves can be used.4 Now, Justice O'Connor's dissenting opinion5 argued that there should be no exception for public safety6 for the statements themselves, but the gun, as derivative7 evidence,8 of actual9 aimed.10 1112 accepting13 functional difference in a case like this between14 admitting the statement, the admission that he had the gun15 on the shelf in the bedroom, and admitting the gun. So16 that, in functional terms, the - the Miranda protection,17 even as you describe it, disappears on your theory.18 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Souter, if - if I accept19 that that accurately describes this case, it does not20 accurately describe the large class of cases in which21 physical evidence is discovered as a result of unwarned22 statements. In many -23 QUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, doesn't it occur - cover24 quite a wide number of cases? This was a case where the -25 the crime that the police were after were - was gun10, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005should come in, because it was not the product compulsion at which the Fifth Amendment isQUESTION: Mr. -QUESTION: The - the difficulty that I havethat as the final answer is that there isn't any￼1 possession. It might be narcotics possession, it might be2 stolen goods. And in all those situations, are you saying3 that the constitutional rule is that a police chief can4 say to his officers, go in and get him to tell you where5 the narcotics are, where the gun is, where the stolen6 goods are? We don't worry about his statement, but we7 want the goods.8 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, that is my9 position, but I don't think it would be a prudent policy10 for law enforcement to adopt. This case may be one in11 which the Government can prove knowing possession of a12 firearm by the defendant even without the benefit of his13 statements, but police officers are not going to be able14 to predict in advance that that is going to be true in the15 vast majority of cases. What they are going to know is16 that if you have a statement that links the defendant to17 the gun, that allows you to show knowing possession. In18 the absence of that, having the physical evidence alone19 will not necessarily guarantee a conviction.20 QUESTION: You don't think the gun on the shelf21 in the guy's bedroom is going to be sufficient to prove22 knowing possession?￼2324 Souter. 25MR. DREEBEN: Oh, I do in this case, JusticeQUESTION: You know what's in your bedroom.11, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 MR. DREEBEN: I think that the Court should2 decide this case not based on the particularities of this3 factual scenario, but on the class of cases in which4 physical evidence is at issue, and should regard the5 question of what incentives the police may have as6 informed by the totality of cases that may arise.7 Police officers who decide to conduct custodial8 interrogation without giving Miranda warnings know that9 they will not be able to use the statements that the10 defendant makes in the Government's case in chief, and11 they have no way of knowing before they conduct custodial12 interrogation what the defendant may say. If the13 defendant offers up information that is incriminating on14 unanticipated crimes or provides leads to information that15 the police haven't previously anticipated, then the police16 officers run two risks.17 The first is that they won't be able to use18 those statements against the defendant in the case in19 chief. The second is that by failing to issue Miranda20 warnings, they increase the likelihood that a later court21 reviewing the facts will conclude that this is not a case22 of a mere failure to give Miranda warnings, but is a case23 involving actual compulsion. And if a court concludes24 that the statements are actually compelled, involuntary -25 QUESTION: Well, Mr. Dreeben, supposing that the12, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 police decide that they're going to follow this strategy2 that is perhaps suggested by Justice Ginsburg. Would that3 itself be evidence of compulsion? In other words, they4 won't give Miranda warnings and see - see what the person5 says, then they give them. Would that be evidence of6 compulsion?7 MR. DREEBEN: It would be evidence that a8 defendant could argue is relevant, but I don't think that9 it would be evidence of compulsion. What's relevant in10 the compulsion analysis is what the police officers11 actually say and do and communicate to the suspect. Their12 uncommunicated intent or law enforcement policies would13 not add up to compulsion by itself.1415 - and say16 would you1718 should still do as it has done in other contexts, balance19 the costs of a Miranda suppression remedy against whatever20 incremental benefits there may have.21 QUESTION: What's your -22 QUESTION: And why - why is this different than23 the rule under the Fourth Amendment, say Wong Sun?24 MR. DREEBEN: What the Court has done in the25 Fourth Amendment context is deal with an actual violation13, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005QUESTION: If we were to reject your position and that this is purely a constitutional violation, then lose the case?MR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Kennedy. The Court￼1 of the Fourth Amendment and establish very exclusion -2 various exclusionary rules that are designed to deter that3 kind of police conduct. The Miranda rule is very4 different, because even if the Court holds that Miranda5 prescribes a rule of substantive conduct for the police,6 which we submit it does not, even if the Court were to7 hold that, it still is a rule that merely presumes8 compulsion. It doesn't constitute a finding of actual9 compulsion.10 QUESTION: Well, we said last year in Chavez that11 the Miranda - that the Constitution was not violated by12 failure to give Miranda warnings until they were offered13 in evidence, didn't we?1415 Justice.16 Amendment1718 take that 1920 wasn't it?21 QUESTION:22 taking all the opinions together. There were six votes23 for that.24 MR. DREEBEN: I think this Court will be better25 able than I am to say what Chavez held.14, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MR. DREEBEN: That - that is correct, Mr. Chief But what the Court has done under the Fifth-QUESTION:￼position? QUESTION:That was the trial court's opinion,Is it correct, was there a majority toThat - that - I believe to - you're1 (Laughter.)2 MR. DREEBEN: But the - the reason that that3 principle alone does not decide this case is that the4 Court has, in instances of actual compulsion out of court,5 applied a derivative evidence suppression rule. That's6 the rule that the Court adopted in Counselman v.7 Hitchcock, and it's followed it in its immunity line of8 cases where it has held that to displace the Fifth9 Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination, you10 need to suppress both the statement and the fruits.QUESTION: Is part of your - is - is part of your that in the Fourth Amendment violation case,is the - really the best available, most direct1112 reasoning13 exclusion14 remedy? And in - and in this case, there are other15 remedies, number one, excluding the statement, so that16 when you - when you find tangible evidence, it's - it's17 just a - an ancillary and less necessary remedy. Is that￼18 the whole 192021-MR. DREEBEN: That - that's -QUESTION: - thrust of the argument.MR. DREEBEN: That's the core of it, Justice What the Court did in Miranda was create a rule22 Kennedy.23 that operates in the very heart of the Fifth Amendment by24 creating a prophylactic buffer zone against the risk, not25 the certainty, but the risk, that actual compulsion has15, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 been exacted. It is that risk that the Fifth Amendment2 targets as the core concern.3 QUESTION: What's the theory of the compulsion?4 That is, what - why, assuming that there's compulsion but5 there hasn't been an introduction of the statement that6 was compelled into evidence. Under that - and suppose7 that the compulsion doesn't rise to the level of the due8 process violation. I mean, I - maybe - maybe they all do,9 but - but if they don't, then what's the theory of keeping10 out the evidence derived from that sort of compulsion.11 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, as the Court12 explained it in its immunity line of cases, the starting13 point of analysis is that a defendant under the Fifth14 Amendment can claim his privilege against testifying based15 not only on incrimination from the statements that he16 makes, but also that evidence that the Government can17 obtain as a result of the statements is incriminating.18 If his testimony is a link in a chain of19 incrimination, he can stand silent, and the Court reasoned20 from that that the Government should not be able to21 circumvent that right of the defendant not to be a witness22 against his - himself, by calling him out of court,23 compelling testimony over his objection that - based on24 the Fifth Amendment, and then obtaining the very25 incriminating information that the privilege shielded him16, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 from having to provide.2 QUESTION: So why doesn't all that apply here? I3 mean, is - is that - I can understand it if they compel4 the testimony, then you introduce it. Then - then you5 have the completed violation of what the Fifth Amendment6 forbids, all right, the completed violation. I can7 understand it if you compel the person to the extent that8 it violates the Due Process Clause, beating him up9 severely, whatever.10 Now, I don't understand why, if you have neither11 of those two things, you would keep the evidence that's12 the fruits out, under some theory that doesn't also say13 you should keep this out.14 MR. DREEBEN: Well, the - the distinction between15 this situation and the true compulsion situation is,16 Miranda does not involve an actual finding of compulsion,17 and the Court has been very frank about this. As a18 result, the Court has repeatedly drawn distinctions19 between the use of unwarned statements and the use of20 actually compelled statements. Actually compelled21 statements may not be used to impeach a defendant's trial22 testimony. That too would violate the Fifth Amendment23 right.24 But the Court held in - in the Hass case and in25 the Harris case that statements that are merely unwarned,17, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 but not compelled, can be used for impeachment. The Court2 similarly held in Michigan v. Tucker and then again3 Oregon v. Elstad that statements that are unwarned,4 not compelled, can be used as leads to find another5 witness' testimony, or to obtain a second statement6 the defendant himself. And if -in butfrom7 QUESTION: So is this distinction that the8 - that one case is just more egregious, more an affront to9 the Constitution, more dangerous, i.e., physical10 compulsion as opposed to the compulsion that's just11 presumed from Miranda?12 MR. DREEBEN:13 a literal violation of14 involves a presumption15 QUESTION: Well, then - then you're back into16 metaphysics.One case, Justice Kennedy, involves the Fifth Amendment. Mirandathat this Court -- that￼17 MR. DREEBEN: It is a little metaphysical,18 Justice Kennedy, but there's a - a pot of truth, I think,19 a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow here, which is20 that the Miranda presumption does not mean, this Court has21 held, that a statement is actually compelled. It protects22 against the most crucial right contained in the Fifth23 Amendment itself, which is -24 QUESTION: But you don't think we should25 differentiate based on the gravity of the - of the wrong18, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 in either case?2 MR. DREEBEN: You could look at it that - that3 way, Justice Kennedy. What - what the Court has done when4 it's dealt with a - a failure to issue warnings, is5 balance. It has recognized that, by providing a rule that6 presumes compulsion in lieu of proving it, the Court has7 taken a step beyond the core of the constitutional right8 itself, and the Court's language in its previous cases of9 calling Miranda warnings and the exclusionary rule under10 Miranda a prophylactic right is understandable in that11 sense. Miranda excludes some statements that are not12 compelled under the Fifth Amendment.13 QUESTION: May - may I ask this question, Mr.14 Dreeben? The - there's a distinction in - in your - you15 submit, between a presumption of involuntariness and16 actual involuntariness. Do you know any other area of the17 law in which we've differentiated between a presumed18 result and an actual result?19 MR. DREEBEN: I - I - I don't want to go off into20 an excursion into rules of law that might occur to me as I21 stand here, Justice Stevens. But what I do know is that22 the Court's own Miranda jurisprudence -￼2324 there's -25 say. ButQUESTION: My understand - you're - you're - there's a lot in the case that support what you I'm suggesting it is kind of a unique19, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 development of the law, because normally I would think if2 you presume X from Y, that would be the same as proving X.3 MR. DREEBEN: It -4 QUESTION: But you say that's new - that's not5 true in this line of - this area of the law?6 MR. DREEBEN: There is language in the Miranda7 opinion, as Justice Ginsburg has mentioned, that would8 support the view that the original vision of Miranda was9 that it would constitute compulsion -10 QUESTION: Right.11 MR. DREEBEN: - not merely presume it. But as12 the Court developed the rule and considered what the costs13 and benefits would be of having a rule that merely14 presumed compulsion, any context in which it was not15 necessarily true. The Miranda Court itself recognized16 that not all statements taken in custodial interrogation17 without warnings are compelled. Once you are dealing with18 a prophylactic rule, it's incumbent upon the Court to19 balance the benefits against the burdens of the rule.20 QUESTION: Of course, one of the benefits of -21 under the Miranda analysis, we will - we avoid the22 necessity of resolving difficult issues of fact sometimes.23 There are a lot of borderline cases to whether there24 really was compulsion or it's just presumed. We'll have25 to get back into that, under your view.20, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I think the Court has put2 itself back into it by adopting the holdings that permit3 statements that are not warned to be used for impeachment4 and to be 56 disregard 78 Court hasused to obtain leads for other witnesses. QUESTION: Well, I guess we tell juries they can presumptions, but they can't disregard facts. MR. DREEBEN: And I think that that's what the really decided is the right approach when you9 are outside the core concern that the Miranda Court was10 addressing, namely the use of the unwarned statement11 itself. There is a terrible cost to the truth-seeking12 function of a criminal trial to suppress reliable,13 physical evidence that was obtained not as the result of a14 core constitutional violation involving literal compulsion15 or a substantive due process violation, but merely a16 failure to issue warnings.17 QUESTION: It's a terrible cost, but it's a18 terrible cost for which the law provides a ready means of19 avoidance. I mean, Miranda's been around for a long time.20 There is - there's no excuse at this point in our history21 for the police to say, gee, I - I don't quite understand22 what Miranda is getting at. And - and that's why it seems23 to me the cost argument is a weak one -24 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I -25 QUESTION: - and is a - let me just finish this21, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 sentence. And as against that weak argument, there seems2 to me a fairly strong argument that if you accept your3 position, there is a, in - in effect, a recipe for4 disregarding Miranda, because in every physical evidence5 case, as in Justice Ginsburg's examples, there's going to6 be an inducement to say, never mind the statement, just7 get the evidence, the evidence will take care of the case.8 So I - it - it - it's seems to me that we got a9 weak argument on one side and a strong argument on the10 other side.11 MR. DREEBEN: Well, there - I - the argument12 based on cost, Justice Souter, is - is not weak, because13 the costs are quite real. The jury does not hear the14 evidence that's suppressed -15 QUESTION: The costs are quite real, but the16 state knows how to avoid having to pay those costs. It17 gives the warning.18 MR. DREEBEN: This Court has repeatedly19 recognized though that there are situations in which there20 are ambiguities in the way that Miranda actually applies,￼21 and law22 the way2324 police,25 to giveenforcement officers are going to make mistakes in that they apply Miranda.QUESTION: I thought the main rule was, thewhen they take someone into custody, are supposed them four warnings, and that seems to me a simple,22, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 clear rule. Now you - you're shifting this to say, well,2 they don't have to give the warnings up front, that's3 okay.4 MR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. Our5 position is that if they don't give the warnings up front,6 they lose the statement that is taken without warnings.7 That is the Miranda rule, and it responds to the core8 concern that Miranda had.9 The question is, how much further should that10 rule go? And, as I think I answered Justice Souter and11 yourself earlier, police officers do not know before they12 get hold of evidence whether they are going to be able to13 link it to the defendant with other admissible evidence14 and prove the violation at trial. They are much better15 off following the Miranda script, getting the admissible16 evidence of - of the defendant's own statements, and using17 it to tie the defendant to the evidence.

You avoid difficult voluntariness inquiries, you smooth the path to admissibility of the evidence, you ensure that the warned statements are admissible.QUESTION: No, I - I'm - I'm sure that that is the FBI policy, but it - the point is, there is a substantial, apparently a substantial body of thought outside the FBI within American law enforcement that dice- rolling pays off.MR.

WICHLENSON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMS. WICHLENS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court:I'd like to begin by responding to theGovernment's argument that Miranda warnings are not a requirement, they may be simply a matter of proving policy, but are not a requirement. Just three terms ago, this Court reaffirmed in Dickerson that - and I'm quoting from Dickerson - Miranda requires procedures that will warn a suspect in custody of his right to remain silent, which will assure the suspect that the exercise of that right will be honored.QUESTION: Yeah, but I think, Ms. Wichlens, if you read through the entire opinion in Dickerson, it's clear that the warnings are required in order to make the statements admissible. They don't say that mere failure to give the warnings without seeking to follow up with admission is a constitutional violation.MS. WICHLENS: That's correct, Your Honor, but in this case they are seeking to admit the evidence. So if there are two components to a Miranda violation, one being the violation in the field by the police officer, the second component is admitting the evidence at trial, and25, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 that is exactly what the Government is attempting -2 QUESTION: Well, is - isn't this a fruits case?3 MS. WICHLENS: It is a fruits case, Your Honor.4 QUESTION: It's not the statement.5 MS. WICHLENS: Correct.6 QUESTION: It is - it is derivatively obtained7 information.89 10 11 12MS. WICHLENS: Absolutely, absolutely. QUESTION: Which might make a difference to you. MS. WICHLENS: It could make a difference, and - QUESTION: At least I've thought so.MS. WICHLENS: Absolutely, Your Honor, andup on a question asked by Justice Kennedy,13 following14 whether, if this is a constitutional violation, the15 derivative evidence rule, the fruits rule, would apply.16 And my answer to that is yes, absolutely, under Wong Sun.17 If this is a constitutional violation, it would apply in18 Chavez, just -19 QUESTION: Well, what - what's the magic about20 that metaphysical rule when we're talking about a21 different amendment and a different kind of statement or a22 different kind of - a different kind of evidence than is23 in the - than the rule itself was designed for primarily?24 I mean, I don't know why we're just bound by that25 metaphysical rule.￼26, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 MS. WICHLENS: Your Honor, I'm speaking of Wong2 Sun for the general proposition that when we have a3 constitutional violation, turning to the Fifth Amendment4 specifically, the amendment that we're, of course,5 concerned with here. In Chavez, a plurality - the6 plurality opinion in Chavez made it clear that if we have7 a violation of the Fifth Amendment, then application of8 the derivative evidence rule is virtually automatic.9 Now, my argument doesn't rest entirely on the10 argument that this is a constitutional violation. My11 first position is that, if it is, it's an automatic12 application of the derivative evidence rule. But even if13 it is not, then we go to a balancing and we balance the14 costs, the benefits of applying a derivative evidence15 rule.16 QUESTION: Why - why would there be any cost here17 to anything if you took the position, as we might take,18 that if a policeman goes in and purposely doesn't give the19 warnings when he knows that he should, or even if he20 reasonably should know and doesn't, we're not going to let21 in derivatives.22 MS. WICHLENS: Your Honor -23 QUESTION: But in the unusual case, we're quite -24 it was an honest mistake, as it could be here, because he25 tried to give the warnings and the defendant said, no, no,27, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Iknowwhattheyare,okay. So-sowhatcost,if-if- there?MS. WICHLENS: Justice Breyer, we need a bright line in this area of the law. This Court has virtually always applied bright lines, particularly in the area of a Miranda violation.QUESTION: Well, we've had - we've had, Ms. Wichlens, probably somewhere between 40 and 50 cases since Miranda was decided, deciding was this interrogation or was it not, was this custody or was it not. There are factual disputes about every single aspect of Miranda.MS. WICHLENS: I think Your Honor's cases, which were, particularly in the early years following Miranda, have now made those rules quite clear what is interrogation, what is custody -QUESTION: Well, we - we apply in this area, as regrettably in a lot of others, what we call the totality of the circumstances test. Do you call that a bright line?MS. WICHLENS: Well -QUESTION: It seems to me the fuzziest of alllines.MS. WICHLENS: For the voluntariness determination, it is a fuzzy totality of the circumstances, but no, in Miranda, we apply bright lines28, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 determining whether there was interrogation, whether there2 was custody. We don't try to get inside the head of the3 individual police officers -4 QUESTION: Well, the brightest line, it seems to5 me, would be if the policeman knew or should have known6 that he was supposed to give a warning, fine, the evidence7 stays out.8 MS. WICHLENS: Your Honor -9 QUESTION: But now all we're excluding, we're10 just letting in evidence in those cases where it genuinely11 is fuzzy and no policeman knows what he's supposed to do,12 or - or it's at least reasonable for him not to know.13 Now, under those circumstances, what you do is lose14 evidence, lose evidence that could be useful in convicting15 a criminal, and what you gain is precisely nothing, since16 the policeman, by definition, was confused about the17 matter and reasonably so. Now, what's the answer to that?18 MS. WICHLENS: The answer to that is, drawing19 that bright line, if it is one, Your Honor, I think does20 require us to get inside the head of the police officer.21 It requires us to make determinations about whether it was22 reasonable or not. An individual police officer may have23 mixed motives. We're not giving -24 QUESTION: We're - we're - we're saying whether a25 reasonable police officer in the - in the position of this29, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425police officer, would have - would have made the mistake. MS. WICHLENS: If -QUESTION: Just as - just as you say, you say for custody we apply a bright line. We don't apply a bright line for custody. The test for custody is whether - whether a - a reasonable person would have believed, given the totality of the circumstances, that he was free to leave.MS. WICHLENS: Perhaps, Your Honor, I - QUESTION: That - that is anything but bright. MS. WICHLENS: Perhaps I shouldn't say brightline. What I mean is objective versus subjective, and what I urge this Court not to do is impose a subjective test, which requires us to get inside the head of the police officer.QUESTION: Okay. Well, we can apply objective - an objective test then.MS. WICHLENS: Under an -QUESTION: If a reasonable police officer in the position of this police officer would - would have been confused about the necessity of giving a Miranda warning, then you're - we're at a different situation.MS. WICHLENS: And if it is an objective test, Justice Scalia, then in this case the police officer fails that test.30, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Well, not necessarily. Didn't the2 suspect here say, don't give me that warning, I know what3 my rights 45 detective6 Patane said, I know my rights. Then the detective - and7 this is the most crucial thing - is the detective not only8 didn't go on to read the other very critical Miranda12 I know my13 rights?14 1516 do. 171819rights. The detective says, you know yourMS. WICHLENS: Correct.QUESTION: And the - Patane says, yeah, yeah, IMS. WICHLENS: Correct. What he didn't say - QUESTION: I know my rights.MS. WICHLENS: What he didn't say was, do you right to have counsel here present, Mr. Patane? QUESTION: No, no, I understand that a lawyerare, I know about that.MS. WICHLENS: The record shows that thesaid, you have the right to remain silent. Mr.9 rights, also didn't obtain a knowing waiver. He didn't -10 QUESTION: No, wait, you left out - he said it11 twice, you have the right to remain silent. Patane says,￼20 know your 2122 might have - who really knows this area, might have23 understood that you have to do more than that. But is it24 fair to ask a policeman who's on the line of duty when he25 tries twice to read him the rights, and each time the31, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425defendant says, no, I know them, forget it. Is it fair to ask the policeman to be the lawyer who has to know you havetogoandgetoutapaperandhavehimsignitandso forth?MS. WICHLENS: It is absolutely fair to require that of a police officer. He doesn't have to be a lawyer, Your Honor. He has to have attended police academy 101. You read four warnings to a defendant, a suspect, after you arrest him. That is not -QUESTION: Well, we're talking here about fruits, the location of the gun and the gun.MS. WICHLENS: Correct.QUESTION: And ever since Oregon v. Elstad, which said it didn't apply to fruits, all the courts of appeals in the Federal circuits, but one, have said it comes in.MS. WICHLENS: That's correct, Your Honor.QUESTION: I - this is the - from the one circuit that holds otherwise.MS. WICHLENS: That's correct.QUESTION: And it hasn't resulted in disaster,has it?MS. WICHLENS: I think it is approaching disaster, Your Honor, and the case that's going to follow this one is at one end of the spectrum. We have lawyers in California going on record instructing police officers32, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 to violate Miranda on purpose, and they actually use that2 word.3 QUESTION: When you say violate, Miranda, Miranda4 is - is not a command that prohibits police officers, or5 that requires police officers to give the statements.6 It's a - it's a - it's a conditional thing. Unless they7 give the statements, the stuff can't be admitted in8 evidence.9 MS. WICHLENS: I respectfully disagree with that,10 Your Honor. I think Dickerson has made it clear it isa11 command. Miranda -12 QUESTION: I think - well, I think, having13 written Dickerson, I think differently.14 (Laughter.)15 QUESTION: You're - and you're entitled to read16 the opinion as you wish.17 MS. WICHLENS: I understand, Your Honor. The way18 I read Miranda, its progeny, all the way up to Dickerson19 and including Dickerson, which, of course, you, Your20 Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, are the authority on, is that21 there are two components to a Miranda rule. If the22 exclusion of evidence is the core of the rule, well then23 the warning requirement is the rest of the apple. There24 are two components to the rule, and police officers are25 being instructed out in the field to violate, to ignore33, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 the first part of the rule.2 QUESTION: Well, that's not this case. You're3 arguing somebody else's case. That certainly isn't this4 case.5 MS. WICHLENS: Your Honor, I am trying to argue6 the implications of this case.7 QUESTION: Well, that's why I raised the point,8 because it seems to me you could have one simple rule9 maybe. I'm just tying - trying it out for all these10 cases. You say if the policeman knew or reasonably should11 have known, well, we're talking about derivative evidence,12 not - not the evidence itself, but derivative - knew or13 reasonably should have known, keep it out. But if in fact14 it was really an honestly borderline thing, at least if15 we're talking about derivative, then no, you don't have to16 keep it out.17 Now, that's simple and we'd send yours back18 maybe to find out whether he reasonably knew or should19 have known, et cetera. And I'm testing it on you. I want20 to see what your reaction is.21 MS. WICHLENS: Understood. Understood, Your22 Honor. I think we - we could pass that test, and, of23 course, it would need to be sent back -24 QUESTION: Oh no, I'm not - I don't - I'm not so25 interested whether you pass it or not if you don't have34, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 to. But I'm interested in what you think of it.2 MS. WICHLENS: My preferred test is, you have a3 Miranda violation, you suppress derivative evidence. I4 think that's the simplest rule, Your Honor, with all5 respect. But if we do have an objective reasonableness6 test, in this case and others like it, it's not7 objectively reasonable to think you can forego three of8 the four Miranda warnings, and it's certainly not9 objectively reasonable to think that you don't have to get10 the suspect to waive those rights before you go on.11 QUESTION: Well, so - so far as the defendant is12 concerned, what - what difference does it make to him13 whether the officer's failure to give the warnings was14 intentional or just negligent?15 MS. WICHLENS: No difference whatsoever, Your16 Honor, none whatsoever. The suspect is still not informed17 of his constitutional rights. That's why I believe a18 brighter line, a simpler test, if you will, Your Honor, is19 more appropriate. But even under an objective20 reasonableness test, the Miranda violation in this case21 was certainly not objectively reasonable.22 QUESTION: What -23 QUESTION: May I ask you a background question?24 I think most cases you know whether there was a duty to25 give the Miranda warnings. Just take a case where it's35, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425clear the officer failed in the - in the duty to give a warning. Is it not correct, as your opponent argued in the first sentence of his oral presentation, that the law has generally been settled for a long time that fruits are nevertheless admissible, and what's your response to that argument?MS. WICHLENS: My response to that, Your Honor, is I think the lower courts have been mistaken. What they have done is taken the language in Elstad, and that decision, of course, did include some language about physical evidence, it was dicta in that case, and that's -dicta.QUESTION: But I would think very, very sound(Laughter.)MS. WICHLENS: Well, with respect, Your Honor - QUESTION: It makes a very simple rule. You can￼let it in.MS. WICHLENS: With respect -QUESTION: There's your simplicity.MS. WICHLENS: With respect, Your Honor, it makes things simpler, but it doesn't achieve the purposes here for the reasons that some of the Justices here today have pointed out. In the case of physical evidence, the physical evidence is the equivalent of the statements. The police officers -36, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Well, let me - let me ask you this, and I'll - I'll go back and read Miranda to - to make sure. To what extent was the Miranda rule founded on the concern that compelled statements - we'll call them that - are unreliable? Wasn't that a - a significant factor?MS. WICHLENS: That was one of the factors.QUESTION: Now, when you have tangible evidence, then the reliability component substantially drops out of the case.MS. WICHLENS: That's correct, Your Honor.QUESTION: And it seems to me that that makes the, what you call dicta in Elstad, with reference to physical evidence, point to a case that's even easier than one - than the one that was in Elstad.MS. WICHLENS: Well, Your Honor, I disagree with the conclusion there, because the flip side of that is the - the reliability of the physical evidence and the fact that if the police find out where it is through a Miranda violation, they just go and pick it up. That's what makes physical evidence different, and that what - that is what makes the deterrence factors different here. And so -QUESTION: Well, it certainly is reliable. There's no question that it's reliable.MS. WICHLENS: There's - there's no question. Physical evidence is what it is. I - I don't -37, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Then that's - I think that's the point Justice Kennedy was making -MS. WICHLENS: Understood.QUESTION: - that the statement might not be reliable. Now, there - there may be other things that work in Miranda, not just to make sure that the statement is reliable.MS. WICHLENS: Absolutely, Your Honor. The other thing that's at work in Miranda and in the Fifth Amendment itself is the notion that the Fifth Amendment isn't just a rule of evidence, just a rule designed to ensure reliable evidence. It's also a rule that recognizes that in a free society, it's repugnant to the concepts of - concept of ordered liberty to compel a citizen to incriminate himself. And so that -QUESTION: But we do - we do have a number of things that are permissive - permissible, like a - a voice exemplar -MS. WICHLENS: Correct.QUESTION: - or a blood test.MS. WICHLENS: Because none of those involve anytestimonial aspect whatsoever, this Court has made very clear. And so we don't really have the derivative evidence rule, the fruit rule, even at issue in those cases. There's no violation whatsoever in those cases,38, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Your Honor. There's no tree, so there can be no fruit. Here, we do have a violation.QUESTION: You have to wind up the rhetoric to a high degree to say that all of society finds this repugnant. The man twice said he didn't want his warnings and he had a gun in the house he wasn't supposed to have.MS. WICHLENS: And we don't know that he knew he had a right to counsel to be there while Detective Benner was saying, you need to tell us about the gun, Mr. Patane. I'm not sure I should tell you about the gun, you might take it away from me. You need to tell us about the gun. If you want to get in front of the domestic violence case, you need to tell us about the gun. I think that is -QUESTION: Well, half the problem is that that isn't - I mean, it begs the question to say that that's contrary to established ordered liberty, et cetera, because that is the question.MS. WICHLENS: It's -QUESTION: Everybody, I guess, agrees that it does violate those basic principles to permit questioning of the person, compel a statement and then introduce that statement into evidence.MS. WICHLENS: It -QUESTION: But apparently, for many, many years, people haven't agreed under the same circumstances that it39, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425violates ordered liberty to get a statement and get physical evidence and introduce the physical evidence.MS. WICHLENS: What I'm talking about, Your Honor, are the two bases underlying the Fifth Amendment, going way back now, not just reliability, but also concepts of, in a free society, should we compel people to incriminate themselves? I understand that there has been a lot of water under the bridge since the framers came up with the Fifth Amendment, but I was answering the questions in terms of -QUESTION: And used to beat people up,that's very repulsive. MS. WICHLENS: QUESTION: Buta lot of it was that the police say, they beat people up. Now,That's correct.￼the answer to that is that if they come even close to that, we'll keep the statement out andwe will also keep the fruits out.MS. WICHLENS: That's correct, Your Honor. Buthere -QUESTION: The - the difference is Miranda doesn't assume compulsion. You're talking as though Miranda - Miranda is a compulsion case. It isn't. It - it's a prophylactic rule, even when there has been no compulsion -MS. WICHLENS: It's a -40, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: - we keep it out -MS. WICHLENS: It's a -QUESTION: - we keep it out.MS. WICHLENS: It's a prophylactic rule requiredby the Constitution, of course.QUESTION: That may well be, but you can't makeyour argument as though what's at issue here is compulsion and our society has set its face against - against the use of anything obtained by compulsion. There - there is not necessarily compulsion. In fact, there usually isn't compulsion simply because a Miranda warning is - is not given. I expect this - this - this individual in this case did indeed know his rights.MS. WICHLENS: We don't -QUESTION: I - I think probably most of the people in this room could read - could - could recite Miranda just from - just from listening to it on television so often.MS. WICHLENS: Well, Your Honor, when I pose that question at cocktail parties, people generally fall off with the fourth - the fourth warning. They don't realize that they would have a right to counsel appointed -QUESTION: Well, I mean, that might depend on how late in the cocktail party. I mean, we -(Laughter.)41, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: I'm not in any position to pose the2 question later in the cocktail party, Your Honor. The3 importance is that the Fifth Amendment protects two4 things, and Miranda, of course, protects the Fifth5 Amendment. And if we give the police officer in the field6 a pass to say, Miranda's optional, you can do a cost-7 benefit analysis, you can decide whether you think the8 statements are really what's going to be important, or you9 can decide that it's the derivative evidence, the fruit of10 those statements that's going to be important. We don't11 have much of a rule at all.12 As the Tenth Circuit summed it up very aptly, I13 think, quoting from the decision of the Tenth Circuit,14 from a practical perspective, we see little difference15 between the confessional statement, the Glock is in my16 bedroom on a shelf, which even the Government concedes17 clearly excluded under Miranda and Wong Sun, and the18 Government's introduction of the Glock found in the19 defendant's bedroom on the shelf. It's the same thing in20 the context of physical evidence.21 QUESTION: But - but the latter you know is true.22 The former may - may have been the product of coercion and23 be false.24 MS. WICHLENS: Correct, Your Honor, but this is -25 QUESTION: So, I mean, that's a big difference if42, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 you think the primary purpose of Miranda is to prevent2 false testimony from - from being introduced, then it3 seems to me quite reasonable to say that police can indeed4 make the choice, do I want to use this testimony. If I5 don't want to use this testimony, I won't give a Miranda6 warning, and anything the testimony leads to, if it leads7 to anything, I - I don't know how the police will always8 know that - that it will lead to something, so I - I think9 it's a - a pretty high risk enterprise.10 But what's - what's wrong with it if - if11 think the primary - the primary function of Miranda12 prevent browbeaten statements by - by - by confused13 in custody who - who confess mistakenly?you is to people14 MS. WICHLENS: The problem is, it lets the15 individual officer on the street decide whether he or she16 is going to give the Miranda warnings in a particular case17 or not. That's not a rule that law enforcement is behind18 in, here I'm referring to an amicus filed in - in the￼19 companion 2021 may be so22 the police officers to have to be trained in the police23 academy to be a lawyer basically, Your Honor, and try to24 decide which evidence is going to be most important -25 QUESTION: Well, what - what is your authority,case of Seibert.Law enforcement doesn't want such a rule, if I bold to say that, in general. They don't want43, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 Ms. Wichlens, for saying that law enforcement doesn't want2 this sort of a rule?3 MS. WICHLENS: Well, Your Honor, what I'm4 referring to there very specifically is an amicus filed in5 the Seibert case by former law enforcement and6 prosecution.7 QUESTION: And you think they represent the views8 of, quote, law enforcement, closed quote, generally?9 MS. WICHLENS: Your Honor, I'm a public defender.10 I can't speak for the interests of law enforcement.11 Perhaps I've been presumptuous to -12 QUESTION: Well, you were - you were told in the13 argument by Mr. Dreeben that that is the practice of the14 FBI and the Federal law enforcement officers.15 MS. WICHLENS: That's - that's correct. Prudent16 police officers, as I understood him to say, will go ahead17 and give the warnings. But we have some very, if I may18 say imprudent officers out there, at least in Missouri and19 California. We know about those. And there are now Web20 sites that police officers can go on to that instruct in21 this method, instruct police officers to try to decide22 what's really important in the case, put themselves in the23 position of the DA, I suppose, and decide whether the24 statements are really going to make the case or, in a25 possessory case, is it the physical evidence that's really44, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425going to make the case?In this case is a perfect example of that.The information was, he keeps it on his person or in his car or in his home. They're going to investigate a felon in possession of a firearm case. If they find that firearm in his bedroom or in his car, that's pretty much all she wrote. The prosecution doesn't need a lot more. They don't need the suspect's statements about where that is, and so that's why we can draw a line between physical evidence and other types of evidence.And I could add -QUESTION: All right. So what? That's - we're going to the same thing - let's suppose they found out about that gun without compelling anything, no compulsion -MS. WICHLENS: But violating Miranda. QUESTION: - no testifying against yourself. MS. WICHLENS: But violating the Miranda rule. QUESTION: But they didn't omit - they omittedthe Miranda warning.MS. WICHLENS: And we -QUESTION: And the Miranda warning is a way of stopping the compulsion. But if you're willing to assume there is no compulsion, what's so horrible about it?MS. WICHLENS: Well, I'm - I'm not willing to45, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425assume there is no compulsion.QUESTION: Ah, well if there is - then whatyou've got is Miranda as a way of getting at instances where there is compulsion.MS. WICHLENS: Absolutely.QUESTION: Fine.MS. WICHLENS: Absolutely. That is the basicpremise of Miranda.QUESTION: Does that apply to the physicalevidence too?MS. WICHLENS: Yes. I mean, the - the basicpremise, if we want police officers to comply with Miranda. And if I could say another word about Elstad, part of - a central part of the holding in Elstad, as I understand it, was that in that case, the initial constitutional violation is cured by the time the subsequent statement comes around. In other words, you have a Miranda violation, the Miranda warnings are not read, the person is interrogated, then the Miranda warnings are carefully and thoroughly read.And as this Court stated in Elstad, and I'm quoting, a careful and thorough administration of Miranda warnings serves to cure the condition that rendered the unwarned statements inadmissible. We can't possibly have that type of cure in the case of physical evidence. When46, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 the police officer is going simply to seize the physical2 evidence, there's no curing of the Miranda violation, and3 that's another way that Elstad is distinguishable.4 QUESTION: But was there never a question in this5 case of whether the - there was consent to this search,6 because the defendant said twice, I know my rights?7 MS. WICHLENS: And you're speaking of the consent8 to the search, Your Honor? Because then Detective Benner -9 QUESTION: Consent to the questioning, and then10 voluntarily telling them, it's on a shelf in my bedroom?11 Why wasn't the - the whole thing pretty much like when you12 go to the bus terminal and say, mind if I ask you a13 question?14 MS. WICHLENS: Your Honor, because he was under15 arrest. He - he had been told he was under formal arrest.16 He was in handcuffs. And so the Miranda warnings - the17 Miranda warning requirement clearly applied. And so18 Detective Benner was not to ask those questions without19 having warned him first.￼2021 isn't it? 2223 Honor. 2425 I know myQUESTION: Okay. Well, that's just a silly rule, I mean -MS. WICHLENS: Miranda's not a silly rule, YourQUESTION: Well, it - it is when the person says, right. What if he stuck his fingers in his47, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 ears, saying, I don't want to hear them, I don't want to2 hear them.3 4 56 I have to7 require the officer to do that, how about, okay, pal,8 would you like to waive those rights? That's an important9 part of Miranda law also: A, inform the suspect of his(Laughter.)QUESTION: But you have to read it to him anyway? MS. WICHLENS: It's not hard to say, sorry, pal, read them to you, and even if you don't want to10 rights, B, ask him if he would like to waive them.11 QUESTION: We take the case on the assumption,12 the Government's question that there was a failure to give13 a suspect the Miranda warnings here, do we not?14 MS. WICHLENS: Correct. Although the15 Government's concession in the lower courts, district16 court and Tenth Circuit, is that Miranda was violated17 because there was a lack of a knowing waiver of those18 Miranda rights, and that's the basis on which the district19 court accepted the Government's concession. But the -20 QUESTION: What did the court of appeals - what21 did the court of appeals -22 MS. WICHLENS: The court of appeals assumed a23 Miranda violation, and I believe repeated the language24 about the waiver problem.25 QUESTION: May I ask you if you - there was a lot48, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 of interruptions to your answer to my question. If you2 had inadequate time to say everything you wanted to say3 about the settled state of the law before this case arose4 by - in the lower courts, that's your opponent's original5 argument.6 MS. WICHLENS: Your Honor, simply that those7 cases were mistaken. This Court had never spoken directly8 on the subject of derivative evidence rule in the context9 of physical evidence. And the times have changed, Your10 Honor. The time of Elstad and some of this Court's cases,11 New York v. Harris, that followed Miranda most12 immediately, we all assumed, naively it turns out, that13 police officers would at least try to comply with Miranda.14 And now there's this movement afoot to basically thumb15 their noses, if you will, at this Court's Miranda decision16 and say Miranda is just an option.17 QUESTION: May I ask you if the state courts were18 uniform in the same way the Federal courts were?19 MS. WICHLENS: The state courts were not. I've20 cited some cases in my brief, both pre-Dickerson and post-21 Dickerson, where the state courts were not at all uniform.22 QUESTION: And was that on both the matter of23 subsequent confessions and physical evidence?24 MS. WICHLENS: Correct, Your Honor, as I recall.25 If there are no further questions from the49, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Court, I would ask this Court to hold that the derivative2 evidence rule applies to physical evidence fruit of a3 Miranda violation and to affirm the judgment of the Tenth4 Circuit Court of Appeals.5 QUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Wichlens.6 Mr. Dreeben, you have three minutes remaining.7 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN8 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER9 MR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.10 Miranda is a rule that is perfectly matched to the problem11 that the Court sought to address, namely the risk that the12 defendant's own self-incriminating statements would be13 obtained by compulsion and admitted against him to prove14 his guilt. That risk implicated two central concerns of15 the Fifth Amendment, one going to reliability, the other16 going to the state's burden to prove guilt with evidence17 other than that extracted from the defendant's own mouth.18 Extension of Miranda to this case, which19 involves physical evidence that does not involve the20 reliability concerns that are at the heart of the Fifth21 Amendment, and does not involve the concern about using22 the defendant's own self-compelled words to incriminate23 him, would not only be contrary to the body of authority24 in the lower courts before this Court's decision in25 Dickerson and largely after it, but would also be contrary50, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 to the purpose of truth-seeking in a criminal trial that2 is central to the Court's jurisprudence in this area.3 Justice Stevens, I - as far as the Government is4 aware, there was no more than a handful of cases in the5 state courts that have followed the rule, other than what6 the Federal rule had been. Justice White's dissenting7 opinion from the denial of certiorari in the Patterson8 case, I believe, collects them, but this was by no means a9 groundswell movement in the state courts.10 QUESTION: Well, I understand, but I noticed that11 in your brief, in your oral statement you said that they12 were unanimous, your brief said there was a strong13 majority in the Federal courts. I haven't checked it out14 myself but is it - is it a unanimous view in the Federal15 courts?16 MR. DREEBEN: My understanding is that there are17 eight Federal circuits before Dickerson, including the18 Tenth Circuit, that it held that suppression of derivative19 physical evidence was not warranted. Since Dickerson,20 only the Tenth Circuit has changed its position, and there21 is no other court, other than the First Circuit, which22 follows a rule that depends on - on balancing deterrence23 concerns against the loss to - of evidence to the trial,24 that follows anything akin to the kind of derivative25 suppression rule that the Tenth Circuit adopted in this51, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425case.Thank you.QUESTION: Well, wait, can I - if you have a minute. What if the policeman deliberately fails to give the Miranda warning in order to get the physical evidence?MR. DREEBEN: In our view, Justice Breyer, no different rule is warranted in that situation, because Miranda continues to protect against the risk that it's aimed at. Absent actual compulsion, there is no warrant for a rule that does anything other than suppress the actual statements.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. The case is submitted.(Whereupon, at 11:01 a.m., the case in the above-entitled matter was submitted.)￼52, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005
