SouthCarolina.          Mr. Bruck.              ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID I. BRUCK                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. BRUCK:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleasethe Court:          For the second time this year, the Courtconsiders today South Carolina's compliance with yourdecision in Simmons v. South Carolina.  The issue thistime is -- is the interpretation, if you will, the SouthCarolina Supreme Court has placed upon the futuredangerousness requirement of the Simmons decision,specifically whether, as the South Carolina Supreme Courtput it, future dangerousness was neither a logicalinference from the evidence nor was it injected into thiscase through the State's closing argument.          QUESTION:  Well, in -- in some sense -- and thisis what concerns me about your argument -- I -- I supposeat some level future dangerousness is -- is alwaysinferable from the fact of -- of a horrible crime.          MR. BRUCK:  I -- I think it is true that -- that31111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 when a person is convicted beyond a reasonable doubt of an2 aggravated, death-eligible murder, it is -- it does not3 take very much more to put the issue of future4 dangerousness at issue. You can conceive of crimes -- I5 particularly suggest the example of an intrafamilial --6 that is, the murder of children by their mother where the7 person with no prior record and no likelihood that the8 situation will recur, where future dangerousness simply9 does not sound from the evidence.10 However, in -- there are also --11 QUESTION: We -- we are the ones that -- that12 gave you this -- this category of future dangerousness.13 And it either makes sense or it doesn't. If -- if there's14 something defensible about the category, it -- it seems to15 me that there would be a significant number of cases in16 which it doesn't apply. I -- I just don't see that from17 your argument. Now, maybe the category is unworkable.18 That's another point.19 MR. BRUCK: Well, I should say that future20 dangerousness is not likely to be at issue in -- in cases21 where State law does not provide the jury the freedom to22 consider it. If aggravation was clearly limited in a23 weighing statute in which the jury has clearly said these24 are the -- or is clearly told, these are the factors that25 go on death side of the scale and nothing more -- only you41111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 can think of a way in which the prosecution could try a2 case in a way that clearly conveyed the message to the3 jury that --4 QUESTION: Well, how many States that use the5 death penalty allow future dangerousness as a factor in6 sentencing?7 MR. BRUCK: You know, I don't have an exact8 number. My sense is that a small minority have it as a9 statutory aggravating factor, such as Texas, Virginia, and10 Oregon, and a much larger number like Georgia, South11 Carolina allow it along with a myriad of other sentencing12 factors without it ever needing to be explicitly13 mentioned. These are the so-called non-weighing States.14 I would guess --15 QUESTION: Well, that is the concern, of course,16 is if -- whether this concept is something that is going17 to have to be applied in every capital sentencing case or18 whether there's some limitation.19 MR. BRUCK: Well --20 QUESTION: And it's hard to know from your21 argument the answer to that. Can you draw a line?22 MR. BRUCK: Yes. I would say where the evidence23 does not sound in future dangerousness and where the24 prosecution does not advance the jury's consideration of25 future dangerousness. For example, in this case, you51111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 know, on these facts, of course, none of this is2 implicated. This is simply Simmons. This is within3 Simmons. Even if we were to limit Simmons to its facts,4 it would include this case because you have an onslaught5 of future dangerousness argument. You have an onslaught6 of classic future dangerousness evidence presented --7 QUESTION: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You8 say evidence sounds in future dangerousness. What -- what9 evidence that -- that is introduced at -- you know, at the10 -- at the sentencing phase that this is a horrible person11 would -- would not sound in future dangerousness? You're12 trying to show that this is a horrible person, that he13 deserves the death penalty. What kind of evidence14 wouldn't sound in future dangerousness?15 MR. BRUCK: Well, for example, the prosecutor16 here took on the issue of the fact that this young man was17 only 17 years old, and his -- and had no prior record,18 both very substantial mitigating factors. And the19 response was that actually the very fact that he had no20 prior record, the prosecutor said, makes him more21 frightening than a serial killer, more frightening than a22 career criminal, which is all future dangerousness23 rhetoric. Frightening means looking toward the future.24 One is not frightened by things that have already25 happened, but things that might happen in the future.61111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Now -- now, you're relying on thestatement of -- of the prosecutor --          MR. BRUCK:  Yes, in part.          QUESTION:  -- on his use of the wordfrightening.  And in another place, he does use the termdangerousness.          MR. BRUCK:  Yes, he does.          QUESTION:  Now, that's one thing if you want to-- and -- and we -- we can discuss that.  But -- but I'mmore concerned about your broader point that when theevidence, as you put it, sounds -- I'm not sure it's theproper use of sounds, but when the evidence, as you putit, sounds in future dangerousness, we have to -- it -- itis constitutionally required that you -- you have theinstruction about no parole.          MR. BRUCK:  Well, I mean, we should recall that-- that -- I mean, one can say, well, these are just thefacts of the crime.  The State has enormous discretionabout what evidence it wants to present, and when itpresents evidence that is reasonably likely or, in thiscase, virtually certain to cause the jury to consider the-- the elemental sentencing issue that a judge considersin almost every case, will he do it again, then --          QUESTION:  That will always be the case.  You --you are asking for a rule that -- that will cover every71111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 capital case. I cannot imagine a capital case where --2 where the prosecution does not, at the sentencing phase,3 put in evidence that makes this look like a horrible4 person, hence, a dangerous person. And -- and I -- you5 know, I just don't know that we're prepared to go that6 far.7 Which leads me to what words -- what are the8 magic words that you want the prosecution not to be able9 to use. Frightening is one magic word. Right? Dangerous10 is another magic word.11 MR. BRUCK: It most certainly is.12 QUESTION: Okay. I mean, we can just have a13 list of magic words that prosecutors shouldn't use from14 now on.15 MR. BRUCK: I think there would be no harm,16 although this case provides absolutely no occasion to17 consider the issue, in dispensing with the future18 dangerousness requirement for precisely that reason, that19 when -- that it is -- there are so few cases in which the20 jury is not likely, in the privacy of the jury room, to21 ask the question, what if he gets out and does it again?22 This comes up in case after case. And there's a -- in23 weighing the -- the State -- I mean, is there a danger24 that the Simmons rule might then be applied in cases where25 it truly does not rebut something that the jury --81111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 occasionally in the rare case, yes.2 But in considering the equities, I think it's3 worth keeping in mind that there is unfairness not only on4 the issue of future dangerousness from this situation.5 There is also unfairness in the retributive function that6 the jury must suffer, and this is not in this case. It7 may be more of an Eighth Amendment claim, but I think in8 weighing the risk of unfairness to the two sides, it's9 worth keeping in mind that life without parole is a much10 more severe punishment. It is much more retributive than11 is life with parole. And it is -- it is more severe from12 the moment it is imposed, not only 30 or 40 years hence.13 And the reason is that life without parole means life14 without hope.15 And anyone -- I -- I try these cases and -- and16 negotiate plea bargains in these cases at the trial level,17 and I can tell you that there is nothing that cuts the ice18 faster with the victim's family, with the prosecutor in19 settling a case than life without parole not because of20 the dangerousness, but because of its retributive effect.21 And there's something terribly unfair at -- when everyone22 in the courtroom knows how crushing this penalty is, this23 penalty of life without hope, except the jury, and they24 are left to think that their option is to let this man25 hope that some day he'll be out raising a family and91111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 working at a job and -- and pretending to be a respectable￼2 member of 345 am saying6 our category of cases in these non-weighing jurisdictions,7 where the jury is given free rein to consider everything,8 that our category of non-dangerousness cases is actually9 so small as to be nonexistent, then in those States atthe community when it isn't so.QUESTION:  You're asking us to overrule Simmons.MR. BRUCK:  No, by no means.  This case -- all Iis that if it is true, as my friend claims, that10 least I think it would be fair. And there is no harm in11 saying --12 QUESTION: But that isn't the question you13 presented in your petition. All you presented in your14 petition was, was the ruling of the Supreme Court of South15 Carolina in this case contrary to Simmons?16 MR. BRUCK: Well, that's right because I17 represent a client and all my client requires is that18 Simmons be applied. We have something that I think can19 fairly be described as something approaching defiance of20 your -- of your decision in Simmons when a record like21 this is -- is found not to raise future dangerousness.22 The only thing that State can come up with that they23 didn't do is to call Dr. Grigson, some psychiatrist, to24 say --25101111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005QUESTION:  Well, for the reasons that we've1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425indicated in our questions, I -- I don't think it'sdefiance.  I -- I do think the prosecution is being prettycareful not to raise future dangerous explicitly becauseit doesn't want the jury to know this.          MR. BRUCK:  Yes.          QUESTION:  And it makes it a little troublesome          But given the state of our law, future￼dangerousness has to be put in issue, and aswe've indicated, I -- I think under -- underthat would be an issue in almost every case.we -- asyour rule          Let me ask you this.  You've heardhere before.  I -- I take it that if this instruction weregiven, either the trial judge relented or futuredangerousness was at issue, it's perfectly open to theState to say, now -- now, you may think this prisoner hasno hope, but the legislature can change this tomorrowmorning.  Tomorrow morning the legislature can change theparole rule, and this prisoner -- this defendant can beout in the community, once again a danger.          MR. BRUCK:  Well, I think that --          QUESTION:  I take it that would be a fairargument?          MR. BRUCK:  I don't think it would be for aseparate reason, which is it invites the -- the jury totreat the law under which this person is being sentenced111111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005me ask it1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425as in effect nonexistent.  The only thing that's real isdeath because that can't be changed.          QUESTION:  Yes, but -- but the certainty thatlife without parole will confine him indefinitely is muchless than that execution will kill him.          MR. BRUCK:  That's true.  That's true.  But when-- when a court -- I mean, a jury doesn't need to be toldthat all manmade law is subject to being changed by man.That is something that we all know.  Jurors know that,that this law was enacted by the legislature and can bechanged --          QUESTION:  Well, would you allow the prosecutorto argue it if you were the trial judge?          MR. BRUCK:  No, I would not because to invitethe jury to --          QUESTION:  So, you're saying that the jurydoesn't need to be told what it already knows, but that'sinconsistent with your whole position.          MR. BRUCK:  No.  All I'm -- all I'm saying isthat the jury should not be invited to speculate that allthe law that it is being told to apply will melt away andcannot be relied on and thus should be ignored.  And thenthe jury ceases really to become a jury that applies thelaw of the State and becomes just a pack of --          QUESTION:  I thought your position -- I thought121111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425your position was that this -- that the judge or thelawyer reads the text of what it says in the SouthCarolina law.￼MR. BRUCK:          QUESTION:legislature enacted.          MR. BRUCK:QUESTION: Exactly.Reads word for word what the That is exactly correct.And that's all you're asking.          MR. BRUCK:know, my -- my submission --That's all we're asking.  And, you          QUESTION:  Wait.  Whether -- whether we shouldallow that to happen depends on, you know, how fair it isto the prosecution and why shouldn't the prosecution beable to point out the reality that that's what thelegislature has said today and it can change thattomorrow?  So, if you really want future dangerousness tobe -- to be treated openly and honestly, I don't see howyou can just -- just say put in the one side and not theother.          MR. BRUCK:  Well, I have to say my case does notturn on the answer to that question.  That could bedecided either way, as this case is reversed, becausethat's not an issue in this case.  It certainly wouldbecome the stuff of future appeals to this Court from theonly two States that see any issue left here, Pennsylvania131111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425and South Carolina.          QUESTION:  In all the other States, in -- inevery other State that has capital punishment --          MR. BRUCK:  Yes.          QUESTION:  -- this instruction is given as amatter of course?          MR. BRUCK:  Regardless of any absence orpresence or alleged absence of future dangerousness.  Inother words, every State but South Carolina andPennsylvania already go beyond Simmons, and these are theonly two outliers in which the record is combed forwhether or not future dangerousness is at issue.          Now, as I say --          QUESTION:  When you say it's outliers, but onceagain that's the -- that's the dichotomy that this Courtset forth in -- in Simmons and in our past opinions.          MR. BRUCK:  Well, yes.  The -- it's true that --that Simmons set a constitutional minimum rule and itrequired future dangerousness to be at issue.  And thereare a great many -- in a -- in a non-weighingjurisdiction, there are a great many ways of puttingfuture dangerousness at issue.  It can be done, as theCourt has held in Simmons itself, by argument.  It can bedone, as is never done in South Carolina, by instructionto the Court, because it's not a statutory factor.  Or it141111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 can -- as the State agrees and as the South Carolina2 Supreme Court acknowledges, it can be done solely by3 evidence without argument by the solicitor.4 QUESTION: But what about the argument that5 everything that goes to future dangerousness also goes to6 something else? The prosecutor said, yes, I showed that7 this was a terrible person because he had no prior record,8 and I used the Billy the Kid remark because -- to rebut9 the age. So, I can give you a reason, other than future10 dangerousness, for everything that I put in.11 MR. BRUCK: Well, it's -- it's -- there's very12 little evidence of future dangerousness and very little13 argument that cannot also be given a retributive14 interpretation, which is what the State has labored to do15 in their brief.16 And if all that -- it's striking that the State17 is not at all satisfied with the test stated by the South18 Carolina Supreme Court, which is whether the issue was19 argued or whether future dangerousness is a logical20 inference from the evidence. The State's test for whether21 evidence is -- raises an issue of future dangerousness is22 that the evidence must only raise future dangerousness and23 must raise nothing but future dangerousness.24 Now, it's rather hard. The only example, as I25 say, they can think of is a psychiatric opinion that the151111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425man will kill again.  Apparently that's the only evidencethat triggers Simmons under the Attorney General's view.          QUESTION:  So what?  What's so -- what's soabsurd about that?          MR. BRUCK:  Because it ain't so.          QUESTION:  What is so absurd about that?  IfSimmons meant anything, it seems to me that's what Simmonsmeant, or otherwise it -- it -- you know, it's virtuallyworthless.          MR. BRUCK:  Well, there was no psychiatricopinion introduced by the State in Simmons itself.  Therewas nothing but a metaphorical argument that two membersof the Court didn't think raised future dangerousness atall.          But it was this idea of self-defense in responseto someone who was a threat.  That -- that was also anargument about retribution, and as the dissenting opinionin -- in Simmons pointed out, that -- you could certainlysee the retributive meaning, significance, that theprosecutor meant there.          But it also -- it also raised the issue offuture dangerousness, and that was all in Simmons.  Andthat was enough.  And that's why I say that to affirm thiscase would require -- would require reversing Simmons.          One has to weigh, too -- I mean, you know, the161111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 State argues this issue as if we are keeping them from2 introducing evidence, and we are doing something unfair or3 we're saying they can't do this, they can't do that. We4 don't say the State can't do anything. All we say is that5 when they make an argument like they made in this case --6 he's quick-witted, doesn't that make someone a little more7 dangerous, calling the defendant Billy the Kid, Bloody8 Billy, the Butcher of Batesburg, and on and on and on and9 on and on -- that we be able to answer it by saying how10 the legislature has defined life imprisonment for the￼11 people of 1213 that life14 has been enacted, what can be fair about keeping the15 defendant from telling the jury, even if all this that the16 prosecutor says about me is true, I will never be released17 again?South Carolina.These jurors are the same voters that demandedimprisonment be -- be enacted, and now that it18 Now, the -- the State also acknowledges, both19 the State Supreme Court and the Attorney General, that20 future dangerousness was raised in this case. They make21 no bones about that. But they say, well, we raised it in22 a special way that does not implicate Simmons. What we23 did was we introduced evidence that not even the Lexington24 County jail could keep this man from being nonviolent, and25 that is future dangerousness. And that's why the171111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 instruction that we offered, telling the jury that future2 dangerousness was not in the case, was denied.3 But the -- but the State says, in defiance of4 all common sense, that evidence that this young man would5 be dangerous, even behind bars and concrete and steel, did6 not implicate the notion that if you notion that if you7 let him out, he would be even more dangerous. That is why￼8 the State9 10 11says that prison dangerousness does not --QUESTION:  He just didn't like being confined.MR. BRUCK:  I'm sorry?QUESTION:  Maybe he just didn't like being I mean, you can imagine a situation like that.MR. BRUCK:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, anything isbut that does not commend itself to our commonthink what the jury is much more likely to inferis that if even jail and prison can't keep this12 confined. 1314 possible,15 sense. I16 from that17 guy from being dangerous, if he ever gets let out, let out18 on parole, Katie, bar the door. He's going to be a19 disaster.20 QUESTION: Well, I'm not sure about that21 inference. If I were a juror and I heard about this22 evidence, I'd say my principal focus would be on the23 safety of the guards and the inmates. I'd say this man is24 dangerous in prison and that's the reason for capital25 punishment. It seems to me perfectly logical.181111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 MR. BRUCK: That -- as I say, the -- the2 evidence has two meanings and that is one of them. We3 don't quarrel with that. But at the same time, if -- if4 he is --5 QUESTION: Well, then you can't say it defies6 all logic, et cetera, et cetera. It seems to me that7 that's the -- the most direct conclusion that -- that8 should follow from the prosecution's evidence on this9 point. He's dangerous in prison.10 MR. BRUCK: Even if it is the most direct, how11 can we say that it does not also prove that if you let him12 out on parole, he'll be even more dangerous?13 QUESTION: But that isn't what Simmons said. I14 thought the rule of Simmons was -- was a rule of fairness.15 Look, prosecution, if you're going to argue that this man16 should be executed because it -- he will be dangerous to17 society if he's -- if he's let out, then, for Pete's sake,18 you have to let the jury know that he won't be let out.19 It's an unfair argument for the prosecution to say he'll20 be dangerous to society unless you execute him, when the21 prosecution knows that he'll never get out.22 MR. BRUCK: Right.23 QUESTION: But this is far beyond that. This24 has nothing to do with such an unfair argument by the25 prosecution. He's not saying don't let this person go191111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 because he'll be praying on society. There's -- there's2 nothing approaching that argument.3 MR. BRUCK: Well, I think it -- it -- what we4 have here is a prosecutor who has Simmons and who knows5 that if he wants to hide from the jury -- you see, the6 prosecution agrees with us about -- and this is, in a way,7 what is most disturbing and troubling about this case. If8 the prosecution did not believe, based on their evidence9 and their argument, that this jury was thinking about10 future dangerousness to society, why would they care?11 What possible harm could there be from a Simmons12 instruction?13 I think the prosecution entirely agrees with us14 on the importance of this and on the dynamics of jury15 deliberation in a case where a -- where the -- where the16 State's evidence and the argument is of this nature. They17 know perfectly well what any practicing lawyer who tries18 these cases on either side knows, which is that this jury19 goes back in the jury room, after having seen and heard20 all of this, and thinks one thing for sure: We got to21 make sure he doesn't do it again. And it is a22 constitutional fact, established by the Simmons case,23 that's -- that part of that is parole, the jury's24 misconception about parole, because we've had parole for25 so many generations and life without parole is a new201111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 phenomenon in this country.2 QUESTION: But this -- this is not a case, is3 it, in -- where the trial judge put any limitation on the4 defense attorney's arguing this point or where the jury5 came back with a question. This is not one of those6 cases.7 MR. BRUCK: Right. For all we know, the jury8 knew there was parole, wrongly. And no limitation.9 But I have to say -- and the State has not10 claimed that in the face of this argument on instructions,11 that the lawyer -- the defense attorney should have picked12 up a statute book and read to the jury the instruction13 that the judge had just refused to give. She would have14 had her head handed to her on a plate if she had done15 that. That is not permitted in South Carolina. When a16 legal principle has been ruled out of a case, a lawyer17 cannot then attempt to charge the jury anyway. And that18 is not an argument you'll find in the State's case.19 They do say that her -- her rhetorical claim or20 -- or co-counsel's claim that you'll never see the light21 of day should be deemed as the equivalent of a no-parole22 instruction, but you dealt with that and disposed of that23 argument in Shafer, where a much more explicit argument24 was held not to be the equivalent of an instruction on --25 on State law concerning parole. So, I think that -- that211111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 argument has absolutely nothing to commend it and is -- is2 directly controlled, I would submit, by -- by Shafer.3 QUESTION: But Shafer was explicit that counsel4 would not be allowed to read the statute, which is what I5 think counsel wanted to do.6 MR. BRUCK: Well, that's right. But you know,7 it -- a lawyer doesn't, under South Carolina practice,8 need to ask the court whether an instruction that has been￼9 ruled out10 it to the1112 instructed the jury in this case that he is the sole13 instructor on the facts. At page 618 of the record, he14 said, as -- I am as judge the sole -- made the sole and15 only instructor in the law. And so -- and that's, you16 know, how trials in South Carolina are conducted. Lawyers17 do not instruct.18 I realize as a matter of constitutional law, if19 it were -- if there were a way for defense counsel to have20 done that, despite the -- the court's ruling, it would21 have sufficed under Simmons, but there was no such way,22 and that's why the State makes no such argument in their23 -- in their brief. This is not where an opportunity was24 passed up by defense counsel to instruct on the law. This25 -- there wasn't any such -- any such opportunity, and221111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005of the case -- whether it's okay for her to readjury.  We know that that is not permissible.I should add, too, that -- that the trial judge1 that's why the -- the argument is so vague and so2 unsatisfactory under -- under Shafer v. -- v. South3 Carolina.4 If this is enough to get around Simmons and to5 allow prosecutors to keep juries from knowing what the6 South Carolina legislature has done with respect to the7 abolition of parole, then you will see, as you already are8 seeing, case after case from South Carolina in which the9 envelope is constantly being pushed further and further10 back in what, I have to submit, is a somewhat manipulative11 effort to get the advantage of the jury's misconceptions,12 to get the advantage of the false dilemma that Simmons13 correctly identified in order to get more death sentences14 than are actually merited by the law and the evidence in15 each case.16 As I say, this is the second time that -- that17 South Carolina has -- South Carolina's compliance with18 Simmons has been before this Court in this calendar year.19 There probably won't be another one this calendar year,20 but there will be a continuing procession. And, indeed,21 the first case in line will be Shafer v. South Carolina,22 which was remanded for reconsideration of the -- for23 consideration -- for a ruling on the issue of future24 dangerousness.

BRUCK:  Prospectively, yes.  It will -- itwill do no good for -- for people like Shafer and -- andthe petitioner in this case whose cases have already beentried.  But, yes, the House of Representatives has alreadyvoted overwhelmingly to, in effect, require a Simmonsinstruction in every case.  That bill is now before theSenate and it could be by this time next year, this willbe of only historical interest in South Carolina, exceptto the petitioner --          QUESTION:  May I ask, as a matter of historicalinterest, when did the requirement that the -- I mean,when did -- when did the sentence of life without parolefirst authorized by the South Carolina --￼1986.MR.

CREIGHTON WATERS                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MR. WATERS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          In Simmons v. South Carolina, a limited dueprocess exception was crafted to the general rule inCalifornia v. Ramos that it was for the States to decidewhether to inform the juries on matters of parole or otherearly release.  And the issue in this case is whatargument and evidentiary submissions are sufficient to --for the prosecution to have been deemed to raise futuredangerousness such that due process overcomes that Statelaw rule.          And petitioner in this case contends that futuredangerousness can be raised simply by the gruesome factsof the crime, by misbehavior in jail, by a prior criminalrecord.  And, of course, that would create, as has alreadybeen discussed, a virtually standardless test and wouldconflict with this Court's statements of the Simmons rule,as well as the subsequent interpretation of the rule bymany other courts.  And that is, of course, that aprosecutor must specifically rely on future dangerousnessto society as a basis for death.          And, of course, that -- the reason for that is251111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the rationale of Simmons itself, which is a due processright of rebuttal.  Future dangerousness -- a futuredangerousness requirement is necessary to that due processright of rebuttal, and obviously, in order to have theright to rebut something, the other party must have firstdone something to affirmatively raise that issue.          Now, admittedly some --          QUESTION:  Mr. Waters, in -- in your view hasany South Carolina prosecutor since Simmons used wordsthat would invoke that case?          MR. WATERS:  Invoke Simmons itself?          QUESTION:  Yes.  It seems to me that anyprosecutor, if your argument is right, can easily getaround Simmons simply by not using the words futuredangerousness and saying, well, this is relevant tosomething else.          MR. WATERS:  Well, I think, you know, our StateSupreme Court has on two occasions ruled that Simmons wasviolated, and in that case, the -- the prosecutor arguedthat, you know, he's shown that he cannot live inside oroutside of prison.  So, clearly that crosses the line.          I think, you know, the -- the fundamental --          QUESTION:  I thought your position was if hecouldn't live in prison, then Simmons was out.          MR. WATERS:  Well, in that particular case, he261111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 said both outside of society and inside prison in that2 particular case. That's State v. Timothy Rogers, a State3 court case. So, our court has on -- on a couple of￼4 occasions 56 -- if the7 makes is this man is dangerous in or out of prison, in8 that case a Simmons instruction is warranted.ruled that.  I mean, obviously --QUESTION:  You -- you then concede that if theargument that counsel for the -- the prosecutor9 MR. WATERS: I think that by incorporating the10 outside society aspect of the argument, our State Supreme11 Court has12 challenge1314 question -- and I'm interested in it too -- as can you15 tell us, as a matter of practice, are there instances in16 where the Simmons rule is followed in South Carolina and17 the jury is instructed about parole because of future18 dangerous being an issue, or as Justice Ginsburg19 suggested, is it the common pattern and practice for20 prosecution -- for the prosecutor to stay away from this?21 MR. WATERS: No. There are plenty of instances22 where -- where solicitors argue future dangerousness to23 society, and a life without parole instruction is given.24 There -- it -- it ultimately boils down to what the25 prosecutor does in his argument and how the trial judge271111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005already ruled that and I'm not here to -- tothat.QUESTION:  I understood Justice Ginsburg's1 rules on -- on what was raised in -- in that trial. But2 it does happen.3 QUESTION: Don't you have that here? I mean,4 the argument here was not only the -- the Bloody Billy,5 the Butcher of whatever it was, but the words dangerous6 were used I think -- I think twice to describe him in the7 argument, once at least. And -- and the argument included8 the -- the statement to the jurors, I hope you never have9 to be in the position again of being 30 -- 30 feet away10 from this kind of -- of a killer. Well, the jurors aren't11 going to be spending time in prison, and I -- I don't know12 why that argument means anything other than I hope this13 guy is not going to be out where you are going to be and14 find you as close to him again. So, hasn't -- hasn't he15 raised it even on -- on your criteria?￼16 MR. WATERS: I don't believe17 think if you focus on the prosecutor's18 whole, it's clear that the majority of19 retributive. And we would assert --so in this case.  Iargument as ahis argument wasQUESTION:  Well, I'm not talking about -- I-- the majority of the argument isn't even thethat you are arguing for.  You said, look, he's2021 mean, you22 criterion23 got to raise it on my theory. He's got to raise it as an24 argument that this person will be dangerous on the25 outside. And I assume if he does that once, that's281111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 sufficient on your theory. And my question is, didn't --2 even on your theory, didn't he do it here?3 MR. WATERS: Well, with regard to the dangerous4 comment, what the solicitor said in that particular case5 was -- he said, well, the evidence here is that he's6 quick-witted, he's not retarded. And of course, the7 evidence in this case also was that petitioner was a close8 friend of -- or the petitioner's family was a close friend9 of this victim. He used to work with the victim, and that10 he used that familiarity with the victim to make her more11 vulnerable.12 QUESTION: Well, what -- what about the 30 feet?13 I hope you're never in this position again. What about14 that argument? I mean, isn't that an argument that makes15 no sense except on the assumption that this person might16 -- the defendant might be outside?17 MR. WATERS: That -- that particular argument18 was -- was made at -- at the beginning of the sentencing19 phase in opening statement. It was a brief reference. I20 don't think that that --21 QUESTION: I mean, it was made to the jurors.22 They heard it, didn't they?23 MR. WATERS: They did hear that, but I think if24 you read it in context, it was more of the case of you25 just committed -- convicted this guy of a horrible crime.291111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 You have a tough job ahead of you, and I hope you never2 have to do this again. I -- I think that -- that brief,3 isolated passage, when read in the context of what the4 solicitor was saying there, would not have such -- been5 such as to necessarily flag the future dangerousness issue6 in the mind.7 QUESTION: So, if -- if the prosecutor had8 closed his argument with that, that would have sufficed.9 MR. WATERS: I'm not -- I don't know if I would10 say that much. I just point out that it was very early11 and it was just a brief reference in opening statement,12 and I don't think that that -- that can be pointed to as13 to have crossed that line because I don't really think he14 used it for that inference, that you know, this -- you15 know, this guy is going to be dangerous to you. He was16 more saying, you know, you just convicted this guy of the17 most horrible, bloodiest crime you can imagine, and he's a18 horrible person, and now you've got one more tough job to19 do. And I hope you never have to go through this again.20 I think that was the point of his argument, not that this21 guy --22 QUESTION: He didn't -- my -- my -- you correct23 me if I'm wrong, because I don't have the transcript in24 front of me, but my recollection is he didn't say, I hope25 you don't have to go through this again. He said, I hope301111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 you're -- you know, you're not in this position of being2 30 feet away from this kind of a person again, which is I3 think quite different.4 MR. WATERS: Well, he -- he did not say, I hope5 you don't have to go through that, but I think if you read6 his argument, that was the point of it, and I think in7 context, that's the obvious point of it rather than future8 dangerousness.9 QUESTION: May I ask this? You gave us a couple10 of examples of the South Carolina Supreme Court itself11 setting aside the conviction -- or executions because they12 had failed to give the instruction. And you -- you've13 just quoted the example he mentioned both inside and14 outside prison.15 Now, did they consider the -- your argument that16 if read in the context of the entire argument, it -- it17 was a featured part of the argument, or did they -- could18 the -- could one reasonably think that from those19 opinions, just that mere mention was enough?20 MR. WATERS: In that -- in that particular case,21 the solicitor focused much of his argument on that. He22 said, this -- this defendant has shown by his prior23 record, because the defendant had had prior incarcerations24 and prior releases -- he's shown by his prior record that25 he cannot exist safely both inside prison and outside311111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 society. So, I would concede that crosses the line. I2 think it was focused on in that case, and it was a direct3 statement of outside society.4 And I -- I don't want to get into magic words,5 but I think when you say outside society, when he clearly6 focuses, that -- that would be a magic word triggering7 Simmons.8 QUESTION: But you would draw a line depending9 in part on how much the issue was emphasized in the10 argument. Not just an isolated comment, for example,11 would not be enough.12 MR. WATERS: What I'm saying is that if there's13 an isolated comment in the context of an -- of an argument14 that focuses on retribution, that -- it's kind of a15 Donnelly v. DeChristoforo principle, that you shouldn't16 assume that the prosecutor intended to worst meaning from17 that, and you shouldn't assume that the jury necessarily18 took the worst meaning from that. And -- and so, I'm not19 saying -- I'm just saying that the context does matter,20 and -- and that's essentially what we have here.￼In Simmons, you know, we had a -- the moresituation.  We had the prosecutor say, jury, youdeath penalty is going to be society's response2122 egregious23 know, the24 to a threat, society's response. The prosecutor said,25 jury, you know, this will be your act of self-defense to321111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 this particular defendant. The death penalty will be an2 act of self-defense. The prosecutor even went on -- so3 far as to say his own expert calls him dangerous and had4 brought that out in cross examination. There's none of5 that here. All they can do in this case is -- is go6 through a technical parsing of the argument.7 QUESTION: Well, why shouldn't -- why shouldn't8 it be? Why isn't it fundamentally unfair in every capital9 case, after all, not to give the instruction that the10 alternative is life without parole? After all, you have a11 jury who knows it has a murderer in front of it. It's12 trying to decide among all alternative punishments. Death13 is the worst, and then the State won't tell them what the14 alternative is. Apparently every State but two have15 decided that is unfair. And why, to go back to basics,16 isn't it as unfair a thing just about as one can imagine17 to tell the jury you have to give life or something else18 and then not tell them what the something else is,19 particularly when they're likely to think he'll be out20 after a few years?21 MR. WATERS: Well, I think the jury in this case22 -- you know, they are told life imprisonment, and they're23 never told that there's any possibility of --24 QUESTION: But sitting -- in your experience,25 wouldn't you say most jurors are sitting there thinking331111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 that life doesn't mean life?2 MR. WATERS: Well, I -- I'm not sure that that's3 necessarily true. I mean, in State v. Patterson, which4 was a 1986 case in South Carolina, there was a voir dire5 of the jury on that, and most of the jurors said, we6 thought it meant, you know, he'll never get out. So, I7 mean, there's conflicting evidence on that. I know this8 Court has repeatedly referred to the fact that it -- it is9 new event and many jurors may not know, but I don't know10 if that's necessarily the case.11 As a matter of fundamental fairness, we're12 still talking about, to some degree, deference to the13 States. And -- and so --14 QUESTION: What does deference to the State got15 to do with fundamental fairness? It seems to me that's an16 entirely different argument.17 The fundamental fairness question that Justice18 Breyer is raising is in a context in which it may or may19 not be debated as to whether jurors know instinctively20 that life really means life, doesn't fundamental fairness21 require that they be instructed unequivocally so that they22 know the terms within which they must act in coming to a23 verdict. That's the fundamental fairness question.24 MR. WATERS: Well, I think that the -- the25 ineligibility of parole, as this Court held in Simmons, is341111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 only directly relevant to future dangerousness to society2 argument, and that, of course, was the due process3 rationale followed in Simmons.4 As far as whether under an Eighth Amendment5 context or even under a due process that life without6 parole is an effective rebuttal to retribution arguments7 and that sort of thing, that's not presented by this case.8 But I -- I think that the -- the relevance, again, of --9 of ineligibility for parole is to rebut future10 dangerousness to society. That's what --11 QUESTION: Well, in -- in Simmons, there's no12 question that the future dangerousness issue, together13 with the jury's question and so on, presented an egregious14 case of -- of a need for instruction.15 MR. WATERS: Yes.16 QUESTION: But let's -- let's assume -- and I17 don't believe this is this case, even remotely, but let's18 assume we had a case in which somehow future dangerousness19 were not an issue. And let's assume we -- we had a -- a20 straight retribution case. Given the fact that there is21 enough history to put in -- in doubt, to put into question22 what really is meant by life imprisonment, in the absence23 of a further instruction, why doesn't fundamental fairness24 require that the jury know for sure what the terms mean,25 which it must select from in sentencing this person?351111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. WATERS: Well, again, the jury is told we're2 dealing with death or life imprisonment.3 QUESTION: No, but that simply begs the4 question. That -- that is changing my question to you.5 My question to you says we're operating in a context in6 which historical practice leads one to -- to question7 whether jurors really do understand that life means life8 in this case in this State now. On that assumption, why9 doesn't fundamental fairness require that the juries be10 given a clear instruction so that they're not sitting11 there wondering what it means if they come back with a12 life sentence?13 MR. WATERS: I think that that depends that --14 that be all to end all is the without parole context of15 life. I mean, life is still a very severe penalty, and --16 and in order to get to your point, I think that you have17 to assume that adding without parole to it makes it so18 far --19 QUESTION: You bet I assume that. There is a20 big difference between life imprisonment, in which a21 person never walks out of the prison, and life22 imprisonment in which the person walks out 15 years later.23 Yes, I make that assumption and I want you to make that24 assumption in answering my question. Why doesn't25 fundamental fairness require that the juries understand361111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 that?2 MR. WATERS: Well, again, I would have to fall3 back to the fact of is the only aspect of the State's case4 that it rebuts is future dangerousness to society. And --5 and so that --6 QUESTION: And my question to you is let's7 assume a case in which that is not the issue, a case in8 which we're talking about retribution. I want to narrow9 the issue down here. Why doesn't fundamental fairness10 require that the jurors understand what the words mean?11 MR. WATERS: Because if it is a purely12 retributive case and -- and future dangerousness was not13 an issue, then there is nothing fundamentally unfair. The14 State has not made any arguments that the defendant did15 not have an opportunity to rebut. And -- and that's the16 holding of Simmons.17 QUESTION: Yes, but the -- the argument to the18 contrary would be if you were sitting there thinking that19 this terrible murderer is in front of you and you are20 asked what is the appropriate punishment, and on the one21 hand you were told it's death, and on the other hand you22 were told -- well, you're not told because a person who23 wants to retribute, wants vengeance, would surely like to24 know that the alternative to death, which is surely25 vengeance, is life in prison forever, not just life in371111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 prison for 10 or 15 years. I mean, can you think -- in a2 death case punishment stage, surely that would be on3 anyone's list of top five of the relevant factors.4 MR. WATERS: I don't know if you can necessarily5 assume that's the case when the jury hears evidence and6 they're instructed on what to consider and the focus of7 the evidence is his adaptability in prison, which is the8 case in this case and many other cases.9 And I think with regard to life without parole10 being a response to purely retributive arguments, it's not11 such an obvious be all and end all response to -- to12 retribution that due process steps in, as opposed to the13 situation in Simmons where future dangerousness to society14 does respond to that. I think that there is still a15 distinction there that -- that retribution is not16 necessarily directly responded to by a life without parole17 sentence, and so --18 QUESTION: I assume that the reason for these19 rules were just -- just State principles that the law says20 what it says, and we don't want to get into the21 refinements of -- of how long a life sentence may be. In22 those States that do allow the fact that a life sentence23 does mean a life sentence to be introduced, do those24 jurisdictions also permit or do other jurisdictions permit25 the prosecution to show that a life sentence does not mean381111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 a life sentence?2 MR. WATERS: There -- there are a number of --3 of jurisdictions that have wrestled with that. I think4 California v. Ramos is an example of that. Illinois has5 had -- has wrestled with that. So, some do allow charges6 on the possibility of commutation, on the possibility of7 pardon, on the possibility of change in the law and -- and8 add argument on that as well.9 And, of course, South Carolina's policy has10 always been that we want a simple either/or choice, death11 or life, and -- and we don't want to bring in these12 collateral concerns. Now, whether the members of this13 Court disagree with that as a matter of policy, this14 Court, of course, has stated in many contexts that, you15 know, the -- the wisdom of policy decisions, as long as16 they have a certain modicum of -- of reasonableness, are17 for the States.18 QUESTION: Is the prosecution allowed to argue19 in South Carolina when -- when the choice is -- is life or20 death, is the prosecution allowed to argue the possibility21 of commutation?22 MR. WATERS: No, no. Parole and early release23 is off-limits on both sides of the coin, and there's never24 been a State case yet to rule that, well, to be fair, the25 prosecution needs to have that, at least as --391111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Well, that's not really very fair, is2 it? When -- when the jury, you know -- if you instruct3 the jury that life means life, it really doesn't mean4 life. You'd have to let the prosecution come in and say5 it could be commuted.6 MR. WATERS: Absolutely, absolutely, and I would7 agree with that.8 QUESTION: Or the -- all the law can be changed?9 MR. WATERS: Or it could be changed.10 QUESTION: The South Carolina Supreme Court11 hasn't dealt with that issue, though, has it? Because --12 because Simmons is relatively new. Has there been a case13 where the prosecutor says, okay, judge, I said future14 dangerousness, but I want to tell them that the law can15 change, that there's a pardon, that there's a clemency16 power? That hasn't come up, has it?17 MR. WATERS: Not of which I'm aware. In fact,18 this rule developed initially when there was parole19 eligibility, and it was really a rule initially created to20 -- to benefit defendants, frankly, in -- in that they21 didn't want the jury to know -- the defense didn't want22 the jury to know that there was parole eligibility. So,23 the South Carolina Supreme Court said, okay, we're going24 to charge life. Life means life imprisonment. That's25 what it means.401111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Well, then the South Carolina Supreme2 Court itself changed its rule on that?3 MR. WATERS: It had. There was a period of time4 where their -- they did sanction charging on parole5 eligibility. This was prior to life without parole on --6 on either 20- or 30-year parole eligibility, depending on7 the jury's finding of aggravators. That existed, I8 believe, for about 4 years, and was overturned in 1991 I9 think. So, there was a period of time.10 But the policy -- the rule has always stayed the11 same, though, and that is that we don't want the jury to12 be legislating a plan of punishment. We don't want to be13 -- them to be concerned about these possible future14 events. We want them to make an either/or choice.15 And South Carolina will remain true to Simmons,16 but beyond that, unless the policy is considered to be so17 unreasonable as to not pass the laugh test, then I think18 that they can potentially -- they can have that policy.19 And I want to bring up another point, especially20 with regard to this and -- and what the prosecution did in21 this case. I don't think the -- the Court should -- or I22 don't -- I don't think it would be wise to -- to assume23 that prosecutors are going to be dishonest or to assume24 that the State court is going to be dishonest and is going25 to circumvent this rule.411111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 And in fact, what the prosecution was doing in2 this case, yes, he was trying to avoid Simmons, but he was3 doing that to obey the law. And -- and clearly in -- in4 Justice O'Connor's concurrence, it said that if the5 prosecution does not argue future dangerousness, then the6 charge does not have to be given, and -- and that's what7 the prosecutor was doing here. So, he wasn't trying to8 circumvent the law. He wasn't trying to be sneaky. He9 was trying to obey the law, and -- and --10 QUESTION: Yes, but he was trying to get the --11 prevent the jury from getting this information.12 MR. WATERS: That's true. That's true. He made13 a tactical decision that he -- and I don't know if it's14 necessarily tactical -- he was not going to rely on future15 dangerousness, and since that would not trigger Simmons,16 then the State law rule would apply. And that's --17 QUESTION: And -- and he also kind of snuck in18 the word dangerousness there in the -- in the 30-foot19 example, but they don't count because they weren't20 prominent in his argument.21 MR. WATERS: Well, I'd -- I'd like to -- to￼22 address that specifically. At that point23 he was talking about the particular crime24 QUESTION: What -- what passage25 talking about a passage? I don't have it42in the argument,in this --are we -- are wein my -- where1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 the -- the prosecutor expressly says future dangerous?2 MR. WATERS: No, not at all.3 QUESTION: I thought perhaps from his question4 that's what we were talking about.5 MR. WATERS: What he -- what he was doing was he6 said, okay, this defendant is quick-witted. This7 defendant -- the evidence says this defendant is not8 retarded. Now, doesn't that make him more dangerous for9 Shirley Shealy, for this crime on this January the 5th,10 for this particular lady? And what he was saying, if --11 if you read his argument in context, was again that the12 petitioner in this case was a close family friend of the13 victim and also used to work at that very same Kentucky14 Fried Chicken.15 QUESTION: Mr. Waters, it wasn't quite like16 that. He said dangerousness, and then counsel for the17 defense stopped him at that point, and then he came back18 with, well, I meant dangerous for her.19 MR. WATERS: Well, I don't know if you can20 necessarily read that that was at a protracted period. It21 may have been he just cut off before he finished his22 sentence. But what he was trying to say was is that he23 was more dangerous for her because she would have trusted24 him. She would not have expect to be cut to ribbons by25 this person because he was her friend. And that's what431111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 the prosecution was saying. He was saying that makes this2 crime more aggravated. It's more premeditated. It's more3 callous. He preyed on the vulnerability of the victim.4 QUESTION: And she was outside prison when this5 happened.6 MR. WATERS: She was outside prison, but this is7 retribution. This is, you know, jury, sentence this8 defendant to death for all the bad things that he has done9 culminating in this capital crime. This was such a10 horrible crime. And if you read the prosecution, there's11 at least five or six examples where he says, what's the12 punishment that fits the crime? It doesn't matter if he13 doesn't have a prior record. This case is bad enough on14 its own. This is a case for the death penalty. And that15 was a recurrent theme from the beginning, the middle, and16 the end of his argument, from start to finish.17 So, I would assert then that, you know, when18 read as a whole -- and -- and again, if you look at the19 evidence of dangerousness -- and there's been some raised20 of whether -- the issue raised of whether dangerousness21 within prison counts. And obviously, as a matter of22 logic, it doesn't because, you know, whether or not the23 defendant is going to get out of prison has nothing to do24 with whether he will be a danger inside.25 But more -- more --441111 14th Street, N.W.

WATERS:  I -- I don't think the link is --is so readily made.  I mean, it's common knowledge that --that prison --          QUESTION:  Well, the -- the evidence of -- ofhis dangerousness included things that he used to like totorture small animals, psychiatric evidence to the effectthat he wants to -- to take action, homicidal action,against anybody who annoys him.  The -- the word was alittle bit more flamboyant in the psychiatrist'stestimony, but that was the point.  These -- these don'tgo to conditions that would only come into play inside ofa prison.          MR. WATERS:  Well, in that particular instance,number one, the prosecution never used any of that in hisclosing argument.  But I don't --          QUESTION:  Well, it brought out in its crossexamination.          MR. WATERS:  Absolutely.          But -- but number two, if you -- that there wastheir adaptability expert, and all of this went to focuson what the jury had before it, which was adaptability to451111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 prison, and that's the issue that they were focused upon.2 And -- and what -- and the expert said, well, you know --3 QUESTION: Let's -- let's assume that. Let's4 assume that was the -- was the point. The fact is the5 evidence came out, and there's -- there's no common sense6 basis that I can think of to say that this evidence would7 not indicate that if the individual got out of prison, he8 would be very dangerous to the people he came in contact9 with. And I thought you were arguing that you couldn't10 make such an inference.11 MR. WATERS: I think that that -- that evidence12 is very close, but I would -- I would assert that -- that13 the way it was used in this particular case to respond to14 adaptability, which is dangerousness within prison, which15 was the specific issue that was focused before this jury.16 If the prosecution --17 QUESTION: But what started all of this, I18 thought, was -- was the point that you were making that19 the evidence that went to dangerousness in prison did not20 ground in inference of dangerousness outside. Maybe I21 misunderstood your point.22 MR. WATERS: No. I -- I agree that that23 particular -- those particular instances are a bit broader24 than the majority of evidence of dangerousness within25 prison, but I think that the -- his expert said, look,461111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 he's not a violent person. He hasn't had a violent past.2 He -- he's -- he's not mentally ill. He's -- he's going3 to be great in prison. He's not the type of individual4 that poses a risk in prison. He's not a predatorial,5 institutional violent individual, which their witnesses6 were noting a distinction between society in prison and7 society outside of prison.8 And I think all the State was doing was cross9 examining on that, saying, wait a minute. You're saying10 he's going to be adaptable? Well, he says, you know, he11 has violent fantasies. Well, that was brought out on12 direct by the defense. They -- they brought that out, of13 these violent fantasies, and the State was merely cross14 examining on a point that already had been made by the15 defense and saying, your opinion here is that he's16 adaptable. Well, what about this -- this violent fantasy?17 So, it was only used in the context of -- even18 though it -- I agree, it has a broader context -- a19 broader -- you know, it wasn't just his misbehavior in20 prison, but it was only used by the State here to21 challenge the adaptability prison in -- or the22 adaptability issue of -- of what he would do in -- within23 prison.24 QUESTION: And it is important to the State, I25 suppose, to show that he will be dangerous in prison.471111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. WATERS:  Oh, absolutely.  This is the --          QUESTION:  The jury presumably would not want togive a life sentence to someone who's going to continue tokill in prison.          MR. WATERS:  Absolutely.  And this is -- this,of course, is the state of -- of Skipper, and -- and it'san inevitability that -- that you're going to see anadaptability case.  But --          QUESTION:  The argument is made whenever theState makes that point, that perfectly valid point, to thejury.  It automatically triggers Simmons.          MR. WATERS:  I'm sorry?  The -- the point?          QUESTION:  The argument made is that when theState makes that perfectly valid point about dangerousnessin prison, it automatically triggers Simmons.  And you sayit should not unless -- unless the prosecutor specificallyargues violence, dangerousness outside of prison.          MR. WATERS:  Correct.  As a matter of logicthat --          QUESTION:  But that really doesn't help you herebecause here you further had evidence of his escape risk.          MR. WATERS:  And --          QUESTION:  So that this wasn't a guy who wasjust going to sit quietly and -- and enjoy his time inprison.  This is someone who presented an escape risk and481111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425hence raised a risk of -- of acting out his dangerouspropensity if he succeeds in escaping.          MR. WATERS:  And I think that that's -- I wouldagree with that wholeheartedly.  I think the majority ofthe -- of the prosecution's dangerousness within prisonevidence went to him being an escape risk, and -- but thefact of the matter is, is whether or not you buy there's adistinction between -- or accept there's a distinctionbetween inside prison and outside society, whether or not-- whatever you think about Simmons, the fact of thematter is that ineligibility for parole does absolutelynothing to respond to the fact that he's an escape risk.He's saying he's going to bust out.  It -- the fact thathe can't get parole does nothing to respond that he'sgoing to bust out -- that he might bust out of prison.          QUESTION:  So, you should have been happy withthe instruction is what that proves.          MR. WATERS:  I'm sorry?          QUESTION:  You should have been happy with theinstruction.          MR. WATERS:  With the?          QUESTION:  Because you're concentrating on whatwould happen in prison.  So, the instruction wouldn't helpyou -- it wouldn't hurt you.  It would actually help you.          MR. WATERS:  What?  The --491111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: This fellow is going to be kept where2 he'll be the most dangerous. Therefore, you should kill3 him. That's your argument.4 MR. WATERS: No. That's -- that's not￼5 necessarily my argument.6 goes to adaptability. I7 -- wouldn't assert that.8 But, you know,9 well, why does the State I think the argument, again,certainly -- certainly wouldn'tas far as to his contention that,care, you know, about giving thisthey're not raising future10 charge if they're saying11 dangerousness, again it raises these collateral concerns12 down the road of pardon, which he's eligible for pardon.13 It raises the -- the issues of change in the law, and --14 and the State seeks to avoid those. And so, that's why it15 cares. It doesn't want to have to get into that.16 And if that issue is given, I don't know if a17 trial judge, without direction from the Supreme Court, the18 State Supreme Court, would allow a prosecutor to then19 respond with -- with, you know, arguments about change in20 the law. And -- and I guess, you know, depending on -- on21 what happens, we'll have to see guidance on that.22 QUESTION: Mr. Waters, you didn't really mean --23 your brief could be read to say that -- that the lawyer24 was effectively allowed to tell the jury that life means25 life. You said something in your -- the jury -- that501111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 because the line was about defendant would never see the2 light of day.￼345 it was in 67 held, and8 reasons that -- that this Court relied upon in Shafer were9 not present in this case, to why those were notMR. WATERS:  Right.QUESTION:  It's no different than -- from whatShafer in that respect.MR. WATERS:  I -- I fully understand what Shafermy only point with that was, was that the10 sufficient, and that was, number one, the jury asked. So,11 obviously, it didn't work. And number two, that the judge12 told the jury, well, parole eligibility is not for your13 consideration, which raised the concern in Simmons that,14 well, parole is available but for some --15 QUESTION: But you -- but you don't dispute that16 if the -- if the lawyer then -- if she had tried to say in17 open court, now, jurors, I'm going to read you from the18 South Carolina, that she would have her head cut off by19 the judge.20 MR. WATERS: I think it's very unlikely the21 trial judge would have allowed her to do that.22 Absolutely.23 And -- and we would just assert, though, that --24 that this is a case -- there's no indication whatsoever25 that the jury was confused or concerned with his possible511111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 release. They didn't ask the question. They weren't --2 it wasn't interjected by the trial judge. And so, all I'm3 saying is -- is that makes this case materially different4 from what happened in Shafer when it said that that was5 insufficient.6 And this -- this lawyer argued natural life in7 prison -- imprisonment extensively, said, you have two8 choices, jury. You have death, a quick, painless death,9 or you have a long, slow death, and that a wife -- and he10 asserted earlier, that well, you know, the -- but the jury11 might think he's going to get out of prison and have a12 wife and a car. Well, no. The defense argued in this13 case just the opposite. They -- they argued that a wife14 is never ever going to happen for Billy Kelly. A car is15 never ever going to happen for Billy Kelly, and -- and16 concluded by saying, I think life imprisonment is the17 right punishment in this case because he'll never see the18 daylight -- the light of daylight again. So, I think it19 was clearly made to the jury, and there's no indication20 that there was confused -- they were confused. There's no21 indication of a fundamental unfairness in this case.22 Finally, I think again this Court has stated in23 -- thank you very much.24 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Waters.25 Mr. Bruck, you have 4 minutes remaining.521111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID I. BRUCK                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. BRUCK:  Thank you, Your Honor.          The question has come up again concerning thehistory of South Carolina's handling of this matter.  Ishould say that a very detailed accounting of the wholehistory, legislative and judicial, is provided in the certpetition in Simmons itself, and it's not a very edifyingtale.  It really shows that the legislature, when theyfirst considered a limited life without parole, wasdeadlocked because of a fear that it would reduce thenumber of death sentences, and the legislative compromisethat finally came out was we can go ahead and have lifewithout parole because you don't have to tell the juryanyway.  So, it won't have any effect.  And that wasthe --          QUESTION:  The Supreme Court of South Carolina,I gather from your opponent, shifted its position too.          MR. BRUCK:  Yes, it did.          QUESTION:  And what was the reason for that?          MR. BRUCK:  It's not entirely clear.  Themembership of the court changed, and indeed, the -- thelegislative leader of this proposal to stop telling thejury or not to tell the jury about parole joined thecourt, and then the membership -- and then the court's531111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 position changed. If there was a connection, I don't2 know. But it -- it -- it's an odd history.3 The -- my friend says that, well, South Carolina4 doesn't want the jury to know about commutation. For a5 very good reason. There is no such thing as commutation6 of a life sentence under South Carolina law. We're one of7 only two life without parole jurisdictions that do not8 allow the Governor to commute a life without parole or any9 prison sentence. The commutation power only extends to10 the death penalty. So, there is a pardon power which --11 QUESTION: When you say commutation, that's all12 synonymous with --￼MR. BRUCK:  Clemency.QUESTION:  -- clemency?MR. BRUCK:  That's right.There is a pardon power which, according to theSimmons, has never been exercised, and by its13 14 15 1617 record in18 terms requires a showing of the most extraordinary19 circumstances.20 And there -- so, South Carolina's life without21 parole is as locked down as any State's. The idea that,22 well, there's lots of play is simply not so, and -- and so23 there's very little that the State could come back with.24 But as a constitutional matter, if there was any25 play at the joints, absolutely, if the jury is told the541111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 truth that there's no parole, the jury can also be told2 the truth about any possibility of release that might3 exist. We don't deny that for a moment. But the State4 recognizes that the -- that the real issue is the5 unavailability of parole, and that's why they fight this6 tooth and nail.7 Justice Ginsburg inquired about prior cases in8 which the State Supreme Court has reversed under Simmons.9 And it's important to keep in mind there are only two, and10 they both involved cases that were tried before Simmons11 came down. And that is why in one case the verbatim same12 argument about what to do with him when he is in our midst13 was made by the prosecutor because they didn't have14 Simmons as the script about what not to say.15 But since Simmons came down and since16 prosecutors who are of a mind to defeat the rule in17 Simmons have had the -- the facts of Simmons to go by, not18 one case by the South Carolina -- the South Carolina19 Supreme Court has not reversed under Simmons in a single20 case, in every instance.21 Now, it's true that occasionally trial judges22 have given a life without parole instruction under￼23 Simmons. Oftentimes it's because24 basic sense of fairness, does not25 the prosecutor took in this case.551111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005a prosecutor, out of atake the position that We're really dealing1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425with a due process rule where you sort of feel it in yourheart that there's something wrong, and that applies toprosecutors and judges too.  But when a prosecutor decidesto -- to use the Simmons script, they've had very goodsuccess in having this instruction not given.          And I should say that if this -- if these factsare now held by this high Court to be not to trigger therule in Simmons, you will see that as being -- as beingthe rule.  Now, it's possible that the legislature willstep in.  It's equally possible, after such a largeloophole in Simmons, a loophole that will swallow theentire case, is decided by this Court --          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Bruck.          MR.
