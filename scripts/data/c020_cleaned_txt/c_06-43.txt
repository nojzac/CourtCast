GROSSMAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:            The text of section 10(b) as well as therule 10b-5 promulgated by the Securities and ExchangeCommission prohibit the use of any deceptive device byany person, indirectly or indirectly, in connection withthe purchase or sale of a security.  The variousdeceptive devices used by the Respondents in this caseis conduct that is squarely covered by the text of thestatute and by the rule.            Respondents here were not passive bystandersfacilitating a fraud by Charter.  Their deceptiveconduct wasadvertisingintegral to the scheme to create fictitiousrevenues for Charter to report to investors.Respondents agreed to overcharge Charter sothat they could receive the money from Charter to thenreturn to it for the advertising, using Charter's very31 same money for the purchase of the advertising.2 Respondent Scientific-Atlanta created a document3 falsely claiming that the reason for the increased4 payments from Charter were because of increased5 manufacturing expenses.6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The transaction was not7 wholly without benefit to Scientific-Atlanta. They got8 some advertising. And it was not wholly without benefit9 to Charter. They were able to show that advertising10 works. Now, that puts aside the fact that they were11 using misleading accounting principles.MR. GROSSMAN:  Well, I would agree, Yourthey received free advertising.  But thethat they were creating the illusion that itadvertising, but rather that they were1213 Honor, that14 problem was15 wasn't free16 purchasing the advertising.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And was the price four to18 five times higher than the normal rates for advertising?19 MR. GROSSMAN: That is correct, Justice20 Ginsburg.21 And the obvious purpose for creating the22 illusion that they were purchasing the advertising23 rather than receiving free advertising was so that24 Charter can incorporate these increased revenues in25 their financial statements. And Respondents understood,41 they understood that in order to -- for Charter to pass2 this by their accountants, to deceive the accountants --3 and this is reflected in the indictment -- in order to4 deceive the accountants for Charter, the Respondents5 were told that there had to be separate agreements for6 both the advertising agreements and the purchase7 agreements.8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Grossman, is there any9 reason why, in principle, the elements for a cause of10 action under 10b-5 have to be the same as the elements11 for a cause of action by the agency under 10(b)? I mean,12 we, we created this, this cause of action. It's not set13 forth in the statute, although other private causes of14 action are.1516 limit it so17 by the SEC,18 private attorney general's actions? You need actual19 conveyance of a misrepresentation to the injured party.20 Is there any reason why we couldn't do that?21 MR. GROSSMAN: Well, I think there are two22 reasons, Your Honor. The first is that at this point in23 time -- I think as the Court recognized in Dura fairly24 recently -- that when Congress enacted the Private25 Security Law Reform Act, that at that time they acceptedIf it's our creation, couldn't we sensiblythat, for example, schemes can be attackedbut schemes do not form the basis for51 the private right of action that this Court had2 previously inferred. And this Court had previously3 inferred the private right of action not only for the4 section but each of the rules in Section 10(b).5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's not like6 under the Sherman Act, where we have reason to think7 Congress intended the Court to go about the business of8 construing and developing antitrust law. In fact, they9 have kind of taken over for us. They are imposing10 certain limits on when actions can be brought, proposing11 particular specific elements. In one of the provisions,12 20(e), specifying the SEC can bring an action but13 private investors can't.14 I mean, we don't get in this business of15 implying private rights of action any more. And isn't16 the effort by Congress to legislate a good signal that17 they have kind of picked up the ball and they are18 running with it and we shouldn't?19 MR. GROSSMAN: Well, this Court, Your Honor,20 as recently as 2002 in Wharf (Holdings) said there is a21 private right of action for violation of any of the22 subdivisions of rule 10b-5: a, b, or c. That would23 have to be reversed.24 Going back to the Superintendent of25 Insurance case in, in -- that would be in 1971, Your61 Honor, the Court held there was a private right of2 action for violation of --3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's kind of4 my point. We did that sort of thing in 1971. We5 haven't done it for quite sometime.6 MR. GROSSMAN: But when Congress enacted7 the Private Security Law Reform Act, everything it did8 in connection with that statute was directed to the9 private right of action that this Court had previously10 implied under 10(b). Nothing that Congress did was11 intended in any way --12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not -- my13 suggestion is not that we should go back and say that14 there is no private right of action. My suggestion is15 that we should get out of the business of expanding it,16 because Congress has taken over and is legislating in17 the area in a way they weren't back when we implied18 the right of action under 10(b).19 MR. GROSSMAN: Well,20 Congress has taken it over. And21 Private Security Law Reform Act,22 private right of action. Everything they did recognized23 the private right of action. It recognized that there24 would be multiple primary violators of 10(b). It did25 that in connection with proportionate liabilityI would agree,when they enacted thethey recognized this71 provisions. It recognized that there would be multiple2 players.3 So certainly, Congress had an understanding4 of what this Court had done up until that time. And5 this Court up until that time had implied the private6 right of action for every subset of rule 10b-5.7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it -- is it a8 necessary part of your theory that the deceptive9 practice that Scientific-Atlanta went in, that they10 knew that that was also -- that Charter would carry that11 forward? I mean, let's suppose that there were benefits12 to this deceptive practice to Scientific-Atlanta, that13 it looked like it had more money to spend on advertising14 than it really did, but they didn't care what Charter15 did with it. In fact, they didn't know that Charter was16 going to carry it on its books the way they did. Would17 there still be liability for Scientific-Atlanta?18 MR. GROSSMAN: No. No, not under the test19 that we have proposed, which is very similar to the test20 proposed by the Ninth Circuit or applied in the Ninth21 Circuit in the Simpson case, and the test proposed by22 the Securities and Exchange Commission in their amicus23 brief submitted in the Simpson case. It's not enough24 to just to have the deceptive act. The deceptive act for25 scheme liability has to be with the purpose of81 furthering a scheme to defraud investors.2 So if Scientific-Atlanta or Motorola had3 engaged in deceptive conduct, but that deceptive conduct4 was not intended to further a scheme to defraud the5 shareholders, no, Your Honor, there would be no action6 under the theory that we are pursuing here.78 I don't see9 defraud theJUSTICE SCALIA:  Intended or known?  I mean,-- what's in it for Scientific-Atlanta to                            that they just                            be enough if                            knew it was in                   shareholders?  Is it enough10 knew it would be used for that purpose?11 MR. GROSSMAN: Oh, it would12 they committed a deceptive act and they13 furtherance 1415 furtherance16 care what Charter was going to do with it, but theyof a scheme.JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, whenof," you -- you import intent.  They didn't17 pretty well18 to make its19 2021 reckless. 2223 position was.24 MR. GROSSMAN: Yes, but my position is also25 --knew that what Charter was going to do wasbooks look better.Would that be enough?MR. GROSSMAN:  I think that would beJUSTICE SCALIA:  That's what I thought youryou say "in91 JUSTICE SCALIA: So it's not an intent2 necessarily. It's just knowledge.3 MR. GROSSMAN: It certainly needs scienter.4 You certainly need scienter.5 JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, it's more than6 knowledge. I mean, you mentioned recklessness. It's got7 to have either knowledge of or a willingness to maintain8 an indifference to the consequence.9 MR. GROSSMAN: Exactly right, Justice10 Souter. And I think it's important -- and there is a11 very -- there is a very good discussion of this in the12 Simpson case by the Ninth Circuit, that the purpose of13 the test is such that it will not ensnare someone who14 does engage in a deceptive act but doesn't understand15 that the reason for it is to further a scheme.16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure. After trial -- you17 know, after trial which causes your stock to tank, you18 may indeed be able to show that you didn't know it was19 going to be used for that purpose. I mean, that's what20 this is all about, isn't it, getting it -- getting it by21 the summary-judgment stage?22 MR. GROSSMAN: No. I think, Your Honor,23 that this Court answered this last term in the Tellabs24 case. And Congress answered that question that you pose25 in the PSLRA, the Private Security Law Reform Act, so101 that you cannot just bring a case and hope to get it by2 the summary-judgment stage. You have to have3 particularized facts alleged under the heightened4 pleading standards of the PSLRA and this Court's5 decision in Tellabs showing that not only the deceptive6 act, but that the purpose of that deceptive act was to7 further a scheme. So, no, you can't just --8 JUSTICE SCALIA: What facts -- what has to9 be alleged short of -- on information and belief the10 defendant knew that -- that this information would11 appear on the balance sheets and be used to improve the12 status of the stock?13 MR. GROSSMAN: Well, of course if you just14 -- if you just allege it on information and belief,15 you're out of court. No doubt about that. That doesn't16 pass the heightened pleading standard in Tellabs or the17 PSLRA. What you do need is what we have here. Here you18 have allegations -- and we didn't make these allegations19 from whole cloth -- these allegations were derived20 principally from a grand jury -- the Federal grand21 jury indictment against Charter executives. That22 indictment says that Respondents were informed and23 ordered to deceive Charter's accountants. They had to24 have --25CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why shouldn't we be111 guided by what Congress did in reaction to the Central2 Bank case? There we said there's no aiding-and-abetting3 liability, Congress amended the statute in 20(e) to say4 yes, there is, but private plaintiffs can't sue on that5 basis. Why shouldn't that inform how we further develop6 the private action under 10b-5?7 MR. GROSSMAN: Well, I think if Congress8 intended under 20(e) -- certainly the private actions9 similar to this -- it would have said that only the SEC10 has the authority to bring a claim for substantial11 assistance whether or not it involves deceptive conduct.12 They could have very easily said "any deceptive conduct,"13 and that would have barred these claims. They chose not14 to do that.15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they were --16 they were addressing a very specific decision from this17 Court, the Central Bank decision. And the one thing18 they did not do is say that that decision was wrong19 with respect to private -- or going forward they weren't20 going to overrule that decision with respect to private21 rights of action. You're asking us to extend to non --22 I know you call it a primary violator, but not the23 person who --24 MR. GROSSMAN: Secondary actors.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- who put the121 deceptive conduct into the market. You're asking us to2 extend that liability to them, which seems inconsistent3 with Congress's approach in 20(e).4 MR. GROSSMAN: We are not asking any5 extension. Quite the contrary, Your Honor. I think6 that is the Respondents who are asking for a narrowing.7 When Congress addressed the PSLRA it addressed all of8 the arguments that we are hearing today from Respondents9 and their amici.10 JUSTICE ALITO: Is your theory dependent on11 the proposition that Scientific-Atlanta and Motorola12 deceived Arthur Andersen?MR. GROSSMAN:  That certainly is a large Yes, Your Honor.1314 part of it. 1516 exactly the 1718 you're referring to is that -- is that the accountants19 should have conducted a more diligent audit than they20 did. I mean these people clearly were trying to deceive21 the auditors. Why else would you issue a document22 falsely stating a reason for a price increase?23 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I'm looking at24 paragraph 218 of your amended complaint, 109a of the25 joint appendix, subsection 4. It says, speaking ofJUSTICE ALITO:  But didn't you allegeopposite in your complaint?MR. GROSSMAN:  No.  We -- I think what131 Arthur Andersen, "though aware that Charter was seeking2 to boost its revenues by paying vendors higher prices at3 the same time it received additional advertising from4 the same vendors, Andersen failed to properly audit5 these transactions by confirming them with the vendors."6 So you alleged that they weren't deceived. You alleged7 that they knew exactly what was going on.8 MR. GROSSMAN: No -- no, Your Honor, they9 knew that they were paying the vendors higher prices,10 but they didn't know why. The contract -- the contract11 for the higher prices was followed by this misstatement12 saying the reason for the higher prices is because of13 increased manufacturing expenses, when in fact that14 wasn't the reason. The reason was to take money --15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Who told -- who told16 Charter that it was necessary for them to have a time17 spread between the contract -- the $20 above the18 contract price and the advertising payment?19 MR. GROSSMAN: Arthur Andersen.20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, if it told them21 that, didn't it have -- it sounds to me from that that22 the accountant says, look, if you want to make this23 appear on the balance sheet as though the advertising24 revenues were just ordinary advertising revenues, you25 better separate these two. That suggests that Arthur141 Andersen knew all along what was going on.2 MR. GROSSMAN: No. Justice Ginsburg, what3 Arthur Andersen did not know -- and this is very clear.4 They did not know that it was Charter's own money that5 was being used by the Respondents to purchase the6 advertising. They were deceived by that document that7 said, we are increasing the price on the set-top boxes8 because of increased manufacturing expense. That was9 false. The10 Charter was1112 thing they told them to separate.13 MR. GROSSMAN: Well, not for that reason,14 Your Honor.reason they were increasing it is becausedelivering the money to them.JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that's exactly the15 JUSTICE SCALIA: What other reason?16 MR. GROSSMAN: The reason is as follows.17 This is what they refer to as barter contracts, two18 companies exchanging things, which is perfectly19 legitimate, there's nothing wrong with that. And there20 are certain ways to account for it properly, and what21 Arthur Andersen was telling Charter was in order to be22 able to have revenues included, gross revenues, you have23 to have unrelated -- unrelated contracts. They couldn't24 be a barter transaction. But there is no way -- no way25 that you could recognize the advertising revenues if151 you're using Charter's own money, and that's what Arthur2 Andersen did not do. It would be no different, Justice3 Scalia, if Charter delivered a suitcase filled with cash4 and gave5 from us.67 saying.8 can't be9 be bartering the advertising revenue for the increased10 money that you're paying.11 MR. GROSSMAN: No. You can barter. You can12 barter, it's just a question of how you account for it.13 But the bartering is one thing. I mean, that's one14 accounting principle relating to bartering, but there is15 no accounting principle that permits the recording of16 revenue if you're using the money from the seller. And17 that's why they disguised --18 JUSTICE ALITO: All right, just -- just to19 be clear on this -- if Charter and Arthur Andersen and20 Scientific-Atlanta and Motorola all sat down and cooked21 up this scheme together and they all knew exactly what22 was going on, would you have a claim against the23 Respondents here?24 MR. GROSSMAN: Yes. And the reason for25 that, Your Honor, is because the advertising contractit to them and said okay, buy the advertising   JUSTICE SCALIA:  I understand what you'reIt seems to me that when you say that theyconnected, you're saying precisely, you can't161 was a sham, and the advertising contract was a sham2 because Charter was giving the Respondents the money to3 buy the advertising.4 JUSTICE ALITO: Then I see absolutely no5 difference between your test and the elements of aiding6 and abetting.7 MR. GROSSMAN: The difference is here we8 would have conceptual --9 JUSTICE ALITO: Because you just said that10 it's not necessary for there to be an actual deceptive11 act on the part of the Respondents.12 MR. GROSSMAN: There has to be a deception13 -- there is deception. The deception is you're entering14 into an advertising contract that presents the illusion15 that you were purchasing advertising, when in fact you16 were not purchasing the advertising.17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's -- but18 that's not the fraud that was imposed upon the market.19 The fraud that was imposed on the market was Charter's20 accounting for the transaction on its books. Nobody21 bought or sold stock in reliance upon the way that22 Scientific-Atlanta and Charter structured their deal.23 They did so in reliance on the way that Charter24 communicated its accounting to the marketplace.25 MR. GROSSMAN: There was no way -- no way171 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that that could properly be accounted for, and theRespondents understood that.  And that's why they didwhat they did, that's what --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  But you're saying --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But there are -- there areany number of kickbacks and mismanagement and pettyfrauds that go on in the business, and business peopleknow that any publicly held company's shares are goingto be affected by its profits, so I see no limitation toyour -- to your proposal for liability.            MR. GROSSMAN:  Well, I think the limitationsare as follows, Your Honor.  Number one, there has to bethe purpose of furthering a scheme to defraudshareholders.  Number two, the test has an element ofmateriality, that it cannot be --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I agree with JusticeScalia's earlier comment, I don't think thatScientific-Atlanta and Motorola really cared anything of-- one way or the other about the investors.            MR. GROSSMAN:  Well, that may be that theydidn't care about the investors --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  For them the scheme made acertain amount of sense, they didn't really care.            MR. GROSSMAN:  Well, they may not have cared,but that would be reckless because they certainly181 understood --2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's far different3 from having a purpose. You said they have to have a4 purpose.5 MR. GROSSMAN: That's correct. If you just6 close your eyes -- if somebody comes to you and says,7 look, we want you to enter into this transaction, it's a8 phony transaction and we don't care -- do whatever you9 want with that, and they know it's a publicly held10 corporation and they have every reason to understand11 that this information --12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Which goes back to my13 earlier question, that most people that engage in14 frauds on business know that if it's a publicly held15 corporation, it's going to hurt the price of the shares16 or affect the price of the shares.17 MR. GROSSMAN: Well, they shouldn't engage18 in schemes to defraud, that's what Congress intended by19 section 10.20 JUSTICE SOUTER: But as I understand your21 argument, it is the difference between aiding and22 abetting liability on the part of the Respondents and23 liability as, in effect, as first line principles, is24 their intent, or at the very least in knowledge that25 they were committing a deceptive act as part of this191 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425scheme.  Is that correct?            MR. GROSSMAN:  That they have to commit thedeceptive act --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes.            MR. GROSSMAN:  -- with the requisite intent.That's correct.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Now, how many times areparties of the position of Respondents ever going toengage in those acts except with exactly the state ofmind that on your judgment makes them principals, ratherthan aiders and abettors.            MR. GROSSMAN:  It is not on my judgment.  Ithas to be pled with the particularity required by thePSLRA.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  No.  No, I realize that youhave to plead it.  What I'm getting at is:  Are youmaking a distinction that in the real world is not adistinction?  That, in reality, no one is going to dowhat these Respondents did without the kind of knowledgeor intent that makes them, on your theory, principalsrather than aiders or abettors?            MR. GROSSMAN:  No, there are cases, I think,Your Honor, where they can engage in deceptive conduct,and there would not be the purpose to defraudshareholders.  For instance, Charter may have come to201 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425them and said look, do me a favor, says the salesmanager.  I want to make my numbers for this period so Ican take my wife on a trip to Hawaii that the companywill give me.            So the company gives him a phony order,thinking that's the purpose of it.  That's the purposeof the phony order to help this guy along.            Well, you've engaged in a deceptive act.  Itmay be deceptive under 10(b), but you wouldn't satisfythe "purpose" test, because the purpose --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  In other words, it'sdeceptive but not deceptive in relation to, or for thepurpose of, deceiving the -- someone like the Petitioner.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, wouldn't it --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  But don't aiders andabettors have to have that purpose as well?  Whatdistinguishes -- what distinguishes the liability thatyou propose from aider and abettor liability?            MR. GROSSMAN:  You have to engage in adeceptive act under 10(b).  10(b) prohibits any deceptiveact.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  I thought you were tellingme that in each case there may be a deceptive act butnot a deceptive act in relation to somebody like thePetitioner here.211 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            MR. GROSSMAN:  Exactly.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  But that's a differentanswer, I think, from the one you were just givingJustice Scalia.            MR. GROSSMAN:  No.  I -- I understood,perhaps mistakenly, from Justice Scalia that therewasn't a deceptive act in your hypothetical.  If thereis a deceptive act, then it's prohibited by 10(b), andwe move to the next statute --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  So any aiding-and-abettingthrough a deceptive act makes you a principal?  Is thatit?  You can't be an aider and abettor by committing orenabling a deceptive act without becoming a principal?            MR. GROSSMAN:  No.  Not at all.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  You cannot?            MR. GROSSMAN:  You, yourself -- you,yourself, have to engage in the deceptive act.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.            MR. GROSSMAN:  Your own deceptive act.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but -- but if you do,or if you should have known, you are not an aider andabettor.  You are automatically a principal.            MR. GROSSMAN:  You may be a principal if yousatisfy the other elements of our test, which areserious elements that you have to plead with221 particularity, with the heightened pleading standards,2 that they have the purpose to further a scheme to3 defraud. That's very different --4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it fair to say that all5 aiders and abettors who commit deceptive acts are6 principals?7 MR. GROSSMAN: No.8 JUSTICE SCALIA: What's the difference?9 What separates the two?10 MR. GROSSMAN: There are tests. You have11 to take it the next step further, because whether or12 not that deceptive act had the purpose and effect of13 furthering a scheme on investors.1415 an aider or1617 have to have --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Don't you need that to beabettor?MR. GROSSMAN:  An aider or abettor?  YouJUSTICE SCALIA:  If I'm entirely innocent,--MR. GROSSMAN:  An aider -- certainly --1819 and I don't 2021 certainly, the primary violator in the situation that we22 are discussing where there are deceptive acts is aiding23 and abetting.24 I mean, if an accountant comes in and25 deliberately falsifies a financial statement, he is231 giving substantial assistance to the company's statement2 -- the company who is issuing those false statements.3 He would be an aider and abettor in that sense. He is4 also a primary --5 JUSTICE SCALIA: You see, I really thought6 the difference was that the principal is the one who7 makes the deceptive representation and obtains money8 from it. The aider and abettor is the person who9 facilitates or enables that deceptive representation,10 which is what we have here.11 MR. GROSSMAN: No.12 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you say if you13 facilitate knowingly and intentionally or even grossly14 negligently, you are not an aider and abettor, but15 you're a principal. I really don't understand what's16 the line between the two.17 MR. GROSSMAN: If you facilitate with a18 deceptive act, then you're a primary violator. That's19 what section 10(b) prohibits. If you facilitate without20 a deceptive act, then you are an aider and abettor.21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Grossman, before you22 finish, there is one statement made by the other side23 that you are trying to use this -- small in comparison24 to all the fraud that was involved here in order to25 collect on the entire loss. That is, you are asserting241 that the vendors are liable for the entire loss when2 they were just a bit player.3 MR. GROSSMAN: Yes. We are not seeking that4 at all, Your Honor. We -- the PSLRA proportionate5 liability provisions govern this with respect to --6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So what are you seeking?7 How would you measure your damages?8 MR. GROSSMAN: We would measure the damages,9 number one, that flow from this particular scheme. We10 would have to first subtract the settlements that have11 been achieved already, and then the proportionate12 liability provisions of the PSLRA provide how you make13 this determination.14 You look at the particular nature of their15 conduct, and you look at the extent to which their16 particular conduct had a causal relationship with the17 damages.18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Grossman, I'm19 conscious of eating into your time but a question -- how20 many chains of this connection can you have? Let's say21 Charter was not a publicly traded company, but same22 thing happened with respect to Scientific-Atlanta, and23 that made it look valuable to a company that is publicly24 traded. So they decided to buy Charter and then that25 made their profits look better to investors. Can you --251 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425how many chains in the link can you go?            MR. GROSSMAN:  Well, I -- I think you can goso long as the person's deceptive conduct has thepurpose of furthering a scheme to defraud.  If theyengage in some deceptive conduct that was not infurtherance of the scheme to defraud, that's the end ofthe chain.  I --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,Mr. Grossman.            MR. GROSSMAN:  Thank you, Your Honor.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Shapiro.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO.                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS            MR. SHAPIRO:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:            My friend has just asked the Court to expandan implied cause of action by diluting traditionalrequirements such as the reliance requirement and byeroding this Court's precedent in the Central Bank case.            The Court has said in the past that it mustbe very cautious about expanding implied causes ofaction, but here there are special reasons for caution.Expanding the implied cause of action would giveplaintiff the very thing that Congress said it shouldnot get in section 20(e) of the Exchange Act.261 Congress wanted cases like this one to be2 handled by an expert and disinterested administrative3 agency.4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's if you equate this5 with aiding-and-abetting, and I think the question is is6 there a middle category between Charter, who is7 clearly primarily liable, and Central Bank, that didn't8 do anything deceptive?9 MR. SHAPIRO: The Central Bank case, I10 believe, answers that by saying to be a primary violator11 you have to satisfy all the prerequisites of 10(b)12 liability, including reliance, loss causation, the13 "in-connection-with" standard. And here plaintiffs fail14 to meet these tests. And Congress in 20(e) --15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are saying -- I16 thought your argument, unlike the government's argument,17 is that there was no deceptive device. There was no18 deceptive device. They simply aided and abetted.19 MR. SHAPIRO: Yes. That's one of the20 arguments we make. It is this case is governed by21 Central Bank because the defendant did not use or employ22 deception in connection with a securities transaction.23 That exactly describes what Charter did.24 Now, what exactly describes what the vendors25 are alleged to do is what is said in 20(e) -- to271 knowingly give substantial assistance to someone else2 that is misleading an investor. That fits this case3 like a glove --4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I thought -- I agree5 with Justice Ginsburg. I thought the "in-connection-with"6 argument is actually in addition to or separate from an7 additional argument you made that there was no deceptive8 statement made here. I thought that's what you were9 arguing, and I have problems with that argument because10 the statute doesn't require a statement. It requires11 -- conduct suffice.12 MR. SHAPIRO: We don't make these arguments13 without reference to each other. We think all of these14 statutory terms have to be viewed together. You have to15 use deception in connection with securities trading,16 which these vendors did not do. That's what Charter17 did.And--18 JUSTICE SOUTER: You don't defend the19 position --20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you say that there21 was deception, standing alone?22 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, we have -- we have23 suggested that that is not true when you're speaking24 with somebody that knows the facts such as Charter.25 Charter understood all these facts. Charter could have281 accounted for these transactions correctly, itself. The2 vendors did that. They didn't recognize any revenues3 here. It was up to Charter to account for these4 transactions properly. Congress required it to do that,5 so it is the speaker here.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Charter said --7 vendors, I need you to consummate this fraud on the8 public. I can't do it without you. I've got to have9 those revenues that you're going to give me through10 these phony advertising payments at four or five times11 the usual rate.12 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, we believe even placing13 that most pejorative characterization on these facts,14 which we don't agree are the true facts, that still --15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you must assume that16 they are now.17 MR. SHAPIRO: Assuming that they are, that18 this is a 20(e) situation where it is alleged that the19 vendors gave substantial, knowing assistance to somebody20 who was committing a fraud. And Congress said that an21 expert and disinterested administrative agency should22 decide whether to proceed, because it is so slippery to23 apply these characterizations.24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's if they are --25 that's if they are aiders and if there are only two291 categories and everyone who is not Charter is an aider2 and abettor, then you're right. But if there's a middle3 category of people who, while not the benefited company4 -- the company that's trying to achieve the deception --5 but made it6 happen.78 description9 that the trustee entered --10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: No --11 MR. SHAPIRO: -- into a secret agreement.12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In Central Bank, it was13 conceded that the bank engaged in no deceptive act.possible for that -- for that deception toMR. SHAPIRO:  Well, you know that's an exactof Central Bank because there it was allegedMR. SHAPIRO:  Well, the --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Here there is the chargeengage in deceptive acts.MR. SHAPIRO:  What was conceded was that the141516 that it did 1718 bank made no statement to investors, but what was19 alleged in the complaint and argued in the briefs was20 that the bank entered into a secret side agreement that21 enabled the use of a fraudulent prospectus that22 unleashed securities that were worthless on investors,23 and investors said, we were depending on our trustee to24 prevent that from happening.25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Now, I take it, though, you301 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425do not defend the position that there must -- for 10(b)liability -- that there must have been a statementaddressed to investors.            MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, we -- we think that forreliance purposes, there --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, do you --            MR. SHAPIRO:  -- the defendant has tocommunicate with investors.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Would you answer myquestion first?  Do you take the position that there canbe no 10(b) liability without a statement addressed toinvestors?            MR. SHAPIRO:  It has to be communicated tothe investors and it has to be attributed under the caselaw to the speaker.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  You mean the statement assuch or a statement which could not have been made butfor the statements of the Respondents must becommunicated to the investors?  Which one?            MR. SHAPIRO:  That -- that kind of but-forcausation is not sufficient.  That is not reliance.That kind of --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  So are you -- so you aresaying that there can be no causation and hence, youknow -- and I think you're going further.  You're saying311 there can be no liability within the description of2 10(b) unless there is a statement directly addressed to3 the investors, is that correct?4 MR. SHAPIRO: That is one of our5 submissions, but we also say that the substance of these6 statements was never communicated to investors. Only7 Charter --8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because the whole purpose9 ofit--10 MR. SHAPIRO: -- spoke to the investors and11 never summarized these.12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shapiro, if --13 MR. SHAPIRO: Yes?14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If it was communicated to15 investors that there had been $20 per set box over the16 regular price, if there had been advertising that was17 paid for by18 whole thing19 the vendors20 counts. If21 whole thing2223 Your Honor,24 There was no duty to disclose to investors here. The25 only communications the vendors made were "we're raisingthe very money that Charter gave, then thewould have failed.  So this can work only ifare silent.  Silence and not speech is whatthe vendors communicate anything at all, thefails.MR. SHAPIRO:  But the -- the communication,has to be to the market and to investors.321 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425our prices 6 percent, the date of our contract is August31st, for the simple reason that it started the verynext day” --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Was there any --            MR. SHAPIRO:  -- on September 1st."            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Was there any economicsubstance to this?            MR. SHAPIRO:  Oh, of course.  There waseconomic substance from the vendors' perspective.  Theywere selling their products at exactly the price thatthey wanted to receive for those products and they weregetting some free cooperative advertising thrown in atthe same time.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is it true that the pricethat they were charging, they did not charge to othercustomers -- the $20 hike?            MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, it's true because theyweren't concerned with that because they weren't payingfor it.  Charter was paying for this cooperative --cooperative advertising, the reason being --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it was --            MR. SHAPIRO:  -- that Charter had a biginterest.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- a sham then, becausethey said the reason they upped the price $20 a box was331 they -- the inflationary conditions, so they had to2 renegotiate the contract, but didn't renegotiate with3 any of their other customers.4 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, Your Honor, from the5 vendors' perspective, this was a transaction that6 appeared to be a way to increase cooperative7 advertising. It cost the vendors no money. They were8 told by Charter that Arthur Andersen had approved the9 transaction. That's alleged in the Barford indictment.10 Then they went home and talked to their own auditors --11 how do you account for this unusual transaction? The12 auditors said, you cannot record any revenues from the13 transaction. They didn't record any revenues. They14 expected Charter to do the same thing, to not record15 revenues --16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that's --17 MR. SHAPIRO: -- if that's what the rules18 required.19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that's not the20 allegation of the complaint. I -- I thought the21 allegation of the complaint was that they -- they22 knew that this was a fraud and they participated in23 the fraud.24 MR. SHAPIRO: Yes, they -- they do allege.25 I'm merely pointing out that in the Barford --341 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I mean that -- so that2 your answer doesn't seem to be -- get us very far on a3 legal point.4 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, we say that if you take5 the complaint at face value and you don't even consider6 the Barford indictment that they cite, that it still is7 a classic example of knowingly giving substantial8 assistance to someone else that is making misstatements9 to investors, because these vendors didn't make any10 misstatement to investors. Nobody relied on their sales11 correspondence. It sat in a file drawer until long12 after the stock had gone all the way up and come all the13 way down.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's the essence of the15 scheme. You said that they -- they are home free16 because they didn't themselves make any statement to17 investors.18 statements,19 fact didn't20But they set up Charter to make thoseto swell its revenues -- revenues that it inhave.MR. SHAPIRO:  But Congress's policy judgment21 here is that the SEC, an expert agency that is22 impartial, should evaluate a claim of that sort and23 decide whether to proceed.24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's if they are aiders25 and abettors, which is what Congress covered. And I351 again go back to, is there another category or is2 everyone -- either Charter, the person whose stock is at3 stake, the company whose stock is at stake and everyone4 else is an aider? I take it that that's your position.5 67 whose stock8 abettor.9MR. SHAPIRO:  Well --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It's either the companyis in question or you're an aider andMR. SHAPIRO: You are only a primary10 violator under -- under Central Bank if each and every11 element of 10b-5 liability is satisfied, including12 reliance on your statement, including the13 "in-connection-with" test, and including loss causation.14 None of those tests are satisfied here, but what is15 satisfied is section 20(e), which says, did they16 knowingly give substantial assistance to somebody who is17 committing a fraud? And that -- that fits this case18 like a glove --19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If we accept --20 MR. SHAPIRO: -- if Congress wanted the SEC21 to address --22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If we accept your theory23 of the case and we then get another case in which an24 accountant or an attorney who prepares the statement for25 publication to the investors and then gives it to361 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Charter, and they are before us, could we find liabilityunder 10b-5 as to the accountants and still rule -- andstill keep our ruling in favor of your client here?            MR. SHAPIRO:  It really depends on --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And if so, what would --            MR. SHAPIRO:  -- on the circumstances.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And if so, what would bethe rationale?            MR. SHAPIRO:  Some attorneys are controlpersons within corporations, and in-house counsel thatdrafts the disclosure statement which contains afalsehood may be liable as in the McConville case, whichthe Court recently considered.  Individuals may beliable --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How about outsideaccountants and attorneys who deliberately and directlyparticipate in negotiating -- or in drafting the falsedisclosure statements?            MR. SHAPIRO:  I --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could they be liable andunder your theory of the case, but your client notliable?            MR. SHAPIRO:  It -- it's possible.  YourHonor, at the end of your --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well what about in this371 case? Let's be specific. As I understood an earlier2 answer of yours, the answer was that Arthur Andersen3 knew what was going on. If I've -- if you are -- and4 as I understand it, that's not what was charged -- but5 if that's correct, Arthur Andersen did know what was6 going on. Can Arthur Andersen be held liable under7 10b-5 --8 MR. SHAPIRO: Absolutely --9 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- whereas your client10 cannot?11 MR. SHAPIRO: Yes, sir. The reason --12 JUSTICE SOUTER: And the difference is?13 MR. SHAPIRO: The reason is they issued14 opinions that were circulated to investors, that were15 attributed to them and which were authorized by them,16 and if a lawyer does the same thing, if Steve Shapiro17 writes an opinion letter and circulates it to investors18 and it's full of falsehoods --19 JUSTICE SOUTER: But --20 MR. SHAPIRO: -- I can be held liable for21 that --22 JUSTICE SOUTER: What if Arthur Andersen --23 MR. SHAPIRO: -- as a speaker.24 JUSTICE SOUTER: What if Arthur Andersen has25 a footnote in there saying, this is okay because we have381 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425this -- this letter from I forget which one of the twoRespondents it was, saying there's been inflation andtherefore we've got to renegotiate the prices and jackthem up 20 percent, Arthur Andersen knows that that isfalse and the Respondent who made it knows that it isfalse, can the Respondent who made it then be heldliable?market --reliance.MR. SHAPIRO:  Only people who speak to theJUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes, but doesn't --MR. SHAPIRO:  -- and induce investor            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes, but doesn't -- doesn'tthe Respondent in that case know that it is likely thatthe auditor is going to indicate the basis for itsstatement, that the transaction is okay --            MR. SHAPIRO:  Well --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- and, therefore, isn't itreasonable to suppose that they anticipated that theirstatement would be communicated to the market?            MR. SHAPIRO:  That is just aiding andabetting, and in fact Congress dealt with that squarelyin section 303 --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  But there's a communicationto the market there --39123 expect that 456 difference? 78 Congress addressed that in section 303 of9 Sarbanes-Oxley, and it held that any person -- said anyMR. SHAPIRO:  Oh, yes --JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- and there's a reason tocommunication.MR. SHAPIRO:  Yes.JUSTICE SOUTER:  Doesn't that make anyMR. SHAPIRO:  That is not sufficient.10 person including a vendor that misleads an auditor can11 be held liable in an SEC proceeding only, not in a12 private suit. It excluded private actions.13 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is the word "only" in14 there?15 MR. SHAPIRO: Pardon me?16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is the word "only" in17 there?18 MR. SHAPIRO: The word "exclusively" is in19 there --20 JUSTICE SOUTER: In the statute?21 MR. SHAPIRO: -- and my --22 JUSTICE SOUTER: So you have an independent23 defense quite apart from -- from the construction of24 10b-5?25MR. SHAPIRO:  We rely on 20(e) and 303 of401 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Sarbanes-Oxley, and my friend has made the argument --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Which I thought speakabout aiders and abettors.            MR. SHAPIRO:  It's talking about an aiderand abettorthat misleads an auditor and then --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But is usually --MR. SHAPIRO:  -- the auditor issues a falsecertification.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- aider and abettor --then again we get back to the question:  If there'snothing in this world other than the company that putsout the false statement and the aider and abettor --            MR. SHAPIRO:  Well -- oh, no --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- and is there somethingin between?            MR. SHAPIRO:  Your Honor, there are otherpersons that are control persons within a company whoare liable.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But we're taking those out.We're talking about independent actors.            MR. SHAPIRO:  Independent actors that don'tspeak to the markets and cause direct reliance on theirown statements are aiders and abettors.  And they are supposedto be dealt with by the SEC, an expert agency.            Now, my -- you know, my friend made the411 argument about Sarbanes-Oxley that there's a savings2 clause in that provision that preserves other remedies.3 But if you look at the legislative history, it says4 explicitly we are preserving SEC remedies. We want the5 SEC to pursue these suits. And Congress refused in 20026 in Sarbanes-Oxley to reinstate the aiding-and-abetting7 private liability cause of action.8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you know, Mr. Shapiro,9 if in the law of torts and the restatement of torts or10 in other areas of the law there is some third11 classification that's between aider and abettor in12 principle?13 MR. SHAPIRO: I don't know the answer.14 Although in these statutes themselves there are such15 provisions not included in section 10(b). For example16 in section 18(a), if you cause some other person to make17 a false statement in a financial statement, you can be18 held liable, but they are not invoking it in section 18.19 Same thing under section 17. If you engage in a scheme20 to cause some falsehood, you can be prosecuted by the21 government.22 But nowhere has Congress said that an23 individual litigant can bring a claim like that without24 regard for reliance and "in connection with" and the25 loss causation test.421 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Let's assume there isreliance and loss causation.  Let me ask a question verysimilar to what Justice Ginsburg has posed a couple oftimes.  She has said is there a third category.  Myquestion is, is there an overlap?  Can there be anoverlap?            MR. SHAPIRO:  No, I don't think there can be.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why?            MR. SHAPIRO:  Because Congress intended insection 20(e) to have an expert agency address thesecases and not to have the trial --            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Congress intended an expertagency to address solely aiding-and-abetting cases.  Myquestion is if there is an overlap -- A, can there be anoverlap?  And if so, I don't see why Congress's intent toreserve aiding-and-abetting alone to the agency affectsthe determination of this case.            MR. SHAPIRO:  We believe they are separatecategories and that Central Bank tells us exactly whothe primary violator is.  He is somebody who makes astatement that investors rely on in connection withsecurities transactions, and that is not these vendors.That is exactly what section 20(e) addresses and commits--            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Could you amend that to431 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425say -- you don't insist that he make a statement thatinvest -- he could engage in a deceptive practicedirected at investments?            MR. SHAPIRO:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Wedon't quarrel over that, Justice Scalia.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  For example, for example,let's assume in this case that Charter said we've, we'vegot to let the investors know that our cost of doingbusiness is going up, and we want to you make anannouncement that you're jacking up your price 20percent.  In that case there would be primary liability.            MR. SHAPIRO:  Absolutely.            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why in that case is therenot also aiding-and-abetting?  We know perfectly wellwhy they are doing it, and they are doing it solely toaid and abet Charter in its scheme themselves enjoyinga wash transaction.  Why isn't that both primary andaiding-and-abetting?there here.isn'tthose      MR. SHAPIRO:  Well, it's primary becauseis the communication to the market that's missing      JUSTICE SOUTER:  We know it's primary.  Whyit also aiding-and-abetting?      MR. SHAPIRO:  You can call it -- both ofthings.441 JUSTICE SOUTER: If you can call it, why2 isn't there the kind of overlap which raises the3 question that Justice Ginsburg has raised?4 MR. SHAPIRO: You can't have primary5 liability, which they are asserting here, without the6 statement to the market. And it can be a statement by7 conduct, and it can be by nodding of the head.8 JUSTICE SOUTER: So you are saying there can9 be an overlap but there is no overlap that helps the10 Petitioner in this case?11 MR. SHAPIRO: Oh, yes. Nodding the head is12 the same thing as saying yes. But it has to be made13 directly to an investor and cause reliance by that14 investor. That's what's missing here.15 So there is nothing wrong with the Eighth16 Circuit's decision. It didn't address that refinement,17 because it has no bearing on this case. So there is no18 point in reversing the decision. It has to be affirmed19 in our view for want of reliance, for want of loss20 causation, for lack of "in connection with", and because21 most importantly, Congress intended to remove this22 category of case and commit it to an expert agency as23 part of its very important reform effort to deal with24 excessive litigation that was harming our economy.25 This was an important concept for Congress.451 And it said it twice: First in the PSLRA in 1995, then2 in 2002, in the Sarbanes-Oxley law. And it removed even3 claims that you mislead an auditor under section 303 of4 Sarbanes-Oxley. And there is no savings clause there5 for private actions. Congress refused to permit the6 private actions.7 Instead, it permitted the SEC to bring8 intentional misconduct cases under section 20(e) or9 negligent misconduct cases under section 303 or under10 section 13. And the SEC has a broad panoply of11 remedies. It doesn't have to just allege intentional --12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does the SEC distinguish13 this kind of situation where silence is the essence of14 the thing for the deceiver, silence not speech? Does15 the SEC distinguish this from aiding-and-abetting?16 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, the SEC's view is the17 one rejected by the Solicitor General, and that's this18 purpose-and-effect standard that's been advocated, which19 we think is hopelessly vague. And it overrides the20 reliance requirement. It overrides the "in connection21 with" requirement. And it overrides loss causation, not22 to mention Central Bank.23 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Shapiro, what is your24 strongest case, in your view, for the reliance25 requirement?461 MR. SHAPIRO: Central Bank itself.2 JUSTICE STEVENS: Central Bank itself?3 MR. SHAPIRO: Because the Court there4 said that even though the bank did something that was a5 secret agreement that facilitated the issuer's6 distribution of a false prospectus and caused all the7 harm to the shareholders, it was a direct sine qua non8 cause of all of that harm, that that was merely aiding9 and abetting, because there was no reliance on anything10 that the bank stated or anything that the bank had a duty11 to state because of a fiduciary relationship.12 Now, the vendors here are even far more13 removed from investors than the bank was in Central14 Bank. The investors knew about the bank in Central15 Bank, and they were relying on it to do its job. But16 that was not sufficient because it made no statement17 that the investors relied on. There is no18 communication here between these vendors and investors.19 There is no way you could --20 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Shapiro, in your21 judgment, is the reliance requirement an element of22 the violation or of the private cause of action?23 MR. SHAPIRO: It's the private cause of24 action. An important point, Justice Stevens, because25 the SEC is not burdened with any of these elusive471 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425inquiries into but-for causation, speculative questionsof indirect reliance; none of that burdens the SEC.            And the SEC also has power to distributefunds to investors.  This is the better mousetrap thatCongress prescribed for these kinds of cases.  It didn'twant the trial lawyers to bring class actions thatalways result in settlements.Mr. Shapiro.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,MR. SHAPIRO:  We thank the Court.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Hungar.    ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR     ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,           AS AMICUS CURIAE,        SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS            MR. HUNGAR:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:            The court of appeals erred to the extent itheld that section 10(b) applies only to verbalmisrepresentations or omissions.  But the courtcorrectly held that this Court's decision in CentralBank forecloses Petitioner's claim here.  Like theplaintiff in Central Bank, Petitioner cannot establishreliance, a critical element of the section 10(b)implied right of action.481 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            Neither Petitioner nor the market relied onor was even aware of any deceptive conduct or statementby Respondents --            JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Hungar, I want to besure I understand one part of the government's position.You do take the position that there has a violation of10b-5?            MR. HUNGAR:  We haven't taken a position onthat question, Your Honor.  We take the position thatthere was deceptive conduct alleged.  The -- one of theelements of a 10b-5 violation, but not the onlyelement.            JUSTICE STEVENS:  Were the other elementspresent?            MR. HUNGAR:  As I say, we have not taken --I mean, materiality, for instance, the "in connectionwith" requirement, scienter, we haven't addressed thosequestions and have not taken a position.            JUSTICE STEVENS:  Do you have an opinion asto whether there was a violation of 10(b) in this case?--MR. HUNGAR:  No, Your Honor.JUSTICE STEVENS:  You don't have an opinion?MR. HUNGAR:  We haven't taken a position, andJUSTICE STEVENS:  I know you haven't taken a491 position, but I was just wondering if you have an2 opinion?3 (Laughter.)4 MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. We haven't5 addressed the other elements and those -- questions that6 we have -- because there is no need to resolve them in7 this case and because they weren't resolved by the court8 of appeals or by the district court, we have chosen to9 focus on what we think is dispositive and what was10 raised and decided below, which is reliance.11 JUSTICE STEVENS: You have not reached12 opinion as to whether there was a violation of the13 statute?14 MR. HUNGAR: Correct.15 JUSTICE SOUTER: Has the SEC publicly taken16 a position on that question?17 MR. HUNGAR: I'm not sure of the answer to18 that question, Your Honor. Certainly individual19 commissioners have given speeches and testified before20 Congress to the effect that the Commission voted in this21 case to agree with our position on deception, the22 position that's expressed in our brief, and by a23 three-to-two vote to disagree with the position on24 reliance that is expressed in our brief. But I don't25 know that there has been any official SEC Commission501 statement to that effect that's been publicly released.2 As I said, the only deceptive conduct that3 was allegedly committed by Respondents in this case4 involves the backdating of contracts and the false5 justifications for the price increase. That conduct was6 never disclosed to the market at any time during the7 class period, and therefore, could not have been relied8 on by the market or by Petitioners.9 And as a consequence, under this Court's10 decisions in Central Bank and in Basic, reliance cannot11 be established because the presumption of reliance that12 Petitioner seeks to invoke requires as a prerequisite to13 its invocation the existence of a publicly disseminated14 statement from the defendant that was disseminated to,15 and therefore, relied on by the market. That did not16 happen here with respect to Respondents.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could the SEC get any18 monetary recovery for the investors on your theory? You19 say yes, it's a deceptive practice, but this belongs in20 the SEC's bailiwick, not in private suits?21 MR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor.22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Private suits; obviously23 they are seeking damages for the decline in the share24 price. What could the SEC -- suppose it should take up25 this case -- get by way of remedy?511 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            MR. HUNGAR:  The SEC is entitled to obtaincivil fines, as well as disgorgement remedies.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there is nodisgorgement here because the vendors didn't getanything.  For them it was a wash.            MR. HUNGAR:  Well, I don't know -- I believein the, not in this case but in the Adelphia case, whichis addressed --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, but this case,disgorgement would not be a remedy.  You say fines,but those would be payable to the government, right?            MR. HUNGAR:  If I may -- yes, yes and no, Ithink is the answer to that question; because under thefair funds provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, section308 of Sarbanes-Oxley, the SEC is authorized to takefines and distribute those -- add those to disgorgementrelief -- and distribute them to investors.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there would be nodisgorgement relief.            MR. HUNGAR:  Well, I'm not surewith that point.  In the Adelphia matter --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What profitsvendors get?  For them it was a wash.  TheyI can agreedid thegot -- whatdid they have to disgorge?            MR. HUNGAR:  Well, they obtained -- at least521 it appears that they obtained advertising that2 presumably had some value, although it didn't cost them3 anything; and presumably the SEC could seek the value of4 that advertising. As I said, in the Adelphia matter5 where the SEC did pursue the vendors that assisted6 Adelphia in a somewhat similar transaction, it obtained7 substantial monetary recoveries from them. I --8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But did they receive9 something that they then disgorged?10 MR. HUNGAR: I believe the allegations were11 similar to those presented here. But in any event,12 certainly the SEC has the authority to proceed in that13 fashion, and additionally the Justice Department has14 the ability to proceed criminally and obtain substantial15 monetary sanctions, either as part of a deferred16 prosecution agreement, as part of a restitutionary17 sanction and the like; but the fundamental point is that18 for the private right of action to apply, as this Court19 said in Central Bank, all of the elements of the private20 cause of action must be satisfied with respect to the21 individual defendant. That is the line.22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree, do you23 agree with Mr. Shapiro, what I understood to be his24 argument, that 20(e), the aider and abettor statute,25 more or less occupies the field here and there is no531 role for additional 10b-5 liability?2 MR. HUNGAR: Well, I wouldn't say that it3 occupies the field per se, but what it does do is --4 given the timing of this Court's decision in Central5 Bank in 1994, followed by Congress's considering the6 question whether to provide for secondary liability7 in private actions, and its decision not to authorize such8 secondary liability -- what it does clearly suggest is9 that this Court ought not adopt the expansive view of10 the implied right of action that Petitioner is urging,11 but instead both because the Court is appropriately12 cautious in expanding liability under implied rights of13 action, and because Congress has now looked at this14 question, not once but twice, and has declined to15 provide secondary liability for secondary actors under16 the cause of action.17 JUSTICE SCALIA: You think that you are18 either a principal or an aider and abettor?19 MR. HUNGAR: You can -- it's possible for20 someone to be both but in order to be both they must21 have -- they must have satisfied all of the elements.22 JUSTICE SCALIA: For the same act, I'm23 talking about -- for the same act.24 MR. HUNGAR: Yes. For instance an auditor25 who certifies false financial statements and allows541 that -- its certification to be, to be publicly2 disseminated, thereby aiding and assisting in the3 issuer's primary fraud, but is also a -- quite likely to4 be a primary violator, because they have spoken to the5 market. The market is relying on their statements, and6 is aware that they are making them; and so they would be7 both a primary violator, but could presumably be pursued8 as an aider and abettor. I don't think there is any9 preclusion of liability under both, but in order to be10 in that category you must be a primary violator. And11 here, Petitioners have not established and cannot12 establish the reliance element with respect to13 Respondents, because nothing that Respondents said or14 did was disseminated to the market during the class15 period.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And I take it in your viewestablish the "in connection with"1617 they cannot18 argument?19 2021 there is no22 with" --2324 say that, Your Honor, because the SEC and the United25 States do not have to establish reliance in criminal orMR. HUNGAR:  We have not taken a position --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Prior to the statment,reliance, but that there is "in connectionMR. HUNGAR:  Your Honor, I would hesitate to551 civil enforcement proceedings, but we do have to2 establish "in connection with," and we think they are3 different. We think reliance adds something more than4 what "in connection with" requires, and so I certainly5 would urge the Court not to suggest that merely because6 reliance is not established, therefore "in connection7 with" must not also be established; and that is one of8 the reasons why we think that the "in connection with"9 question is best resolved, not in this case, but in the10 case where it's been squarely presented, and preferably11 a government enforcement action where the government12 has an opportunity to tailor the case in an appropriate13 fashion.14 The Court, as I said has been --15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's at least a16 little awkward for you to say we should wait for a case17 in which it's been fully presented when the argument18 you're making here wasn't fully presented, or at19 least not decided below.20 MR. HUNGAR: I think it was, Your Honor. It21 was certainly briefed and argued in both the district22 court and the court of appeals. The district court23 squarely resolved it at page 41a of the petition24 appendix. The court of appeals addressed reliance at25 page 10a of the petition appendix. It did not give it a561 fully orbed discussion.2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understood the3 court of appeals' decision to be based on its4 determination that there was no deceptive act because5 there was no statement or omission.6 MR. HUNGAR: But on page 10a, they also talk7 about reliance, Your Honor; and what's important here to8 understand is that Petitioner's theory of reliance9 rests on a misstatement, because they say the market10 -- it's a basic presumption of reliance based on the11 fraud-on-the-market theory case. That's the only12 allegation of reliance in the complaint; that requires13 something publicly disseminated. The only thing that14 was publicly disseminated is the statement. What the15 court of appeals said is, that doesn't work, there was16 no reliance because Respondents didn't make any publicly17 disseminated statement. So it's actually, perhaps not a18 complete, but certainly a perfectly reasonable resolution19 of the reliance question; and therefore it is squarely20 presented. Petitioners raised reliance in their petition21 --22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't see --23 MR. HUNGAR: -- at page 25. In their24 opening brief at pages 37 to 40, it's squarely presented25 and --571 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I'm looking at the courtof appeals decision which I thought just said that therewas no deceptive device.            MR. HUNGAR:  Your Honor, on page 10a, thesecond line, the first full sentence, speaking ofMotorola and Scientific-Atlanta, "they did not issueany misstatement relied upon by the investing public,"and then it goes on the next sentence:  "None of thealleged financial misrepresentations by Charter was madeby or even with the approval of the vendors," that isthe Respondents.            Again as I say, it's not as complete adiscussion of the reliance issue as we would havethought appropriate if we had been writing the opinion,but it certainly does touch on the question and we thinkit's wholly presented.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,Mr. Hungar.            Mr. Grossman, have you three minutes.        REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY M. GROSSMANmake.   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. GROSSMAN:  Thank you.I -- excuse me, I have three quick points toOne, Mr. Shapiro and Mr. Hungar both said581 that the advertising cost the vendors no money. Well,2 if the advertising cost them no money, why was there a3 contract that they entered into for the purchase of4 advertising? Clearly it was designed to give the false5 appearance that Charter had this additional $17 million6 in revenue.7 Number two, the SEC did take a position in8 the Simpson case as it submitted an amicus brief;9 Commissioner Cox testified before a House committee this10 past spring that they wanted to submit the same brief on11 the same points supporting the position that we are12 taking here; and the testimony of Commissioner Cox is13 appended to the briefs of Congressmen Franks and14 Conyers.15 Number three, Central Bank did not turn on16 reliance. Central Bank turned on the issue of deceptive17 conduct. There was no deceptive conduct in that case.18 The plaintiffs conceded there was no deceptive conduct;19 the court of appeals and the district court said there20 was no deceptive conduct; it was strictly an aiding-and-21 abetting case.22 With respect to the reliance issue in23 Central Bank, what the Court did say was under24 plaintiff's theory he wouldn't have to prove reliance.25 He only had to prove that he -- that the defendant591 substantially assisted a defendant who engaged in a2 primary violation, but he would not have to prove any3 reliance by the aiding and abettor.4 Number three, with respect to 20(e), how do5 my friends on the other side read 20(e) in connection6 with section 9 and section 18 of the Exchange Act, each7 of which provides remedies and private rights of actions8 against multiple parties? Under their definition, that9 would appear to be displaced by 20(e). 20(e) was not10 designed, it was not intended to do anything but to give11 the SEC the right to bring the very type of aiding-and-12 abetting action that this Court barred in Central Bank.13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,14 Mr. Grossman. The case is submitted.15 (Whereupon, at 12:00 p.m., the case in the16 above-entitled matter was submitted.)17181920212223242560
