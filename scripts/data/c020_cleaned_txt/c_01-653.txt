NextWave Personal Communications and a companion case. Mr. Clement.ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERFEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSIONGENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice and may itplease the Court:Congress has directed the FCC to use auctions toallocate scarce wireless spectrum in a manner that furthers the public interest. Those auctions allocate spectrum to the party who will -- who values the spectrum most highly and, by assumption, will use it most effectively to serve the public. In addition, Congress has directed the FCC to consider a number of specific factors in assessing the public interest, including promoting opportunities for small business and ensuring the rapid deployment of wireless services. Nothing in that public interest regulatory regime runs afoul of section 525 of the Bankruptcy Code.To be sure, in administering its auctions the FCC does place consequences on the regulatory signals41111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 provided by the failure to meet regulatory payment2 deadlines. In particular, the FCC views the failure to3 make a timely regulatory payment as a proxy for a4 determination that continued possession of the license is5 not in the public interest.6 QUESTION: But your point is, is that the7 regulatory discretion and authority of the agency has been8 replaced under the statutory scheme in large part by the9 dynamics of the free market. The highest bidder shows us10 which is the most qualified person.11 GENERAL CLEMENT: That's right. It's been12 replaced in large part but not exclusively, and I think13 both aspects that are important --14 QUESTION: Well, as to the first part, isn't the15 Bankruptcy Code and the policy of new start and creditors16 and so forth, isn't that really part of the free market17 structure?18 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think there's a19 difference, though, when a regulator regulates solely for20 timely payment for its own sake, and in that case it21 implicates only the policies that are addressed by the22 Bankruptcy Code, and I think it's a different situation23 when the regulator looks at the failure to make timely24 payment as a proxy for something else.25 QUESTION: Well, but Mr. Clement, in your51111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 petition for certiorari, the question presented speaks of2 an obtained option automatically canceled. That suggests3 that it is indeed automatic.4 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, it's automatic in the5 sense --6 QUESTION: I mean, automatic means without any7 discretion.8 GENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice, Chief9 Justice Rehnquist, when it says automatic, what it means10 is that it cancels without any, the need for any further11 action from the commission, but in any given case, the12 cancellation of a license is a result both of the13 automatic cancellation rule and the fact that a payment14 deadline has come forward, and where the commission has15 discretion is in relaxing the payment deadline, and you16 can see that in this very case. NextWave's license is17 canceled, according to the FCC, because NextWave failed to18 make the very first installment payment due under those19 licenses.20 Now, according to the licenses in the first instance,21 that payment was due on April 30, 1997, but the licenses22 didn't cancel on April 30, 1997 because the commission in23 its discretion, as part of a multifactor public interest24 determination, extended the payment deadline a full 18￼25 months.61111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 QUESTION: Well, Mr. Clement, it appears to me2 that the FCC went along with the bankruptcy filing, filed3 a claim for the amount that wasn't paid, and apparently4 went along with the proposals for a while to work this out5 and then, very shortly before the decision to reauction6 the things, the FCC decided not to go along with it. That7 doesn't sound like some automatic cancellation. I mean,8 the FCC appeared to treat it very much like the bankruptcy9 claim for quite some time, didn't it?10 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, to be sure, the FCC11 participated in the bankruptcy proceedings and protected12 its interests as a creditor, but at the same time it has13 independent interests as a regulator, and the FCC, as we14 point out on page 19 of the reply brief, made clear at15 various points well before NextWave went into bankruptcy16 that it did not view bankruptcy as an exception from the17 regulatory provisions of the Communications Act, and I18 think if you look at the specific event that NextWave19 points to as the automatic cancellation, it's the failure20 to make a payment that was due on October 29, 1998, and it21 was due on the 29th of October, 1998, rather than April22 30, 1997, precisely because of a public interest23 determination by the commission.24 QUESTION: You say a public interest25 determination, but the only correlation that seems clear71111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 to me is a purely economic correlation. When the value of2 the leases dropped, the FCC apparently went into the3 Bankruptcy Court and said, we want our full $4 billion,4 and when the value of the leases went up, the FCC took the5 position, we want to reauction them and get the increase6 in value. It seems at each point at which the FCC made a7 decision, it was making an economic decision, not a8 regulatory decision.9 GENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice Souter,10 I don't think that's correct. When -- I mean, it is true11 that the FCC tried to go in and protect its interests as a12 creditor, but at the point that NextWave was trying to13 keep its regulatory licenses that it promised to pay $4.714 billion for, and trying to keep those licenses for just15 over a billion, the result of that process would have been16 that the rest of that amount, the $3 billion plus, would17 have been an unsecured claim of the FCC, that would have18 been really worth virtually nothing, so I think the better19 way to understand this case is that the FCC does have20 interests as a creditor, and it has tried to protect those21 interests in the bankruptcy proceedings and has22 participated in those proceedings, but at the same time,23 it has interests with the -- as a regulator, and in its24 capacity as a regulator it hasn't acted in a way that25 would result in a sole-cause cancellation.81111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Mr. Clement, suppose -- and I consider this a classic case for what this provision of the Bankruptcy Code was directed to. Suppose you have a State law that says anyone who is in default of traffic tickets that amount to more than $500 shall have his license revoked, okay, and the person in question goes into bankruptcy, doesn't pay the $500, gets the $500 discharged in bankruptcy, the State you think can revoke his license?GENERAL CLEMENT: No, I don't, but let me giveyou --QUESTION: Why not? Isn't there a regulatory purpose there?GENERAL CLEMENT: No. The only regulatory purpose there, at least as I understand your hypothetical, is in providing for timely payment, but suppose a State --QUESTION: No, the regulatory purpose is having financially responsible drivers so people don't run around the road hurting people and leaving them to bleed on their own account.GENERAL CLEMENT: Well --QUESTION: There's just as much a regulatory purpose in that hypo as there is here.QUESTION: You can always find a regulatory purpose. I mean, it's the easiest thing in the world to91111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 do.2 GENERAL CLEMENT: But again, but if a State had3 a regulatory purpose in ensuring that its drivers were4 financially responsible, and presumptively said that a5 license would fail to cancel for the failure to pay $5006 in traffic tickets, but provided a mechanism for the7 driver to go in before the regulatory commission and say,8 look, I know I haven't paid $500 worth of traffic tickets,9 but I'm actually financially responsible. I have a ton of10 money in the bank, and so you ought to give me a11 relaxation of the rules or a waiver --12 QUESTION: There's always such a mechanism13 whenever you have a debtor and a creditor. The creditor14 can always extend the payment.15 GENERAL CLEMENT: Right, but --16 QUESTION: You need some special power from the17 State to do that?18 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, but again, if you look,19 and what the regulator is doing is extending the --20 extending the payment not as a creditor, but as a21 regulator, I think you're in a very different situation.22 QUESTION: So you're just making up a regulatory23 purpose, as a regulator. I mean, as a regulator, as a24 creditor you can always say it's being done as a25 regulator, always.101111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 GENERAL CLEMENT: I really don't think that's2 true, with respect. I think the kind of waiver proceeding3 or opportunity to relax the rules would be out of place in4 a regulatory regime that was only concerned with timely5 payment. It's precisely because the FCC uses the timely6 payment, or the failure to make timely payment, as a proxy7 for a public interest determination that it has this8 waiver proceeding, and it gives the regulating entity --9 QUESTION: That's something that I don't fully10 grasp in your argument. First you say, this is fully11 automatic, this cancellation of the license. You don't12 pay up, license gone. But then you say, but we can extend13 the time if we want to. We can use our discretion. Well,14 the automatic argument seems at war with the discretion15 argument.16 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I mean, there is some17 tension there, and the FCC has been at pains to try to18 make sure that it doesn't bend over one way too far or the19 other. In its restructuring order that I think is20 critical in this case. It froze the payments -- it21 suspended the payments ultimately for 18 months, and then22 it also provided some restructuring options that required23 further modifications of its rules.24 QUESTION: Well --25 GENERAL CLEMENT: When it did that --111111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Go ahead.2 GENERAL CLEMENT: When it did that, not only did3 some people complain that they didn't give enough4 regulatory relief, but other disappointed bidders ran to5 the D.C. Circuit and said, look, you've acted arbitrarily6 and capriciously because you haven't stuck with your7 pre-auction rules.8 QUESTION: But this doesn't sound at all like9 the question presented, which says at auction,10 automatically cancel upon the winning bidder's failure to11 make timely payments to fulfill its winning bid. It --12 when you were drafting that question, it sounds like your13 perception of the thing was quite different than it is14 now.15 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, again I think the key16 is, the payments do cancel automatically after all the17 efforts to get the payments extended have failed, and18 that's just not like a hypothetical consideration in this19 case, because in this very case --20 QUESTION: I agree, you've said two different21 things there. If it's automatic, it happened without22 whatever happened next. But you're saying it23 automatically canceled after attempts to collect failed.24 GENERAL CLEMENT: No, no, not after attempts25 to--121111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: So when was the automatic trigger?GENERAL CLEMENT: The automatic trigger is when somebody fails to make a payment --QUESTION: All right. Is that enough?GENERAL CLEMENT: And -- no, it's really not enough, if you look at the broader perspective of the regulation, because there's an alternative way to get out of the automatic cancellation. It's not -- if you're a regulated entity and you don't want your license to cancel, you don't go to the commission and say, don't apply the automatic cancellation. What you do is, you go to the commission and you say, I've a regulatory payment. It's going to be due April 30. I'm not in a good position to make that payment, so what I'd like you to do is relax the payment deadline, and --QUESTION: And you say you have the authority to relax the payment date?GENERAL CLEMENT: Not only does the commission have the authority to do that --QUESTION: If that's true --GENERAL CLEMENT: -- it did it in this verycase.QUESTION: If that's true, why don't you settle the case today? They say they can pay in full today. GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, the reason we don't131111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 settle the case today, although obviously there were2 efforts to try to settle this, which would require3 congressional legislation, which we were unable to get in4 a timely fashion, but the reason that they are not ina5 position to cure their defaults, if you will, is because6 our view is that they have -- the opportunity to cure has7 passed. The licenses have actually already --8 QUESTION: But is the option to cure -- if you9 wanted to settle, would you be disabled from settling, or10 could you settle, decide, well, we think it would be wise11 regulation now to accept the payment?12 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think it would be within the13 agency's discretion to settle the litigation at this14 point. Now, of course, if we did that, I'm sure, as in15 the last time the commission tried to relax its rules, I'm16 sure we'd draw a D.C. Circuit challenge to that exercise17 of discretion to relax the rules. But the very fact that18 there is that reservoir of discretion to relax the rules19 demonstrates that the ultimate cancellation is not a20 sole-cause cancellation.21 QUESTION: I think -- so it is really a legal22 issue, whether you have that discretion or not? I mean,23 there are people who say you don't have that discretion.24 GENERAL CLEMENT: Absolutely.25 QUESTION: Well, do we have to decide that in141111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 this case? I didn't realize that was one of the issues2 presented. That may be a more important issue than the,3 you know, 456few billion dollars involved here. GENERAL CLEMENT: Well -- QUESTION: Right?(Laughter.)GENERAL CLEMENT: But I don't think -- whether8 or not the FCC has the authority to exercise that9 discretion in a particular case might be an issue, but10 it's undisputed that they have that right as a general11 matter and, in fact, NextWave wouldn't be here today if12 the FCC didn't have the authority to offer discretionary13 relaxation of its rules. When NextWave's --14 QUESTION: Well, you might not be here, but I15 mean, we're just assuming that it had that. The case is16 here. That is not one of the questions presented. I17 frankly don't want to decide that question, because that18 is not one of the things I've given a lot of attention to.19 It sounds to me very, you know, at least quite arguable20 whether they ought to have that authority.21 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, I don't22 really think it's in dispute, because in this very case23 the payment deadline --24 QUESTION: I agree it's not in dispute, which25 means we don't have to decide it. It's not presented in151111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200057￼1 the case. 2345 makes a6 and you7 anyway.8QUESTION: -- the question.GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I --QUESTION: Mr. Clement, the respondent alsoright-to-cure argument under the bankruptcy law, haven't addressed that, I take it, in your briefs,GENERAL CLEMENT: No. We think the9 right-to-cure argument is best addressed on remand. Ido10 think there are two reasons why the right to cure is not11 any longer available to NextWave. One is that the12 licenses automatically canceled on their own terms. The13 second reason is that the license restriction, the14 licenses themselves had a restriction on transfer or15 alienation, and there's law under 11 U.S.C. 365 that deals16 with executory obligations that says that the debtor in17 possession cannot take possession of a license, assume the18 obligations of a license if there are restrictions on its19 alienation or transfer.20 QUESTION: In FCC practice, have you ever21 revoked a license and then decided that you're going to22 reissue it to the initial holder?23 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, there have been24 situations like that, not necessarily in the C-Block25 license situation, but there was a situation with respect161111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 to a different program where a license canceled by its own2 terms by a failure to renew, and the commission renewed3 that license largely on the basis of the fact that that4 licensee was already providing service, and so the result5 of revoking the license would be to deny people service6 that was currently being provided.7 Now, in the reconsideration order that's the8 subject --9 QUESTION: Well, a reconsideration order is10 different, but a new issuance it seems to me is quite11 questionable so far as the discretion of the agency, and I12 think I agree with some of my colleagues, I'm not sure13 that's before us.14 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think that particular15 instance is particularly relevant, because NextWave relied16 on that in its reconsideration proceedings before the17 commission. And the commission, in rejecting that, I18 think demonstrated why this isn't a case of sole-cause19 cancellation. If you look at the commission's reasoning20 on page 82a of the petition appendix, the commission says,21 quote, "NextWave is providing no service. The spectrum22 licensed to NextWave has gone unused since early 1997, and23 represents licenses in 90 markets across the United24 States."25171111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼QUESTION: But that same order repeatedly refers1 to the automatic cancellation rule.2 GENERAL CLEMENT: Absolutely, it does, and what3 the commission decided in this order, which is under4 review in this case, is that it was not going to relax or5 provide an exception to the automatic cancellation rule,6 but the reason it decided that is because NextWave wasn't7 providing service, and that others stood ready to provide8 service under that spectrum, and what I would respectfully9 suggest is that under those circumstances the cancellation10 is not a sole-cause cancellation.11 It also reflects the fact that NextWave wasn't12 providing service, that others stood ready to do it,13 that's enough to take it out of 525, which is, after14 a very narrowly written provision. It only protects15 against sole cancellation. It allows the failure to16 dischargeable debt to be a contributing factor in a17 regulatory decision, indeed, the primary factor in the18 regulatory decision, just not the sole cause.19 QUESTION: May I ask just one question about20 your interpretation of the automatic cancellation? Is it21 the commission's view that they could -- there would be a22 cancellation, they could reauction the licenses, and that23 the original licensee would still remain liable for the24 entire debt?25 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think the position is they181111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005and all,pay a￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425might have an opportunity to go after that as an unsecured debt in bankruptcy.QUESTION: Yes, but they would remain liable for the entire debt, in your view?GENERAL CLEMENT: That's true.I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.QUESTION: Well, may I just follow up on that? I mean, I assumed that was not an issue here because they had auctioned them off again and they had mitigated their damages. Is that the way the commission treated it?GENERAL CLEMENT: That's an open question before the commission that they haven't addressed.Thank you.QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Clement. Mr. Franklin, we'll hear from you.ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS ARCTIC SLOPEREGIONAL CORPORATION, ET AL.MR. FRANKLIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:The question in this case is whether section 525of the Bankruptcy Code permits a bankrupt company and a bankruptcy judge to override the FCC's regulatory determination of the public interest and thereby allow the191111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425company to retain an exclusive entitlement to use the Nation's airwaves that the FCC and Congress have determined is not in the public interest for it to hold.QUESTION: You refer to it as a regulatory determination which, of course, assumes the whole point at issue.MR. FRANKLIN: Well, I don't think it -- I think that that, in fact, is undisputed as this case comes before the Court, that the FCC had valid regulatory reasons for taking the action it did.QUESTION: Then why is it phrased in terms of an automatic cancellation rule?MR. FRANKLIN: Because the automatic cancellation happened in November of 1998, but one cannot look at that as a mere snapshot. You have to look at the reasons why the FCC had that rule and the reasons why the FCC had their auction --QUESTION: Why do you have to look at the reasons? I mean, that's what troubles me. The language of the statute simply says that a governmental unit may not revoke a charter, franchise, or other similar grant, okay -- it goes on, solely because --MR. FRANKLIN: Right.QUESTION: -- such person is or has been a debtor, blah, blah, or hasn't made a payment. Solely201111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425because.MR. FRANKLIN: Right.QUESTION: Now, let's assume that there is a Federal statute that makes discrimination because of, or failure to hire someone, or let's say, let's say killing someone solely because of his race --MR. FRANKLIN: Yes.QUESTION: -- a crime, a separate crime. And someone, let's assume he kills someone who is Jewish, and he said, well, I didn't kill him solely because he was Jewish; I killed him because I disagree with the policies of Israel. Does that get him out of the statute?MR. FRANKLIN: Well, I'm not aware of a like that, that says, solely because --statuteQUESTION: Oh, I made it up.MR. FRANKLIN: I know that, but -- (Laughter.)MR. FRANKLIN: But it's important. The￼section 525 is drafted -- is an antidiscrimination statute, butit's drafted differently than other -- title VII, for example, does not use the word --QUESTION: I'm getting to the question of whether the fact that you have some other motive --MR. FRANKLIN: Yes.QUESTION: -- eliminates the sole causality.211111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 The only reason this person was killed was because he was2 Jewish, and so also here, the only reason this license was3 terminated is because the person hadn't paid.4 Now, there may be some regulatory motive in the5 background, just as in the hypothetical that I invented6 there was some international political motive in the7 background, but that doesn't alter the fact that the8 person was killed solely because he was Jewish, and it9 seems to me that the license here was revoked solely10 because the payment hadn't been made.11 MR. FRANKLIN: With respect, Your Honor, the12 term because, when it is used in antidiscrimination13 statutes, and we have cited cases on page 3 of our reply14 brief, is used to mean motive. Because means, for the15 reason that. That's what the definition of the word,16 because -- when Congress drafted section 525, it drafted17 the statute narrowly. It intended to prohibit￼18 arbitrary 1920 anything,21 license, whenever there's a license involved, you can say22 that there is some regulatory motive, as in the23 hypothetical that I gave to Mr. Clement.24 MR. FRANKLIN: Well --25 QUESTION: The motor vehicle cancellation.221111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005--QUESTION: Then the statute doesn't cover because every regulatory body that cancels a1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. FRANKLIN: I think that -- under section 525, the mere fact that an agency has said it has a regulatory motive is not sufficient. It has to be a valid one that is not simply an arbitrary attempt to collect a debt, and, Your Honors --QUESTION: Okay, can -- on that point, do you agree that the statute is a response to -- the Perez case, the automobile cancellation?MR. FRANKLIN: Yes.QUESTION: There was a regulatory motive there. The regulatory motive is financially responsible drivers. The benefits of that are obvious.MR. FRANKLIN: Well --QUESTION: So if that situation is supposed to be covered by the statute, then by a parity of reasoning, so would this one be.MR. FRANKLIN: But in Perez the Court examined that motive and determined that looking at the statute and looking at the way it operated, in fact, as the Court put it, the sole emphasis of the statute was not the regulatory purpose. It was -- as the Court said, the sole emphasis was the collection of debts.QUESTION: Okay, then sole emphasis and sole purpose really boils down not to exclusiveness but a kind of proximate or principal causation theory, and if that's231111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 the case, certainly here the FCC treated the debtor2 relationship as the principal determinant of the various3 steps that it took. First, it insisted on its 4 billion,4 then when the market changed it said, forget it, we want5 to reauction, and if it's a principal or proximate kind of6 causation theory, I don't see how you can prevail.7 MR. FRANKLIN: I don't think that section 5258 embodies a causation theory in the way that Your Honor is9 postulating. I think that section 525 most specifically10 speaks about which are the valid considerations that an11 agency can look at, and in this case one needs to look at12 the auction system that Congress established.13 Congress intended to replace the cumbersome14 comparative hearings and unjust lotteries of the past with15 a new, more streamlined mechanism under which an16 entitlement to use our airwaves, everybody's airwaves, is17 allocated to the person that, or the company that values18 it the most, and the way we know that is that they must19 make good on the promises embodied in their auction bid.20 QUESTION: Then why doesn't automatic mean21 automatic? Your brother has just explained that automatic22 means sometimes.23 MR. FRANKLIN: Automatic --24 QUESTION: It means automatic without teeth.25 MR. FRANKLIN: Automatic means automatic,241111 14th Street, N.W.

FRANKLIN: Well --(Laughter.)MR. FRANKLIN: Our position in this case isthat the cancellation was automatic, but that it was supported by valid regulatory concerns, and those concerns -- I mean, the auction system mandated by Congress would be completely vitiated if a bidder -- and I represent people that, companies that are repeat players in this game. Bidders cannot come in and obtain an entitlement to use our airwaves by promising that they will make a payment, and that's the reason why they're selected --QUESTION: Then Mr. Franklin, why didn't Congress provide an exception, as it did in, for perishable commodities for the Department of Agriculture?MR. FRANKLIN: Well --QUESTION: If there is this nonbankruptcy overriding concern, then we have one example where Congress responded to it by saying the bankruptcy provision isn't going to prevail.MR. FRANKLIN: Well, I -- no exception was needed here. The agriculture programs allow the Secretary of Agriculture to do what the FCC may not do here, and251111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 that is to cancel a license solely because of a failure, a2 bankruptcy status.3 Now, if you look at the statutes that are cited4 in our reply brief, the agriculture statutes, they allow5 the Secretary of Agriculture to terminate an agricultural6 license where somebody has been discharged from7 bankruptcy, ever in the past, or even if a partner or a8 shareholder of a company has been discharged from9 bankruptcy.10 Now, the legislative history of that specific11 exemption makes clear that Congress -- there was a debate12 in Congress as to whether the solely because language13 would cover that, whether there was a regulatory purpose14 or not, and Congress felt like they didn't want to have to15 deal with that.16 In this case, however, it is undisputed there17 was a valid regulatory purpose, and with respect, Justice18 Scalia, I do not --19 QUESTION: Of course, nothing in the Federal20 Communications Act requires the Federal Communications21 Commission to stand as the guarantor, you know, to hold22 the bag for the person that they're giving away this23 multibillion-dollar license to. They could require cash24 on the barrelhead, couldn't they? And let the person who25 wants the license get a loan from some bank, let them be261111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 stuck holding the bag.2 MR. FRANKLIN: But even in that --3 QUESTION: So there's no regulatory necessity4 for this whole tragedy, is there?5 MR. FRANKLIN: No, with respect, if one looks at6 a cash-on-the-barrelhead system, the way the FCC auctions7 work, and our clients are deeply involved in them, one8 does not get the license right after becoming the high9 bidder. There is a period of time in which the FCC has to10 look at various factors and people have the right to file11 petitions to deny. Under NextWave's interpretation of12 section 525, which prohibits an agency from denying a13 license to anyone for failing to pay a dischargeable debt,14 under their interpretation the FCC would be required to15 grant a license to somebody who has been declared the high16 bidder and then declares bankruptcy the next day.17 What NextWave is doing here is truly gaming the18 system. They are saying, it's a heads I win, tails you19 lose scenario. We can go into bankruptcy, we get the20 license because we promised that we would pay more than21 anybody else would --22 QUESTION: May I stop you in your hypothetical,23 because I thought you don't get the license till after you24 have make the down payment.25 MR. FRANKLIN: You make a down payment, and271111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 NextWave made their down payment.2 QUESTION: Yes, but they didn't have any license3 until they did that.4 MR. FRANKLIN: But what I'm saying is, even on a5 cash-on-the-barrelhead system the FCC does not require6 full payment, it can't require full payment until they7 actually grant the license, and that is a several-month8 lag between the time when you're declared the high9 bidder -- in one case, in my client's case it was more10 than a year after they were declared the high bidder for11 licenses, and they actually received them, because of12 proceedings that were filed.13 QUESTION: The rationale offered by the14 commission here was that the policies of the FCC outweigh15 the policies of the Bankruptcy Act. Is there authority16 for us to defer to the commission in making that kind of a17 determination? I mean, why don't we defer to the18 Bankruptcy Court, which says the policies of the19 Bankruptcy Act are more important than the policies of the20 --21 MR. FRANKLIN: I don't think that the FCC has22 deference in interpreting the Bankruptcy Code, but I don't23 think it's a question of whether one policy outweighs the24 other. I think --25 QUESTION: Well, that's the explicit rationale281111 14th Street, N.W.

FRANKLIN: Our rationale is that they can be harmonized, and should be harmonized. For example, the exception, the regulatory exception to the automatic --QUESTION: So that you don't defend the rationale offered by the commission?MR. FRANKLIN: I'm not sure that that exact rationale, but we think that the policies harmonized and should be harmonized.QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Franklin. Mr. Verrilli.ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSMR. VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and please the Court:is the can bemay it￼The record is clear that the FCC revoked NextWave's licenses solely because NextWave deferred a payment to the FCC while reorganizing in bankruptcy. Two and a half years ago the FCC blocked NextWave's bankruptcy reorganization, and it did so by announcing that NextWave's licenses had automatically canceled because NextWave had deferred a loan payment to the FCC in 1998.QUESTION: What do you mean, had deferred it?291111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. VERRILLI: Well, because NextWave -- QUESTION: You mean, failed to make it?MR. VERRILLI: It did not make it, yes. It didnot make it.QUESTION: Why don't we say that?MR. VERRILLI: It did not make it (Laughter.)MR. VERRILLI: -- in 1998. QUESTION: There might have beenmumbo-jumbo that had caused the payment notMR. VERRILLI: Well, we were reorganizing inbankruptcy --QUESTION: You didn't pay it. You didn't payit.MR. VERRILLI: -- and we did not pay because we were reorganizing, that's right.Now, throughout the proceedings in this case the FCC has never identified a ground, other than that single nonpayment, that would support revocation of the licenses, and that's because there isn't one. What the FCC has done instead, and what it's done here this morning, is to instead suggest that section 525 of the Bankruptcy Code ought not apply because the FCC had a regulatory or public interest purpose for making a nonpayment an automatic sole trigger for revocation of a license, but in passing the301111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005--some legalto be due.￼1 Bankruptcy Code, Congress already weighed the public2 interests, and section 525 of the code is a clear3 expression of Congress's4 interest lies.5 QUESTION: But6 What do you say to that?7 MR. VERRILLI:8 completely refutes that proposition, and it does so in the9 following ways. The regulation that they cite, which isjudgment about where the public they say it's not automatic.I think the record utterly and10 1.2110 of their rules, and it's at page 495 of the11 appendix to the petition, says that the licenses cancel12 automatically upon nonpayment. The face of the license13 says that the licenses cancel automatically upon14 nonpayment and for no other reason.15 The announcement of the license cancellation in16 this case in January 2000 said that the licenses canceled17 automatically for nonpayment and no other reason.18 QUESTION: But we know how the commission has19 interpreted it. I mean, they did say, we're going to give20 you a moratorium. We're going to give you a chance, and21 we'll make a deal for you. You give back some of those22 licenses, and we'll work out a settlement, and for one23 year the FCC said, it's okay if you don't pay while we're24 considering some kind of settlement, so --25 MR. VERRILLI: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, in the311111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 restructuring orders they did do that, but that doesn't2 make the revocation any less automatic. All it did was3 move the date back in a legislative, quasi-legislative4 rulemaking, move the date from when it would initially5 have occurred to a later time. When --6 QUESTION: But if there had been such a7 settlement, then there could have been some, at least,8 licenses retained even though there had been the9 nonpayment, which is supposed to be an automatic trigger.10 MR. VERRILLI: Well, yes, Justice Ginsburg, but11 the date was suspended by the FCC well in advance. The12 payment date was suspended well in advance of its13 occurrence, so a payment date never came and went without14 NextWave or any other licensee failing to make a payment.15 All that happened here was that in advance of the payment16 date, the FCC moved the payment date, but when it did so,17 it reaffirmed --18 QUESTION: There had not been a failure to make19 an earlier payment?20 MR. VERRILLI: That's exactly right, Justice21 Scalia. This was suspended in advance of the due date for22 the first payment.23 QUESTION: Okay, so --24 QUESTION: Mr. Verrilli, let me ask you about25 something else. The bankruptcy court, as I understand it,321111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 ordered a $3.7 billion reduction in the purchase price on2 constructive broad grounds, is that right?3 MR. VERRILLI: That is right, Justice O'Connor.4 QUESTION: And if we were to affirm here, does5 the FCC have any power to prevent a bankruptcy court from6 reducing the price in that fashion?7 MR. VERRILLI: Yes.8 QUESTION: That's very strange.9 MR. VERRILLI: Yes, it does, and it's already10 been taken care of, in fact. The question under the11 avoidance provisions of the Bankruptcy Code is when the12 debtor's obligation becomes due, and the issue here was13 whether the obligation became due on the date of the14 auction or, instead, later, at the time the licenses were15 awarded. Now, that is a matter entirely within the16 control of the FCC. All they have to do is make clear in17 their regulations when the obligation attaches.18 The reason that there was a problem here was19 that the regulations suggested that the obligation20 attached later and, therefore, if the value of the asset21 declined from the time of the initial auction to the time22 of the license award, section 544 would apply. But the23 FCC has changed its regulations, and at this point it is24 unambiguous that the obligation attaches at the time of25 the auction -- and therefore 544 can't operate.331111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼12 aside the 34 nonissue.5 in any event it isn't -- the question really here is6 whether the FCC, when it effectively acts as a lender, is7 going to be treated any differently than a private company8 when it acts as a lender.9 QUESTION: That is the question. That's my10 question. As I read the statute, it seems to me, for at11 least your argument's sake, it is solely because, and12 moreover, of course this statute governs the FCC, but in13 reading the statute, I don't see how this statute was at14 all intended to govern the instance in which the15 Government is acting as creditor in respect to receiving16 payment for a good that it has sold.17 Now, I base that on first reading the purposes18 of this in the history, and reading the whole legislative19 history, which will not convince some of my colleagues,20 but nonetheless is a factor in what I think, and I think21 that this is clearly about a future loan, a future22 situation in which the future situation, the Government is23 forbidden to discriminate against a human being because he24 was once in bankruptcy.25 This seems to be to balance, to bring back into341111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005QUESTION: Well, didn't the second circuit set bankruptcy order in that case?MR. VERRILLI: -- and it did. It's just aIt's just -- that issue is just a nonissue, and￼1 balance the Government vis-a-vis the private creditor. If2 you're right in your interpretation, and I am wrong, I see3 no way whatsoever in which the Government would have the4 right to take a secured interest or in any other way5 collect a6 license.78 response. 9debt which a human being owes it for buying a Now, that's my question. I want to get your MR. VERRILLI: My response is the following,10 Justice Breyer. First, the text of 525 is unambiguous.11 It applies to someone who is or was a debtor, and it12 applies to debts that are dischargeable, as well as those13 that have been discharged and, therefore, it is clear on14 the face of the statute that it applies and protects15 companies while they are reorganizing and before the debts16 are discharged, so I think on the face of the statute17 that's -- it's not correct. It's not the right reading of18 the statute.19 And in terms of what it does in operation, it's20 this. Now, if -- if this had been a situation where the21 FCC had demanded cash on the barrelhead up front, and22 NextWave had gone and bid and gone out and borrowed that23 money from a bank, and had to pay the bank over time, and24 then filed for bankruptcy, there would be no question that25 that, that the debt to the bank could be reorganized and351111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425disposed of in the normal manner in bankruptcy. QUESTION: Well, I'm not sure about that. Ithink if you accept the FCC's argument here, they would say we have a regulatory purpose, because we want it -- we want these licenses to be given to people who have the financial responsibility to operate the radio stations and so forth. The arguments they made would continue to apply to that situation.MR. VERRILLI: Well --QUESTION: So I wouldn't say there's no question.MR. VERRILLI: That's a --QUESTION: I think if we accept their argument here, we would probably have to accept it in the other situation.MR. VERRILLI: Well, I think if we -- well, I think that that point is exactly right, Justice Scalia, that the Government's regulatory purpose argument, if accepted, would give them the authority to revoke licenses not only when the payment was not made to the Government, but not made to private parties.QUESTION: So far, I'm trying to get the answer to my question, and so far, in terms of my interpretation, the second point you made is in terms of to the applicability, if my interpretation is right. I want to361111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425know if it's right, and I only come up with one thing that you've said so far, which is text, which is important --(Laughter.)QUESTION: -- but I learned the second year of law school, I learned the second year of law school -- and obviously many of my colleagues don't agree with me, but I learned the second year of law school that when you have a text which says "all," that there are often implied, not- written exceptions. All animals in the park. No animals in the park doesn't necessarily apply to a pet oyster, okay, and so --QUESTION: Well, it's not an animal.QUESTION: Thank you. An oyster in my course in biology is an animal, all right.(Laughter.)QUESTION: Maybe in yours it was a rock, or avegetable or a mineral. But regardless, you seeand my question, of course, is that since that'sread statutes -- not everybody -- is that I find exceptions implicit in statutes where to fail to exception is to destroy the purpose of the statute, and is not backed by anything in respect to what the people who wrote it want.MR. VERRILLI: Well --QUESTION: Now, I believe it destroys the371111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼my point, how Iread that1 purpose of the statute because I see no way in which the2 Government as creditor could collect the money it's owed3 through a secured interest in what they've sold, if my4 interpretation is wrong.5 MR. VERRILLI: No, it --6 QUESTION: Now, I'm putting that as strong as I7 can. I want to get a complete answer.8 MR. VERRILLI: Two points. First, the9 Government can collect its interest as a secured creditor10 in exactly the same way a private lender could through the11 bankruptcy system. It has enormous protections through12 the bankruptcy system as a secured creditor. It gets,13 it's 100 percent entitled under the Bankruptcy Code to the14 full value of the licenses, and it has numerous other15 protections under the code. It can make an election16 under --17 QUESTION: Can I stop you right there? How does18 it do that? Because when it goes to enforce its secured19 interest, I take it it's revoking the license because of20 the money that was due it. And so how do you -- when you21 go in to enforce your secured interest in the bankruptcy22 court, and the bankruptcy judge on the other side reads23 525(c), 525 on your interpretation, how does he do it?24 Because it's just like this case. They're revoking it.25 MR. VERRILLI: You can't -- the FCC, like a381111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 private lender, can't foreclose on the lien. It has to --2 its debt has to be processed through the bankruptcy3 system.4 QUESTION: Of course it should. That's logical.5 My point is, how does the bankruptcy judge at that point6 get around the language of 525, on your interpretation of7 it, since on your interpretation of it, you would be8 taking back the license because of failure to pay a debt.9 MR. VERRILLI: Right. They can't -- under the10 Bankruptcy Code they can't take back the license. They11 can get their secured claim paid to the same extent that a12 private lender could, but they can't --13 QUESTION: So they cannot take a secured14 interest in the license?15 MR. VERRILLI: Yes, they can, and -- but just16 as--17 QUESTION: They don't take the license back if18 they cause the debtor to have to sell the license and to19 take the money from the sale of the license and give it to20 the FCC. Isn't that what's going on? That's different21 from a cancellation of the license. The license subsists,22 and the debtor can sell it to somebody else, or the23 bankruptcy court on behalf of the debtor can sell it to24 somebody else, is that right? Does that need approval25 from the FCC?391111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. VERRILLI: The transfer would, to somebody2 else would need approval from the FCC, but the key point3 here is that section 525 --4 QUESTION: But that's different from a5 cancellation, isn't it?6 MR. VERRILLI: Yes, it is different from a7 cancellation, and the key point here I think, Justice8 Breyer, in answer to your question ultimately, is that 5259 is in the Bankruptcy Code to protect the right to10 reorganize. What it says is that those who hold11 Government licenses cannot be denied the ability to invoke12 the bankruptcy process and reorganize solely because they13 do what the Bankruptcy Code allows them to do.14 Without this protection, licensing agencies would15 have the ability to force insolvent debtors to liquidate,16 because it would have the power to revoke their permission17 to do business solely because they hadn't paid a debt, or18 solely because even they were in bankruptcy, and that19 would --20 QUESTION: Can the FCC -- can an FCC licensee21 encumber the license? Can it pledge the license to22 some -- to a bank that's giving it a loan?23 MR. VERRILLI: Yes, it can. It can give it as24 a -- it can -- the answer to that is yes. There are some25 restrictions on it, but the answer to that is yes, it can.401111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 If I could, I'd like to get back to the question2 of whether this was, in fact, an automatic revocation, and3 the reconsideration order, which is the order under review4 here, is the order in which the FCC says principally that5 it departed from the automatic character of the6 revocation, but that reconsideration order says no fewer7 than 14 times by my count that the revocation was8 automatic, and there's one statement in that in particular9 which I think should put to rest as a factual matter the10 question of whether this was anything other than an11 automatic cancellation, and that's at page 74a of the12 appendix to the petition, and it's right at the bottom of13 the page, 1415 thus, the16 loss of its licenses, even under the rule interpretation17 it urges, was to avoid a default by making full and timely18 payment on or before the payment due date. If the only19 way that NextWave could have avoided default was by making20 the payment, then there is nothing else that could have21 been shown, and nothing else that could have happened in22 the reconsideration process or any waiver process, that23 would have provided an additional ground for revocation.24 And if I could also point the court to a25 statement on the prior page, page 73a: For all these411111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005before the footnote.And the FCC says in the reconsideration order, only way that NextWave could have avoided the￼1 reasons we reject NextWave's interpretation of our default2 and cancellation rules and reaffirm that the failure to3 make full payment in a timely manner, following exhaustion4 of all applicable grace periods, constitutes a default and5 results in the automatic cancellation of the license6 without further commission action.7 Their theory is that this happens by operation8 of law on the day after nonpayment. It is as automatic as9 anything can be, and nothing about the reconsideration10 process, and nothing about their waiver authority changes11 that one iota.12 QUESTION: Well, at least according to this13 presentation the FCC said that it does have discretion to14 grant relief from the automatic cancellation.15 MR. VERRILLI: Well, but they said in the16 reconsideration order that they were not going to do that,17 ever, because it was an automatic cancellation.18 They also said in the restructuring orders,19 Justice Ginsburg, that you referred to earlier, in each of20 the restructuring orders they said they would not grant a21 waiver of the payment deadline under any circumstances,22 and then when individual licensees sought waivers, the FCC23 rejected the waiver requests, and it cited back to those24 provisions in the restructuring order saying, we told you25 this was an automatic rule, and we reject your request,421111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 and it did so even in instances, in two cases where the2 licensees were providing service. And so there's just no3 question that this was an automatic cancellation rule and4 therefore precisely at the core of what section 5255 forbids the FCC or any other licensing agencies from6 doing.7 If I may, I want to turn to the question of8 whether there is any conflict between the FCC's exercise9 of its authority under section 309(j) and the Bankruptcy10 Code. The answer is, as a statutory matter there is no11 conflict, because the FCC was not required to have an12 installment payment plan, and even if it were required to13 have one there wouldn't be a conflict because Congress14 didn't say that the FCC had to make license revocation15 automatic upon nonpayment. So the FCC's argument really16 is an implied repeal argument here, that 309(j) implicitly17 repeals 525 in some applications, but --18 QUESTION: Assuming we think there's a conflict,19 is there any authority for the agency's assertion that it20 has the authority to determine which statute outweighs the21 other?22 MR. VERRILLI: Yes, and the authority is exactly23 contrary to the position that the FCC deserves deference.24 The FCC deserves deference only with respect to25 interpretation of its own statute, not with respect to the431111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Bankruptcy Code. So the answer is clearly that they don't2 get any deference, and -- but there isn't any conflict.3 All there is is the FCC -- there isn't any statutory4 conflict. All there is, the only conflict arises from the5 FCC's desire to make this an automatic cancellation rule,6 and the conflict is between an FCC policy choice and a7 directive from Congress. When the conflict is at that8 level, there's no doubt about what the answer is, which is9 that the directive from Congress prevails.10 QUESTION: If they just simply changed their11 rules to say the FCC "may" cancel the license in the event12 of the nonpayment of any13 enough?14 MR.

It depends25 upon the regulatory situation.441111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 MR. VERRILLI: I think that would violate 525,2 but for a different reason.3 QUESTION: Ah, okay.4 MR. VERRILLI: And it's this. 525 doesn't5 merely forbid revocation for nonpayment. It forbids6 discrimination, and it forbids imposing conditions solely7 because of nonpayment, solely because of being in8 bankruptcy, so --9 QUESTION: What does the word "solely" do? I10 can follow what you just said if it simply said because11 of, but Congress wrote solely, and that has to have some12 function.13 MR. VERRILLI: I think it does have several14 functions. For example, Your Honor, the FCC has a build-15 out rule for these licenses, says you have to build them16 out within 5 years, and to serve, a requirement that we17 were in compliance with, by the way. But if we hadn't18 been in compliance with them and the FCC had moved to19 revoke the licenses because we weren't in compliance with20 the build-out rule, and we had said, well, the reason we21 are not in compliance with the build-out rule is that22 we're in bankruptcy and we can't pay the vendors to build23 it out, that would be a situation in which the FCC could24 enforce its rule, even though at some level it is because25 we were in bankruptcy. It's just not "solely" because.451111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 It's because we violated a neutral rule that was not2 focused solely on nonpayment. And I think there would be3 other circumstances in which the fact of nonpayment could4 be a consideration in a broader or a different -- in a5 broader or different set of circumstances.6 But when you have what you have here, is where7 it is the only consideration, the only factor, the8 determinative consideration, that is the paradigm case of9 violation1011 12 13 14 1516 the Court:17 Clearly, we're dealing in 525 with something18 that is an exercise of regulatory power, and as several19 members of the Court have noted, it's always possible to20 say, even though we are revoking or canceling this license21 automatically because you didn't make the payment, we have22 other motives in mind, responsible, financially23 responsible drivers on the road. We are not simply out to24 get you because of the dollars.25 That's, of course, not what this statute is461111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005of 525. What the FCC has done, it's -- QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Verrilli. Mr. Tribe, we'll hear from you.ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE ON BEHALF OF CREDITORS NEXTWAVECOMMUNICATIONS, INC., as amicus curiaeMR. TRIBE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please￼1 about. The whole point of the Perez decision was to get2 rid of Kesler and Reitz, which required peering into the3 mind of the bureaucrats, not always a wonderful vision to4 behold, and not clear. This is a causation provision, and5 let me turn to Justice Ginsburg's question from the6 perspective of creditors who need to be able to rely on a7 bright line test of whether something was done solely8 because of nonpayment of a dischargeable debt, or solely9 because of insolvency, or solely because of an invocation10 of Chapter 11.11 The word solely, I think, does serve a function12 there, and that is, in its absence I suppose it would be13 possible for a licensee in regulatory default, a licensee14 who hadn't built out, to hide behind the existence of a15 fiscal default and say, you see, it's because of the fact16 that I didn't make a payment, not because I didn't build17 out. Then one has a complicated mess, and from the point18 of view of creditors who need to know whether an agency is19 going to pull out the lifeline without which this entire20 edifice collapses and is just a bunch of hardware, not21 worth anything more than the separate parts, from the22 point of view of creditors who need to know, it seems to23 me a very clear test is needed, and that is, was this the24 sole trigger? Have they come up with some other25 substantive, independent basis which either was the471111 14th Street, N.W.

Circuit said, and it makes sense.QUESTION: Mr. Tribe, what do you say in response to Justice Breyer's point that the statute really deals with a situation in which the Government agency is not the creditor? That's what it basically was --MR. TRIBE: Well, I -- in a way, I think that that makes our point all the stronger, that is, even when the agency has no conflict of interest, it might not be in it for the money, and one wonders here why, for example, why they don't yank the license when the debt is owed to private creditors? Doesn't that show in just the same waythat they're not reliable? That is, QUESTION: No, no -- well,is all.MR. TRIBE: Well, money --QUESTION: They want theirtaxicab licenses, there are nuclear power licenses -- licensing is the most common thing in the world. You often pay for it, and what I really am worried about is, imagine they took a secured interest in the license, and on your interpretation, how do they get the taxicab license back --MR.

TRIBE: -- does not cancel and at confirmation the license is one of the assets of the estate, and at that point --QUESTION: Well, they could get it back -- in other words, they could take it back because they didn't revoke it.MR. TRIBE: No, they don't take it back. That is, when -- there are a number of things in the estate at confirmation.QUESTION: I'm a creditor, I'm a private creditor, I say I have a secured interest in this, it's mine, okay. I sell it at auction. Now, the FCC --MR. TRIBE: I'm sorry, Justice Breyer. The bankruptcy court is filled with elaborate rules about when you can and cannot foreclose. That is, an asset is part of the estate at confirmation, and whether you're going to be able to get your money back is a function of whether you are under or oversecured. There are provisions in 1111(b) for dealing with both situations. Your situation is no worse when you are a regulator than the Bank of America, or one of the clients in our case, Citicorp, and491111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 no better.2 QUESTION: That's the part that's precisely3 bothering me, my situation is no worse.4 When I read the statute, it seems to me my5 situation is worse, because if the statute applies here,6 it applies there, and you and your colleague both tell me7 no, that isn't so, and if you can show me it isn't so, my8 problem disappears.9 MR. TRIBE: What I'm saying, Justice Breyer, is10 that after bankruptcy, if NextWave, for example, were to11 emerge from bankruptcy they would still have the license,12 but only on conditions in which you as the FCC, like other13 creditors, in light of your secured interest, had taken an14 appropriate piece of the pie. You don't get it all,15 that's the point. Nor does a private creditor get to16 grab the license and all the value from all the other17 creditors and, in fact, when you are an agency that is18 wearing really two sets of shoes, the ordinary regulator's19 running shoes but also the wing tips of the creditor20 agency, it makes the situation worse, not better.21 That is, this law is designed to assure that22 even the agency, which does not have a monetary interest,23 can't simply yank all the value for itself because it has24 the power over this license.25 If the agency, on top of all that, is a creditor501111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 and has that additional set of incentives, then it's all2 the worse. You wonder, for example, why it is that in the3 MMDS licenses, in which there are licenses that are held4 by a number of bankrupt licensees who did not make the5 payments they promised to make, why it is that the FCC6 does not regard them as not having been what they looked7 like at the time of the bid. The reason is that it's been8 paid in full. So it really is a situation in which the9 FCC's position as a creditor should not redound to its10 credit. If anything, that makes this statute all the more11 vital.12 The capital formation that is necessary to make13 309(j) work, to make it possible, Justice Scalia,14 sometimes not to demand all the money up front, but to15 have something more creative, maybe demand letters of16 credit, guarantees, none of that can work if creditors who17 put in over half a billion dollars, not in a gamble but on18 a very careful business plan that was completely carried19 out, they're not providing service, but Catch-22, it's20 because their attempt to emerge and fully cure any default21 was frustrated by the agency that saw pie in the sky,22 large numbers.23 In that situation, for the agency to be able to24 collapse the capital formation here tells us something25 rather unpleasant about the future. How likely is it that511111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Citicorp and the California and Kansas pension funds and2 all of the other organizations that have put money in on3 reliance on the way section 525 works will do this again4 next time around?5 The formation of capital, the market on which6 the FCC chose to rely, choosing to rely in the capacity of7 a first lender, with no more or less secured protection8 than others, that whole system depends on, in the most9 literal sense, the rule of law. It does not depend on the10 question whether we can attribute to the regulator some11 motive that does not relate solely to the money. So if12 the system is to work the way the FCC claims, 525 is a13 dead letter.14 Now, if you were right, Justice Breyer, if there15 really was a problem that couldn't be solved in the way16 the confirmation rules work, in the way the pie is divided17 up, then maybe, as with perishable commodities, there18 would be a problem for Congress to solve. Congress has in19 section 523 enumerated 18 categories of debts that are not20 dischargeable in bankruptcy, and sometimes it does it in21 another statute, not always in the Bankruptcy Code. These22 are policy judgments about whether something is unique23 about the situation that requires treating the Government24 in some different way, the way the Department of25 Agriculture is treated.521111 14th Street, N.W.

TRIBE: Thank you.QUESTION: Mr. Clement, you have 3 minutesremaining.REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERFEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSIONGENERAL CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.Let me first address Justice O'Connor's very proper concern that licensees are going to be able to enjoy their licenses for much less than they agreed to pay the commission. That is not a dead letter and, in fact, one of the cases that is being held for this case involves Kansas PCS, where the bankruptcy court approved the plan that gave the FCC 5 cents on the dollar for the value of its licenses.Now, it's true that one mechanism to get the licenses for less than they paid for, the fraudulent conveyance theory, is something that the FCC can address. That was the GWI bankruptcy, where the FCC only got 16 cents on the dollar. But there's a second way to do it, which is to only give the FCC the value for its security interest, the value of the licenses at that point, and the bankruptcy court did that in Kansas PCS, and only gave the commission 5 cents on the dollar.531111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Second, let me address Justice Kennedy's concern2 with, where's the authority for the FCC to take into3 account bankruptcy policy concerns? The authority comes4 from a D.C. Circuit decision called LaRose, which is cited5 on page 79a of the decision, the reconsideration decision6 that's under review. The LaRose decision is a D.C.7 Circuit decision that tells the FCC that it must take8 bankruptcy policy considerations into account.9 Now --10 QUESTION: It's not binding on us, certainly?11 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, it is binding on the12 FCC, though, and the FCC tried to do its best to take13 bankruptcy considerations into account. Now, if it failed14 to do it properly --15 QUESTION: But this, they're saying that they're16 not going to take bankruptcy considerations into account.17 GENERAL CLEMENT: No, they did. They did, and18 again I think they -- one of the reasons they took19 bankruptcy considerations into account is by extending20 payments for all the C-Block licensees for 18 months. But21 if you think the problem here is that the FCC didn't do22 the right balancing of bankruptcy policy and23 telecommunications policy, then the D.C. Circuit or this24 case could reverse for an arbitrary capriciousness, but25 that's not the role of 525.541111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 525 is an exceedingly narrow provision that2 simply prevents a regulator under any circumstances from3 canceling a license solely because, and here it's just not4 true that the failure to make a payment was the sole5 trigger, because you have to look at it in context, and6 what triggered default is the failure to make a payment of7 a payment that was due for a particular reason.8 Now, anybody in -- any FCC licensee could have9 gone to the commission and tried to get a further10 extension of that payment deadline. They'd already gotten11 extended 18 months. They could have gotten extended even12 further, and it's hard for me to understand how there's a13 sole trigger when the very payment deadline that is14 supposed to be -- trigger the automatic cancellation is15 itself the reflection of a multifactor public interest16 determination by the commission. They extended it 1817 months but no further, based on a consideration of the18 public interest.19 Now, on Justice Breyer's concern about what's20 going on here, I think your concern is exactly right, and21 what sense does it make from a bankruptcy policy to22 disable the Government to make installment payments?￼2324 it? 25QUESTION: Exactly right. Why didn't you argue GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think -- no, I551111 14th Street, N.W.

One, we did -- there is that flavor in the brief, but the other reason is, you at one point said, doesn't the commission just want the money? That's actually not true. What we want is, we want the licenses back --QUESTION: I know, but if they did, it's such an obvious argument that I feel there's something wrong with it because you didn't argue it.GENERAL CLEMENT: Don't worry -- thank you, YourHonor.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Clement. The case is submitted.(Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the above-entitled matter was submitted.)￼561111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005
