Charles McArthur.          Mr. Bertocchi.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL D. BERTOCCHI                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  Thank you.  Good morning,Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:          In this case, a police officer who had probablecause to believe that readily destructible evidence wasconcealed in Charles McArthur's home secured that homefrom the outside while his partner went to see the judgeto get a warrant.  By doing so, the police officer,Officer Love, prevented what, as it turned out, would havebeen the certain destruction of that evidence.          He also avoided doing something that this Courthas often condemned in its Fourth Amendment cases.          QUESTION:  May I stop you there, please,counsel?  As it turns out, and you mentioned, at the endof the day the respondent would have entered the home anddestroyed the evidence if he'd had the chance, but thepolice didn't know that at the time, did they?          GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  I don't think they knew it,certainly, Your Honor.31 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  And I think that we have to take thecase on the assumption that they didn't know.          GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  Correct.          QUESTION:  Isn't that right?          GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  I agree.          QUESTION:  So I don't think we should look atthe fact that he said that later in resolving the case.          GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  Your Honor, by mentioningthat I didn't mean to suggest that the Court should.  I101112    it.13141516171819202122232425think that demonstrates something about the fact thatpeople can intend to destroy evidence without telegraphing          QUESTION:  Yes.          GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  But I agree that theofficers certainly didn't know it.  Mr. McArthur didn'tsay so.          QUESTION:  Well, can we take the case on theassumption that there's a substantial risk that in thiscontext he would have destroyed the evidence?          GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  I agree, Your Honor.  Ibelieve that the police believed that, that they wereconcerned about the risk to evidence, but I can't say thatthey could read his mind.          QUESTION:  Well, but didn't the evidence thatthey had before them establish at least exigent4 1    circumstances?  Could they have gone in on an exigent 2    circumstances exception? 3              GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  Well, Your Honor, I believe 4    in this case they could have, although I would emphasize 5    again that they never actually went in at all except 6    briefly with -- 7              QUESTION:  No, I realize that, but I mean, in 8    deciding the reasonableness of the -- of blocking the 9    individual from going back in, it seems to me we ought to10    consider that they could have gone in themselves under an11    exigent circumstances theory, if that is so.12              GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  I believe that is so, Your13    Honor, and certainly it demonstrates that the intrusion14    that we're asking for here is amply justified.15              QUESTION:  But then you run up against your16    opponent's argument that the police themselves created the17    exigent circumstances, because they told -- they told the,18    later, defendant that his wife had snitched on him, and if19    he didn't know that, then he wouldn't have any incentive.20              GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  I understand that argument,21    Your Honor, and I don't believe it applies in this case22    for a couple of reasons.  One is that I believe the23    officers had genuine concern sufficient to allow them to24    impound, certainly, and perhaps to go in even before they25    spoke with him.5 1              Mrs. McArthur told the officers that she had 2    just seen Mr. McArthur conceal the marijuana under the 3    couch.  She told them that when she came out into the 4    house, and I believe that that told the officers not only 5    that there was marijuana inside, which provided them with 6    probable cause to search, I think that also demonstrated 7    to them that Mr. McArthur, or at least would give them 8    reasonable grounds to suspect that Mr. McArthur was 9    interested in preventing them from getting access to the10    evidence and had already at least once translated that11    idea into action.12              QUESTION:  Well, I want to know how fine you're13    slicing it when you say reasonable cause to believe.  Do14    you mean probable cause?15              GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  No, I don't, Your Honor.16              QUESTION:  Well, if you don't mean probable17    cause, then I think your response to Justice Ginsburg is,18    there were no exigent circumstances sufficient to support19    an entry but for the police's statement to him that they20    knew about the drugs and they wanted to go in.  Am I21 right? 2223 24 25          GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  I -- Your Honor, I -- thatisn't what I intended to say, I'm sorry.          QUESTION:  Okay.  Now, assume they did not --assume we remove from consideration the fact that they612345678    are?9told him that the wife had snitched on him and they wouldlike to search.  Did they have probable cause to make anexigent circumstances search?          GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  Your Honor, I don'tbelieve -- I do believe that they did.  I don't -- I dobelieve --                QUESTION:  And the reasons are?  The reasons11    aware that Mr. McArthur, while they were present, and he12    knew they were present, had already taken action to13    conceal the evidence from them, and I think it would be14    reasonable for them to believe that he might take15    additional action, or decide that that action wasn't16    sufficient.                GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  The reasons are, Your Honor,10    that they -- as I indicated, that they had -- they were171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Okay.          GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  In addition, Your Honor, Iwould suggest to the Court that --          QUESTION:  When you say he knew they werepresent --          GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  Yes, Your Honor.  He -- thepolice had been outside for some time while Mrs. McArthurwas moving her items out, and they wouldn't have been verygood peacekeepers if they didn't let it be known, or she7 1    didn't let it be known that the police were outside while 2    she was moving her items out. 3              So at the time Mrs. McArthur came out and said 4    all this, the police knew that Mr. McArthur knew they had 5    been outside for some time, that they were in the company 6    of his wife, who was angry at him and might be motivated 7    to snitch on him, and she also told them that he had 8    already taken at least some action to conceal marijuana, 9    the marijuana that was inside, from them.10              QUESTION:  Did she indicate how much marijuana,11    because much is made by McArthur that this was -- this is12    very small stakes.13              GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  Your Honor, she did not say14    anything -- there is no testimony in the record that she15    said anything other than that it was marijuana, and that16    is really one of our central points in response to that17    argument, is that the officers had no reason to know just18    what the stakes would be for any number of reasons.  One19    of them was that.20              It is certainly unlikely that if they had asked21    her Mrs. McArthur could have said 2.3 grams.  At most she22    might have said, a little, but a little can rise to the23    level of a felony in Illinois, and even a little little is24    a jailable crime.25              QUESTION:  But in any case she didn't say8 1    anything one way or the other about quantity -- 2              GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  Correct. 3              QUESTION:  -- as far as the record tells us. 4              GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  Correct, Your Honor. 5              QUESTION:  Is that correct? 6              GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  That is correct. 7              Your Honors, Officer Love's conduct in this case 8    was restrained and, indeed, specifically calibrated to 9    intrude no more than necessary while giving full effect to10    the warrant requirement, and we ask that this Court11    approve that conduct because it will both protect both12    evidence and privacy.13              There are two facts that we believe demonstrate14    that Officer Love's conduct fell clearly within the limits15    of reasonable conduct under the Fourth Amendment.  One of16    them, of course, is that there was no entry necessary in17    this case, and we believe that that substantially lesser18    intrusion is very important.  It interfered only with19    Mr. McArthur's possessory interest in his home, and while20    those interests are certainly protected by the Fourth21    Amendment, the -- they are not -- they do not receive the22    high level of protection that privacy interests do,23    particularly where a home is concerned.24              QUESTION:  May I ask if, in your view, the25    length of time that it takes to get the warrant is91 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425relevant at all?          GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  I believe it is, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  And in this case, what was it?          GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  Your Honor, I think on thisrecord the most you could say would be 2 hours, but Ibelieve that the more justified conclusion would be aboutan hour and 15 minutes from the time the impoundment wasimposed to the time that the warrant was signed.          QUESTION:  If it took, say, 8 or 10 hours, youwould say that's probably unreasonable?          GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  Your Honor, I would say thatwas a much harder case, but it would depend on thecircumstances that caused it to take that long.          QUESTION:  Yes.          GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  I think this is an amount oftime that you could almost say was per se reasonable.  Ithink, in fact, that it was surprisingly brief, in --particularly in light of the fact that this is a smallrural jurisdiction with a small police force and --          QUESTION:  But you would say the length of timewould be a relevant consideration?          GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  Certainly, Your Honor.  Iknow the Court has said on many occasions that anintrusion on Fourth Amendment rights can start off okayand become unreasonable by degree.101              QUESTION:  Would you also -- what is your2    position on whether the quantity of drugs is relevant to3    the inquiry?  I mean, if it was a bomb about to explode4    you take one view, and an ounce of marijuana you can get a5    little different reaction intuitively, but do you think6    legally it should make any difference?7              GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  Your Honor, I think under8    Welsh you can't say that it doesn't figure into the Fourth9    Amendment calculus.  We believe that there was ample10    justification in this case in light of the quantity of11    marijuana.  This is a case which the State of Illinois12    legislature has decided you can go to jail for.  This is a13    case that the county prosecutor, who is the original14    jurisdiction prosecutor in the county, has decided was15    worth a search warrant --16              QUESTION:  If it were different -- if, for17    example -- some counties around the country don't18    prosecute on cases like this, or maybe the quantity would19    have to be a little smaller.  If they had a policy of not20    prosecuting minimal amounts of possession of marijuana,21    then I take it, it would or would not be reasonable to go22 in? 23242511          GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  Your Honor, I think if theyhad a blanket policy that was known to the policeofficers, then I think they would -- you know, before they1    even got to that question they would doubt, or be sure2    that they couldn't get the prosecutor to approve the3    search warrant in the first place.4              QUESTION:  Could they have arrested this5    defendant without a warrant, without an arrest warrant --678 had? 9GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  Yes, Your Honor.QUESTION:  -- based on the information that they                GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  I believe that they could10    have.  I believe they had probable cause both to search11    the house and to arrest Mr. McArthur.12              QUESTION:  Mr. Bertocchi, how far did the police13    have to go geographically to get a warrant in this case?14              GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  Your Honor, I am not aware15    of that.  I know that Mr. McArthur lived in Sullivan, and16    that Sullivan is the county seat of Moultrie County, so17    they didn't have to leave the town of Sullivan to get to18    the courthouse.19              QUESTION:  Mr. Bertocchi, I guess your case is20    easy if you assume, as you do, that they had authority to21    enter without a warrant on the basis of exigent22    circumstances, but assuming I don't agree with you on that23    point, I'm concerned about complicating the criminal law24    more than is necessary.25              You're asking us to establish some standards12 1    below the exigent circumstances standard which would 2    dispense with a warrant, and you're saying if you don't 3    actually go into the house we want yet another test that's 4    a little bit less than exigent circumstances.  I'm not 5    sure that human beings are capable of entertaining as many 6    variations and figuring out what is less than exigent 7    circumstances but still enough to justify this. 8              Why shouldn't we just have one single rule? 9    It's an exigent circumstances rule.  If there are exigent10    circumstances, you can either go in the house or exclude11    the homeowner from going back in himself.12              GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  Your Honor, I agree that13    impoundment does present something of a complication, but14    I don't think it's that serious, and I think that the test15    is not all that different, because it's a balancing test16    ultimately, always.  I think that in this case we also17    distinguish, as does --18              QUESTION:  Well, it's not a balancing test with19    exigent circumstances.  If there are exigent circumstances20    you can go in.  You don't have to say, you know, well, is21    it a really expensive house, or is it a less-expensive22    house, or, you know, is this person really concerned with23    his privacy, or is he the kind of guy who leaves his24    window shades up anyway?  You don't balance anything.  If25    there are exigent circumstances, you go in.131 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  I understand --          QUESTION:  And when you have that test thecourts know how to deal with it.  Why don't we just have aflat rule, if there are exigent circumstances, you caneither go in or you can stop him from going in?          GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  Well, Your Honor, it's ourposition --          QUESTION:  Life is too complicated.  We can'tengage in all of these myriad levels of police activity.          GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  Your Honor, if the Courtwere to agree with me that exigent circumstances were --particularized exigent circumstances were present here,sufficient to allow an entry, that would be verysatisfactory, because I'm sure that would result in the --          QUESTION:  But the question presented is, is itreasonable under the Fourth Amendment for police officerswho have probable cause to believe a residence containsevidence enough to secure the residence from the outside,so your question certainly assumes the existence ofprobable cause.          GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  Yes, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  It doesn't really say anything aboutexigent circumstances.          GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  Your Honor, our position isthat no specific or particularized exigent circumstances14 1    were required to do what Officer Love did. 2              QUESTION:  You say probable cause is enough. 3              GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  Probable cause is enough 4    that you don't have to make an entry, yes, Your Honor. 5              Your Honors, as I was indicating in response to 6    Justice Stevens, the intrusion in this case lasted a 7    surprisingly brief amount of time, but another important 8    aspect of its limitation is that it was always intended 9    only as a step on the way to getting a warrant.10              Impoundment is really not capable of analytical11    separation from getting a search warrant.  It is a step in12    its execution which is designed to assure that if there is13    evidence in the house at the time probable cause arises,14    it will still be there by the time the judge -- the15    officers come back with the warrant if the judge signs it.16              QUESTION:  Suppose that the wife had told the17    police officers not that he had hidden some contraband18    under the sofa but, rather, that he had it in his pocket.19    Are we going to have to, in the next case, ask whether,20    although the police could not arrest him without a warrant21    on the basis of just that probable cause, they could22    nonetheless prevent him from putting his hand in his23    pocket or, you know, follow him around and make sure that24    he doesn't put his hand in his pocket, which is a lesser25    intrusion than arresting him, arguably a lesser intrusion15 1    than stopping him -- I mean, is there any end to the 2    number of variations of lesser, lesser, lesser intrusion 3    that we'll be confronted with? 4              GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  Well, Your Honor, in this 5    case I think if -- that once he had come outside the house 6    they could have arrested him because they had probable 7    cause to arrest him and then, incident to that, I think 8    they could have reached into his pocket.  So in those 9    situations where there is probable cause to arrest,10    personal search issues are going to be subsumed in search11    of the person incident to arrest.12              QUESTION:  You think they didn't need an arrest13    warrant, they could just have --14              GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  I believe that when they had15    this -- that -- the record demonstrates that Mr. McArthur16    came out of his house to speak with the officers, and I17    believe that at that point he was in a public place and18    could be arrested without a warrant, yes, Your Honor.19              QUESTION:  Of course, your theory, I take it, is20    that he could have been arrested in the house without a21    warrant because the indication that the police had was22    that he was possessing drugs inside, but they didn't have23    particularized knowledge that the amount of drugs was24    only -- only carried the offense to the misdemeanor level,25    so I take it you would have said he could have gone --161 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9they could have gone in and arrested without a warrant.          GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  I believe that -- I believethat they could have, again based on the exigent --          QUESTION:  Why shouldn't -- given the fact thatwe do have -- we do make a distinction between arrest withor without warrant in one's own home, why shouldn't thepolice have the burden of demonstrating that they hadprobable cause to believe that the drugs were in a felonyquantity before they went in to arrest?10111213141516    warrant?17              GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  Your Honor, I believe that18    in some cases that might very well be a difficult rule to19    administer, and I think this is a good example of that,20    Your Honor.  I don't think Mrs. McArthur would likely          GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  Your Honor, I believe thatin this instance had they gone in to --          QUESTION:  No, but even apart from this, andjust as a general rule, why shouldn't that be the generalrule, that the police would have to establish a felonylevel before they go into a house to arrest without a21    have been able to give them, even if they had asked, the22 detail --23              QUESTION:  Well, that's right, and therefore24    they couldn't have gone in.  It would not be difficult to25    administer, it would be easier to administer, but you'd171 lose. 23 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  Your Honor, I believe thatthey did have sufficient cause in this case had theyneeded to enter to effectuate this impoundment, but Idon't believe that they needed it to do it in the way thatthey did.          If there are no other questions I would reservethe remainder of my time, if I could.          QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Bertocchi.          GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  Thank you.          QUESTION:  Mr. Roberts, we'll hear from you.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS     ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,                 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER          MR. ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court:          For three reasons, police officers who haveprobable cause to believe that a residence containsincriminating evidence may prevent entry for a reasonableperiod of time in order to preserve the evidence whilethey obtain a search warrant.          First, there's a strong law enforcement interestin preserving evidence pending issuance of a warrant.          Second, securing the premises from the outsideby preventing entry is a limited and temporary intrusion.181 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          Third, it's less intrusive than other means ofpreserving evidence, and it promotes fidelity to theFourth Amendment's preference that searches be authorizedby a warrant.          When a residence contains evidence of a crime,there's an inherent danger that the evidence may bedamaged or destroyed if people are allowed on thepremises, and therefore, unless police have a means toprotect the evidence during the time that it takes toobtain a warrant, the search pursuant to the warrant mayoften be fruitless.          QUESTION:  Mr. Roberts, do you think allevidence is fungible?          MR. ROBERTS:  No, all evidence is not fungible,Your Honor, but almost all evidence is capable ofalteration or destruction, or damage in some way.          QUESTION:  Is all evidence that's capable ofalteration or destruction fungible?          MR. ROBERTS:  No.          (Laughter.)          MR. ROBERTS:  All evidence that's capable ofalteration or destruction isn't fungible either, butthere's a sufficient inherent danger of some kind ofdamage with -- damage or destruction of evidence under thecircumstances that the risk would be too great in enough191 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425cases to warrant asking for some particularized --          QUESTION:  Let me make the question a littlemore precise.  Does the seriousness of the offense weighinto the analysis at all in your view?          MR. ROBERTS:  Certainly not when all we'retalking about is temporarily preventing entry for alimited period of time.          QUESTION:  Mr. Roberts, you say that, you know,there's a great law enforcement interest in preserving theevidence, but there's also a considerable interest on thepart of the individual in going into his own home.          MR. ROBERTS:  Yes, and --          QUESTION:  What if he tells the police officer,gee, I have to get back in there, I have something on thestove that's going to burn.  Or, you know, I have a childin there that I have to attend to.          Now, are we going to have to weigh all of thoseadditional factors in this subtle balancing test once weabandon the exigent circumstances rule and ask in eachcase, well, this isn't just getting back into his home,it's getting back into his home to turn off his computer,or to take care of a child.  We're going to go crazytrying to balance these things all the time.  Why not juststick with the exigent circumstances rule?          MR. ROBERTS:  Our rule that we're proposing here                            20 1    that has already been reflected in cases involving 2    containers, vehicles, and evidence in plain view, and the 3    Court suggested in dicta it applies to securing residences 4    as well, is easily applied.  The issue is, is there 5    probable cause to believe that the residence contains 6    evidence of a crime, and if there is probable cause to 7    believe that, then there is a consequent -- 8              QUESTION:  Even if there's a child in there that 9    needs taking care of, right?10              MR. ROBERTS:  Well, the Court's made clear --11              QUESTION:  That's a clear rule, then.  You're12    going to take that position?13              MR. ROBERTS:  The Court's made clear that any14    search or seizure, even one that's justified by a warrant,15    can be rendered unreasonable by the manner in which it's16    executed, and one factor that you would consider in17    determining whether the seizure --18              QUESTION:  Well, that's not a manner of19    executing it.  They're executing it by not letting him go20    into the house, but you're saying it isn't just the house21    you have to consider, it's also all these other factors,22    why he wants to go in, right?23              MR. ROBERTS:  No, Your Honor.  The basic24    principle would still apply, but the police officers have25    to act reasonably.  That's, the fundamental principle of21 1    the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, and if under the 2    circumstances reasonableness required some accommodation 3    of the needs that were -- that the occupants were impeded 4    from addressing because of the seizure, the police would 5    have to reasonably address that.  If there was a child 6    inside, I think that would create exigent circumstances 7    that would justify them going in to take care of the child 8    if there were some need to do that. 9              QUESTION:  But in effect you're saying that yes,10    balancing is going to have to be done in the field, so I11    think your answer to Justice Scalia is, we don't have just12    a simple rule that if there's probable cause they can13    impound.  Your rule is, there's a general rule that if14    there's probable cause they can impound, but there may be15    circumstances which vary the permissible application of16 that rule.17              MR. ROBERTS:  There may be circumstances which18    require the police to take other actions to address the19    needs as reasonable, but the fundamental rule remains the20    same, and I don't think that is different than in any21    other circumstance, any other kind of --22              QUESTION:  That rule would depend on the facts23    as they are known to the officer, even -- so that so long24    as the homeowner says, I have a kid in there, even if he25    doesn't have a kid in there, it would be unreasonable for221 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9the police officer to stop him from going in, I assume.          MR. ROBERTS:  I think that if -- if -- unlessthe officer had -- knew that there wasn't a kid in there,which in this case he might know because the wife --          QUESTION:  Well, maybe the police officer couldgo in himself and bring the kid outside.          MR. ROBERTS:  He could.  He could accompany himinside.  That's what I was trying to say before, Mr. ChiefJustice.  If there was a child who was -- who neededprotection that much that required the respondent toenter, then that would justify the police officer going inin the interest of public safety.          QUESTION:  What if the child is old enough todestroy the evidence and sees what's happening?(Laughter.)          QUESTION:  Can the police go in and make thechild come out, too?          MR. ROBERTS:  If the child were outside andwanted to go in and was old enough --          QUESTION:  No, no, no, the child is inside, andthe officer realizes, well, maybe he'll destroy the10111213141516171819202122    evidence.2324 25          MR. ROBERTS:  Oh, the officer could ask thechild to come out under those circumstances.          QUESTION:  He could ask him to, but the child                            23 1    says I'm too busy destroying evidence. 2              (Laughter.) 3              MR. ROBERTS:  Well then, that would certainly 4    create exigent circumstances that would justify going in 5    to secure the premises from the inside, but this case 6    involves a very different and much more limited situation, 7    where all that was necessary was to prevent entry and that 8    kind of intrusion is extremely more limited, because it's 9    only possessory interest in the premises.  It lasts only10    long enough to get the judicial determination about11    whether there's probable cause to search and seize, and12    it's far less intrusive than the other alternatives.13              For instance, if the police officers here had14    arrested respondent, that would have invaded his personal15    privacy and his liberty.16              QUESTION:  The other thing I wondered about is,17    what would have happened -- this case arose out of an18    argument between the husband and wife, as I remember.19    What if she changed her mind when she got to the20    magistrate and decided not to support the probable cause21    and they never got the warrant, would the seizure then22    have been unlawful?23              MR. ROBERTS:  The --24              QUESTION:  Does the legality depend on the fact25    that the warrant was ultimately issued?241234567    issued.8          MR. ROBERTS:  The legality depends on thepresence of probable cause.  I think at the time that theyconducted the seizure they would have had probable causeand the seizure would be legal.                QUESTION:  Even if the warrant were not issued?                MR. ROBERTS:  Even if the warrant were not10    and that this is particularly reasonable, is that the11    other alternatives such as arresting the occupants, such12    as a warrantless entry, are more intrusive, involve13    invasions of privacy.  They're more serious, and by14    providing an alternative to immediate warrantless entry15    this external impoundment option actually encourages16    police officers to seek a warrant before they search.  The17    Court has therefore recognized a principle that the18    interest in protecting evidence can temporarily supersede19    possessory interest in property for the time that it takes20    to get a warrant in a variety of contexts.21              As I noted before, the Court's done it in dictum22    in situations involving securing premises, but the Court's23    held that that's true in a variety of cases like container24    cases, where the Court has held that if the police have25    probable cause to believe the container holds evidence25               As I was saying before, the -- part of the9    reason that the intrusion is so small, is limited here,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425they can seize the container pending a warrant to searchit, and the Court's held that if the police have probablecause to believe that evidence that's in plain view isassociated with criminal activity, they can seize it.          The same principle that underlies that, theinterest in protecting the evidence, the inherent dangerthat the evidence may be damaged or destroyed if thereisn't an ability to freeze the status quo while the policeget a warrant, the fact that the police are getting thewarrant here, all point to the fact that it's eminentlyreasonable for the police to be able to secure thepremises from the outside for a temporary time while theyobtain a warrant to search.          If there are no further questions --          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Roberts.          Ms. Jones, we'll hear from you.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE F. JONES               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS          MS. JONES:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may itplease the Court:          The question presented by these facts is, whatanalysis should this Court employ in determining underwhat circumstances and by what method the police can seizea home in order to preserve evidence of a crime?          The State of Illinois and the United States of                            26 1    America want this Court to issue a broad rule that it is 2    always all right for police officers to seize a home on 3    the basis of probable cause alone.  This Court should find 4    that such a rule violates the Fourth Amendment for two 5    reasons.  First of all, it does not take into account the 6    high esteem in which this Court's decisions place the 7    home, and it is also not a logical extension of other 8    cases concerning the seizure of property. 9              QUESTION:  Well, it was suggested in Segura, I10    guess, as a possible rule.11              MS. JONES:  Your Honor, in the dicta in Segura12    there is some suggestion that external seizure of the home13    would have been justified in Segura's case, and perhaps14    that is because everyone with a possessory interest in the15    apartment in Segura was in custody and therefore the16    police really weren't interfering with anyone's possessory17 right.18              In this case you do have the homeowner present,19    and his possessory rights in the home are being20    substantially interfered with, and the Government's test21    of probable cause only simply does not take in to account22    the high esteem in which the home is held and the fact23    that it's very intrusive.24              QUESTION:  Well, what should the police have25    done to preserve evidence that they know is at risk?27 1              MS. JONES:  Your Honor, there were two 2    alternatives for the police in this case.  First of all, 3    once Mrs. McArthur told the officers that she saw her 4    husband slide marijuana under the couch, the first thing 5    they could have done is simply left with Mrs. McArthur, 6    went down to the courthouse, and obtained a search 7    warrant.  The second alternative was to -- 8              QUESTION:  Well, but they knew of the risk of 9    destruction of the evidence.  My question is, what could10    they do to preserve the evidence in these circumstances,11 nothing?12              MS. JONES:  No, Your Honor, there is nothing13    they could do, and the reason I'm suggesting that is, in14    Welsh v. Wisconsin the officers on that scene were faced15    with a similar dilemma.  The only way they had to preserve16    evidence of Mr. Welsh's blood alcohol level is to do what17    they did, which was to enter the home without a warrant18    and arrest him before his blood alcohol level went down.19              This Court found that because that was a minor20    offense, the police officers could not do that in order21 to --22              QUESTION:  Well, the offense in Welsh was quite23    different than the one here.  Here, according to your24    colleague at any rate, this -- the -- it could -- was25    grounds for arrest, and also he could have served time in281 jail. 2          MS. JONES:  Your Honor, there is a distinctionbetween the offense here and the one in Welsh.  Welsh wasa nonjailable offense, that's true.  Here, we have a classC misdemeanor, which is the lowest category of crime.3456789    different?          QUESTION:  Well, is that important, Ms. Jones,to your argument?  I mean, supposing there had been alarge stash of heroin.  Would that make this case10              MS. JONES:  Yes, Your Honor, it would make this11    case different, for two reasons.  First of all, I'm12    suggesting you reject the probable cause only test and13    stick with the probable cause plus exigent circumstances14    test, and the reason the quantity of the drugs would be15    important is because that goes to the exigency.  As this16    Court observed in Welsh v. Wisconsin, the prevention of17    the destruction of evidence is not an exigent circumstance18    when you're talking about a minor offense.  Presumably,19    then, it is when you're talking about a major crime.20              QUESTION:  But the police had no way of knowing21    the quantity at that point.  I think you just told us, and22    correct me if I'm wrong, that if the crime would be a23    felony, then what was done here was okay.  Secure the24    premises pending receipt of a warrant by the police25    officer.  But if the crime is only a misdemeanor, then,29 1    too bad, you have to take the risk that the evidence will 2    be destroyed.  I think that's the line you're drawing. 3              MS. JONES:  Two responses to that, Your Honor. 4    First of all, the line that I'm drawing is that the 5    officers have to have probable cause and exigent 6    circumstances.  In this case, it's my position that they 7    had neither, but the line I'm asking the Court to draw 8    again is probable cause and exigent circumstances. 9              QUESTION:  Well, is it exigent circumstances if10    it's a felony but not if it's a misdemeanor?  That's what11    I don't fathom, because I thought from your brief and from12    what you said before that you were making a distinction13    between lesser offenses and felonies.14              MS. JONES:  I am, Your Honor, that's true, and15    the reason I make the distinction is again, it's part of16    that analysis of whether or not the exigent circumstance17    of destruction of evidence is present.  That's at least18    what the Welsh decision suggests, that if you're trying to19    preserve evidence of a minor crime, then the officers are20    not justified in entering the home to preserve evidence of21    that crime, so it's a factor of determining whether or not22    there's an exigent circumstance of destruction of23 evidence.24              QUESTION:  Why isn't -- sorry.25              MS. JONES:  Your Honor, if I may, she had a30 1    question before that.  You had also asked me about if the 2    officers knew about the quantity of marijuana at the 3    scene.  The officers I'm sure did not know that there were 4    precisely 2.3 grams of marijuana present.  However, the 5    officers could easily have asked Mrs. McArthur about the 6    quantity she saw, and the fact that nobody really seemed 7    to be taking this incident very seriously suggests that 8    the officers knew they weren't talking about -- 9              QUESTION:  Why are they not taking it seriously?10    They immediately go off to get a warrant.11              MS. JONES:  Your Honor, if they -- they didn't12    ask Mrs. McArthur questions about the quantity.  They13    didn't ask her questions about whether her husband was14    dealing drugs.  If they thought they had a serious offense15    and they thought they had probable cause at the scene they16    could have placed Mr. McArthur under arrest immediately.17    Mr. McArthur evidently --18              QUESTION:  Well, I'm surprised you say that no19    one was taking this seriously when the police went to get20    a warrant and secured the house.21              MS. JONES:  Your Honor, they did go and get a22    warrant, but what I'm suggesting is, you're not taking23    about a major crime here where the police felt that they24    had the immediate need to make an arrest of Mr. McArthur.25              QUESTION:  Well, but you know, there's always a31 9101112131415161718192021great deal of second-guessing in these Fourth Amendmentcases.  If the police do A, they should have done B, andif they do B, they should have done A.  So I think youhave to base your case on the infirmities in what thepolice actually did.          MS. JONES:  Yes, Your --          QUESTION:  Wouldn't an arrest have been more          MS. JONES:  Your Honor --          QUESTION:  I would have thought so.  I wouldhave thought that the police were acting in a restrainedfashion by getting a search warrant, finding out what theyhad, and then taking action.  An immediate arrest wouldhave I think been more of a personal intrusion.          MS. JONES:  Your Honor, again I'm suggestingthat because the officers did not have probable cause atthe scene they could not arrest --          QUESTION:  Well, I don't think I agree withthat.  They had been told that he had marijuana in hispossession and I don't know what-all, and that's probablecause, isn't it, to suspect that he was in possession of12345678    intrusive?22    marijuana?23 24 25          MS. JONES:  Your Honor, I respectfully disagreefor two reasons.  First of all, Mr. -- or, excuse me,Officer Love did not ask Mrs. McArthur that very important321 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9question of whether she was familiar with what marijuanalooked like.  Under Illinois law, when you gatherinformation from an informant about the existence ofcontraband, Illinois law generally requires that you havesome indication --          QUESTION:  Well, wasn't a warrant obtained froma magistrate here?          MS. JONES:  Your Honor, it was, and if you --          QUESTION:  And was it obtained without probable10 cause? 1112    cause for the search warrant, and if you compare the13    search warrant application and the affidavit submitted --14    you'll find those in the joint appendix, I believe15    beginning on page 5.  If you look at the application for a16    search warrant and the affidavits, there's a lot of17    information contained in those affidavits that were not --18    that was not given to Officer Love at the scene.19              For example, in the application for a search20    warrant the State's Attorney thinks it's important enough21    to put in there that Mrs. McArthur is familiar with the22    appearance of marijuana.  The State's Attorney also23    includes in there that Mrs. McArthur has seen marijuana on24    the presence -- or on the premises several times.  He has25    her put in the affidavit that she has seen her husband use33MS. JONES:  No.  Your Honor, there was probable 1    marijuana on several occasions. 2              None of that information was given to Officer 3    Love at the scene.  All Officer Love had at the scene was 4    a woman who Officer Love admits was predisposed into 5    getting our husband into trouble tell him as she's 6    leaving, oh, by the way, I just saw him slide some dope 7    under the couch. 8              QUESTION:  All right.  Suppose -- is it -- all 9    right, the wife says, I -- you know, she lives in the10    trailer with her husband, and the wife says, he hides dope11    under the couch, okay?  And he's -- there's some there.12              MS. JONES:  I'm sorry.13              QUESTION:  She -- the wife says, who lives in14    the trailer with the husband, that her husband has put pot15    under the couch.16              MS. JONES:  Mm-hmm.17              QUESTION:  That's what happened.18              MS. JONES:  Yes.19              QUESTION:  Okay.  Now, why wouldn't the officer20    think that if I say goodbye, I'm going off to get a search21    warrant, the husband would take the dope and flush it down22    the toilet.  That's what I would think.  I mean, why23    wouldn't he think that?24              MS. JONES:  Your Honor, in this case there25 were --341 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  In fact, if he's intelligent, that'swhat the man would have done.          MS. JONES:  Well, Your Honor, from the record,what we know what Mr. McArthur did is when the policearrived in the scene, he didn't flush the marijuana.          QUESTION:  But he hadn't been let into thehouse, right?  He hadn't had time, or had he had time?          MS. JONES:  The officers had not been let intothe house, but they were certainly outside, and Mr.McArthur was aware of their presence, yet he didn't takeany steps to destroy the evidence.  He simply hid it underhis couch.          QUESTION:  All right.  I'm just saying, is thereany reason why the police wouldn't think, if he gets backin the house, he will go take the marijuana and put itdown the toilet?  Is there anything here that would makethat an unreasonable thing to think?          MS. JONES:  Your Honor, it may be a reasonablething to think, but that certainly does not then give thepolice the power to take the next step, which is to eitherseize the home or make a warrantless arrest.          QUESTION:  Why isn't that -- and this is now alegal question.  I was trying to -- why isn't that anexigent circumstance that would give the policeman theright to go in and preserve the evidence?351              MS. JONES:  Your Honor, the reason why it's not2    is --3 4 5    Louisiana suggests that evidence has to be in the process 6    of destruction before it's considered to be an exigent 7    circumstance permitting the officer to make a warrantless 8    entry inside. 9              QUESTION:  You mean, they've got to hear the10    sound of the water flushing, or something like that --11              (Laughter.)12              QUESTION:  -- before they can go in?13              MS. JONES:  No, Your Honor.  I'm not --14              QUESTION:  No, but seriously, I mean, what --15    how could that standard ever be satisfied in the case16    Justice Breyer gave you, except on -- you know, some silly17    assumption like that?18              MS. JONES:  Your Honor, I agree that the19    evidence having to be in the process of destruction is a20    high standard for the police to meet, and that's why lower21    courts have taken the Vale case and have reduced that22    somewhat to require a fear that the evidence is in23    imminent danger of destruction.24              QUESTION:  All right, why -- going back to his25    question, why wasn't there a basis for -- to conclude that36QUESTION:  Because?MS. JONES:  -- this Court's holding in Vale v. 1 2 3 4    general? 5              QUESTION:  Yes, your particular -- well, I'm 6    talking about Justice Breyer's hypo, which I think 7    responded to your case. 8              MS. JONES:  First of all, the reason why this 9    Court should continue with that standard that the evidence10    has to be in imminent danger of destruction --11              QUESTION:  No, but assuming we -- assuming that12    is the standard, why isn't it satisfied in the13    hypothetical that you gave, which I think is descriptive14    of what we know about this case?15              MS. JONES:  Your Honor, the reason the officers16    should not have considered the evidence to be in imminent17    danger of destruction is, again, Mr. McArthur took no18    steps with regard to that --19              QUESTION:  No, but you're saying that -- and I'm20    not quite sure why, but you're saying we know for a fact21    that at a given moment he had not taken a step to destroy22    the evidence, but the hypothetical is, and I think the23    facts of the -- in the record support the hypothetical,24    that the wife from whom he is estranged and who has an25    obviously rocky relationship with him, has just been in37it was in imminent risk of destruction?          MS. JONES:  I'm sorry, I'd like to clarify.  Areyou asking in my particular case, or are you asking in 1    the trailer, has seen the drugs, is now outside talking to 2    police officers. 3              Isn't a person of any intelligence going to say, 4    she is very likely to tell them what she saw, I'd better 5    get rid of the drugs?  The question is not whether at any 6    given moment he had actually started flushing them away. 7    The question is whether there was probable cause to 8    believe that he would do that, and why isn't there, or why 9    wasn't there in this case?10              MS. JONES:  Your Honor, first of all -- I11    believe this is in the joint appendix, and I'm sorry I12    don't remember the page number for this, but Officer Love13    or Mr. McArthur, one of them was asked the question14    whether or not Mrs. McArthur saw him conceal the15    marijuana, and nobody knew the answer to that, so first of16    all maybe Mr. McArthur --17              QUESTION:  Well, she had come out and said,18    there are drugs under the sofa, after having been in the19    trailer extracting personal possessions.  Isn't it20    reasonable to assume, to infer that she had seen them?21    She'd just been there.22              MS. JONES:  Your Honor, I would disagree that23    it's reasonable to infer that she saw them.24              QUESTION:  All right.  So your claim is there25    was no probable cause.381 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MS. JONES:  Your Honor, I'm claiming there wasno probable cause and no exigent circumstances, and aprobable --          QUESTION:  I thought you had conceded that therewas probable cause to get the warrant.          MS. JONES:  There was probable cause to get thewarrant because the information that was given to JudgeFlannel was different than the information that OfficerLove had at the time that he made the determination toseize the home.          QUESTION:  All right.  Now what I'm trying to --          QUESTION:  Well, could I come to the questionpresented here, which -- I had thought, frankly, that thequestion presented posed neither the issue of exigentcircumstances, nor the issue of probable cause.  I mean,it seems to me this is not a hard case if there wereexigent circumstances.  If you -- if the police officer --you would acknowledge, I think, that if he could have goneinto the house, he could do the lesser thing of stoppingyour client from going into the house.          MS. JONES:  Your Honor, yes, if probable causeand exigent circumstances --          QUESTION:  Right.          MS. JONES:  -- existed, yes.          QUESTION:  So I mean, there's no reason to take39 1    this case if there were exigent circumstances.  And as for 2    probable cause, the way I read the question presented, is 3    it reasonable under the Fourth Amendment for police 4    officers who have probable cause to believe that a 5    residence contains evidence that could readily be 6    destroyed, to secure the residence by preventing its 7    occupant and others from entering unaccompanied. 8              I thought that -- you're not conceding the 9    existence of probable cause to believe that a residence10    contained evidence that could readily be destroyed?11              MS. JONES:  Your Honor, I'm not conceding that12    probable cause existed in this case, and I'm also13    asserting that a rule that permits external seizure of the14    home on probable cause only does not take into account,15    first of all, this Court's holdings with respect to the16    home and second of all, does not really weigh, or doesn't17    fairly balance the State's interest in prosecuting the18    particular kind of issue.19              QUESTION:  Did you challenge the question20    presented in your brief in opposition?21              MS. JONES:  Your Honor, we -- we're still22    sticking with the question presented, whether this is23    reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.24              QUESTION:  Yes, and -- but it is -- is it25    reasonable under the -- for police officers who have40 1    probable cause, so that is the premise of the question 2    presented, that the police officers have probable cause. 3    Unless you disputed that, you're not in a position now to 4    challenge probable cause. 5              MS. JONES:  Your Honor, I understand what the 6    question presented is and, as a general rule, we disagree 7    that that ought to be the rule that applies in all 8    seizure-of-the-home cases.  The Court, or excuse me, the 9    State of Illinois and the United States of America is10    asking this Court to permit seizures of the home on11    probable cause only, and it is our contention that this12    Court should not adopt such a rule.13              QUESTION:  Well now, that is obviously an14    argument you're very much entitled to make, but I think15    you've been making a different one, that there was no16    probable cause, and I think it's questionable whether17    you're entitled to make that argument here.18              MS. JONES:  Your Honor, I guess what I'm doing19    is, I'm suggesting that no matter which rule you adopt,20    the one advocated by the State or the one that we're21    presenting, when you apply that rule to our case in22    determining whether or not the Illinois Appellate Court23    should be affirmed, I'm suggesting to you reasons that, no24    matter which rule you adopt, the decision of the Illinois25 court --4112345678    that.910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Well, you're basically arguing, then,if you say there's no probable -- that the decision shouldbe affirmed on an alternate ground?          MS. JONES:  Yes, Your Honor, I'm --          QUESTION:  Well, Ms. Jones, how can you do that?The Appellate Court of Illinois found that the police hadprobable cause here.  You didn't take a cross-appeal from          QUESTION:  In fact, at page 7 of your --          QUESTION:  I would assume we would accept thatfinding.  I don't know why you're here arguing there wasno probable cause at the scene.  That seems to be bothcontrary to what the Illinois, Appellate Court of Illinoisfound, and contrary to the assumption made in the questionon certiorari.          QUESTION:  In fact, in your brief in oppositionyou said, although probable cause existed, and the police,so forth, so on.  You did, I think in your brief inopposition, you assumed there was probable cause.          MS. JONES:  Your Honor, again, we're notcontesting probable cause to issue the search warrant, andthat's true the Illinois Appellate Court --          QUESTION:  Well, but the question presentedsays, is it reasonable under the Fourth Amendment for apolice officer who had probable cause to believe a -- this421 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9is probable cause for the police officers to act.          MS. JONES:  Yes.          QUESTION:  So the fact you say you concedethere's probable cause to issue the search warrant doesn'treally get to that point, does it?          MS. JONES:  No, Your Honor.  You have to look atthe probable cause at the time that the home was seized.          QUESTION:  Precisely, and that's what thequestion raises, and that's what the lower courts foundagainst you.  That's what you've conceded in your brief in1011    opposition.12131415    cause.16              QUESTION:  We're talking about your brief in17    opposition to the petition, not the brief in opposition on18    the merits, and you do say on page 7 of your brief in          MS. JONES:  Your Honor, in our brief inopposition we do state that the Illinois Appellate Courtwas incorrect in finding that we never contested probable19    opposition to the petition, and that's the basis on which20    we decide whether or not to accept these petitions, what21    is the issue presented.  We don't -- we wouldn't have22    taken this case to decide whether in -- on these23    particular facts there was probable cause or not.  That's24    not the kind of thing we normally do here.25              But you had said in your opposition, although43 1    probable cause existed, and the police entry was made 2    peaceably.  You're obviously talking about before the 3    warrant was issued, and I took that to mean accepting the 4    question presented, is it reasonable for police officers 5    who have probable cause to believe.  If you were going to 6    contest that, you should have made that clear when you 7    opposed the petition. 8              MS. JONES:  Your Honor, again, let me state that 9    I do accept the question presented as it is, and it's our10    argument that this Court should not adopt a rule that11    permits a seizure of the home on probable cause alone.12              QUESTION:  All right --13              QUESTION:  Can you tell me this -- out of a14    very -- say, just a person who knew nothing about the law15    approaches this and says, the wife says there's -- he put16    some pot under the sofa.  The policeman then goes to the17    door and says, did you put pot under the sofa?  He says,18    no.  Okay?  Off to get a search warrant.19              If I were a policeman I would think, he's going20    to flush that right down the toilet.  That's where we left21    off, right?22              MS. JONES:  Okay.23              QUESTION:  Okay.  Now, I would think that24    instead of going into the house, which I'm not sure why he25    couldn't have done it, he says, look, I'll just keep you44 1    outside the house.  That way I don't have to go into the 2    house.  I would think he might have gotten a Fourth 3    Amendment medal, instead of Fourth Amendment criticism, 4    because what he's doing is, he's trying to do the least 5    restrictive thing possible consistent with the evidence 6    being preserved. 7              Now, why isn't what he did a good thing rather 8    than a bad thing from a Fourth Amendment point of view, 9    and what is the case that makes it impossible for him to10    do that thing?11              MS. JONES:  Your Honor, first of all, if you12    adopt that rule, then you're agreeing with the State and13    the United States of America that probable --14              QUESTION:  I haven't said what a rule was.  I15    just wanted to say, the common sense of it seeming to be16    that he should keep the person outside rather than go in17    the house, and the only alternative being that you have to18    let these people who have marijuana in violation of the19    law destroy the evidence.  Those seem to me to be the two20    alternatives.21 22 23 24 25          MS. JONES:  Your Honor, if he's keeping theperson outside of the home because he believes it containsmarijuana and he's concerned that the marijuana is goingto be destroyed --QUESTION:  Right.45 1              MS. JONES:  -- then he's making the seizure on 2    probable cause and exigent circumstances, and that's the 3    test that we want this Court to adopt with respect to 4    seizures of the home, and -- 5              QUESTION:  I don't understand.  I'm saying why 6    exactly can't he just keep the person outside?  I would 7    say from a Fourth Amendment point of view you'd say yes, 8    he can keep the person outside because it's the least 9    restrictive way to preserve the evidence.  The only10    alternative is to let him preserve the evidence.11              Now, the thing that would be wrong with that12    hypothetical rule is what?  I'm not saying I adopt it.  I13    just want to get what's the objection to it.14              MS. JONES:  Your Honor, if there's probable15    cause and exigent circumstances, there's nothing wrong16    with that, and also what the Court should keep in mind is17    external seizure of the home may not always be --18              QUESTION:  All right, so you say there's nothing19    wrong with my rule.20              Now, you must think there's something wrong with21    it, because you want to come out the other way.   Now, one22    thing you'd say was wrong with it was because he didn't23    have probable cause.  We've discussed that enough.  The24    second thing you think is wrong with it is because the25    circumstances don't justify it.461 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          You use this word exigent, but the reason whythey don't justify it, what he's got before him is, thewife's told him there's pot under the sofa, the man livesin a trailer, he's told the man he's looking for the pot,and his knowledge of human nature.  All right.  Those arethe things he has before him.  Now, why isn't that enough?          MS. JONES:  If you're asking me why that isn'texigent circumstances in this particular case --          QUESTION:  Asking you why that isn't enough tojustify keeping the man outside the trailer so he won'tdestroy the evidence.  That's my question.          MS. JONES:  Probable cause and exigentcircumstances would be sufficient to seize a home.  WhatI'm arguing is, that's the rule we want you to adopt,probable cause and exigent circumstances.          Now, when that's specifically applied to ourcase, the reason there are no exigent circumstances hereare twofold.  One, Officer Love is the person that createdthe exigency of the destruction of evidence, and severallower courts have held that when police officers createthe exigency of destruction of evidence, they cannot thenuse that exigency to turn around and enter a person's homewithout a warrant in order to preserve that evidence.          Here, Officer Love admitted --          QUESTION:  May I stop you at that point, because47 1    I think you're telling the police, don't be candid with 2    the people who you suspect about what's going on.  It 3    seems to me here the officers did everything by the book. 4    They asked him whether he had contraband.  When he said no 5    they said, we're going off to get a warrant, and it seems 6    what you're saying right now is that the police would have 7    been in a better position vis-a-vis the Fourth Amendment 8    if they had not told him what's up. 9              MS. JONES:  That's correct, Your Honor, I am10    suggesting that.  Several lower courts, including the11    Seventh Circuit in United States v. Roselli, have held12    that when it is reasonable or it is foreseeable that13    evidence will be destroyed if you ask for permission to14    search, if you go ahead and take that step and ask for15    consent and it's denied, you can't then turn around and16    use that exigency to enter the home without a warrant,17    because the police have created the exigency.18              Here, if you look on page 20 of the joint19    appendix, Officer Love testifies that at the time Mrs.20    McArthur told him that Mr. McArthur hid marijuana under21    the couch, Mr. -- or Mr. McArthur was still free to come22    and go from his home.  However, once Officer Love asks23    Mr. McArthur for permission to search and is denied, from24    that point on, Mr. McArthur can't go in because now25    Officer Love is concerned that the evidence is about to be481 destroyed. 2              QUESTION:  I suppose we could posit a situation 3    in which officers think that a really big drug ring is 4    cutting heroin in a particular apartment, and you 5    certainly wouldn't expect them to knock on the door and 6    say, you know, are you guys cutting heroin in there, do 7    you mind if we come in and look, and they say no, we don't 8    want you to come in and look.  Whereupon, they burst in on 9    the basis of exigent circumstances.  I suppose we wouldn't10    allow that, would we, so you don't have to be frank with11    the criminal.  It's sometimes a good idea not to be frank12    with the criminal.13              MS. JONES:  Your Honor, if you know that there's14    an apartment where people are cutting drugs, then the step15    that the officers should take in that hypothetical --16              QUESTION:  Is get a warrant.17              MS. JONES:  -- they should have went and gotten18 a warrant.19              QUESTION:  I agree.20              QUESTION:  Okay, but the officer -- let me21    change the hypothetical slightly which I think is -- in a22    way that I think is also supported by the record.23    Consider only these facts.  They -- the police are outside24    the trailer.  They are in plain view, so it's reasonable25    to suppose that he inside the trailer, he knows they're491 there. 2              The wife goes in.  The wife comes out and says 3    to the police, there's marijuana under the sofa.  He sees 4    the wife talking to the police.  Don't the police at that 5    point have exigent circumstances to believe that he will 6    destroy the evidence? 7              MS. JONES:  No. 8              QUESTION:  Wouldn't any sensible person destroy 9    the evidence?  I mean, wouldn't he reasonably say, she has10    just been in here, she has seen the drugs under the sofa,11    she's talking to the cops, she hates my guts, she is12    probably going to tell the cops what she saw in here, I'd13    better get rid of it?  Isn't that a reasonable thought14    process for someone in his position?15              MS. JONES:  Your Honor, the problem with having16    that be the standard to determine the exigent circumstance17    of the destruction of evidence is that you could say that18    in any case where someone has evidence of a crime inside19    of their home.  I believe Justice Stevens --20              QUESTION:  No, you can't say that.  What makes21    this exigent is the confluence at a particular point in22    time in which the -- it isn't merely a case in which he23    has drugs, he knows somebody knows that he has drugs, he24    knows that maybe that somebody may go to the police.  It's25    all happening in front of him at that time.  He has the50 1    drugs, the person who's going to snitch on him has just 2    seen the drugs, he can see the person outside his trailer 3    talking to the police.  It is sort of the temporal unity 4    of all of this that gives it the exigency, and why 5    doesn't -- that's my argument.  Why doesn't it give a 6    sufficient exigency? 7              MS. JONES:  Your Honor, two reasons why it 8    wouldn't give a sufficient exigency.  First of all, the 9    police were out at the McArthurs for a while and again,10    Mrs. McArthur was coming and going out of the trailer this11    whole time the police were there.  Evidently Mr. McArthur,12    from whatever he could gather from what was occurring13    there, wasn't concerned enough that his possession of14    marijuana was going to be reported that --15              QUESTION:  No, but you're trying to answer the16    hypothetical by adding facts about something that was17    going on in the trailer that the police could not know,18    and if the police didn't know it, it doesn't get into the19    analysis.  I don't see how it affects the fact that they20    could infer an exigency.21              I guess your time is up.22              QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Jones.23              MS. JONES:  Thank you.24              QUESTION:  Mr. Bertocchi, you have 4 minutes25    remaining.511 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL D. BERTOCCHI                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  Thank you, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Mr. Bertocchi, I would not normallyintrude upon your time, but you know, I've just criticizedor discussed with Ms. Jones whether she wasn't alteringthe question presented.  I have the same question for you.          I had frankly thought that this case involvedneither the question about whether there was probablecause, nor the question about whether there were exigentcircumstances.  If there were exigent circumstances so thepoliceman could have gone in, this is an easy case.  Butyou come up and argue exigent circumstances.  It was notargued in your petition for certiorari.  It was notcontained in the question presented for review in yourpetition for certiorari, which is, by the way, differentfrom the question that you show in your blue brief.          What are we talking about here?  All of a suddenI'm discussing a case that bears no resemblance to thecase that I thought we were going to hear.          GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  Your Honor, I believe when Iwas addressing the question of exigent circumstances thatI was doing so in response to specific questions about thefacts of this case, and it is our position that if theCourt were to determine that particularized exigent52circumstances were necessary, then they were present ifthe Court wanted to ask that.          We do stand behind the question presented.  Wedo believe that the officer had --          QUESTION:  Even without exigent circumstancesyou think that he could have made the exclusion from the1234567    house?8 910111213141516171819202122232425          GENERAL BERTOCCHI:  Yes, I believe that, YourHonor.  That is our position, and if I may speak up forthe question presented and for the rule it proposes, Iwould submit that that is not going to be a difficult ruleto apply, because it will only require police officers toknow two things, 1) that they have probable cause tosearch, and 2) the character of the evidence, and if theydon't know that, then they shouldn't be looking for awarrant, and if they shouldn't be looking for a warrant,they would have no basis and no need to impound.          Thank you, Your Honors.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you,Mr. Bertocchi.  The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 10:59 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)53
