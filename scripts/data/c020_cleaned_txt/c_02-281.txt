KIRBYON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. KIRBY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleasethe Court:In this case the Paiute propose and are seekinga categorical rule that makes Indian tribes, their casinos, their commercial businesses, and their personal property immune from search warrants and subpoenas issued in connection with the investigation of crime and the prosecution of crime.They seek this rule under Federal statutory law, under Federal common law, and under the Constitution. However, such a categorical rule is not supported by the text, structure, or history of the Constitution, by any Federal statute, or by any sufficient or rational public policy.Further, there is not now, nor should this Court extend or create a common law right to be immune from search warrants and subpoenas that are issued in31111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 connection with the investigation of crime and the2 prosecution of crime.Itisa-- QUESTION: consent by MR. KIRBY:345 accept as 67 that question. It does involve matters outside the8 record, and I will proceed to answer.9 QUESTION: I see. I just thought it was aCounsel, did the tribe offer tothe employees their employment forms?Your Honor, I am prepared to answer10 little curious that if some means of solving this had been11 offered, why we're here.12 MR. KIRBY: There was not any means of solving13 it at the time, Your Honor, because the Federal14 regulations that govern the public welfare act at15 question, title 45, part 205, prohibits the information16 from being disclosed.17 QUESTION: Okay, thank you.18 MR. KIRBY: It is --19 QUESTION: That goes for -- they had asked for20 edited copies. They just wanted the last page, and they21 said that they could be edited. Does the -- in your view22 didn't Federal regulations preclude even those edited23 copies of just the last page from being turned over?24 MR. KIRBY: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, because the25 information that's precluded from being distributed is the41111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 names of the individuals who are being investigated.2 Now, I know that the allegation is made that in3 the letter that was sent by the district attorney and by4 the Department of Health and Human Services stated that5 this was a welfare fraud investigation. However, that6 letter actually did not so state. It stated that the7 investigation was a confidential investigation that8 required the payroll information being sought.9 The fundamental right and responsibility of10 government is to protect its citizens, and one of the main11 ways it does that, of course, is through the investigation12 and prosecution of crime. The Federal Government and the13 State government have together an integrated law14 enforcement regime that allows for search warrants and15 subpoenas to be executed and issued in connection with the16 investigation of these crimes or alleged crimes whether17 the criminal conduct occurs on the reservation or off the18 reservation and regardless of whether the evidence or19 proceeds of crime is thought to be on the reservation or20 off the reservation.21 For instance, in a Public Law 280 State, such as22 California, if there is a crime committed off the23 reservation, frankly as well as on the reservation, the24 Federal Government does not have jurisdiction over that25 crime. Thus, the Federal Government does not have the51111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 ability to issue a search warrant. If the States do not2 have the ability to issue a search warrant under those3 circumstances and there is evidence of crime or proceeds4 of crime on the reservation, then that property or5 evidence remains immune from law enforcement.6 QUESTION: Is California one of the 280 States7 that has jurisdiction?8 MR. KIRBY: Yes, Justice Kennedy, California is9 a Public Law 280 State.10 Now, in a non-Public Law 280 State, the same11 situation presents itself because in that situation, the12 Federal Government has the right to -- and the -- the13 duty, if you will -- as a responsibility to its citizens14 to enforce the criminal law with regard to crimes that15 occur on the reservation that would be State crimes if16 they occurred off the reservation. And under the Major17 Crimes Act, as well as the General Crimes Act, the Federal18 Government prosecutes that crime and, of course, does the19 investigation prior to prosecution. In order to conduct20 those activities and to fulfill that mission, if you will,21 the Federal Government needs to have the right and does22 have the right to execute search warrants and to issue23 subpoenas.24 Now, as we have seen, there may be a situation25 where a crime is committed on the reservation in a Public61111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 Law 280 State and a crime committed in a -- the same crime2 in a non-Public Law 280 State, and in those situations,3 there must be parity with regard to the law enforcement4 regime. If not, what we end up with is gaps in the5 criminal justice system, and that wasn't the intent of the6 legislature in enacting Public Law 280.7 As the Court will recall, Public Law 280 was8 passed by Congress because of a perceived lawlessness on9 certain reservations. That lawlessness arose because10 Congress felt that the Federal Government -- due to the11 vast distances, if you will, of Federal Government law12 enforcement agencies, and the lack of density of those13 agencies -- simply wasn't able to enforce criminal laws14 throughout the vast acreage of reservations. And so --15 QUESTION: Mr. Kirby, here what happened I -- as16 I understand it, was that a search warrant was served on17 the tribe itself, and so I think that's what your argument18 should probably be addressed to. I think in Hicks we held19 that there could be process served against individual20 tribal members.21 MR. KIRBY: Yes, Your Honor. The search warrant22 was issued as to tribal property. I -- I would point out23 that the search warrant itself didn't actually require the24 tribe to do anything other than stand by and allow the25 officers to go forth and search. And in this --71111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Well, that's true of most search warrants.MR. KIRBY: Yes, Your Honor.QUESTION: I mean, the person served doesn't have to do anything except let them search.MR. KIRBY: Yes, Your Honor, the point being -- the point being that the search warrant did not hail the reservation or the tribe into court for the purpose of responding to a civil judgment for the purpose of --QUESTION: What -- what was the tribal property at issue?MR. KIRBY: It was common payroll records, Justice Scalia.QUESTION: Were they records of the casino?MR. KIRBY: They were records of the commercial business operated there, yes, the casino.QUESTION: Where were they kept? Were they kept at the casino?MR. KIRBY: Your Honor, they were kept in back of the casino, as I understand it, in an outbuilding that was secured by a padlock.QUESTION: Would you -- would you draw a distinction between the subpoena of the records of the commercial operation and a subpoena of the records of the -- of the government records of the tribe itself?81111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. KIRBY: Yes, Justice Scalia, there could2 very well be a distinction there. And the solution that3 we believe would address that distinction would be a4 solution that Justice White presented in the Brendale5 decision when he talked about a tribe having a unique6 protectable interest in certain situations. And the tribe7 ought to have a right to go to court -- in this case, it8 would be a State court -- to present that protectable9 interest so that a -- an interest-balancing assessment can10 be accomplished.11 In this case the interest of the tribal record12 may very well outweigh a minimal interest of the State if13 it was a simple minor misdemeanor. On the other hand, it14 may be that if it's a large serious felony of multiple15 murder and there is very direct evidence in the records of16 the tribal government, perhaps under those facts the court17 may find that the interest weighed in favor of the State's18 police power.19 QUESTION: But that --20 QUESTION: Isn't there the obvious --21 QUESTION: Is it that the local magistrate in22 each case has to -- and then the law enforcement officer23 weigh these interests? Well, this is a misdemeanor.24 Well, this is a felony. I -- I don't -- I think that25 would be a very difficult rule to implement in practice.91111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: What does everybody do? Sort of2 stand around until the appeal is finally exhausted --3 MR. KIRBY: No.4 QUESTION: -- for a couple of years to see5 whether they can do the search or not?6 MR. KIRBY: No, Justice Scalia, and no, Justice7 Kennedy.8 What would happen would be once the probable9 cause determination is made that there is evidence of a10 crime within the records of the casino in our11 hypothetical, the search warrant would be executed and the12 property would be seized and brought before the court. At13 that time the tribe, if it thought it had a protectable14 interest under State statute, perhaps because of certain15 statutory privileges, or under some special protectable16 interest that the tribe may feel that it has because of17 its unique domestic dependent sovereign status, could18 present that interest balance analysis to the magistrate19 immediately.20 QUESTION: But what good did it do to the State21 -- to the tribe after the horse is out of the barn? In22 other words, the State -- the tribe is not being23 prosecuted for anything in these cases. It's a tribal24 member who's being prosecuted. And if you're saying,25 well, the -- the warrant has to be executed but after the101111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 fact the State -- the tribe, to -- to ease its wounded2 feelings, can have this declaration? I don't follow it.3 I mean, the tribe's idea is there is no right to4 come on our property and seize our records. If you're5 saying every time the county can do that and that all the6 tribe has is an after-the-fact determination by some7 magistrate that the county was wrong, it's not much of a8 remedy, is it?MR. KIRBY: With all respect, Justice Ginsburg, it's the best remedy available. The tribe's have a categorical rule that no search warrants910 I believe11 desire to12 may be issued with regard to its property has disastrous13 consequences when evidence or proceeds of a crime is14 located upon the reservation.15 QUESTION: Why? Why is that? I mean, from what16 you've said so far, it sounds to me as if the State or the17 county went to the tribe and said, we want your records,18 and the tribe said, why? And the county said, we can't19 tell you. Well, obviously that would be a situation where20 they might get their backs up.21 But suppose you just said, look, the reason is22 that we think there are a couple of people here who are23 cheating us. We think they get welfare from us and you're24 paying them too much. That's why we want to look at it.25 Maybe they would have said, sure, golookatit.ButI￼111111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 take it you couldn't do that simple thing?2 MR. KIRBY: Your Honor, the Federal regulation3 prohibits the --4 QUESTION: All right. So then isn't the5 solution that maybe you need a law to overcome the Federal6 regulation or maybe you just go to a Federal official and7 say, will you please ask them?8 MR. KIRBY: No, Justice Breyer.9 QUESTION: There's no way to do it. In other10 words, under the law the only choice -- your major11 constitutional thing is you have to say the only12 possibility is the county that wants to prosecute somebody13 has to -- goes to the tribe and says, we want to prosecute14 somebody. We won't tell you who. We can't tell you why.15 Give us all your records. I mean, on that circumstance,16 I'd think the tribe would certainly have a point. And yet17 -- yet if -- if you were behaving reasonably and maybe --18 maybe if Federal law prevents you from behaving19 reasonably, maybe they should change it.20 How is this supposed to work out?21 MR. KIRBY: Well, Justice Breyer, looking at the22 situation that you've presented, which is our situation,23 one must remember that letters were sent by the Department24 of Health and Human Services to the three individuals25 asking for a reconciliation. Letters were sent by the121111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 district attorney to these same three individuals. Two2 letters were sent to the tribe asking for the information,3 which the tribe had honored five times in the last4 approximately two years, and the tribe had actually in one5 of those occasions asked for a search warrant, which it6 then honored. There was a history of working with the7 tribe to obtain this information.8 During this circumstance, the tribe took the9 position it was no longer going to do that. It wanted to10 have something more, and in fact the tribal attorney11 suggested that a search warrant be obtained. And as it12 had been in another circumstance within the preceding 1213 months. So there is a clear history of trying to work14 with the tribe.15 What ended up happening in this case is what16 could happen in any case. The tribe, for whatever reason,17 depending upon whatever tribal government might have been18 elected at the time -- and it -- they may have been19 different on that day than they were during the preceding20 2 years -- decided, no, we're not going to do that any￼21 longer. And that's how this situation22 And what we're looking at --23 QUESTION: Well, do you have24 the information? Can you question the25 of welfare fraud and ask them how much13came to fruition.other means to get people you suspect they earned, if1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 anything?2 MR. KIRBY: Justice O'Connor, that was done on3 at least two separate occasions. Letters were sent to4 each of the three casino employees advising them of the5 discrepancy and asking that the employees come in and6 reconcile the discrepancy. Those letters, unfortunately,7 were ignored. And so the county was faced with the8 situation where it is mandated to have such an9 investigation process into potential fraud by the --10 QUESTION: Well, presumably you could question11 supervisory employees who prepare payroll records and ask12 them how much have you paid these people, if anything.13 Could you do that?14 MR. KIRBY: Yes, Justice O'Connor, that could be15 done. That presumes, however, that the tribal officials16 would subject themselves and submit to questioning and17 providing the information verbally that they have refused18 to provide in writing simply by filling out a form19 requesting the information.20 QUESTION: Well, we have said that the -- in21 Minnesota v. the United States, I think we said that a22 proceeding against property in which the United States has23 an interest is a suit against the United States. Do you24 take the position that you can file a suit against the25 Indian tribe without its consent?141111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. KIRBY: Justice O'Connor, when property is at issue, we have an in rem situation that doesn't require a lawsuit. We have the -- I believe it's Minnesota and the Cass County case which --QUESTION: Well, you didn't answer my question. MR. KIRBY: I apologize.QUESTION: Do you take the position that you canfile a suit against the tribe?MR. KIRBY: Not to differ or to draw hairs, yes,the suit could be filed and if the tribe consented to jurisdiction, then we could resolve it in court.right.QUESTION: Yes, but -- against its consent. MR. KIRBY: Not against its consent. That'sQUESTION: No.￼QUESTION: Mr. Kirby, isn't it the case that -- that you can sue -- the United States can be sued against its -- against its consent if it's operating a commercial enterprise. Isn't that the international law of sovereign immunity, just as under our Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act a foreign sovereign can be sued in this country against its will if it is operating a commercial enterprise?MR. KIRBY: That is my understanding, Justice Scalia, and that is the case we have here.151111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 QUESTION: No, but isn't there one difference?2 And that is, take the foreign sovereign situation.3 There's a statute of the United States. And -- and if we4 start with the assumption, as I do, that we are in a5 different situation from -- from what we faced in Hicks so6 that we're talking about, in effect, a claim directly7 against the -- the sovereign itself, and if we also8 assume, which I think is correct, that the ultimate party9 in interest in this kind of a welfare fraud situation is10 the United States, why isn't the sensible answer to say,11 all right, if the United States wants the tribes to be12 treated like foreign sovereigns in a commercial13 enterprise, and if the United States wants to regard the14 casinos as a commercial enterprise for that purpose, let15 it pass a statute comparable to the Foreign Sovereign16 Immunities Act?17 MR. KIRBY: That would certainly be a resolution18 of this case, Justice Souter. However, what we're left19 with dealing today without congressional action is the20 common law tribal immunity doctrine as set forth by this21 Court and the Montana analysis that this Court has set22 forth with regard to --23 QUESTION: Has Congress ever adopted a statute24 speaking to tribal sovereign immunity?25 MR. KIRBY: No, Justice Scalia.161111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Court?QUESTION: Isn't it entirely a creationMR. KIRBY: Yes, Justice Scalia, it is. QUESTION: And if in fact --QUESTION: Well, isn't -- isn't it alsoof thisa--acreation which basically was an adoption of an international law norm?MR. KIRBY: Initially --QUESTION: Isn't that what John Marshall thought he was doing?MR. KIRBY: I believe that the tribal sovereign immunity doctrine commenced with the Turner decision which was approximately 1919. And as this Court indicated in the Kiowa decision, that sovereign immunity doctrine was created almost by accident. It was --QUESTION: What about Worcester v. Georgia? I thought that the -- the tribal sovereign immunity began long before 19-something.QUESTION: So did I.MR. KIRBY: Worcester v. Georgia, Justice Ginsburg and Justice Souter, dealt with primarily treaty rights and the -- the need for Justice Marshall to try to -- to put, if you will, or place the tribes who were nation -- independent nations, sovereigns of this country, into some category that was different from nation states.171111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 Our Constitution recognizes that Indian tribes are not2 nation -- foreign nation states. In the Commerce Clause,3 we speak to the Interstate Commerce Clause as States being4 one type of entity, Indian tribes being another, and5 foreign nations being another. So tribes have always been6 considered differently. And here they are domestic7 dependent8 different91011 minute, if we get to the main issue of this, I suspect --12 you see, on the one hand if we decide in your favor, that13 means that any magistrate in the State, of which there may14 be many, in any criminal case whatsoever for probable15 cause can allow State officials to go into all the tribal16 documents no matter how many there are, no matter how17 related to government of the tribe, whatever they are.18 They're most -- they're most key matters for the tribe's19 governance. But if we decide against you, all it means is20 that you have to go to the Federal Government and convincesovereigns which has characteristics totally from foreign nation states.QUESTION: Mr. Kirby --QUESTION: I think we will hear in about a￼21 them that22 with it.2324 certainly 25this is really important and then they'll dealMR. KIRBY: Well, Justice Breyer, Congress has plenary power over Indian tribes. QUESTION: I'm not thinking of Congress. I'm181111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 saying right now -- you go to the Interior Department.2 They have people there. You go tell them what the problem3 is, and they say -- you say, this tribe is being totally4 unreasonable here, completely. I don't know why but they5 are. And -- and if they feel it's important that the6 Federal Government now has adequate ways of getting you7 the information you need. Now -- now am I wrong?8 MR. KIRBY: Justice Breyer, with all respect,9 yes, you are wrong.10 QUESTION: There's no way. In other words, it's11 just we're at a -- at a loss. Either -- either -- we'd12 have to get legislation, in your opinion.13 MR. KIRBY: In my opinion we have to adopt a --14 first of all, we cannot adopt a categorical rule that the15 tribes propose. So what we are looking for is a solution16 that is acceptable to certainly the majority of the17 Court --18 QUESTION: All right. You -- it's acceptable to19 you. You say commercial -- if it's a commercial body like20 a casino, that's -- they don't have the immunity, but if21 it's noncommercial, it's okay. But has this been argued22 below whether they're commercial or noncommercial?23 MR. KIRBY: It has not been argued below,24 Justice Breyer. However, that's not the distinction that25 we're making between commercial and governmental activity191111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425because, as I indicated earlier, if the government minutes, if you will, the tribal minutes, have direct evidence of a very serious felony for whatever reason --QUESTION: Okay. The distinction you would be making is?MR. KIRBY: A balancing interest, Your -- Justice Breyer. And I believe that --QUESTION: Why do you want to --MR. KIRBY: -- under the Younger abstention doctrine -- yes, Justice Kennedy.QUESTION: You want to do it the hard way. I mean, the -- you win this case if we say you can subpoena the commercial -- the records of a commercial enterprise being run by the tribe, but you don't want to do that.MR. KIRBY: We'd be happy to win this case on that ground, Justice Scalia.(Laughter.)QUESTION: May I ask, speaking of that -- that question, does the tribe itself operate the casino or does it operate it through a corporation of some kind?MR. KIRBY: The casino is operated through a corporation that is chartered by the tribe, not by the State. So the tribe has certain policies wherein it blesses an organization as a -- as a tribal corporation.QUESTION: Your -- your petition raises three201111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425questions, and so far, due to no fault of your own, you've only covered one of them. Do you want to try to get to the other two or three?MR. KIRBY: Justice Rehnquist, I see that my time is drawing to a close. If I may, I would like to reserve my time and perhaps address that in reply.QUESTION: Very well. Ms. McDowell.ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA B. McDOWELLON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAESUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS IN PART AND THE RESPONDENTS IN PARTMS. McDOWELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:I would first like to correct one misunderstanding that the Court may have been left with as a result of Mr. Kirby's comments. There is no Federal regulation or other Federal requirement that would have prevented the county or the State from sharing with the tribe the information, the welfare applications, and so on. Federal --QUESTION: Well, but even so, let's assume there's a serious felony having been committed involving a crime of violence where employees of the casino are implicated. Surely, the district attorney's office or the211111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425county is not going to share that information with -- necessarily with -- with the whole tribal council.MS. McDOWELL: In the first place --QUESTION: That seems -- that seems to me a very disruptive proposal for -- for orderly law enforcement.MS. McDOWELL: Well, Your Honor, nothing in the position that's being urged here would preclude a State from proceeding against individual tribal members and searching their own --QUESTION: No, but the suggestion was that there'd be a lot of cooperation between the tribes. But it seems to me that that may compromise a very serious criminal investigation.MS. McDOWELL: Well, and -- and if that's the case, they would not need to share the information with the tribe, but they could proceed against the individual tribal member.QUESTION: No, no. But -- no, the problem that he's trying to put -- imagine the most serious crime you can think of committed off the reservation by people who have nothing to do with the Indian tribe, for example, but there is a key piece of evidence that is there in the tribal document and they want to get it.Now, what we've just been told is there -- they can't -- if -- if we decide for the tribe, there's no way221111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 whatsoever they can get it. It's impossible. If the2 tribe refuses to cooperate, the Federal Government can do3 nothing without new laws being passed. Now, is all that4 the case?5 MS. McDOWELL: No, that's not the case, Justice6 Breyer. In many instances, of course, if there was a7 serious crime, it's a crime that the Federal Government,8 as well as the State, could prosecute, and there's no9 immunity bar to --10 QUESTION: But if there -- it's not --11 QUESTION: In the 280 jurisdiction?12 MS. McDOWELL: Even in the Public Law 28013 jurisdiction, Justice O'Connor, because there are Federal14 statutes, as you're well aware, dealing with firearms,15 narcotics, racketeering and so on that could often be used16 in this sort of situation.17 In addition, the Federal Government could often18 bring the parties together and try to reconcile these19 sorts of disagreements. Tribes, after all, are sovereign20 governments. They have a significant interest in law21 enforcement.22 QUESTION: Well, Ms. McDowell, let's talk about23 their being sovereign. I had thought that we -- that our24 cases make very clear that their sovereignty is a peculiar25 and lesser kind of sovereignty. It is certainly -- does231111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 not exceed the sovereignty of the States or of foreign2 countries. And I -- I am perplexed at why -- why the3 United States wants to accord the -- the tribe's4 commercial enterprises greater protection than is accorded5 to England or -- or Germany or any -- any foreign6 sovereign --7 MS. McDOWELL: Well, of course --8 QUESTION: -- where suit is allowed. And I'm9 sure in the course of suit, you can subpoena documents10 relating to that -- to that commercial enterprise. Why11 should we -- and that provision in the Foreign Sovereign12 Immunities Act was simply a reflection of what the13 international norm had become. Now, why in the world14 should we accord greater protection to this lesser15 sovereignty that -- that consists of the Indian tribe?16 MS. McDOWELL: Well, in the Kiowa case, Your17 Honor, the Court extended tribal sovereign immunity to18 commercial off-reservation activities of a tribe. The19 Court recognized that any limitation on tribal sovereign20 immunity that would exclude a tribe's commercial21 activities from the protections of sovereign immunity was22 a task for Congress rather than for the judiciary.23 And it is significant that when commercial24 activities of the United States Government, for example,25 have been -- when suit has been allowed against such241111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 entities, it's been a matter of -- of statute, not a2 matter of judicial decision. Indeed, the Foreign3 Sovereign Immunities Act is, after all, a statutory4 protection.QUESTION: I think there was a dissent in that made the point that Justice Scalia has been56 case that7 pursuing.89 here. This is a suit brought by the tribe, not by theI'd like to back up and find out how we got10 county, right?11 MS. McDOWELL: That's correct, Your Honor.12 QUESTION: And I think you are urging that 198313 is not available --14 MS. McDOWELL: That's correct.15 QUESTION: -- to the tribe either as plaintiff16 or defendant.17 If 1983 is not available, then what is the18 basis? What statute does the tribe's case arise under for19 the substantive determination that you would like to have20 the Court adjudicate? If we don't have 1983, what Federal21 law does the case arise under?22 MS. McDOWELL: It's generally been understood,23 Your Honor, although not specifically addressed in a24 decision of this Court, that the Supremacy Clause and the25 Federal jurisdictional statutes provide a right of action251111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 for injunctive and declaratory relief when a party is2 claiming that State action is precluded by superseding --34 action? 56 similar7 opinion8 this at9 Shaw v.QUESTION: Are you saying it's a kind of BivensMS. McDOWELL: It may be that. It's -- it's to Ex parte Young. Justice Kennedy's dissenting in the second Golden State Transit case discusses -- at some length. Also the Court's decision in Delta Air Lines provides a number of -- of10 citations to cases that arose in this particular context.11 So it is a settled, although not frequently discussed12 basis, of coming into Federal court to challenge State13 action.14 QUESTION: Is -- is there a problem on an Ex15 parte Young theory here? I mean, you're -- we're not --16 they're not simply asking the tribe to stop doing17 something that's unlawful by going against the officer who18 does it. They are asking for tribal property.19 MS. McDOWELL: I think you're referring to a20 situation where a State would sue the tribe.21 QUESTION: Well, they -- that's what's going on.22 The -- the county here wants tribal property, right?23 MS. McDOWELL: That's correct. It has obtained24 a search warrant against tribal property. Interestingly25 enough, the return of the search warrant directs the tribe261111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that if they want the property back, they will have to come into State court and proceed under the California Criminal Code.QUESTION: Well, is that Ex parte Young?MS. McDOWELL: No. That's not Ex parte Young. Ex parte Young is -- is based essentially on what the Court has called the legal fiction that when a State officer is violating superior Federal law --QUESTION: Right. So -- so Ex parte Young isn't going to cover a situation like that. I mean, an Ex parte Young analog in this situation isn't going to cover the -- the request here.MS. McDOWELL: Well, it is when one is considering the tribe's suit against the petitioners.QUESTION: Well, if -- if the -- what is the Federal -- basis for Federal jurisdiction of the tribe's suit against the petitioners if 1983 is not available?MS. McDOWELL: Well, the jurisdictional basis is section 1331, Federal question jurisdiction, Your Honor. QUESTION: But surely the Federal law that thecase arises under is not 1331 itself. You have to have another law, and the one exception to that is on the Federal side when the Court created the Bivens action because Congress had not enacted a statute like 1983 to cover Federal offices.271111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425But you seem to be asking us to create another such category where there's some right of action implied from what?MS. McDOWELL: From the Supremacy Clause, Your Honor, because the tribe's Federal common law immunity supersedes the State enforcement of a State search warrant against it.QUESTION: This is such an obvious way to raise this kind of issue without that. The next time somebody wants something from the tribe, they say no, make them go to court and appeal it.MS. McDOWELL: Yes, but a search warrant is obtained in an ex parte proceeding, Your Honor. There's no opportunity for --QUESTION: Well, I mean, can't you just resist a search warrant and say, no, I think it's an unlawful warrant and go right to the State court and appeal it?MS. McDOWELL: No, you can't, Your Honor.QUESTION: Everybody just has to follow this. There's no procedure to resist --MS. McDOWELL: No, there's no procedure for that. And indeed, a -- a party that resists the search warrant may subject itself to criminal penalties for doing so.QUESTION: May I ask --281111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MS. McDOWELL: So that's not an optimal procedure.QUESTION: May I ask you a question about your theory that the tribe is not a person within the meaning of 1983? You seem to assume that if they could not be made a defendant, they also could not be a plaintiff. Don't you make that assumption in your argument?MS. McDOWELL: That's correct, Your Honor, and that's because the term person --QUESTION: And isn't that assumption plainly wrong? Because for -- to be a defendant, you have to act under color of State law. So there are all sorts of persons who can be plaintiffs who could never be defendants.MS. McDOWELL: Well, it -- it is not necessarily the case that a tribe could not act under State law, Your Honor, because, for example, with jointly administering --QUESTION: But in the normal course of events, it wouldn't be acting under State law. It's acting under its own law.MS. McDOWELL: That's correct, or it may be acting under Federal law.QUESTION: So in the normal course of events, the fact that it might not be a defendant wouldn't shed any light at all on the question of whether it could be a291111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 person for plaintiff purposes.2 MS. McDOWELL: Well, generally, Your Honor, the3 Court has applied the interpretive presumption that the4 term person doesn't include a sovereign. The term person5 appears twice in the same sentence in section 1983, so it6 would be curious if it was construed differently.7 QUESTION: Well, but a citizen, an ordinary8 citizen, could be a person for plaintiff's purposes but9 not necessarily a defendant.MS. McDOWELL: Well, that -- that may indeed be Your Honor.In the South Carolina Ports decision recently, recognized that the preeminent purpose of immunity is to assure that sovereigns are1011 the case, 1213 the Court14 sovereign15 treated with the dignity that their sovereign status16 entitles them. The execution of a State warrant is a17 particular threat to the dignity of a sovereign tribe,18 even more so perhaps than hauling it into court. It's19 obtained ex parte.20 QUESTION: You think that's so when -- when what21 you're doing is getting the records of a casino? I22 mean --23 MS. McDOWELL: That's correct. Now, we're not24 saying that every tribal business necessarily is an arm of25 the tribe for sovereign immunity purposes, but the￼301111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 particular characteristics -- may I finish, Your Honor?2 QUESTION: Thank you, Ms. McDowell.3 Mr. Peyton -- Mr. Peyton Chambers.4 ORAL ARGUMENT OF REID PEYTON CHAMBERS5 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS6 MR. CHAMBERS: Thank you, Mr. --7 QUESTION: Are you Mr. Peyton Chambers or Mr.8 Chambers?9 MR. CHAMBERS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.10 I'm Mr. Chambers.11 QUESTION: Very well.12 MR. CHAMBERS: Thank you. Thanks, Mr. Chief13 Justice, and may it please the Court:14 There are three principles of Federal law that15 bar this search warrant. The first is tribal sovereign16 immunity. The second is the longstanding principle that17 States may not infringe the right of tribes to govern18 themselves or internal affairs on their reservation. And19 the third is that there's no act of Congress that20 authorizes this search warrant, though two statutes,21 Public Law 280 and the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, do22 provide a framework for some assumption of State23 jurisdiction over tribes and Indians on reservation -- the24 -- reservations. The county doesn't claim that either25 applies here to authorize this act, and they do not.311111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425I -- I want to address, if I may, Justice Scalia's question about the commercial and governmental distinction because basically the Indian Gaming Act by Congress sets up a framework for tribes to operate gaming. This is a tribal enterprise. It has to be, under the Gaming Act, owned and controlled by the tribe. It -- and the proceeds of the gaming have to be used for tribal purposes, chiefly tribal governmental purposes. And they are by the Bishop Paiute Tribe.The Bishop Paiute Tribe is a small tribe in a remote area of California. It uses all of its gaming revenues to operate tribal programs on its reservation. Like most tribes, the Bishop -- the Bishop Tribe operates a health clinic, for example, educational programs, welfare programs --QUESTION: May I just interrupt --MR. CHAMBERS: Certainly, Justice Stevens. QUESTION: -- on the corporate point that wasbrought up earlier? Who pays the income tax on the earnings of the casino? The corporation or the tribe?MR. CHAMBERS: The -- the tribe is not taxable under the Federal income tax laws, Justice Stevens. And -- and the corporation, as an arm of the tribe, is not taxable.QUESTION: So there are no taxes on the321111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425earnings.MR. CHAMBERS: There -- there are no taxes.This is a relatively small casino. It's in a pretty remote part of California, sort of halfway between Los Angeles --QUESTION: But it is owned by a corporation rather than by the tribe itself?MR. CHAMBERS: Well, Justice Stevens, it's operated by a corporation that was chartered by the tribe. It's wholly owned by the tribe. And it -- it -- the board of directors, for example, is removable --QUESTION: Well, who owns the real estate that the casino is located on? The tribe or the corporation? MR. CHAMBERS: No, the tribe, Justice Stevens.The tribe owns all the real estate on this smallreservation in eastern California. It's an 800-acre real estate -- or trust land. It's owned by the United States in trust for the tribe.QUESTION: How about the slot --QUESTION: But this -- what you're saying is true of all --QUESTION: How about the slot machines? Who owns the slot machines? The tribe or the corporation?MR. CHAMBERS: They'd be tribal property, Justice Stevens, and operated --331111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Well, what does the -- does the2 corporation own anything?3 MR. CHAMBERS: No, I don't believe so, Justice4 Stevens. It's a simply a tribal arm and -- and it's --5 it's -- it is the tribe. And it has to be the tribe under6 the Indian Gaming Act. My point is that Congress --7 QUESTION: You're -- you're sure that it doesn't8 own -- what does it do? What -- you say it doesn't own9 the land. It doesn't own the slot machines. What -- what10 does it do?11 MR. CHAMBERS: It -- it operates the gaming12 facility rather than having the tribal political leaders,13 Justice Scalia, engaged in the day-to-day operation of the14 -- of the gaming activity. But it's --15 QUESTION: But if -- if what was formerly tribal16 government has now been so infused with a commercial17 character, that it seems to me calls tribal immunity into18 question generally.19 MR. CHAMBERS: Well, let me try to persuade you20 it doesn't, Justice Kennedy. That the -- I mean here,21 first of all, the Indian Gaming Act was enacted for the22 purpose of strengthening tribal governments. That's what23 Congress was doing. Secondly, Congress required the tribe24 to own and control gaming operations. And third, Congress25 limited the revenues that the tribe gets from the gaming341111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 operation to be used essentially for the welfare of the2 members of the --3 QUESTION: How is that different from any4 foreign country that wholly owns a corporation engaged in5 -- in business? For any foreign country, when it owns6 such a corporation, all the revenue, all the profits go to7 the treasury of the foreign country to be used for the8 public benefit. At least where that is the case, I think9 that the sovereign immunity turns on the nature of the10 operation, not on whether the revenues go to the benefit11 of the people of the country.12 MR. CHAMBERS: But, Justice Breyer, there of13 course the country, the legislature, or the government of14 that country could decide what to do with its revenues.15 QUESTION: And they're all for -- well, what is16 -- so tell me precisely what is the difference between the17 casino and, let's say, the state of -- the Government of18 Finland which happens to own a shipping business 10019 percent and the revenues and profits from that shipping20 business go entirely to health care, parks, other things21 for the people of Finland. Now, what's the difference22 between our Finnish shipping line and the casino here?23 MR. CHAMBERS: There are two differences,24 Justice Breyer.25 First, the Finnish government, if it wanted to351111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 could decide to invest the proceeds of the shipping line2 in the U.S. stock market. The tribe cannot do that. The3 tribe is constrained by Congress to use the revenues4 essentially for governmental purposes or for charitable5 donations or a couple of other purposes. But it's not --6 it's like a State lottery I suppose, although even there7 the State legislature could decide to use the State8 lottery for some other purpose.9 The second distinction really was I think10 pointed out in -- in Justice Souter's question to -- I11 forget whether it was to Mr. Kirby or Ms. McDowell. But12 -- but Congress has enacted the Foreign Sovereign13 Immunities Act which provides that a commercial enterprise14 of a foreign nation operating in the United States is15 stripped of its sovereign immunity.16 Congress has never done that for a tribe, and17 it's very important to note that while sovereign immunity18 in the tribal context is a common law doctrine developed19 by this Court, it has been adopted by Congress. Most20 importantly, in the Indian Self-Determination Act of21 1975 --22 QUESTION: Why aren't you relying on Kiowa23 County? Because that was as commercial as a deal could be24 and the Court said no sovereign immunity.25 MR. CHAMBERS: Justice Ginsburg, as you pointed361111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 out, there was a dissent there, but a difference in Kiowa2 County is that you had a tribe engaged in the commercial3 operation outside the reservation. That's not so here.4 This is entirely on the reservation. It's a tribe --5 QUESTION: That's a fortiori for you I would6 think. I would think that the difference in Kiowa is --7 is -- it seems to me one -- one might say when the money8 is coming -- when money is sought that comes out of the9 tribal treasury, we're not -- we're not willing to take10 into account the commercial nature of the enterprise.11 It's still coming out of the tribal treasury.12 But this is quite a different matter. Nothing13 comes out of the tribal treasury. And you're -- you're14 just seeking documents that belong to the commercial15 enterprise essentially. I -- I don't know that Kiowa16 necessarily covers this case.17 MR. CHAMBERS: I hope I can persuade you that it18 does, Justice Scalia, that -- that -- the sovereign19 immunity basically covers funds and property and the20 operation of a tribal or any government, whether it's the21 Federal Government, a State government, or a tribal22 government. And it protects that categorically from23 judicial process of a non-superior sovereign.24 Here the tribe is not subordinate to the State25 of California. The tribe is subordinate to the United371111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 States and the county is subordinate to the State of2 California. But the tribe is not subordinate to3 California. So the tribe's policy cannot be displaced by4 California when it's operating its own government.5 Now, this could apply to any record of the6 tribe, and -- and the tribe operates, as I said, health7 care programs, educational programs. All -- virtually all8 Indian tribes do this today, and it's --9 QUESTION: The tribe is subordinate to this --10 to this extent, that the laws of the State of California11 can be enforced under -- under section 280.12 MR. CHAMBERS: Justice --13 QUESTION: Under law 280.14 MR. CHAMBERS: Justice Kennedy, Public Law 28015 confers criminal jurisdiction on California on offenses by16 or against Indians. That's the language of Public Law17 280. It does not apply to tribes. The Court held in the18 Bryan v. Itasca County case that Public Law 280 does not19 apply to tribes, and in the second Three Affiliated Tribes20 decision, the Court said that Public Law 280 does not21 waive tribal immunity or interfere with tribal rights of22 self-governance. So -- so Public Law 280 -- and the State23 doesn't claim -- I'm sorry -- the county doesn't claim24 that the State has any jurisdiction over the tribe under25 Public Law 280.381111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425That proceeds really to another reason why the -- why the warrant is not good here under Federal law.QUESTION: Well, but it -- but it has jurisdiction over individuals who by hypothesis either in this case or some hypothetical case might be given -- might be being -- being sheltered by the tribe.MR. CHAMBERS: Well, Justice Kennedy, the tribe isn't sheltering anybody. This tribe wouldn't shelter anybody and -- and tribes don't do that.QUESTION: Well, why didn't the tribe --QUESTION: We're -- we're talking about hypothetical instances --MR. CHAMBERS: Okay.QUESTION: -- as to how this -- as to how this rule that you advocate would apply.MR. CHAMBERS: Justice Kennedy, I think how it should apply is that the rule should encourage cooperative intergovernmental agreements between tribes and counties, and that is in fact what happens all over Indian reservations today, that --QUESTION: Well, then why didn't it happen on your side?I would like to ask a question of the same nature that Justice O'Connor asked the county. These were employees of the casino. They had twice received notices391111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 from the county saying, here's the payroll thing, what it2 says you've got, and here is the welfare payment you3 received. Would you please reconcile these? And the4 employees didn't respond, didn't respond twice. And so5 the county comes to the employer, the casino, and says,6 help us out. These people -- I guess we could lock them7 up, but we would prefer just to have you give us the8 records that will enable us to determine whether there was9 welfare cheating.10 MR. CHAMBERS: Justice Ginsburg, the tribe tried11 to avoid this confrontation. First, the tribe did get a12 letter asking for information about three employees13 without any specification of why. The tribe responded14 that its policies do not allow a disclosure of employee15 information without the consent of the employees. Then,16 without any further notice, the county came to the tribe17 with armed officers and insisted on seeing the records.18 Now, the reason that -- I mean, the tribe has19 security officers in the casino. They came in a private20 part of the casino. But obviously the tribe doesn't want21 that kind of confrontation. They told the officers where22 the records were. The officers went with deadbolt cutters23 into the tribe's building, cut the locks, and seized the24 records.25401111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼QUESTION: Are you saying the tribe did not know1 that this 23 time that4 Ginsburg.56 the tribe7 district attorney. They said we don't want to have this8 kind of thing happening again and offered to work it out9 by accepting simply a copy of the last page of the --10 California law requires a welfare applicant to sign an11 acknowledgement that employers can turn records over to12 the county investigating welfare fraud.13 QUESTION: Mr. Kirby said there was some Federal14 regulation that blocked that and then Ms. McDowell told us15 that there is no such regulation.16 MR. CHAMBERS: I think Ms. McDowell is right,17 Justice Ginsburg. But -- but I guess one would have to18 look at the regulation, and I'm sure the Court will.19 QUESTION: All right. So what's your suggestion20 on this point? That -- it seems to me that what we have21 is an instance where perhaps both sides feel the other was22 being very unreasonable, but something that should have23 been worked out. And -- and so because you couldn't work24 it out, one way to work it out would be get the Federal25 Government involved, but it couldn't be worked out.411111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005investigation pertained to welfare fraud?MR. CHAMBERS: I believe that is correct at the the search warrant was executed, JusticeNow, the tribe took that hit basically. I mean,didn't do anything. They approached the￼1 So now we're in a position of either having to2 say no matter how unreasonable the tribe is in stopping3 the State from getting evidence of a serious crime, well,4 that's -- the tribe wins, or saying no matter how5 unreasonable the State is in trying to interfere with the6 activities of the tribe, they win.7 Now, to me quite honestly, neither of those8 solutions is satisfactory. Do we have to choose the one9 or the other?10 MR. CHAMBERS: I think that you have to choose a11 -- a solution that respects the tribe's operation as a12 government. The tribe --QUESTION: If I have to choose, why wouldn't I if I'm trying to look for a compromise that the essence of it, very well, if I have to1314 just say,15 preserves16 choose between two imaginary, unreasonable warring17 parties, I will say that where it's commercial, the tribe18 loses; where it's noncommercial, the tribe wins. What's19 wrong with that, which is where we started?20 MR. CHAMBERS: Well, what's wrong with that here21 is we don't have imaginary parties. We have real parties22 here.23 QUESTION: No. I understand that.24 MR. CHAMBERS: I understand your hypothetical25 and I -- I don't want to say it's not this case. I know￼421111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 I'm not supposed to say that.2 But I -- but I think that -- that the -- I mean,3 here what you have is a tribe that tried to work it out.4 The tribe was willing and is willing to sign an5 intergovernmental law enforcement agreement with the6 county.7 Tribes and counties do this all over the8 country. You know this, for example, from the amicus9 brief filed by four States on behalf of the tribe in this10 case, four States that have two-thirds of the Indian11 reservation trust lands in the country in their borders12 and the majority of Indians who live on reservations13 within their borders. Those States say that they work it14 out between tribes and counties, tribes and States.15 Tribes have agreements all over the country with counties16 about domesticating search warrants, about extradition --17 QUESTION: Those -- those agreements may be18 prompted by at least the uncertainty of what would happen19 if they didn't make an agreement. I mean, we don't know20 that those agreements aren't prompted in part by the21 uncertainty as to whether, if there were not an agreement,22 the State couldn't come in anyway.23 MR. CHAMBERS: Well, Justice Scalia, I -- I24 think that ascribes -- tribes do try to operate -- tribes25 have a very strong interest in law enforcement too. And431111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 -- and there were plenty of alternatives here available to2 the county. The county could have gone and gotten a3 search warrant against the individuals. That -- those are4 the people they had to prove had the intent to defraud5 them anyway.67 records. 89 Ginsburg,10 cancelled1112 didn't file whatever was required, the State -- whatever13 payroll reports it was required to report to the State.14 So it's the tribe's default. And the State now wants to15 enforce the requirement that -- that all employers in the16 State file certain records about their employees. Could17 the State, which could go after any other operation that18 fails to file required papers, go after the tribe?19 MR. CHAMBERS: Justice Ginsburg, the tribe is20 required under its compact with the State of California to21 file certain information because the tribe, for example,22 participates --23 QUESTION: Yes, and if it doesn't -- doesn't --24 MR. CHAMBERS: If it doesn't, there are dispute25 resolution mechanisms in the compact and there's a waiver441111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005QUESTION: But the individuals don't have the The -- the tribe does have the payroll records. MR. CHAMBERS: They would presumably, Justice I think have their bank accounts or -- or checks or -- or other information.QUESTION: Suppose the question were the casino￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425of tribal sovereign immunity for the enforcement of those dispute resolution provisions. So the answer to the question in -- in that situation is that the State could get that information.But here the tribe has filed all the things it's required under that compact to file with the State --QUESTION: May I ask kind of a background question? Because I'm really not sure of the answer.Supposing a tort was committed within the casino by one non-Indian against another non-Indian. Where would the recovery be allowed for that tort? Could they sue in an Indian court or State court, and what law would apply?MR. CHAMBERS: Justice Stevens, in that case they would sue in State court because the State would have jurisdiction over a civil action, even actually in a Public Law 280 State between an Indian and an Indian.QUESTION: Suppose there was a tort committed by a casino employee against a patron. Would the State have jurisdiction over that suit?MR. CHAMBERS: The State would have jurisdiction over that suit, Justice Stevens, unless the nature ofthe --QUESTION: Well, could the -- could the litigant in that suit get discovery from the tribe in that suit --MR. CHAMBERS: I was going to say --451111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: -- in State court?2 MR. CHAMBERS: They could not get discovery to3 the extent that it would intrude on essential governmental4 functions of the tribe because that would be --5 QUESTION: Well, the very records that were6 involved in this case -- some reason they had to identify7 the particular person in the casino who was responsible8 for the tort and you have to look at employment records to9 find out. Could they get that in a civil suit in State10 court, do you think?11 MR. CHAMBERS: No -- no, they could not without12 the tribe's consent, Justice Stevens. But in the ordinary13 course of business, if the tribe understood the nature and14 need of the issue, why, almost surely it would comply with15 a -- with a request like that. But --16 QUESTION: You -- you say essential government17 records, but these are basically commercial records, are18 they not?19 MR. CHAMBERS: Mr. Chief Justice, I see I20 haven't persuaded you. I -- I think they are given the21 nature of Congress' oversight and limitations Congress has22 put on the operation of this facility and -- and all23 tribal gaming facilities. So this isn't just any tribal24 business. This is a business that's operated under pretty25 strict guidelines by Congress for it to be owned and461111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425operated by the tribe.QUESTION: Well, if the tribe were operating atrading post, would it be different?MR. CHAMBERS: It could well be different,Justice -- Chief Justice Rehnquist.QUESTION: Mr. Chambers, you -- the tribe filedthis suit under section 1983. Is that correct?MR. CHAMBERS: It filed it under several --under 1331 and 1983, Justice O'Connor.QUESTION: And one of the questions we have toanswer is whether the tribe is a person under section 1983.MR. CHAMBERS: Well, if you -- yes, if the Court decides that --QUESTION: And I -- I would appreciate it if you would address that point because the interpretive presumption is that the tribe, as a sovereign, which you're so strongly urging here, is not a person under section 1983. Why should we recognize that it's covered as a person under section 1983?MR. CHAMBERS: Justice O'Connor, you should do so because -- because section 1983 is a broad remedial statute for violations of Federal rights by States.QUESTION: Well, does that mean we should just go wild construing it for that reason?471111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. CHAMBERS: No, Mr. Chief Justice. And I2 don't think you have. I --3 QUESTION: I don't think we will.4 (Laughter.)5 MR. CHAMBERS: No, but -- but --6 QUESTION: But it doesn't include States?7 MR. CHAMBERS: No, it doesn't, Justice O'Connor.8 QUESTION: Why would it include the tribe?9 QUESTION: And it doesn't -- it doesn't include10 foreign governments. We said a couple of years ago11 Paraguay couldn't bring a 1983 suit.12 MR. CHAMBERS: Yes, you did. You did in the13 context of a pretty late capital punishment --14 QUESTION: No, but I mean --15 MR. CHAMBERS: -- interception by Paraguay.16 QUESTION: No. Sure, it was -- it was late in17 the day for capital punishment. We were deciding a -- a18 question of -- of the meaning of section 1983, and I don't19 know why that isn't good for your case too.20 MR. CHAMBERS: Justice Souter, it's not good21 because there wasn't a history in 1871 of States impacting22 negatively on States' Federal rights or on the Federal23 rights of foreign states and there was in the case of24 Indian tribes. This Court had decided in 1867 two cases25 cited in our brief involving the Kansas Indians and the481111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 New York Indians, and the Court had decided the Cherokee2 cases about 30 years before where there were serious3 intrusions on tribes' Federal rights by States.4 So Congress, when it enacted section 1983, was5 not only presumptively aware of those, but in the 18706 committee report relied on by the Government, by the7 Senate Judiciary Committee, specifically makes reference8 to the Kansas Indian case when it's considering whether9 Indians are citizens under the Fourteenth Amendment and10 when they're not.11 QUESTION: But -- but you agree, I think, that12 the tribe is not suable. Under -- as a defendant, the13 tribe is not amenable to 1983 as a defendant.14 MR. CHAMBERS: That -- that is correct, Justice15 Ginsburg. But, for example, in the antitrust cases,16 you've held that States can sue as plaintiffs. You've17 held that foreign nations can sue as plaintiffs. They18 can't be sued as defendants under antitrust statutes. And19 I think in the Vermont Natural Resources Agency case on20 the False Claim Act, you decided that while a State could21 not be sued as a defendant under the False Claim Act, that22 it wouldn't necessarily preclude it from suing as a23 plaintiff.24 QUESTION: Mr. Chambers, I thought your -- your25 first position on this issue was that it was not raised491111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425below. You raised that in your brief in opposition to the petition. Are you abandoning that now?MR. CHAMBERS: No, I'm not, Justice Scalia. I'm trying to answer the question --QUESTION: No, I understand that. But you -- but -- but you didn't mention a thing about it, and it was in your brief in opposition to the petition. It was also in your brief. You claim that the 1983 issue was not raised below.MR. CHAMBERS: And -- and should have been if it's going to be pressed to this Court. I -- I do agree with that, Justice Scalia.QUESTION: Then what is county's jurisdictional basis? And don't tell me 1331 because it has to arise under some law other than 1331.MR. CHAMBERS: I'm not going to tell you 1331.QUESTION: I don't mean the counties. I mean the tribe.MR. CHAMBERS: No, no. It arises under Federal common law when sovereign immunity or the right to self- government is being pleaded. And that's --QUESTION: And your -- and your best citation for that proposition?MR. CHAMBERS: Two cases, Justice Kennedy: the National Farmers Union v. Crow Tribe and the second Oneida501111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 case, both in 1985.2 QUESTION: So is the injunctive relief -- I3 looked at the declaratory relief in the complaint and it4 didn't seem really directly on point. The -- the request5 for declaratory relief had to do with the Gaming Act, law6 280, compacts, et cetera. So they didn't seem really to7 raise the question we now have. Then there's a section on8 damages, which is 1983, and then some requests for9 injunctive relief.10 MR. CHAMBERS: Justice Breyer, the -- the first11 count in the complaint did raise the right of self-12 governance.13 QUESTION: Not the first request for relief.14 The requests for relief -- there are five, and the first15 two have to do with the declaratory judgment. I think16 they're not right on this point, but --17 MR. CHAMBERS: Okay. Well, I -- I think at18 least the -- the count did do that and sovereign immunity19 was pled in the complaint.20 And then also, the preemptions -- Supremacy21 Clause issue that Ms. McDowell was mentioning in the22 Golden State Transit, I think, dissent by Justice Kennedy23 cites Gibbons v. Ogden and the Cooley case v. the Port of24 Philadelphia, going back into the 19th century for the25 proposition --511111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Those came up out of State courts,2 though. They didn't come up through the Federal system.3 MR. CHAMBERS: I guess that's correct. I think4 that -- yes, there wasn't Federal question jurisdiction in5 that part of -- of the 19th century.6 QUESTION: So what -- the Federal question7 jurisdiction you're saying is Federal common law.8 Anything else?9 MR. CHAMBERS: Well, I certainly think in10 footnote 27 of our brief, we cited a number of Indian11 cases, the Chickasaw case, the Sac and Fox case, New12 Mexico Apache Tribe v. Mescalero, where the Court had13 entertained similar claims under 1331.14 We're only seeking here prospective injunctive15 and declaratory relief against the county, and we only16 brought the action when they threatened the second search17 and seizure. We didn't do anything with the -- with the18 first intrusion. So -- so I would rely on -- on -- I19 mean, on -- on the number of cases where you have allowed20 tribes to bring preemption type claims against States21 without relying on section 1983, though -- though we do22 believe the compensatory damages are appropriate under23 section 1983 also.24 If there are no further questions, thank you,25 Mr. Chief Justice.521111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Chambers.Mr. Kirby, you have 4 minutes remaining.REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN D. KIRBY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. KIRBY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.I would like to address very briefly the flip side, if you will, of the categorical rule being proposed by the tribe and the problems with that. And that flip side involves not the police power of the State, which we have already talked about, but the constitutional rights of a defendant who is faced with criminal prosecution in a State court when that defendant feels there is exculpatory evidence in the possession of the tribe. For instance, it may be a video surveillance of the parking lot or whatnot that shows perhaps a self-defense defense for this particular person.Under the tribe's rule --QUESTION: It's odd for you to be raising a tribal member as a defendant when you have potential tribal members here who might be subject to suit. You seem a strange champion for such people.MR. KIRBY: It doesn't necessarily need to be a tribal member who might be a criminal defendant, Justice Ginsburg. It could be anyone, a non-tribal member or even a patron, who feels that there is exculpatory evidence531111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 that the tribe possesses. And under the Sixth Amendment,2 that person has the right to have the State issue3 compulsory process to obtain that exculpatory evidence.Under the tribe's rule that's being proposed, would have the ability to trump the Sixth right of the accused in that situation and not45 the tribe6 Amendment7 produce the exculpatory evidence. The tribe would also8 have the right to trump the Fourteenth Amendment rights to9 a fair trial of that particular person. And that's the10 flip side of the categorical rule that's being proposed11 and why we believe it's another reason it should not be12 adopted by this Court.13 With regard to the 1983 action, I would like to14 say that not only is the tribe not a person within the15 meaning of the statute and the interpretive presumption16 that this Court has set forth in, I believe, the Vermont17 Agency it was acknowledged. But also the right that the18 tribe is asserting, the right to self-governance, is not a19 Federal statutory right and it's not a constitutional20 right, and as such, it cannot support a 1983 action. And21 that is another reason why 1983 provides no relief for the22 tribe in this case.23 In -- in closing, I would like to say that this24 case does not implicate traditional sovereign immunity25 which is sovereign immunity from civil suit. And there541111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 was a question raised with regard to that, I believe by2 Justice Scalia, pointing out that the tribe's treasury is3 not at issue here. It's not at stake here. What we're4 dealing with is process, in this case the criminal process5 of the court. And that's a totally different situation.6 This Court has never addressed criminal process7 as being subject to tribal immunity. All of this Court's8 decisions have addressed the tribe's immunity to civil9 lawsuit. That is not what we have here. The doctrine of10 tribal immunity should not be extended in this case to11 include criminal process for the reasons that we have set12 forth.13 While there may not be any wholly satisfactory14 result, Justice Breyer, we believe that our position is15 the best position. Even if one has to choose between16 either of the two categorical approaches, simply even17 looking at the rights of an accused and compulsory18 process, that should mitigate toward the county's position19 here. We've also suggested a procedure, as presented by20 Justice White in Brendale, as being a potential resolution21 of this problem, maintaining the dignity of the tribe and22 also allowing the State to exercise its police power and23 protect its citizens as it investigates and prosecutes24 crime.25551111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼If there are no further questions --1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Kirby.
