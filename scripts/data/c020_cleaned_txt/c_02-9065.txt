Mark Close.Ms. Beckwith.ORAL ARGUMENT OF CORINNE BECKWITHON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMS. BECKWITH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court:The petitioner in this case, Shakur Muhammad, isa state prisoner who has brought a civil rights action alleging that a prison guard framed him on a false disciplinary charge in retaliation for his having exercised his constitutional right to seek redress in the courts for this same prison guard's previous misconduct. For three reasons, this Court should not engraft onto this type of Section 1983 claim a favorable termination requirement that would make this prisoner have to win his claim in another forum before he can seek his remedy in Federal court.First, the favorable termination requirement is a habeas protecting advice - device - that was borne of this Court's recognition that Congress would not have wanted a general civil rights action to be the vehicle for3, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 undoing a state criminal judgment, particularly given the2 more specific habeas exhaustion requirement.3 Second, extending the favorable termination4 requirement beyond this original rationale lacks any basis5 in the statute's terms or history, and it's devoid of the6 kind of common law pedigree that might suggest Congress7 envisioned a broader application to cases that do not look8 like habeas cases in that they don't involve a direct or9 an indirect challenge to the fact or duration of custody.10 And finally, any remaining qualms about11 Congress' intent are resolved by the Prison Litigation12 Reform Act, where, after carefully weighing the interests13 of overburdened courts and of prison officials, Congress14 imposed an administrative exhaustion requirement, not a15 favorable termination requirement.16 QUESTION: But I don't understand this about this17 case. I'm having an awfully hard time understanding this18 case, and - and it seemed to me what had happened was that19 the - your client, who's certainly well represented, he is20 sitting there at lunch and he makes some faces or gestures21 and the prison guard then has him up for a couple of22 charges and he basically is acquitted of the more serious23 one and they punish him for the more - less serious,24 threatening behavior, no, it's insolence or something like25 that.4, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 He never says a word about retaliation, never2 says a word about it. He never appeals, which he could3 have done, his conviction. He never says to the prison4 authorities, hey, throw this out. The whole thing was5 based on the guard's desire to retaliate. And now6 suddenly have his - not having done any of that, we're in7 Federal court, and the Federal magistrate says, you know,8 he has no evidence of retaliation, or at least not enough.9 And now we're up here arguing about Heck v.10 Humphrey, sort of like the Finnegan's Wake of the habeas11 corpus law, and I - I can't really understand how we even12 got here. I - I don't understand why, if you're right,13 this isn't an unexhausted claim, or at least the14 magistrate said you don't - your client, unfortunately for15 him, has not enough evidence. How do we get into this?16 QUESTION: Well, I suppose one of the reasons you17 got into it was that the Sixth Circuit said that you had -18 had to comply with Heck against Humphrey, and you didn't19 agree with it.20 MS. BECKWITH: Well, that's right, and you know,21 this is undoubtedly a valid First Amendment retaliation22 claim. The idea here is our - our client is saying, you23 know, he - he made perfectly appropriate allegations in24 the courts against this prison - this prison guard in25 prior lawsuits, and the guard set out to get him -5, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼123456 7- 8QUESTION: Can we reach this - I can't reach the Sixth - the question that the circuit thought was here. I don't see what we're supposed to say. What are we supposed to say? That - that this unexhausted claim, nonetheless, in 1983 states a claim?MS. BECKWITH: It's not - I don't believe it's anQUESTION: If I said what I said, is that correct 9 what I've said?10 MS. BECKWITH: I don't think so, because it's not11 an unexhausted claim, and I believe the whole point of12 this case is the - is the misstatement of the law by the13 Sixth Circuit that would deem this a non-civil rights14 claim, basically a habeas claim completely contrary to15 this Court's precedent in Preiser. We have, you know,16 Preiser v. Rodriguez, which set up the way, you know,17 followed up on by Heck v. Humphrey, the way that we decide18 which way these cases should go. Is this a civil rights19 claim? It should go through 1983. Or is it something20 we're worried might swallow the habeas exhaustion21 requirement?22 QUESTION: Well, does the Heck Humphrey issue23 that comes to us one that is affected by whether good-24 time credits are lost?25 MS. BECKWITH: The - whether good-time credits6, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425are lost is a - is a consideration and whether this is a fact or duration case.QUESTION: Right.MS. BECKWITH: And this case is nothing about - QUESTION: So after all the briefing, theadditional briefing that's gone on, do we know now for sure whether good-time credits are affected here?MS. BECKWITH: I think we do. The most important point on that question, Justice O'Connor, is something that I - a point I unfortunately made in a footnote instead of in the text, footnote 6 on page 5 of the yellow brief, which I wish had been the first sentence of my issue in bold, and that point is that it doesn't matter, because we're not - no part of our constitutional claim challenges the insolence conviction.QUESTION: But is - is that really the point? It's not what you challenge, it's the implication of what you want to be held.MS. BECKWITH: It - that's right.QUESTION: And those are quite different things. I mean, if in fact good-time credits are lost, even though you are not asking for any adjudication on good-time credits, then it necessarily follows that the length of the sentence can be affected, and it necessarily follows that at some point there could be a habeas claim because7, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the individual was not being released.MS. BECKWITH: That's right, but there's nothingabout this claim that would ever, you know, ever lead to the result, under the test necessarily imply the invalidity of the deprivation of good-time credits, which, by the way, I don't believe we were deprived of good-time credits, because of the reasons I state in my brief. Our client is a habitual offender and this claim was not raised in the lower court but -QUESTION: Well, let - let's - could we just make a short excursus there? Assuming that no good-time credits are lost with respect to the minimum sentence, the point of - determining the earliest point at which he could be paroled, isn't it the case under state law that good-time credits still would be applied to the maximum sentence?MS. BECKWITH: That - that is true. I don't believe that would ever -QUESTION: Then - then isn't that the end of your argument -￼MS. BECKWITH: I don't think so.QUESTION: - because doesn't it just finish -MS. BECKWITH: Sure.QUESTION: - my - my question so8-Imean,letmeyou know where, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 I'm going. If - if - if the good-time credits would apply2 to the maximum sentence, then it seems to me that if he is3 not released at the point at which he says he should be4 entitled to good-time credits, he's got a habeas claim.5 MS. BECKWITH: I don't think that - I think that6 that aspect of the claim, you know, aside from waiver and7 aside from not challenging the conviction that led to the8 good-time credits, if they exist, is still not true, I9 don't think. It - it's too hypothetical. Most of these10 cases are like Preiser, where there would be immediate11 release. He has to serve his minimum sentence under12 Michigan law, so he's not ever going to get out earlier13 than his minimum. He - those will not be shortened by14 good-time credits.15 After that, he's going to see the parole board16 several times. He's going to be 103 years old when he17 hits his maximum sentence. The likelihood that he would18 actually not be dismissed until his maximum sentence, you19 know, be discharged as opposed to paroled earlier than20 that and have his sentence terminated long before his21 maximum, you know, just makes it impossible that this22 would be anything but hypothetical -23 QUESTION: Well, but for ease of judicial24 administration, do we really want to have to look at how25 old he's going to be and all of these things? Is it not9, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 possible to say at the end of the day, good-time credits2 still apply to the maximum, so you're out of here?3 MS. BECKWITH: Well, that may be true in another4 case, but it's not true in our case, because we're not5 challenging, you know, nothing about our constitutional6 claim would necessarily imply the invalidity of that7 insolence 89 question,conviction.QUESTION: Well, sticking with Justice O'Connor's suppose good-time credits were involved here,10 but insofar as the prisoner is concerned, it was wholly11 peripheral, and assume that the good-time credits would12 not click into operation for another 20 years. Would it13 make sense for us to insist on Heck v. Humphrey in those14 circumstances?15 MS. BECKWITH: In - I mean, I think that - that16 Preiser created a clean line, and this Court has decided17 repeatedly that good-time - the loss of good-time credits18 falls on the fact or duration side of that line, and I19 think it makes sense to continue to maintain that clean20 line, and it's the kind of thing where good-time credits21 are the hard case. There's -22 QUESTION: So you think it does - so you think23 that if good-time credits were unequivocally involved24 here, that the Heck rule would apply?25 MS. BECKWITH: I don't - I - I think that's what10, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 this Court's precedents would suggest. There might be2 room for reconsideration of the good-time credits in the3 future when it - when it starts to get real hypothetical4 or when there - if there might be some abuses, such as5 prison, you know, evidence that prisons were, you know,6 had the perverse incentive of tacking on good-time credits7 to-8 QUESTION: Well, this is - this is very strange9 when we - when the original idea, I thought, of Heck was10 typing the kind of claim. I think the Court said in that11 case, this is not a prison condition case like my dietary12 law is not observed, am I not getting medical treatment,13 but it - it is like - there was an analogy to malicious14 prosecution, and here this has the same flavor, that this15 is - the complaint is that this guard had it in for me,16 and there were trumped up charges.17 And the way you get around - would you say18 you're not really attacking the insolence, what he - he19 was convicted, so you're only concerned with the six days20 pre-hearing detention, but I don't see how you can, in all21 candor, chop up your complaint that way, because if the22 officer hadn't been retaliatory, the officer wouldn't have23 confronted him in the first place, he wouldn't have been24 insolent, and nothing would happen. So how you can say25 is, well, we'll accept the insolence but really we don't11, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425because this is a retaliation and there never would have been any charge at all.MS. BECKWITH: Well, I - that's - part - along the lines of the argument the respondent makes in trying tousea-sortofabut-forkindoftake,ortest,ora relevance kind of test, but that is not the test. The test is whether the claim, the constitutional claim, would necessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction or sentence -QUESTION: I - I thought your response to that was that provocation was no defense to the charge -MS. BECKWITH: That's right.QUESTION: - to the charge of insolence.MS. BECKWITH: The respondent is - is arguingthat - that it goes to credibility. Credibility is not enough. That's about relevance or admissibility.QUESTION: But is not your position, and I don't know that the other side has contested it, that provocation would not have been a defense to the charge of insolence?MS. BECKWITH: That's right. There's no - QUESTION: And therefore, your provocation claim￼does not invalidate the insolence MS. BECKWITH: There's - correct, Justice Scalia. There's12, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005conviction.there's - that'sno way of litigating -1 QUESTION: How - how do I decide that, because2 that, it seems to me, is why I kept thinking I'm having3 trouble with this case?4 MS. BECKWITH: Well -5 QUESTION: It is inconceivable to me that under6 any law of any place that if a guard has gone and brought7 this whole thing about as a way of retaliating against a8 First Amendment right, I can't imagine a tribunal that9 wouldn't throw out the whole thing. I mean, I know you10 say, oh no, that isn't what they would have done. If he11 had gone to that disciplinary body and it said, look, I12 have proof here that this is total fake by the guard in13 retaliation for my First Amendment right, what that body14 would have said is, we convict you still of insolence but15 not of the greater charge.16 That to me is inconceivable, but whether that's17 soornotisapurematterofstatelaw,and-andit18 seems to me that this case then turns on a pure matter of19 state law, because I think if it is totally separate maybe20 you're right. If it isn't totally separate, I don't see21 how you could be right.22 MS. BECKWITH: And it is. I have several answer23 that. It is totally separate. You - you can't litigate24 the retaliation claim in - in a - in a prison misconduct25 hearing, just as Rodney King couldn't -13, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: You couldn't - you couldn't say,2 hearing examiner in the prison, I want to tell you3 something. The guard's doing this because I filed some4 earlier claims against him. What - what would be so hard5 about doing that?6 MS. BECKWITH: In fact, we actually - the hearing7 officer himself, in his deposition, which is at joint8 appendix 102 to 103, indicates he - he - retaliation was9 not a defense. It might go to credibility, but he can't10 consider that -11 QUESTION: No, but that's a - that's an issue of12 fact. And the thing that's bothering Justice Breyer is13 the same thing that's bothering me, and that is it seems a14 - it seems like a very strange statement of law to say15 that there would be no retaliation defense, and if - and16 yet it seems to me you've got to say that in order to17 avoid Heck and Humphrey. So what's your basis for saying18 it? Do you have -19 MS. BECKWITH: It's -20 QUESTION: - any state law authority for saying21 that so that we could make that assumption that you are22 correct in your statement when we decide this case?23 MS. BECKWITH: To tell you the truth, I just24 assumed it as - as a logical matter. It's like, as I was25 saying before, Rodney -14, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: You assumed that in - in the - in the disciplinary proceeding for - that, let's say, in a disciplinary proceeding for insolence, he would not be - the prisoner would not have the opportunity of saying, he got me into this situation in retaliation for filing these actions? You just assumed that?MS. BECKWITH: Right. It's just like assault on a police officer. If you're arrested because you're black and then you assault that police officer, you - you know, your - your 1983 claim on the illegal arrest is not, you know, it's - it's separate and apart from -QUESTION: But we're talking here about insolence. I mean, he gave him a dirty look or something or other.MS. BECKWITH: The - the hearing officer himself said that -QUESTION: Well, is there any state law authority that we could look to?MS. BECKWITH: I'm not aware of any and I'm sorrythatI-QUESTION: Well, it doesn't seem unreasonable to me. A police officer who's charged with a civil rights violation for - for whacking a demonstrator cannot please - plead as a defense, I was provoked. Doesn't matter if you're provoked, you're not supposed to do - do the act,15, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 and I don't know why it would be any different with - with2 a prison inmate if - if he was provoked -3 4 5 6 78 challenge9 misconduct proceeding in this case is really not relevantQUESTION: But he doesn't admit that. QUESTION: - to resist the provocation.MS. BECKWITH: And in any event -QUESTION: What's so unreasonable about that? MS. BECKWITH: - I think that what - whether we the - the misconduct - the result of the10 because -11 QUESTION: Well, his - his complaint doesn't say12 the kind of thing you just said. I think his complaint13 says, I'm sitting there, the officer made some faces,14 lured me into this whole thing, and then what he charged15 me with was false. So I - I didn't see - it's what16 Justice Ginsburg, I think, was talking about at the17 beginning. I'm just - maybe you have nothing else to say18 on it, but I saw this being chopped up. I saw one19 incident, it being chopped up as if there were several20 things, one insolence, one threatening behavior, and then21 separating that out, and I got totally confused about the22 Heck v. Humphrey part, the exhaustion part -23 MS. BECKWITH: The - the complaint is very clear.24 I mean, the gist - the most tangible part of - of the25 complaint is that I was overcharged, you know, and I had16, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 to do pre-hearing detention, six days in pre-hearing2 detention that I would not otherwise have had to do3 because this guard was retaliating against me for suing4 him, for exercising -5 QUESTION: This is the amended complaint. It was6 not his original complaint, and one of the many puzzling7 features in this case is the Sixth Circuit is addressing8 the original complaint, where this man says, I want the9 whole thing expunged, not that, yes, I was insolent, but I10 wasn't engaged in threatening behavior. The initial11 complaint said, this officer retaliated against me, the12 whole thing is no good, court, expunge the discipline.13 And it was only in the amended complaint that they came up14 with this theory, oh, insolence was all right, and the15 only thing that we're attacking is the threatening16 behavior.17 MS. BECKWITH: Well, the two complaints are18 actually very similar, maybe identical, except for the -19 removing the request for expungement. And, of course, the20 Sixth Circuit's -21 QUESTION: Well, isn't that a rather significant22 difference, because that says the whole thing is no good,23 the insolence is no better than the threatening, the whole24 thing is no good?25 MS. BECKWITH: Mr. Muhammad was - was not17, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425represented by counsel. He was - he was working pro se, and he amended his complaint. The amended complaint was accepted and that's - that's the complaint that's - that's before -QUESTION: But that's not what - that isn't the complaint that was before the Sixth Circuit, so at a minimum, shouldn't we send it back to the Sixth Circuit -MS. BECKWITH: No.QUESTION: - and say, look, you looked at the wrong complaint?MS. BECKWITH: Well, it was the complaint that was before the Sixth Circuit. They just made a factual error, and I think both parties agree it was a factual error, but it's one that didn't matter.QUESTION: Nonetheless, they ruled on a complaint that is not the one he was complaining about.MS. BECKWITH: But - but it doesn't matter, because they relied on Huey v. Stine and the case law in the Sixth Circuit. It wouldn't matter whether you asked for expungement or not if you are challenging the result, which the Sixth Circuit thought -QUESTION: Excuse me. All of this is relevant why? Because of the issue of whether he's lost any good- time credit, isn't that right?18, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MS. BECKWITH: I don't -QUESTION: Wasn't that issue waived by the other side and wasn't - wasn't there a finding? As I understand it, there was a finding by a - by the magistrate that plaintiff is no longer in the more restrictive custody of toplock or administrative segregation, nor in the more extended custody that would still faced him had he lost any good-time credit, and an issue was never made by the other side as I understand it, nor before the Sixth Circuit, that he had lost any - any good-time credit. Am I wrong in that?MS. BECKWITH: That's absolutely right. The issue wasn't presented -QUESTION: So it's waived. Why should we get into that here?MS. BECKWITH: Right. And if - but if -QUESTION: Especially having granted cert on a - on - on a significant question, to which that - that is - is preliminary.MS. BECKWITH: That's correct, Justice Scalia, and if good-time credits are not at issue, it doesn't matter if we're challenging the insolence conviction, because nothing about this claim is going to affect the fact or duration of - of confinement, so that, you know -19, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Though the state does dispute you on2 the good-time credit, does it not?3 MS. BECKWITH: The state does dispute. You know,4 I think they're wrong for four reasons.5 QUESTION: But too late, but too late. Isn't6 that your point? They dispute you, but too late.7 MS. BECKWITH: That is my point. I mean, that is8 my best point. My second best point -910 then it's11 If it has12 1314 in that way, if all you're complaining about is six days15 that he spent in pre-trial detention and your winning on16 that would have nothing to do with anything else, would17 not set aside the rest of the - of the loss of good time18 or anything else, then you're obviously right.19 MS. BECKWITH: That's right.20 QUESTION: That's what she says.21 (Laughter.)22 QUESTION: Why is it an issue for us?23 MS. BECKWITH: I agree. It's an issue because24 the respondent is trying to push the test of, you know, of25 Heck v. Humphrey into the context of misconduct20, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005QUESTION: Okay. If you're right on that point, the easiest case ever, you're obviously right. nothing to do with good-time credit -MS. BECKWITH: Well -QUESTION: - if you can chop up the - the action￼1 proceedings, regardless of the punishment imposed. They2 say even -3 QUESTION: You don't - you don't say that Heck4 against Humphrey should never apply to misconduct5 proceedings, do you?6 MS. BECKWITH: No.7 QUESTION: You just say it shouldn't have -8 MS. BECKWITH: As in Edwards, it should9 definitely apply when good-time credits are lost or10 something else happens, you know, in the proceeding. I11 can't imagine what besides good-time credits, but if fact12 or duration is affected - in this case, fact or duration13 was not affected. This is a classic civil rights claim.14 We're talking about the First Amendment. It could have15 been about religion. It could have been about race.16 QUESTION: Know what is very strange about this17 case is you've got these two threshold requirements. If18 it's a habeas line, then you can't skirt exhausting state19 judicial remedies. If it's a prison condition case, then20 you have the PLRA, you have to exhaust the internal21 remedies. Here, you didn't do either. I mean, if you22 take it on your case, this is really in the prison23 conditions line. You didn't even appeal internally.24 MS. BECKWITH: But that's - that's not at issue25 in this case. The - the respondent complained in the21, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425courts below about exhaustion. It was considered by the lower court. The respondent said, you didn't seek rehearing, and the magistrate judge said, I disagree with you, he didn't have to seek rehearing because he's not complaining about the insolence -QUESTION: But, nonetheless, you are saying that this is a case that can go into court under 1983 even though there was - it's not on the habeas side so you don't have to exhaust the judicial remedies. It's not on the prison conditions side and you don't have to - you don't have to exhaust internal administrative remedies.MS. BECKWITH: Justice Ginsburg, I absolutely disagree. He did exhaust. This was a question -QUESTION: What did he exhaust?MS. BECKWITH: He - he did everything he needed to do. The magistrate judge held that and the district judge affirmed that and it wasn't appealed -QUESTION: Where? Because it seems to me that he didn't. He didn't ask for anything.MS.

BECKWITH: No, the - the - the government filed a brief, a motion to dismiss, saying, you know, many things, but one of the things was he didn't exhaust his administrative remedies and they said because he didn't seek rehearing, respondent, or the - Mr. Muhammad responded, I didn't have to seek rehearing because I'm not complaining about the insolence. I agree I'm guilty of insolence. And the magistrate agreed. That's the end of exhaustion.QUESTION: Exactly. But did he exhaust administrative remedies for what he's complaining about here, which is -MS. BECKWITH: Right. There was no -QUESTION: - which is not the insolence conviction, but rather the sixth - the six day lockdown or whatever he had pending the hearing on the higher charge.MS. BECKWITH: As far as we know, he exhausted everything that he needed to exhaust.23, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

BECKWITH: The government -4 QUESTION: I know they said that, and that's one5 of the reasons I'm having difficulty. You would have6 thought that if he was retaliated against, he would have7 said to the hearing examiner, I was retaliated against me,8 the whole thing is no good, I had six days that I spent,9 at least deduct the six days from the seven days10 additional punishment you're giving me. He didn't say11 that. Nobody knew a thing about it. He didn't ask for a12 rehearing. He didn't ask a judge - I mean -13 MS. BECKWITH: I -14 QUESTION: - what I'm worried about is writing an15 opinion in this that says you're completely right, and in16 the course of doing that by every assumption I have to17 make, so mixing up the law that nobody can understand what18 it is.19 MS. BECKWITH: I understand. There - there's no20 doubt that the PLRA requires exhaustion of administrative21 remedies. It's not at issue in this case. It's not22 jurisdictional. Every circuit court to consider the issue23 has said it's not jurisdictional. The government raised24 the - the question. The lower court considered it. They25 - they ruled in our favor.

It was decided in the lower court. It's - it's over.QUESTION: Is - is it clear that the wrong ofwhich he's complain - complains - is one of the wrongs set forth in the Prison Litigation Reform Act, or is this - is this some -MS. BECKWITH: Yes. And in fact, that - that's one of our arguments that the Prison Litigation Reform Act reaffirms the - the clean line that was created in Preiser. You have fact or duration claims and you have conditions claims, Prison Litigation Reform Act, in - in creating an exhaust - an administrative exhaustion requirement for conditions claims, you know, indicates that this is the kind of claim that needs to exhaust.25, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

That's a discretionary determination.5 MS. BECKWITH: That's right.6 QUESTION: So it might have been the very same7 thing. The officer might have said, this is a bad guy,8 don't let him out until after the hearing. So, in one9 case, he can't get out because it's mandatory pre-trial10 detention. In the other - so this case is not about he11 had a right to be free, or free in the prison population12 those six days, but he could have argued that he should13 have been not locked up.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS L. CASEYON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTcharge him forand a Justice,￼MR. CASEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:I agree this is a very confusing case. We believe there are several reasons why summary judgment should be affirmed. The first is that because Mr. Muhammad did lose good-time credits, and because the nature of his challenge necessarily implies the invalidity of his misconduct determination, we think this case is controlled by Edwards v. Balisok.QUESTION: Why didn't you waive the question of good-time credits? I mean, why - you - you heard the27, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425discussion before.MR. CASEY: Yes.QUESTION: Why - why is this something we should consider?MR. CASEY: First of all, we believe it's - it's a matter of straightforward statutory - not even interpretation, just reading the text of the Michigan statutes on good time, so it's not some fact issue that -that can be waived. Secondly -QUESTION: Excuse me? Only fact issues can be -legal issues can't be waived?MR. CASEY: No, it's not a legal argument. Thisis a straightforward - a straightforward application of the statutory language that says he did lose good time.QUESTION: You did not - did you make the point below that the other side has to lose because he lost good-time credit?MR. CASEY: In our first motion for summary judgment, which was in 1998, we argued that Heck and Edwards controlled the case, that he was in effect challenging his good - or his misconduct hearing determination. The magistrate of the district court denied that motion, saying he is not challenging his misconduct. They agreed with his theory that this was a stand-alone retaliation case. So nobody - neither party28, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425nor the district court nor the Sixth Circuit got into the fine points of the argument about whether this was a duration case or a conditions case.QUESTION: Then why isn't it waived?MR. CASEY: Well, we submit it's - it's a straightforward matter. It appears that the magistrate, in his opinion or his recommendation denying our motion for summary judgment, was under the impression he did not lose good time.QUESTION: Okay. And let's assume the magistrate was wrong. As I understand it, you did not go to the district court and say, the magistrate is wrong on this point and this point can be dispositive under Heck. Am I correct?MR. CASEY: We did not argue it in those terms. We argued, as I say, the broader application of Heck and Edwards to the effect that he was - the nature of his challenge necessarily implied that his -QUESTION: But your position - your position as I understand was that even if he did not lose any good-time credits, that you - nevertheless, Heck controls.MR. CASEY: Yes.QUESTION: And that's the question - QUESTION: And that's what -QUESTION: - on which we granted certiorari.29, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 That's the question we - whether a plaintiff who wishes to2 bring a 1983 suit challenging only the conditions rather3 than the fact or duration of his confinement must satisfy4 Heck v. Humphrey. Now, that question is not in the case,5 if indeed the duration of his confinement is what is6 affected. And did you respond in the brief in opposition7 by saying, actually, this question is not even in the8 case?9 MR. CASEY: Yes. We -10 QUESTION: But even if you did, it's not in the11 case, none of it's in the case on the assumption your12 colleague there was making, or your opponent. Imagine13 that Mr. Muhammad wins his claim in the 1983 action, which14 the fact that they thought didn't have enough evidence15 suggests he wouldn't, but suppose he did. Then he says,16 what I've showed was illegal under the Constitution or17 whatever, was, by being put in confinement for six days18 before my hearing, and my being charged with threatening19 behavior, that's it, that's all. The rest of it is all20 beside the point. I don't complain about my insolence. I21 don't complain about the seven days. I don't complain22 about the loss of good time. I don't complain about23 anything except the six pre-hearing days and the later24 dropped charge of threatening.25 So, if he's right about that, if you can do30, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 that, if in fact his winning on that in no way calls into2 question the conviction or the loss of good time or the3 seven later days for insolence, then under Heck, of course4 he can bring it.5 MR. CASEY: Yes, that - that's correct. Heck -6 the favorable termination requirement of Heck only applies7 when the nature of the challenge necessarily implies -8 QUESTION: Fine. So now I've got to the point9 that either she's obviously right or you're obviously10 right, and what it depends upon is a matter of state law,11 which is whether, as a matter of state law, should he win12 this claim, it is true that his showing the retaliation in13 respect to the six previous days and threatening in no way14 calls into question the validity of the insolence15 conviction, the seven days, and the loss of good time. So16 I say, what is the answer to that question of state law?17 Or a sister concluded - it's fairly obvious under the law18 that they are separate. Now what do you conclude?19 MR. CASEY: We argue that they are not separate,20 that the nature of this challenge does in fact necessarily21 imply the invalidity of his misconduct determination.22 What he's challenging in this Federal lawsuit is23 retaliatory disciplinary action. That - that's the24 language that he used in his amended complaint. What he's25 saying is that the guard acted with an improper motive and31, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 that these adverse consequences flowed from that. The2 only adverse consequences that he's alleging are involved3 in the misconduct hearing. So we don't think that the4 fact that he was found guilty of insolence and not5 threatening behavior has any bearing at all on this6 question. It was one incident, one charge that this7 particular hearing officer felt should be reduced to a8 lower charge, but the nature of his challenge, if - if Mr.9 Muhammad is correct that this guard acted10 unconstitutionally, there should not have been any11 misconduct charges, should not have been a hearing, should12 not have been any pre-hearing detention or post-hearing13 punishment.14 QUESTION: Is - is - is that so? You - you think15 it, as a matter of constitutional law, you - you could not16 - you could not say that a prisoner has no right to17 threaten a guard even if he - even if he claims to have18 been provoked or has no right to insolent behavior even if19 he claims to have been provoked? As a matter of20 constitutional law, the prison cannot have such rules?21 MR. CASEY: The Heck v. Humphrey analysis says22 that there were certain claims that are not cognizable on23 a money damage action under 1983. Our argument is this is24 such a claim. If a punishment imposed affects the25 duration of confinement, the loss of good time, then under32, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Edwards v. Balisok, termination requires -2 QUESTION: I'm saying it - it does not affect it3 if he would have been convicted anyway, and the contention4 of the other side is that he was guilty of the offense,5 both the major offense, if he had been guilty of that, and6 the minor offense, regardless of whether there was7 provocation on the part of the guard.8 MR. CASEY: Correct. That - that's his claim.9 Our argument is that -10 QUESTION: Well, why - why do you - why do you11 assert the opposite?12 MR. CASEY: Well, that - that implicates the13 elements of the common law tort of malicious prosecution,14 as discussed in Heck and Edwards, and those elements15 include favorable termination and probable cause.16 QUESTION: But I think what you're not - it isn't17 the issue of whether provocation is a defense to a charge18 of insolence. I thought what you were saying is that this19 whole string never would have happened, nothing would have20 happened. If he - if he establishes the retaliation, then21 none of this would have happened, and it's just one22 episode.23 MR. CASEY: Well, if - if he's correct that this24 retaliation is independent of the hearing process, that's25 - that's his argument. Our argument is that the only33, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 thing he's complaining about is the retaliatory action,2 and the retaliatory action was charging him with3 misconduct. He -4 QUESTION: Is not - not retaliation separate in5 the hearing process. You're saying, is his point that6 when the guard looked at him from outside the cafeteria7 and made faces at him, and then he came in, and then the8 prisoner stands up and gives him some very dirty looks,9 according to the guard. Now, if you can separate out10 there the retaliation, if you can separate out there what11 the guard did by way of retaliation, making some very bad12 faces through the window, and insolence under state law,13 which would exist even if the guard were badly motivated14 in making the bad faces, then you've got your two separate15 things.￼1617 a claim18 conduct19 adverse20 deter a21 engage -22 QUESTION: Fine. And the - and the conduct -23 MR. CASEY: But that's -24 QUESTION: - of the prisoner that's retaliation25 isthat-that-hastodowiththat-MR. CASEY: Under Sixth Circuit law, to establish for retaliation, there has to be protectivethat the inmate engaged in and there has to be action taken against that plaintiff that would person of ordinary firmness from continuing to34, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 MR. CASEY: No, conduct of the guard.2 QUESTION: - would be his threatening look, but3 not his insolent look.4 MR. CASEY: If this situation had proceeded5 exactly as petitioner alleges up to the point where they6 were nose to nose for a few seconds and then they had both7 walked away, there would be no retaliation claim, there8 would be no constitutional violation at all. The only9 thing that gives rise to a constitutional right is the10 adverse action of charging him with misconduct. That's11 why we say that this charge is necessarily implicated in12 the hearing process. It necessary - necessarily13 implicates that his misconduct determination is invalid.14 If he's right that there should have been no15 charge at all, if he's right on that, then the Heck v.16 Humphrey analysis doesn't even come into play. We think17 he's wrong on that. The - the district court felt he was18 right on that and - and ruled against us on our Heck v.19 Humphrey motion. The Sixth Circuit in effect said we were20 right on that, that the nature of this challenge does21 implicate the hearing process, and under Sixth Circuit22 precedent, they said, therefore, it falls.23 QUESTION: But the Sixth Circuit was addressing a24 complaint that looked like it was attacking the whole25 thing, because it asked for expungement of the35, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 disciplinary - of the disciplinary action. Why didn't you2 call to the - or whoever was representing Michigan at that3 stage - call to the attention of the Sixth Circuit that it4 had addressed the wrong complaint?5 MR. CASEY: The Sixth Circuit issued its order.6 The petitioner filed a motion for rehearing. Under the7 court rules, we're not permitted to respond to that, but8 our argument is that even though the Sixth Circuit -9 QUESTION: You could have made a motion to remand10 or something.11 MR. CASEY: We could have, but we did not. In12 retrospect, I wish many things had been done differently13 in this case.14 QUESTION: Well, do you aggrieve, looking at the15 Sixth Circuit opinion, that it was examining the original16 complaint, not the amended complaint?17 MR. CASEY: It referred to the original18 complaint, but the - the holding of the Sixth Circuit on19 page 106 of the joint appendix, they say in an earlier20 Sixth Circuit case, and they quote it, in order to grant21 the plaintiff in this case the release he - relief he22 seeks, we would have to unwind the judgment of the state23 agency. That is the basis on which they affirmed the24 judgment.25 QUESTION: I thought you agreed that the Sixth36, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Circuit was looking at the initial, original complaint, not the amended.MR. CASEY: That they - they mentioned the initial complaint and not the amended complaint. That's correct.QUESTION: Yeah.MR. CASEY: But we believe that the rationale that they used, that his challenge did implicate the validity of his misconduct hearing, is correct on both his original complaint and his amended complaint.QUESTION: May I ask you a hypothetical question? Assume we had the case with the same facts except the remedy a different - if the, say the prison authorities had said you can't use your television set for 30 days and that was the only remedy and otherwise everything else was the same, and he said it was - they did that in retaliation because I exercised my First Amendment rights. If that were the discipline, would Heck v. Humphrey preclude relief in this case?MR. CASEY: Yes, we believe - that's the question the Court granted cert on. If a punishment affects only conditions -QUESTION: And that's the one we probably ought to hear some argument about.MR. CASEY: That's - that's correct. I - I37, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425agree, Your Honor. We argue that -QUESTION: And why would it preclude relief inthat case? That's what I'd be interested in hearing. MR. CASEY: Because as in the Edwards v. Balisok and - and Heck v. Humphrey, the proper method of analysis is to look to the most closely analogous common law tort,look to traditions of common law, public policy considerations in light of the purposes of Section 1983. In Heck v. Humphrey and Edwards v. Balisok, the Court said, in the prison context - prison disciplinary context, the favorable termination requirement applies. On the facts of those cases, there was good time involved, so duration -QUESTION: More than the facts of the case, we -the reason we - we - we adopted that common law rule was to prevent a collision between 1983 and habeas corpus law and prevent 1983 from being used as an end-run around habeas corpus limitations.MR. CASEY: Again, on - on the facts of the case, that's - that was the situation presented, because in that case there was a collision between the habeas statutes and the 1983 -QUESTION: And that collision was - was in the reasoning of the Court. It isn't -MR. CASEY: Yes, it was. But additional38, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 reasoning was based on common law traditions and we argue2 that that same rationale applies even if good time is not3 involved, even if it's just conditions of confinement as4 punishment.5 QUESTION: So that even if setting a - a ruling6 in favor of the plaintiff would not in any way call into7 question the prison disciplinary proceeding, it still8 should - Heck should still apply?9 MR. CASEY: No. If - if the nature of the10 challenge does not imply that the misconduct determination11 is invalid, then the Heck v. Humphrey analysis doesn't12 apply. It's not analogous to the common law tort of13 malicious prosecution. We don't assert that the favorable14 termination requirement applies to all conditions cases.15 We say it only applies when a claim for money damages is16 attempted which - the nature of which necessarily implies17 that the misconduct hearing is invalid.￼1819 is on the20 courts of21 applied, that the Sixth Circuit views it differently than22 the other 232425circuits that have addressed it. MR. CASEY: I believe that's correct. QUESTION: Do you agree?MR. CASEY: I believe that's correct.39QUESTION: Well, it looked like the Sixth Circuit short side of a five-to-one split among the appeals on how Heck v. Humphrey is to be, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 QUESTION: Yeah, based on -2 QUESTION: How - how is -3 QUESTION: - its own Huey decision, and I really4 thought very likely that was why this Court granted cert5 here, to see whether the Sixth Circuit rule is out6 with what we said in Heck v. Humphrey.7 MR. CASEY: The Sixth Circuit, and all of8 court of appeals' decisions that have attempted to9 the Heck v. Humphrey analysis to conditions cases,of stepthe apply are10 necessarily involved in - in extension of the Heck11 rationale to this other factual context, because Heck and12 Edwards involved good-time losses. I agree that's - we13 assume that's why the Court took the case. When we filed14 our brief in opposition, we suggested that there are these15 alternative reasons why the Court should not grant cert.16 One of them was the loss - that he did in fact lose good17 time, but -18 QUESTION: But, of course, that conceivably was19 waived, because you didn't get into it below. If we - if20 we disregard that and think that you waived this issue of21 good-time credits, and if we reach the merits on which I22 assumed we granted the case, then what justifies the Sixth23 Circuit rule? Do you say just because damages potentially24 are at issue that the 1983 claim can't go forward?25 MR. CASEY: A - a claim for damages cannot go40, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 forward unless there's favorable termination. If his2 claim was for an injunction changing the hearing3 procedures somehow, as in Edwards, that type of claim4 could go forward.5 QUESTION: I don't see the difference in the6 Sixth Circuit rule anymore. What - in what respect is it7 in the minority? I thought you were reading now, as I8 heard you, the last or the next to last sentence in the9 opinion -10 MR. CASEY: That's - that's correct.11 QUESTION: - that the Sixth Circuit simply12 thought that if this individual wins, if Mr. Muhammad13 wins, they would have to unwind the entire judgment of the14 hearing, which would include the judgment having to do15 with insolence.￼161718 -192021 any other 2223 different24 apply the25 conditions and not just to punishments affecting the41, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MR. CASEY: That's correct.QUESTION: And so if that's what they base it onMR. CASEY: That's correct.QUESTION: - is their rule different from that of circuit?MR. CASEY: The way the Sixth Circuit isfrom most of the other circuits is that they Heck v. Humphrey analysis to punishments of1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425duration of confinement. QUESTION: What QUESTION: They MR. CASEY: The conditions, punishments,is the condition -meaning the Sixth Circuit? Sixth Circuit applies it to and duration punishments.MR. CASEY: What do you mean by a conditions punishment?QUESTION: The - the punishments that Mr. Muhammad received were the loss of good time, confinement to administrative segregation, essentially remaining in his cell, plus loss of privileges for 30 days. So only the loss of good time affects the duration of his sentence -QUESTION: Thus, only the loss of good time could have been challenged in habeas?MR. CASEY: Correct.QUESTION: And the conditions couldn't have beenchallenged in habeas?MR. CASEY: Correct.QUESTION: And that's the distinction -MR. CASEY: The distinction in this case - QUESTION: - that the other circuits think iscrucial?MR. CASEY: Correct. In - in conditions challenges, habeas corpus relief is not available, so there will be no other Federal court remedy if a Federal42, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 civil rights action is not available.23 should be 456 time credits. That's waived, that's out of here. Let's7 just make that assumption. And you say that he's out of8 luck on pursuing any remedy for anything else?9 MR. CASEY: Prisoners who seek to challenge theQUESTION: And it - it's your position that there no remedy whatever for this person?MR. CASEY: It's our position that if he is - QUESTION: If - if - we're disregarding the good-10 nature of their complaint seeks to challenge or call into11 - whose challenges necessarily imply that a prison12 misconduct is invalid, do not have a Federal Civil Rights13 Act cause of action, whether it - whether the punishment -1415 QUESTION: And other circuits disagree. They say16 that in this case it would relate to conditions, and17 therefore, the 1983 suit could go forward.18 MR. CASEY: Correct.19 QUESTION: That's the difference?20 MR. CASEY: Correct. And the difference was21 created because the majority in Heck based much of its22 decision on a rationale of the common law. A concurring23 opinion in that case, signed by four justices, said, no,24 we're not going to base it on that rationale because that25 might mean that there would be no Civil Rights Act remedy43, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 in any such case. Subsequently, in the Spencer v. Kemna,2 one of the judges who - or justices - who had been in the3 majority changed her mind and is now agreeing with the4 rationale of the concurring opinion in Heck. So that's5 why the Sixth Circuit, or that's why the courts of appeals6 are split on this. On the facts of Edwards and Heck it7 involved just duration claims, but depending on the8 rationale for the rule, it may or may not apply to9 conditions cases. We say it does apply to conditions cases10 because -11 QUESTION: And the condition here - and one thing12 is the abstract level on which you're speaking, the other13 is concretely what this case is about. This case is about14 six days spent in pre-hearing detention. It's the only15 thing that money is sought for. Now, we're told that16 insolence is bondable, threatening behavior is not. Does17 bondable mean it will be bond? What is the incidence?18 What practically is the effect?19 MR. CASEY: Some - some major misconducts are20 mandatory non-bondable. Threatening behavior, the21 original charge, was mandatory -22 QUESTION: So insolence is not mandatory. What is23 the practice in the prison? Is it common to let people -24 MR. CASEY: On - on page 14 of the joint appendix25 we've quoted from the policy directive, and the standard44, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425is, if there is a reasonable showing that failure to do so would constitute a threat to the security or good order of the facility, so on a case-by-case basis, a prisoner charged with a bondable major misconduct could be placed in pre-hearing detention.QUESTION: Well, when you say bondable, I mean, you don't mean if a person posts a bond they're out on the street?MR. CASEY: No, no. That - that's the phrase used in these prison directives.QUESTION: But that's what this case is about, those six days when he was in administrative detention.MR. CASEY: Those are the six days for which he is seeking damages.QUESTION: And - and do you have, rather than being in the general prison population, do you have any statistical indication of - on charges of insolence, are people more often than not, or is it rare that they would be in administrative detention awaiting the hearing?MR. CASEY: I - I don't have the statistics of - the Department of Corrections probably could compilethat, but I don't know. I do know that there were last year more than 72,000 major misconduct hearings of all kinds, bondable and non-bondable. I do not know how many of those 72,000 resulted in pre-hearing detention.45, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: But was - was this argument raised2 below that there's no cause of action because there's no3 assurance that he wouldn't have been kept for six days4 anyway, even if it was bondable? You - you didn't defend5 on that ground, did you?6 MR. CASEY: It was not argued in those terms, no.7 As I said, the case was argued -8 QUESTION: Why do we want to get into that? I -9 I don't understand.10 MR. CASEY: No. We did not argue the - the terms11 of the bond versus non-bondable, because it simply didn't12 come up.13 QUESTION: So suppose now - I think Justice14 O'Connor may be causing the light to dawn in my head -15 suppose you're right, suppose that there is just one ball16 of wax. Suppose the - this is all a waste of time trying17 to separate those two things. There's just one thing.￼18 There's a 192021 wins. If22 good time23 of course24 the kind of thing that habeas was designed for. Habeas25 was about duration of - of staying in prison, and withconviction, all right?MR. CASEY: Correct.QUESTION: Now, we look to see what happens if he he wins, we set aside the whole conviction, but is out of it. And since good time is out of it, he can bring a 1983 action, because this wasn't46, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 good time out of it, it doesn't matter whether it's one2 ball of wax or two. He can go in on 1983 since there's no3 conflict with the habeas statute. What's your response to4 that?5 MR. CASEY: Our response to that in - in - in6 response to the question that the Court granted certiorari7 on is that even if good time was not at issue in the case,8 if the only punishment he received affected the conditions9 of confinement, our argument is, it's still appropriate to10 look to the traditions of the common law and public policy11 considerations to determine whether a cause of action in12 those circumstances is cognizable in 1983. We've argued13 that it is not cognizable. If he is challenging the14 validity of his misconduct determination, that's analogous15 to the common law tort of malicious prosecution.16 The elements of that tort require favorable17 termination before it can succeed. We believe that - that18 same element applies in a 1983 case. So if he does not19 get favorable termination of his prison misconduct, he20 cannot bring a suit for damages under 1983.21 QUESTION: It is essential to your argument, is22 it not, that provocation would be a defense?23 MR. CASEY: No.24 QUESTION: No?25 MR. CASEY: Whatever - whatever charge -47, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: If provocation would - would not be a2 defense, then even if he establishes provocation, for3 which he can get damages, he would not be impairing the4 judgment against him.5 MR. CASEY: One of the elements of the6 constitutional cause of action for retaliation is adverse7 action against the prisoner because of his protected8 conduct. The adverse action in this case is not the9 staring down and the nose-to-nose confrontation. The10 adverse action is charging misconduct, and we say, if he's11 right in his complaint that there would not have been a12 misconduct charge but for this action, that necessarily13 implies that the misconduct proceeding is invalid,14 that triggers the analogy to malicious prosecution15 element of favorable termination.16 QUESTION: So that you say basically, the17 importance of Heck and Humphrey here is the way it18 you ought to refer to common law analogies in analyzing19 whether there ought to be a 1983 action, and that has20 nothing to do in the final analysis with whether there's a21 collision between habeas corpus and 1983. That is an -22 that is an independent requirement of the way you go about23 analyzing 1983 actions.24 MR. CASEY: Yes, that's correct.25 QUESTION: So that even though there isn't a48, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005and and itssays￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425habeas corpus problem, you still go through the same methodology?MR. CASEY: Correct. You say the same methodology applies whether it's just conditions or duration of confinement. If it's a -QUESTION: Are you essentially making an exhaustion of - of state remedies then? It seems to me -are you - you're not saying that this person would have no complaint, no Federal complaint, not in habeas, not in 1983? Are you saying that -MR. CASEY: Yes.QUESTION: - or are you saying 1983 is premature? MR. CASEY: If he gets favorable termination. Wesay-QUESTION: Where does he get the favorable determination?MR. CASEY: The - if he got favorable termination by review of the misconduct - if he - if he had won at the misconduct or if he had appealed and won on appeal, that would be favorable termination.QUESTION: So you're saying essentially he hasn't exhausted his internal administrative remedies, and that's why the 1983 is improper?MR. CASEY: We say the - his failure to exhaust is another independent reason why he does not have -49, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: You're saying he has to both exhaust and prevail?MR. CASEY: That's correct. They're independent requirements.QUESTION: And that seems somewhat inconsistent with at least the negative implication of the Federal statute, which says all he has to do is exhaust.MR. CASEY: Well, the - the Court addressed that question in Heck v. Humphrey, and it said that even if a person exhausts his remedies, if he has not favorably terminated, he cannot bring the lawsuit unless and until he gets favorable termination. They're - they're independent. The exhaustion requirement -QUESTION: Well, that's the Heck v. Humphrey'sgloss, but that's an additional requirement. Usually exhaustion does not require prevailing.MR. CASEY: Well, that's correct. That's correct. The - the reason he has to get favorable termination in this case is because of the analogy to -QUESTION: Yes.MR. CASEY: - malicious prosecution. QUESTION: Right. It - it usually does notrequire prevailing, but it does require prevailing when - when your cause of action is that - that you have beensubjected to the law improperly.50, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. CASEY: That's correct. That's our argument.2 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Casey.3 MR. CASEY: Thank you very much.4 QUESTION: Ms. Beckwith, you have 3 minutes5 remaining.6 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CORINNE BECKWITH7 ON BEHALF 89 presentedOF THE PETITIONERMS. BECKWITH: Turning to the actual question in this case, there is no justification for the10 Sixth Circuit's rule extending the Heck favorable11 termination requirement to prison hearings that don't12 involve the fact or duration of custody. Congress could13 have amended 1983 to say that, but we know from the PLRA14 they looked at the same considerations, they did something15 different. The Sixth Circuit is an outlier here, as16 Justice O'Connor said, because there's no - there's no17 conflict with habeas in a - in a matter like this.18 As to all of the other questions that have come19 up during this argument, this case came to this Court in20 the posture where there were no good-time credits and21 there was no exhaustion question. Now, we think we can22 overcome those problems, but I don't think this Court23 needs to.24 And the - the government has never cited any law25 that says the guard's retaliatory conduct violating Mr.51, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Muhammad's First Amendment rights would have been a2 defense, and we know of none. They argued that it was -3 it was relevant to credibility. They argued that that was4 some kind of a but-for relationship, but victory in the5 1983 suit does not affect the adjudication for insolence6 in this claim. All of this only matters if good-time7 credits are at issue.8 And putting all of that aside, we just agree9 with Justice Breyer that then this is an easy case in our10 favor. If there are no further questions from the Court,11 we'd ask that you reverse the Sixth Circuit.12 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms.13 Beckwith.
