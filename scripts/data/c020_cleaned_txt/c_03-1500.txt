CHEMERINSKY:  Good morning, JusticeStevens, and may it please the Court:           On the grounds of the Texas State Capitol,there is one evident religious symbol that conveys apowerful religious message that there is a theisticGod and that God has committed rules for behavior.           Of course, the government may putreligious symbols on its property, including the TenCommandments, but must do so in a way that does notendorse religion or a particular religion, but doesnot have the purpose of advancing religion, but doesnot favor any particular religion.           JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Chemerinsky, Isuppose that opening statement suggests that youthink that Thanksgiving proclamations are alsounconstitutional, which were recommended by the veryfirst Congress, the same Congress that proposed theFirst Amendment.31111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425           MR. CHEMERINSKY:  No, Your Honor, I would - I'm sorry.           JUSTICE SCALIA:  They also refer to oneGod, to a theistic ruler of the universe.           MR. CHEMERINSKY:  No, Your Honor, I thinkthe Thanksgiving proclamations would beconstitutional.  I think it's analogous to thelegislative prayers that this Court upheld inChambers v. Marsh.  I think it's very different thanthis Ten Commandments monument.           JUSTICE SCALIA:  All right.  But then youhave to narrow your opening statement and say thatcertainly the State can acknowledge the existence ofa unitary God without offending the EstablishmentClause.           MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Yes, Your Honor, but itall depends on how it is done.  Here the way in whichit is done is the most powerful and profoundreligious message that this Court has ever consideredon government property.  Here you have a monumentthat proclaims not only there is a God, but God hasdictated rules for behavior for those who follow himor her.           JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I don't know whetherthat's any more profound or ultra-religious,41111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 super-religious than the prayer that the chaplain2 gives every day in the House.3 MR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, there is a4 difference between a prayer that a chaplain gives --5 in Chambers v. Marsh, this Court emphasized that the6 prayer by the chaplain was a nonsectarian prayer.7 This is very much sectarian. This proclaims that8 there is a God. It proclaims --9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I mean, I haven't10 read the prayer. So I would be surprised if I went11 through all the prayers and there was no mention,12 direct or indirect, of the Ten Commandments or a13 couple of them.14 MR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, I would be15 surprised because here, if you look at these16 commandments, it's that God has claimed that he is17 the only God, prohibiting idolatry, prohibiting18 graven images, prohibiting taking the name of the19 Lord and God in vain. Requiring observing of the20 sabbath. This is God dictating to God's followers21 rules for behavior.22 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any other -- I23 mean, you can continue if you want, but one24 difference which I've written down is you say that25 the difference between this and the prayer is that51111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 this is more profoundly religious. Is there any2 other difference, in your opinion?3 MR. CHEMERINSKY: No. I think the key4 difference is --5 JUSTICE BREYER: That's the difference?6 So if I happen to read these prayers in the Congress7 and I came to the conclusion that in terms of a8 religious message, I actually thought the prayers had9 the more religious message, then I should vote10 against you.11 MR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor. There12 are, of course, other differences. As I said to13 Justice Scalia earlier, with regard to legislative14 prayer in Chambers versus Marsh, this Court said that15 there was a history going back to the very first16 Congress that allowed there to be those kinds of17 religious invocations. Ten Commandments monuments18 standing by themselves, as they do here, certainly19 are not of that historic origin.20 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: How about if they're21 packaged in a museum-like setting and there is some22 interest on the part of the State in preserving23 something.24 2561111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Yes, Your Honor.JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  And displaying a whole￼1 variety of things?2 MR. CHEMERINSKY: Of course, there can be3 Ten Commandments or any religious works as part of a4 museum setting. This isn't a museum setting, Your5 Honor. Every monument on the Texas --6 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is this a kind of a7 park? What do we regard this space as? What is it?8 Is it a park-like setting?9 MR. CHEMERINSKY: It is a park-like10 setting. It is the acres of the State Capitol11 grounds. Every monument on the State Capitol grounds12 is there because the State legislature wanted to13 convey a particular message. It is a felony in14 Texas, an impeachable offense to put anything on the15 Capitol grounds without the approval of the16 legislature.17 Most of the monuments are there to honor18 war veterans. This is the only religious message19 anywhere on the Capitol grounds. And by itself --20 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, would it be all21 right, in your view, if they put several others up22 for different religions? Then is it going to be23 okay?24 MR. CHEMERINSKY: If the clear purpose and25 message was to honor the diversity of religions in71111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Texas, it would then be permissible. If it were a series of displays like that frieze, the fifteen different --           JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  You don't object tothat?MR. CHEMERINSKY: Quite the contrary, I think it's a --           JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Or the depiction on thedoor of the Court?           MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Quite the contrary.This is exactly how the State may display the TenCommandments.           JUSTICE SCALIA:  But the prayers inCongress don't do that and our Thanksgivingproclamations don't do that.  They invoke a God, aunitary God, and that's contrary to the dictates ofsome religions that believe that there are a lot ofgods.           MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Yes, Your Honor, thereis --           JUSTICE SCALIA:  We don't pray to gods,the prayers are always to God.  You know, I don't seewhy the one is good and the other is bad.  It's noanswer to say, well, you know, the former has beenaround for a long time.  Well, it has but it suggests81111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 what the framers and what our society for several2 hundred years has believed the Establishment Clause3 means.4 And it does not -- it is not too sectarian5 if it invokes a unitary God. Now, you're saying it6 becomes too sectarian when it invokes the Ten7 Commandments.8 MR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor. I'm9 saying several things. As I said earlier, first,10 this Court in Chambers v. Marsh said that there was a11 unique history to legislative prayers. There isn't a12 similar history here.13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Chemerinsky, too,14 doesn't the venue count? After all, we have had the15 question of prayer in schools, and the Court has said16 that that was not all right. Prayer in the17 legislature was distinguished. So it's not just18 prayer anywhere that the government wants to have it19 is okay.20 MR. CHEMERINSKY: Of course, Justice21 Ginsburg, the venue counts. And here the venue is22 very important. It is the corner between the Texas23 State Capitol and the Texas Supreme Court.24 And in that way, this monument standing25 alone does convey the government's endorsement for91111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425religion.           JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Okay.  But if thelegislature itself can have its sessions opened witha prayer, can the legislature itself want to have theTen Commandments posted within the legislative halls?           MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Your Honor, I thinkthere is a very different message that's conveyed.           JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Can it do that?           MR. CHEMERINSKY:  No, Your Honor, it can'tpost the Ten Commandments by itself in itslegislative halls because that would then be thegovernment endorsing expression for support for thatmessage.It cannot be, Your Honor, that just because there is a legislative prayer, that any religious message anywhere on government property would then be permissible. As Justice Kennedy has said in his opinion for --           JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  But it's so hard todraw that line.  If the legislature can open its ownsessions attended by the public with a prayer, yousay it cannot, in the same building, display the TenCommandments.           MR. CHEMERINSKY:  That's right, becausethe message from the government is quite different.101111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 The message with legislative prayers, as this Court2 found in Chambers v. Marsh, is a recognition of a3 long historical practice.4 But when it comes to the Ten Commandments,5 it really is different than even a legislative6 prayer. This declares not only there is a God, but7 that God has proclaimed rules for behavior. The Ten8 Commandments come from sacred texts.9 As Justice Kennedy said in his opinion of10 County of Allegheny, certainly a city council could11 not put atop the city hall building a large Latin12 cross, even if that city council begins every day13 with a prayer.14 It cannot be there just because some15 religious messages are allowed, like a prayer, that16 everything then becomes permissible.17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you know, in the18 First Amendment speech area, we're very, very strict.19 A moment's delay in publication is a constitutional20 crisis. And I'm not sure that we should carry that21 over to this area, where there is this obsessive22 concern with any mention of religion. That seems to23 me to show a hostility to religion. I just don't see24 a balanced dialogue in our cases or in these kinds of25 arguments.111111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, I don't2 believe there should be an obsessive concern with3 religion. If the Ten Commandments are displayed as4 part of an overall display of law givers, like that5 frieze, it's permissible. But when you put sacred6 texts somewhere on government property, then the7 message is that the government is endorsing --8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: This is a classic avert9 your eyes. If an atheist walked by, he can avert his10 eyes, he can think about something else.11 MR. CHEMERINSKY: I don't think so, Your12 Honor. This Court has said the key is that the13 government14 makes some15 outsiders.1617 or Hindu -- 1819 question.20 the Seventh Circuit on what they did in Lacrosse,21 Wisconsin. And as we all know, this organization has22 donated Ten Commandments monuments all over thecan't endorse religion, in a way thatfeel like insiders and some likeImagine somebody who is Muslim or BuddhistJUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask you thisSupposing -- I recently read a case from23 country. And what they did there is they sold24 parcel back to the Eagles, their name, and put25 sign which read, this property is not owned or121111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-the up aWashington, DC 20005￼1 maintained by the City of Lacrosse, nor does the city2 endorse the religious expression thereon.3 Now, my question to you is, if there were4 a similar disclaimer on this monument, would that be5 an adequate remedy, in your view?6 MR. CHEMERINSKY: It would be a harder7 case, but I don't think it would be an adequate8 remedy. And the reason is the city cannot put a9 religious symbol standing alone on government10 property just through disclaimer.11 That's exactly what County of Allegheny12 was. There the nativity scene in the courthouse had13 a plaque saying it was donated by others, but that14 can't excuse it because otherwise the city could put15 the large Latin cross just with a disclaimer.16 JUSTICE STEVENS: But if the test is17 whether the reasonable observer would think that the18 government is endorsing the religious message,19 wouldn't the disclaimer make it clear to the20 reasonable observer the government was not endorsing21 the message?22 MR. CHEMERINSKY: I think the disclaimer23 would make it a harder case, but I think when you're24 dealing with the ground in a Texas State Capitol and25 the Texas Supreme Court, that placement, when you're131111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 dealing with the Ten Commandments, sacred texts, I2 still think that the message the reasonable observer3 would be that this is the government endorsing4 religion.5 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: At some point, would6 the State's interest in preserving old objects7 overcome the objection constitutionally?8 MR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, at some point, it9 could where it was clear to the reasonable observer10 that it was there because it was an old object.11 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: How did this monument12 get there? Was it in -- is it true that it was put13 in as a result of promoting a movie about the Ten14 Commandments?15 MR. CHEMERINSKY: The record is unclear as16 to that. There are certainly many indications in the17 popular press that Cecil B. DeMille together with his18 movie, The Ten Commandments, worked with the Friends19 of Eagles to have these monuments put around the20 country.21 But there is nothing in the legislative22 history that links this particular monument to that.23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't the display on24 the tablets on the top before you get to the text,25 before you get to, I am the Lord, thy God. I thought141111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 that those were replicas of what was in the film.2 MR. CHEMERINSKY: I don't know that, Your3 Honor. I've tried to find out what that text is. It4 is not in Hebrew. It is not in a script that anyone5 was able to recognize. But it is important to notice6 that if you look at the entire monument, in addition7 to the Ten8 of Christ,9Commandments, there is also a Latin symbolthere is also Jewish Stars of David.And as I was saying in response to Justice10 Kennedy's question, imagine the Muslim or the11 Buddhist who walks into the State Supreme Court to12 have his or her case heard. That person will see13 this monument and realize it's not his or her14 government.15 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought Muslims accept16 the Ten Commandments.17 MR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor, the18 Muslims do not accept the sacred nature of the Ten19 Commandments, nor do Hindus, or those who believe in20 many gods, nor of course, do atheists.21 And for that matter, Your Honor, if a22 Jewish individual would walk by this Ten23 Commandments, and see that the first commandment24 isn't the Jewish version, I am the Lord, thy God,25 took you out of Egypt, out of slavery, would realize151111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 it's not his or her government either.2 JUSTICE SCALIA: You know, I think3 probably 90 percent of the American people believe in4 the Ten Commandments, and I'll bet you that 855 percent of them couldn't tell you what the ten are.6 (Laughter.)7 JUSTICE SCALIA: And when somebody goes by8 that monument, I don't think they're studying each9 one of the commandments. It's a symbol of the fact10 that government comes -- derives its authority from11 God. And that is, it seems to me, an appropriate12 symbol to be on State grounds.13 MR. CHEMERINSKY: I disagree, Your Honor.14 For the State to put that symbol between its State15 Capitol and the State Supreme Court is to convey a16 profound religious message. If you're just saying,17 now, this isn't there for its secular reason. If18 someone were to read this monument, one sees that it19 emphasizes its religious content.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: It is a profound21 religious message, but it's a profound religious22 message believed in by the vast majority of the23 American people, just as belief in monotheism is24 shared by a vast majority of the American people.25 And our traditions show that there is161111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 nothing wrong with the government reflecting that. I2 mean, we're a tolerant society religiously, but just3 as the majority has to be tolerant of minority views4 in matters of religion, it seems to me the minority5 has to be tolerant of the majority's ability to6 express its belief that government comes from God,7 which is what this is about.8 As Justice Kennedy said, turn your eyes9 away if it's such a big deal to you.10 MR. CHEMERINSKY: I disagree, Your Honor.11 Because this Court has said that above all, the12 government can't make some feel like they're insiders13 and some like outsiders. Even if they're the14 majority religion --15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose a16 non-Christian, say a Muslim, comes before a judge who17 has very strong Christian beliefs, a very religious18 person. Does he feel like an outsider? And to19 require that we pretend that there is no religious20 motivation, no deep religious conviction on the part21 of many of our public officials seems to me to be a22 hostility toward religion.23 MR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor. Imagine24 that judge put the Ten Commandments right above his25 or her bench. That would make some individuals feel171111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 like outsiders. Of course, many judges have2 religious beliefs, but they can't have the religious3 beliefs above them.4 And Your Honor, that's not hostility to5 religion. As this Court said in County of Allegheny,6 excluding religious symbols like the nativity scene,7 when displayed by itself, is not hostility to8 religion.9 Last year in Locke v. Davie, this Court10 said that to deny funding through the State of11 Washington for scholarships was not hostility to12 religion. Enforcing the Establishment Clause is not13 about hostility to religion. It is about making sure14 that every person who walks into that15 feel that it's his or her government.16 JUSTICE BREYER: That's an17 to me, but I don't see any way to get18 difficult cases without making a practical judgment19 about whether that's really so.2021 Goldberg's22 know there23 we've found a satisfactory test. And the point that24 they make is the government should be noninvolved25 with the religious, and it can't favor one over theAnd the reason I say that, I start withopinion with Harlan in Schempp.  And Iare a lot of others, but I don't know if181111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005courtroom canimportant pointthere in these￼1 other.2 But at the same time, we are a religious3 nation, where most people do believe in God and most4 of our institutions flow from the religious nature of5 our people. The City on the Hill, proclaim liberty6 throughout the land. All of those are religious.7 So how can the government, without what8 they call the pervasive and brooding commitment to9 secularism, which they think would be wrong, become10 necessarily involved because of our traditions, but11 not go too far?12 Now, I come to the conclusion very13 tentatively, there is no way to do it other than look14 at the divisive quality of the individual display15 case by case. And when I do that, I don't find much16 divisiveness here.17 Now, I'm exposing the whole thing not18 because I'm accepting it, but I would love to hear19 what you think.20 MR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor, I think21 that the test that this Court has formulated do draw22 those lines. With regard to your point about23 divisiveness, the Ten Commandments is enormously24 divisive right now. I don't think we can ignore the25 social reality.191111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 The chief justice of the Alabama Supreme2 Court resigned, there are crowds outside today. I3 got hate messages this week, not because people care4 about the Ten Commandments as a secular document, but5 people care about the Ten Commandments because it's a6 profound religious message.7 And many want that religious message on8 government property. And I'm saying the government9 can put the Ten Commandments there as part of an10 overall display of law givers, because, Justice11 O'Connor,12 religion.1314 itself it15 divisive.16 does violate the Establishment Clause.17 JUSTICE SCALIA: What about the opening of18 this Court's session today, in a manner that has been19 used since John Marshall, is that divisive because20 there are a lot of people who don't believe in God.21 MR. CHEMERINSKY: But You Honor, I22 think that you have to distinguish between minimal23 religious content and maximum religious content.24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Chemerinsky, on25 that point, how much of the Ten Commandments -- I201111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005it's an overall display about diversity of But when the Ten Commandments sits byis, to use your word right now, enormouslyAnd that's why, from that criteria, it￼1 mean, once we get to thou shalt not kill or murder,2 then there are tenets to govern a society, but how3 much are strictly about the obligation that man owes4 to God?5 MR. CHEMERINSKY: The first of the two6 tablets, the first five commandments, Your Honor, and7 of course religions belief this was written in God's8 own hand and given to Moses. It's believed that the9 first five commandments that you were referring to10 are God's prescriptions for religious behavior.11 The latter five, the others that you're12 referring to, were God's commands for secular13 behavior. All of these are God's commands to God's14 people. And that's what makes it different than the15 minimal religious content of God save this Honorable16 Court that Justice Scalia was referring to.17 The core of Texas's argument seems to be18 that it's there for secular purposes. But of course,19 if one looks at this monument, one sees that it's20 emphasizing the religious content and there is21 nothing that would lend the reasonable observer to22 see the secular content.2324 thy God. 25It says in large letters, I am the Lord,JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, suppose, Mr.211111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Chemerinsky, it was like Moses on that frieze where2 there are commandments showing, but there are only3 the sixth through tenth commandment. Would that be4 all right?5 MR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, if it was6 like Moses on that frieze together with fourteen other7 symbols, absolutely okay, because it would clear to8 the reasonable observer --9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if we just had the10 Moses with the tablet that has the instructions for11 how people will conduct themselves in a civilized12 society versus worshiping the Lord.13 MR. CHEMERINSKY: I think that would still14 be unconstitutional between the Texas State Capitol15 and the Texas Supreme Court because it would still be16 the State of Texas expressing the message that there17 is a God and that God has dictated these rules for18 behavior.19 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, what if you go one20 step further and there was simply a tablet without21 any embellishment about source saying, you know, thou22 shalt not kill, thou shalt not covet, et cetera,23 basically just the last five commandments, pure and24 simple. Would you have any objection on25 Establishment Clause grounds?221111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. CHEMERINSKY: If the tablets were by themselves in that way, between the Texas Supreme Court and the Texas State Capitol, it would be a harder case, but I believe it would still be unconstitutional because those tablets do convey a message that God --JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I'm just talking about when I -- I don't know if I used the word tablet. I'm just talking about a piece of stone or a poster that says thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not covet, thou shalt not bear false witness, et cetera.           Would there be any Establishment Clauseobjection simply because though it does not say so, thosewere quotations from the last six commandments  - last five commandments.MR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor. If all it said was thou shalt not kill and thou shalt not steal, I don't think that that would be a problem because, of course, those are a reflection of law.JUSTICE SCALIA: Who are you kidding? I mean, everybody knows that comes from the Ten Commandments. And what that message says is that these commands that are engraved on the human heart come from God. Why put it that way? You know, instead of that, just quote the State statute against murder. That's not what they're doing.231111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 They're saying these basic principles of2 human behavior that we're governed by come from God.3 And that message would be conveyed so long as you use4 the terminology of the Ten Commandments. That's what5 the Ten Commandments stand for.6 MR. CHEMERINSKY: But Your Honor, this7 Court has emphasized that content and context matter8 enormously. And what I'm trying to do is to9 distinguish the situation where in Texas, it was10 clearly tablets with the words, I am the Lord, thy11 God, with five commandments for religious behavior12 and five for secular behavior.13 From Justice Souter's question, there are14 five others and especially those that are reflected15 in State law, like thou shalt not kill and thou shalt16 not steal. I think that the message is different17 there. It is the words, I am the Lord, thy God.18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think you're telling19 us that the State cannot accommodate religion. The only20 way they can do it is to put the Ten Commandments up21 and insist that it's always secular, whether it's22 predominantly for a secular purpose. It seems to me23 that's hypocritical and it's asking religious people24 to surrender their beliefs and that is not25 accommodation.241111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor. I do2 think that it degrades religion to have to have the3 Ten Commandments defended for their secular purpose.4 I do think, though, that what's required of the5 government, when it puts religious symbols on6 government property, is to not be endorsing religion.7 That's why a nativity scene by itself in the County8 of Allegheny case was unconstitutional.9 On the other hand, that's why the nativity10 scene as part of a unified display in Lynch v.11 Donnelly was permissible. That's why, if the Ten12 Commandments are part of an overall display like this13 frieze, it's permissible. If it's part of an overall14 display about religious tolerance, and that's what15 the reasonable observer would see, it is permissible.16 But where it is the Ten Commandments17 themselves, placed as they are here, then it really18 is about the government endorsing religion, then it19 is the purpose of advancing religion and then it does20 violate the Establishment Clause.2122 should not 2324 much be in25 a Free Exercise Clause claim, then there has to beJUSTICE KENNEDY:  So the word accommodatebe within our jurisprudence?MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Accommodate should verythe jurisprudence.  And any time there is251111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 careful attention to accommodating religion. But2 there is no Free Exercise Clause claim in this case,3 Your Honor, so this isn't a case about accommodating4 anybody's religious beliefs. This is about the State5 expressing support for religion with sacred and6 solemn religious texts on government property. And7 my position is --8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can the State express its9 support for religion generally?10 MR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, it would11 all depend12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose it didn't have13 the Ten Commandments, it just had a big thing that14 says religion is good. It said religion is the15 foundation of our institutions. Suppose there were16 something like that. Would that be bad?17 MR. CHEMERINSKY: I don't think that would18 be a problem under the Establishment Clause because19 it's minimal --20 JUSTICE SCALIA: But there are atheists21 who disagree with that intensely.22 MR. CHEMERINSKY: But Your Honor, I'm not23 arguing for a heckler's veto by atheists. What I am24 saying is that when the government puts sacred and25 solemn texts taken directly from the Bible at the261111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425core of its State government, it has to then dosomething to convey the message that it's not therefor religious purposes, that it's there for secularpurposes.           JUSTICE SCALIA:  Doesn't it matter whetherthat text has acquired an independent meaning of itsown?  As I say, I don't think most people know whatthe text of the Ten Commandments are, but they doknow that it stands for the fact that our laws arederived from God.  That's what it stands for.  Whyisn't that symbolism sufficient to enable the Stateof Texas to use it?           MR. CHEMERINSKY:  The Ten Commandmentsmonument by itself conveys the message that the TenCommandments are the source of law and it's thatmessage the State can't convey.  May I save the restof the time for rebuttal?time.JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes, you may save yourMR. CHEMERINSKY:  Thank you.           JUSTICE STEVENS:  General Abbott, we'llhear for you, please.         ORAL ARGUMENT BY GENERAL GREG ABBOTT               ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS           GEN. ABBOTT:  Justice Stevens, and may it271111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 please the Court:2 Every court that has reviewed the specific3 facts of this case has agreed that the Texas monument4 is constitutional under this Court's well settled5 precedents in Lynch and Allegheny. This Court should6 agree that the Texas monument should not be torn down7 from its historical place for three reasons.8 First, the Ten Commandments is an9 historically recognized symbol of law. Second, this10 monument is one of the smallest of the 17 monuments11 on the Capitol grounds, and like most of the other12 monuments, was a gift to the State of Texas and is13 clearly recognized as such on the monument itself.14 And third, this monument has stood for15 more than 40 years without controversy on a national16 historic landmark. In fact, even the --17 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this18 question? Under your analysis of the reason this is19 justifiable, would it equally be permissible to have20 a crucifix of the same size in the same location on21 the Capitol grounds?22 GEN. ABBOTT: Justice Stevens, I think23 that would pose a much greater problem.24 JUSTICE STEVENS: That's not25 Do you think it would be permissible --28 1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1-Washington, DC 20005my question.it seems to￼1 me your reasoning that you've given us would support2 that result. And maybe that's the correct result.3 I'm wondering what your view is.4 GEN. ABBOTT: I seriously question whether5 or not a crucifix would be constitutionally6 acceptable in that same location, and for the very7 same reasons which I'm articulating why the Ten8 Commandments would be acceptable in this location.9 The crucifix is not like the Ten10 Commandments in that it's not an historically11 recognized symbol of law. It doesn't send a secular12 message to all the people, regardless of whether or not they13 are believers or not believers of the important role14 the Ten Commandments have played in the development15 of law.16 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not a secular17 message. I mean, if you're watering it down to say18 that the only reason it's okay is it sends nothing19 but a secular message, I can't agree with you. I20 think the message it sends is that law is -- and our21 institutions come from God.22 And if you don't think it conveys that23 message, I just think you're kidding yourself.24 GEN. ABBOTT: Well, Justice Scalia, the25 Ten Commandments send both a religious message and a291111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 secular message. When people --2 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But the district court,3 I think in this very case, found that commemorating4 the Ten Commandments' role in the development of5 secular law was not one of the State's purposes in6 accepting the monument.78 case comes9 don't haveNow, will you accept that finding as theto us?  That hasn't been challenged.  Weany cross appeal.  I assume we accept thatthe district court.10 finding of 1112 correct to13 the district court's finding, the secular purpose14 that was accepted by the district court was to honor15 the Fraternal Order of Eagles. But also there was an16 ongoing --GEN. ABBOTT:  The Court obviously isaccept that finding.  As you know, from17 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But you're arguing for18 something contrary to the district court's finding.19 GEN. ABBOTT: I'm actually, Justice20 O'Connor, arguing for purposes that are in addition21 to that district court's finding because there was an22 ongoing purpose to retain this now historical23 monument that has stood for more than 40 years24 without controversy on a national and historic25 landmark.301111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So in another case, if a2 government official feels that the Ten Commandments3 have been very, very important in his or her life as4 a spiritual or religious matter and wants other5 people to know how important the Ten Commandments6 are, he cannot accept on behalf of the city the Ten7 Commandments. And so you can have no Ten8 Commandments in city A, but the Ten Commandments in9 city B. General, that doesn't make a lot of sense to10 me.11 And again, you're just doing with purpose12 what you did in response to Justice Scalia's13 question. You're asking us to ignore the religious14 purpose that is the most manifest value of these15 symbols.16 GEN. ABBOTT: Well, with regard to both17 purpose and effect in this particular setting, I18 don't think that religion was the driving force. I19 know that all of the evidence shows that religion was20 not a driving force in any respect.21 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I suppose that every22 monument that's on the State Capitol grounds in Texas23 in a sense conveys a message of State endorsement,24 State endorsement of the role of servicemen in25 fighting earlier wars or in support of the Boy Scouts311111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 or whatever it might be, doesn't it?2 I mean, by placing them there with the3 legislative approval, is that not really some kind of4 a message of endorsement for each one?5 GEN. ABBOTT: If I may clarify an6 important fact and that is clearly the State of7 Texas, by displaying 17 monuments in a museum-like8 setting on the Capitol grounds, is trying to acknowledge9 and commemorate certain events.10 It's important for the Court to remember,11 though, that the State of Texas has specifically12 endorsed nine of those monuments by putting the State13 seal or the Lone Star seal for the State of Texas on14 those nine monuments. This monument does not have15 that kind of endorsement on there.16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't it all the case, as17 has been pointed out, that no monument is going to be18 on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol without the19 approval of the legislature? You don't dispute that,20 do you?21 GEN. ABBOTT: Not at all. That is very22 true.23 JUSTICE SOUTER: And you don't dispute24 that anyone going on those grounds would assume that25 the State government approved it or it wouldn't be321111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 there?2 GEN. ABBOTT: Justice Souter, of course3 the presumption would be that people on the Capitol4 grounds would assume the State of Texas wanted those5 monuments on the Capitol grounds.6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not sure that7 that endorsement -- in England, there is a square8 where they have King Charles on one hand -- on one9 end and he's looking at Oliver Cromwell, who beheaded10 him, on the other. I don't know if you have to11 endorse one or the other.12 GEN. ABBOTT: Well, Justice Kennedy, I13 believe that there is a very meaningful difference14 between this Court's standards of an endorsement and15 what a State or the nation may do with regard to16 commemoration.17 As an easy example, on the National Mall,18 there is, of course, the Lincoln Memorial and in the19 Lincoln Memorial, there is text from the King James20 version of the Bible. The nation commemorates and21 acknowledges Lincoln and what he has said. But by22 that display, the United States is not trying to23 endorse the King James version of the Bible or a24 particular religious message in that. Instead what25 the state331111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE SOUTER: But you have to contend2 with the fact that the district court found that this3 sort of commemoration of the Commandments involved4 was not the objective in placing the monument there,5 so you're left basically with a religious text.6 And if anybody has any doubt about that,7 the religious text is surrounded by some religious8 symbols, the Chi Rho, the Star of David. So it seems9 to me that it's hard to find, if we accept the10 district court findings, that there's anything here11 but an expression of approval by the State of Texas12 for a religious expression, and only for the13 religious expression.14 GEN. ABBOTT: Sir, all other factors, though,15 Justice Souter, as a person who stands in front of16 that monument clearly recognizes, centered in a17 specialized scroll is an indication that this was a18 monument that was dedicated and presented to the19 people and the youth of the State of Texas by the20 Fraternal Order of Eagles. There is no stamp of21 approval on this by the State of Texas on that22 monument.23 JUSTICE SOUTER: But you're not trying to24 withdraw the -- I took it to be the concession that25 of course anyone would reasonably assume that the341111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 State of Texas approved this message, and thought it2 was appropriate to devote state property to its3 promulgation.4 GEN. ABBOTT: Clearly the State of Texas5 approved of the monument being on the grounds --6 JUSTICE SOUTER: But then the fact that7 the Eagles also approve it doesn't really get us very8 far, does it?9 GEN. ABBOTT: Well, where I believe it10 gets you, as this Court has recognized, there is a11 very meaningful difference between acknowledging12 something and endorsing something. For example, the13 creche in Lynch or the menorah in Allegheny.14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Let me ask you this. If15 the Eagles' presentation statement weren't on there,16 would that17 analysis?1819 disclaimer20 on there, I think the monument could still stand just21 as the creche did in Lynch or the menorah in22 Allegheny. The city of Pawtucket was not endorsing23 the creche in the display, it was acknowledged as24 part of the overall holiday celebration.25 JUSTICE SOUTER: What is the -- that's one351111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005make a difference to Establishment ClauseGEN. ABBOTT:  I think that the Eagles'on there helps our case, but if it were not￼1 of the problems with the argument, it seems to me,2 that by putting the Ten Commandments monument on3 grounds that have lots of other monuments, that the4 religious message is somehow either diluted or5 changed. Contrast the situation in Texas with what6 we've got here.7 You've got Moses up there with at least8 the last five commandments showing. But Moses is in9 the company of a group of individuals who are nothing10 but law givers. You've got Menes and Hammurabi and11 John Marshall and the rest of them. There is an12 obvious theme.13 Anybody who looks at the identity -- or14 knows the identity of these figures is saying they're15 getting at law givers. But if you look at the16 grounds of the Texas State Capitol, you see wars,17 pioneer women, children and so on. There is no one18 common theme. The only theme seems to be these are19 objects or symbols that are worthy of some kind of20 respect.21 And one of them is religious. Being mixed22 into a group that has no common theme does not23 eliminate the religious -- the obvious religious24 message from this monument. Isn't that correct?25 GEN. ABBOTT: Well, just as this Court may361111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 display in the courtroom itself, Moses with the Ten2 Commandments amongst law givers, doesn't mean that3 that is the only way the Ten Commandments --4 JUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe it doesn't, but I'm5 trying to find a rationale for the argument that's6 being made, and that I thought you were alluding to.7 The argument is that by mixing this in8 with a grab bag of other symbols, you have somehow9 diluted or changed the focus from a religious message10 to something else. And I can understand that in the11 Moses case in the frieze because there is a clear12 common theme.13 On the Texas grounds, at least insofar as14 I can tell, there is no common theme. There are a15 series of objects that say, these are worthy of16 veneration. One of them is religious. There is17 nothing that removes the religious message from its18 prominence in the display the way the religious19 message is removed from prominence in the Moses20 display, isn't that correct?21 GEN. ABBOTT: Your Honor, if I may explain22 with two points. One, there is a common theme on the23 Texas Capitol grounds, just as there are on most24 Capitol grounds and on the National Mall. And the25 common theme is to recognize historical influences in371111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 our country and in our State.2 JUSTICE SOUTER: But what do you do with3 the district court finding?4 GEN. ABBOTT: Well, the district court5 finding obviously chose to decide that the secular6 purpose for the display was to honor the Fraternal7 Order of Eagles for their commitment to combating8 juvenile delinquency.9 But that is different -- the purpose why10 the district court found why the display was11 constitutional is different than the message12 being sent to the reasonable observer.13 JUSTICE SOUTER: You had a second14 and I don't want to miss your second point.15 GEN. ABBOTT: The second point is16 there are other displays in this Court. As a person17 walks into this courtroom or exits the courtroom,18 they don't see the Ten Commandments in a display with19 a bunch of law givers. Instead, they see the Ten20 Commandments alone with an eagle above it.21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: They see blank tablets.22 They don't see any writing. This is the only one23 that has script on it. It has numbers and in fact24 that's confusing because one of them, the people25 think is the Ten Commandments is the Bill of Rights.381111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005that ispointthat￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425(Laughter.)           GEN. ABBOTT:  Justice Ginsburg, clearlythe Ten Commandments that are reflected on thedoorway into and out of this courtroom don't havewords on them like the tablets do in the State ofTexas.           JUSTICE SCALIA:  But we know what theyare, don't we?GEN. ABBOTT: We do and that's the point. Even more importantly, the reasonable observer knows what --           JUSTICE STEVENS:  But do we know whichversion of the Ten Commandments it stands for?  Thereare three different versions at least.           GEN. ABBOTT:  I happen to agree with thePetitioner.  There is more than three versions of theTen Commandments.  And the purpose, if you go back towhat the Eagles were trying to achieve here, was tocome up with a version of the Ten Commandments thatwasn't reflective of any particular religion.what thethe factGod.  Iftext is.  JUSTICE SCALIA:  And it doesn't matterversion is, does it?  If it just stands forthat laws -- the foundation of our laws isthat's all it stands for, who cares what the391111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425           JUSTICE STEVENS:  General Abbott, wouldthe Texas purpose be equally served if the monumenthad on it the kind of disclaimer that the city inWisconsin put on its monument?           GEN. ABBOTT:  Justice Stevens, Iapologize, I'm not familiar with that disclaimer.           JUSTICE STEVENS:  It reads this way.  Whatthey did is they sold the parcel of land that had theEagles' donation on it back to the Eagles and thenthey put a fence around it and then they put thissign up, "This property is not owned or maintained bythe City of Lacrosse, nor does the City endorse thereligious expression thereon."  Maybe as long as it'sstill on the property, it couldn't be the same.           But suppose you had a comparabledisclaimer.  Would that defeat any of the purposes onwhich you relied to justify having the statue there?GEN. ABBOTT: A disclaimer like that would surely ensure that this display is constitutional. However, it's our contention --           JUSTICE STEVENS:  And would it underminethe message that you legitimately seek to convey?           GEN. ABBOTT:  I don't believe it would.           JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, why don't you do it andwe wouldn't have this case?  I really would consider401111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 it something of a Pyrrhic victory if you win on the2 ground that you're arguing. So that in all future3 cases, we're going to have to examine displays of the4 Ten Commandments to see whether there was ever any5 intent to say that our laws are ultimately dependent6 upon God. Is that what you want us to do case by7 case?8 GEN. ABBOTT: Well, this Court obviously9 has decided Establishment Clause cases on a10 case-by-case basis, but in this particular instance,11 the Ten Commandments displayed in a museum-like12 setting on the Capitol grounds arrayed among 17 other13 monuments, the message that is received by the viewer14 who is trekking through the Capitol grounds looking15 at monuments is clearly one not of the State of16 Texas.17 JUSTICE BREYER: I've got to get one18 question before you leave because you're the one who19 knows the record. And what I've had a hard time20 finding in the record is what I think there must be21 some material that the State or somebody in a tourist22 office or a guide or somebody tells people what the23 17 different monuments are.24 And all I've found is the general brochure25 which doesn't tell them what they are. And I found411111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 something on the Internet. Well, which is in the2 record. But aside from this page from the Internet3 in the record and that, is there anything else in4 this record that if somebody wanders around, they're5 on the State grounds, they say, what is this, what6 are these things anyway? There must be something that7 tells them. And where is it?8 GEN. ABBOTT: The state provides a walking9 tour guide.10 JUSTICE BREYER: And the brochure doesn't11 tell what they are. This thing, it says grounds?12 GEN. ABBOTT: Your Honor, Justice Breyer,13 if I could refer you to page 205 of the Joint14 Appendix, it provides a description of each of the15 monuments on the walking tour. And if I could also16 refer the Court to page 117 of the Joint Appendix, it17 shows the actual walking tour where a person would go18 along the process of seeing the monuments.19 But clearly as they walk through the20 Capitol grounds, what any observer, not just the21 reasonable observer, what any observer would notice22 is that before they could even get to this particular23 monument, they will have passed in full view of24 countless other monuments and historical markers25 clearly indicating to them that they are not there421111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 for the purpose of seeing just the Ten Commandments2 but they are in a museum-like setting cast among many3 different kinds of monuments.4 And so they appreciate the setting before5 they even arrive at the Ten Commandments monument.6 Also when they arrive at the Ten7 Commandments monument, they will notice it is one of8 the smallest of the monuments on the Texas Capitol9 grounds. It does have the disclaimer on it10 indicating that it was donated by the Fraternal Order11 of Eagles. It does not have the State seal on it12 like many of the other monuments, so it's not --13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it like how many14 other monuments? This is not peculiar to Texas. The15 Order of the Eagles have given how many monuments16 just like this one, identical to this one?17 GEN. ABBOTT: Justice Ginsburg,18 actually not clear from the record. There19 some accounts of hundreds, maybe even into20 thousands that the Fraternal Order of Eagles have21 given out. And I cannot tell you for a fact that22 they are all identical.23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: When you said that24 every court that has considered this case has said25 it's compatible with the Establishment Clause, did431111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005it ishave beenthe￼1 you mean just this Texas case or other cases2 involving an Eagles Ten Commandments?3 GEN. ABBOTT: Justice Ginsburg, my4 reference was to the fact that every case that has5 considered the specific -- every court that has6 considered the specific facts of this case, meaning7 the Texas case --8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you didn't mean this9 particular depiction of the Ten Commandments?10 GEN. ABBOTT: No, Your Honor. What I11 meant is that both the district court and the Fifth12 Circuit Court of Appeals specifically reviewed the13 facts of this case and were all in complete agreement14 that the facts of this case render this monument15 constitutional under this Court's well settled16 precedents in Lynch and Allegheny.17 One other thing I would like to draw the18 Court's attention to that will give you a very well19 understanding of what the monument looks like and its20 setting is the videotape that is Exhibit 44, it's21 obviously not part of the Joint Appendix, but it22 demonstrates how this particular monument is set in a23 museum-like setting amongst many other monuments and24 gives you the perspective of what the typical viewer25 would appreciate as they walk around the Capitol441111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 grounds.2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Kind of an eclectic3 museum. One message that you get is that the State4 is honoring the donor of the various --5 JUSTICE STEVENS: General Abbott, I want6 to thank you for your argument and also for7 demonstrating that it's not necessary to stand at the8 lectern in9 10 11 12order to a fine job.  Thank you.GEN. ABBOTT:  Thank you, Your Honor.JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Clement.ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENTON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES13 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS14 MR. CLEMENT: Justice Stevens, and may it15 please the Court:16 The Ten Commandments have undeniable17 religious significance, but they also have secular18 significance as a code of law and as a19 well-recognized historical symbol of the law. When a20 State decides to display a Ten Commandments display21 along with more than a dozen other monuments on its22 Capitol grounds in order to honor the donor, it is23 not endorsing the religious text of the Ten24 Commandments.25 And in the same way, when a state has that451111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 monument as part of such a collection, the2Establishment Clause should not be interpreted to3 force them to send a message of hostility to religion4 5 6 78 understand it, it's the Protestant version basically9 of the Ten Commandments we have before us, which has10 significant differences from the Catholic version and11 the Jewish version.12by singling out that one monument for removal solelybecause of its religious content.JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Clement, can I ask you to address one thing that troubles me about the case? As IAnd I understand it was the result of 13 consultation and so forth. But I noticed in your14151617 Catholic state, and the only one from Massachusettsbrief, you list the States in which the TenCommandments displays are listed, there is none forRhode Island, which I often think of as primarily a18 1920 commandments in it.21 Is there any significance to the fact that2224 25is a frieze on the north wall of the public librarywhich apparently didn't have the text of thethis kind of display may be more popular in areas of 23 the country where the Protestant religion is dominantas opposed to other versions of Christian religions? MR. CLEMENT: Justice Stevens, I don't461111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 think so. I mean, we didn't purport to do an2 exhaustive survey, but I think there is a3 well-represented group of displays throughout the4 country including, I think, in States that probably5 have relatively high Catholic populations.6 But I think we would steer this Court away7 from attributing too much significance to the fact8 that if a State is going to display the Ten9 Commandments at all, it will necessarily have to10 display a version that reflects one or another sect's11 preferences.12 I mean, in the Marsh case, for example, this Court13 upheld legislative prayer. It understood that they14 would necessarily have to choose a chaplain and that15 chaplain would necessarily be of one denomination or16 another. And this Court didn't doom the whole17 practice of legislative prayer because of the18 necessity of picking a chaplain of one denomination19 or another.20 In fact, in the Marsh case itself, this21 court upheld Nebraska's practice, even though they22 had chosen the same Presbyterian minister for 1623 straight years. And so I don't think this Court in24 other Establishment Clause contexts has steered away25 from putting the States and municipalities in a471111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 catch-22.2 And given that this Court has suggested3 even in Stone against Graham that the Ten4 Commandments can be displayed, can be used in certain5 settings, it can't be that once the State in practice6 picks a particular version, it's all of a sudden7 guilty of a sectarian preference.8 JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, the other9 thing that was notable about your listing is most of10 the examples are examples of displays of the event11 itself rather than the text. And there is an12 argument made I think by Professor Laycock that when13 you display the entire text, it's kind of a different14 sort of symbol than when you just have a symbolic15 presentation.16 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Stevens, I17 think there are quite a few of both types of displays and18 I think the very fact that the Fraternal Order of Eagles19 put a lot of these displays out suggests that a bunch of20 them are textual displays.21 I'm not sure, though, that a display that22 actually has Moses receiving the Ten Commandments23 from God is any less religious. I would suggest24 that's actually more religious than one that just25 displays the monument standing alone.481111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 If the monuments are standing alone, you2 can I think appreciate the fact that maybe they're3 being displayed for their secular significance as4 well as their religious significance. When Moses is5 there, it's hard to avoid the implication that they6 are the revealed law of God, as opposed to also a7 secular code.8 So in that sense, I'm not sure that the9 variations in the display --10 JUSTICE STEVENS: You think just a symbolic11 display is less objectionable than quoting the text as12 this monument does?13 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Stevens, I14 would say -- my point is not that there are not other15 ways to display it. I mean, certainly I think, as we16 out in our brief, blank tablets or tablets with Roman17 numerals are less objectionable -- certainly, I don't18 they're beyond objection -- than a textual display.19 My point was that I'm not quite sure how20 one would balance sort of four Commandments and Moses21 versus all Ten Commandments in text. I think it's a22 close call.23 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, except the four24 Commandments and Moses would avoid the differences25 between the three different versions of the Ten49pointthink1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Commandments, whereas when you quote one, you must2 select one over the other two.3 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I guess I'm not sure4 that's true. I mean, some of the displays that are5 out there in courthouses have Moses receiving the6 Commandments and have text. And I guess, my point,7 though, would be, again --8 JUSTICE STEVENS: Most of them don't.9 MR. CLEMENT: To be sure, to be sure. But10 I would hope the constitutional line wouldn't be that11 you can't have text. I mean, the Ten Commandments12 have a role in our society and had an influence on13 the development of the law as text.14 I mean, you know, they weren't influential15 Roman numbers. They were influential as text.16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Clement, there17 is a question I have about the government's position.18 And does place matter at all? I mean, here we're19 talking about the grounds surrounding a State20 Capitol. What about every school room, if that's the21 choice of the school board? Is it the same or do you22 make -- or every courtroom up to the court to decide23 for itself?24 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I25 certainly think location and context matters. I50with ten1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 think in almost every Establishment Clause context,2 the setting and context matters a great deal. The3 school case, for example, as you suggest, I mean,4 unless this Court is going to revisit Stone against5 Graham, it's certainly true that the school context6 at least raises much more difficult questions.7 In terms of where it can be displayed in8 a courthouse, I think there are certainly9 permissible displays in the courthouse, but it may be10 something all together different to have a display in11 a way that it actually looks like a religious12 sanctuary within the walls of the courthouse.13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It looks just like this14 monument. Let's take this monument and put it in the15 rotunda of the court because the judges of that court16 choose to have it there. Is that all right?17 MR. CLEMENT: Justice Ginsburg, I think18 putting it in the rotunda of the court as a19 stand-alone monument, giving it sort of pride of20 place, if you will, raises a much more difficult21 question, to be sure, and may well cross the22 constitutional line.23 As I was alluding to, the one case I'm24 familiar with, which is the case of the Alabama25 Supreme Court, there it was displayed in a way that511111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 the district court literally found it was like a2 religious sanctuary within the walls of the courthouse.3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And do you think that it4 should cross the constitutional line under the5 interpretational theory of the First Amendment you6 wish us to adopt?7 MR. CLEMENT: I think the display that I8 have in mind in the Alabama Supreme Court probably9 does cross the constitutional line even under our10 view. I think that a display of the Ten Commandments11 in some appropriate way in the courthouse certainly12 wouldn't cross the line that this Court -- that we13 would have this Court draw.14 I mean, we think, for example, it cannot15 be that the very fact that moving it closer to the16 courthouse itself is a constitutional problem because17 as you yourself have pointed out, Justice Kennedy,18 the legislative prayers that were approved in Marsh19 v. Chambers were at the absolute epicenter of the20 government. And still those were a permissible21 acknowledgment of religion.22 So I think while context matters, I don't23 think solely the fact that it's moved closer to the24 seat of government does have a dispositive impact.25 And again, I would say in response to521111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Justice Stevens' question, I do think it is important2 to remember that there is going to have to be a3 choice among the various documents if they are going4 to be displayed at all. And I don't think that the5 Constitution puts the municipalities and the States6 in the bind of being able to display the Ten7 Commandments in theory, but in fact, not being able8 to pick any one version --9 JUSTICE STEVENS: What would your comment10 be on requiring a disclaimer of some kind?11 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Stevens, two12 points to make about that. One is certainly a13 disclaimer would make this an easier case. And I14 would point out that there is a disclaimer of sorts15 on the monument already because it clearly states16 that it was a gift from the Fraternal Order of17 Eagles.18 JUSTICE STEVENS: It is kind of ambiguous.19 MR. CLEMENT: It is, Justice Stevens, and20 I'm troubled frankly by the suggestion that they21 would have to go as far as you suggested they would22 go under the City of Lacrosse case. The idea that in23 order to have the Ten Commandments monument on the24 Capitol grounds, the State of Texas has to cordon25 that monument off, unlike any other of the 17531111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 monuments, 23 fence away4 that the State has nothing to do with the Ten5 Commandments is bending over too far in the other6 direction. The State can have, as this Court has7 acknowledged many times, permissible acknowledgments8 of religion. And I don't think in this case that the9 State of Texas has gone too far.10 One other point I think that is important11 to put on the table, and it is consistent with the12 analysis of both the district court and the Fifth13 Circuit, is that whatever the original purpose is for14 Texas accepting the monument and displaying it in the15 first instance, they now have an additional secular16 purpose in retaining the monument.suggests a hostility to religion.I think the idea that there has to be afrom the Ten Commandments to make clear17 And I would point this Court to Judge18 Becker's analysis in the Chester County case for the19 Third Circuit. In that case, he had a display that20 was admittedly smaller, but it was actually a much21 more overtly sectarian version of the Ten22 Commandments. It had the Ten Commandments plus the23 summary of the Ten Commandments from the New24 Testament.25541111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005And nonetheless, Judge Becker said that in￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that case, the monument had been there since 1920 andChester County had a legitimate secular purpose inmaintaining that document and maintaining the plaqueon the courthouse.           And I think he correctly understood thatin these cases of displays that have stood for 40years or longer, that the State is in something of adilemma.  Thank you, Your Honor.           JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Chemerinsky, youhave four minutes left.        REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN CHEMERINSKY               ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER           MR. CHEMERINSKY:  Thank you.  This casecomes down to two questions.  First, is the TenCommandments a highly religious message.  And second,can the government place a single religious messageon government property at the seat of its government.           As to the first question, Stone v. Grahamresolves this because this Court said that the TenCommandments is an inherently religious message nomatter what disclaimer accompanies it.           The Ten Commandments is not on the TexasState Capitol grounds simply to recognize the role ofreligion in government.  It is not simply anacknowledgment.  It is sacred text taken directly551111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 from the Bible. It's not there about the history of2 religion in Texas. There is nothing that would tell the3 reasonable observer that it is there for historical4 purposes. It isn't there for history.5 What about all the other religions that6 have played a role in Texas history? The Muhammad7 religion, even Madeleine Murray O'Hare. Is Texas8 saying they would accept statues for all of these9 individuals there as part of the history of Texas?10 The second question is, can the government11 place a single religious message by itself on12 government property, especially at the seat of13 government. The County of Allegheny case resolves14 that. This is much like the nativity scene at the15 seat of the county government.16 What's important and hasn't gotten enough17 emphasis this morning, this is the sole religious18 message anywhere on the Texas State Capitol grounds.19 This isn't a museum. Every item that's there is20 there because the Texas legislature chose to put it21 there. Most of them honor veterans of particular22 wars. Texas put this there precisely to express the23 religious message.24 Your Honors, what's left of the25 Establishment Clause if any item can be displayed561111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 with the most profound religious contents? Do we2 then say the observer can just avert his or her eyes?3 The observer could have averted his or her eyes in4 the County of Allegheny case. But this Court was5 clear in saying that a single religious message, a6 single religious symbol on government property is7 inherently an establishment of religion.8 For this reason, the Texas monument9 violates the Establishment Clause. Thank you.10 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you,11 Mr. Chemerinsky.
