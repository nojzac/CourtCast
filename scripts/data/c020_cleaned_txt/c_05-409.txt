Putnam Funds Trust.          Mr. Frederick.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID FREDERICK               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MR. FREDERICK:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:          This case concerns the appealability ofremand orders under the Securities Litigation UniformStandards Act, or SLUSA.          Our position is that the general ruleprohibiting appealability applies in this case forthree reasons.          First, section 1447(d) has been consistentlyconstrued to prohibit appeal of remand orders based ona district court's lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. That rule governs even if the district courtincorrectly construes a subject-matter jurisdictionprovision.          Second, SLUSA section 77p(c) concededlydefines removal jurisdiction and it does so byincorporating the criteria for preemption.  Thus, thecourt's subject-matter jurisdiction is coextensive with31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 those cases that SLUSA preempts.2 And third, Congress knows how to make remand3 orders appealable when it wants to, but SLUSA contains4 no provision for appellate review of remand orders.5 Under Respondent's approach, the Federal courts would6 obtain jurisdiction in cases not subject to SLUSA7 preemption, but there's no indication that Congress8 intended that result.9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Under your approach, Mr.10 Frederick, the Federal court would decide the principal11 substantive issue in the case, the principal legal12 issue, nonfactual perhaps, and then decide that is has13 no jurisdiction if it finds that it doesn't come within14 -- within (c), sends it back to the State court. Is --15 is the State court bound by -- by that finding by the16 Federal court?17 MR. FREDERICK: No, it's not.18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why not?19 MR. FREDERICK: Because under this Court's20 longstanding precedent, for there to be preclusion,21 there must be a right of appellate review. So if you22 agree that the general rule of 1447(d) applies and23 there is no right to appeal the remand order, then the24 basis on which that order is -- is founded, the25 preemption of SLUSA is open for the State court to41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425address on remand.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And for this Court, Iassume, at least theoretically, on petition forcertiorari?          MR. FREDERICK:  That's correct, through theState court system.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What -- what was the basisthen, or was there a basis, for Judge Easterbrook'scomment, it's now or never?          MR. FREDERICK:  He was wrong.  He was wrong. The issue of preemption under SLUSA can be raised bythe defendants on remand in the State courts.  It canbe litigated.  It's important to note that the removalprovision says, shall be removable.  It's at thedefendants' discretion whether they want to ask theFederal court to test whether SLUSA preempts the caseor to keep it in State court for the State court toapply SLUSA and thereby hold that the class actionwould be unsustainable.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do we have a standard --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do we have any cases that --that are like this one which are like this one whichinvolve not just res judicata of -- of the -- of thefinding by the Federal court, but the law of the case?I mean this is the same case when it's remanded. 51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 You've already had a court that has found a particular2 element with respect to this case. It seems to me3 highly unusual to have the same issue in the same case4 then decided by a second court. Do you have any -- any5 parallel?6 MR. FREDERICK: There are cases in the lower7 courts, Your Honor, in the complete preemption area8 that have held that a removal based on the doctrine of9 complete preemption was not sustainable because the10 case was not completely preempted, but holding that11 preemption, implied conflict preemption, can be applied12 by the State courts on remand.13 And it's important to note here that there --14 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't have any case of15 ours, though.16 MR. FREDERICK: Not that I'm aware of, but17 what the City of Waco case says, upon which they base18 their reliance, is that the reason why there was appeal19 of that particular order was because it would be held20 preclusive. Here, it would not be held preclusive21 because there is no right of appellate review.22 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is -- is there --23 correct me if I'm wrong, but I -- I had thought there24 was an -- an easier answer, and that is that the -- the25 decision that ultimately the State court will make, as61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 to whether there is or is not preclusion, is not2 identical to the decision that the Federal court --3 that the district court makes on the motion for remand4 because on the -- and this is the way I was going about5 it.6 On the motion for remand, all a Federal court7 decides is whether, in fact, there is a colorable basis8 for the removal. When it goes back, if it does go9 back, to the State court, there will be an opportunity10 not to go merely to the stage of colorable basis, but11 to litigate it ultimately on the merits. So -- so that12 what we have is a -- in effect, a kind of quick-look13 finding at the Federal level, and that does not14 preclude a -- a complete development of the issue on15 the merits in the State court, if that's where it goes.16 MR. FREDERICK: That is certainly true,17 although I would take issue with the notion of there18 being a colorable claim. I don't think that the SLUSA19 removal is analogous to the Federal officer removal20 statute where the statute itself says the defense has21 to be under color of law, and this Court in the Mesa v.22 California case said that phrase is where the colorable23 claim creates article III jurisdiction.24 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but do you take25 the position --71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. FREDERICK: But I -- I don't -- sorry.2 If I could just finish. I don't contest the rest of3 it, which is that on remand, preemption can be4 developed through amended pleadings, through facts that5 are developed --6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but you must take7 issue with the this is only a quick determination,8 unless you also agree with -- disagree with Justice --9 Judge Easterbrook when he said, the decision for the10 Federal court is only two things. It's either remand11 or dismiss the action. That is, the Federal court12 under no circumstances will keep this case for trial.13 Either it will dismiss it outright or it will remand.14 MR. FREDERICK: Well, under their theory,15 though, Justice Ginsburg, the court could, because of16 their construction of the removal jurisdiction17 provision, would retain jurisdiction.18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but that was not --19 certainly not the Seventh Circuit's understanding.20 MR. FREDERICK: Well, and we think that that21 position that they have advanced in this Court is22 incorrect, and I would agree with your postulate that23 what the Federal district court does and it has24 jurisdiction to do is to decide whether preemption25 applies and then remand the case, or if preemption does81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425apply, to dismiss it.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Whether preemption appliesor whether there's a colorable basis for saying?  Ithought you were saying that the district court decideswhether preemption applies.          MR. FREDERICK:  It does -- it does do that.It's actually --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you don't -- you don'tagree with what Justice Souter was saying, that allit's -- all it's making is a colorable basis.          MR. FREDERICK:  I thought I expressed myposition there.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  In other words, you take theposition that -- and -- and you may well be right, butI mean, you take the position that there is a completedetermination on the merits at the -- at the stage atwhich the district court rules on the motion to remand.          MR. FREDERICK:  That's -- on the basis of therecord then before it.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes.          MR. FREDERICK:  Yes.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, you say on the basisof the record then before it.  I mean, they can -- theycan -- can they put in any evidence they want?MR. FREDERICK: The court always has the 91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 authority to have evidence taken to determine its own2 jurisdiction. That's routinely done by district3 courts.4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, as I5 understand it, at least the Seventh Circuit's fix on6 this case was that the Federal courts have adjudicatory7 authority to do one thing and to do that one thing8 finally, that is, to decide whether this is a case that9 cannot be brought in any court or whether it's a case10 that Congress has left over for the States still to11 deal with. That was the whole theory of the Seventh12 Circuit, that this is no quick look. The -- the13 Federal courts are making a final determination. And I14 think that would exclude what Justice Souter has15 suggested.16 MR. FREDERICK: I -- I agree with you that17 that is how the Seventh Circuit described the opinion18 and what -- what the adjudicatory authority was, and19 that is why we take issue with the Seventh Circuit. We20 do think that the State court on remand has any issue21 that the defendants want to raise before it. All that22 the Federal district court has done is to decide that23 -- that there was no basis for a SLUSA preemption24 because the requisites of subsection (b) had been25 satisfied.101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 But I want to point out that the issue before2 you is whether or not that decision, correct or not, is3 appealable. And what is important in the error of the4 Seventh Circuit was that they held that that decision5 was appealable, and under the Thermtron rule, as6 applied in Gravitt and Things Remembered, even a7 district court decision that is erroneous in its8 construction of a subject-matter jurisdiction provision9 is still a remand based on subject-matter jurisdiction10 and therefore falls within the four corners --11 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, it doesn't -- what12 Thermtron says is that we read (d) in conjunction with13 (c). Now, the reason that (c) is relevant here is14 because it says, if at any time before final judgment15 it appears that the district court lacks subject-16 matter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded.17 Presumably what (c) is thinking of are cases18 where subject-matter jurisdiction is not the whole19 issue before the -- the Federal court. It's thinking20 that subject-matter jurisdiction in certain instances,21 like a defect in a removal proceeding, is something22 that the -- that the Federal court could get to prior23 to a final judgment.24 But here, the final judgment in the Federal25 court is the very question of whether this is preempted111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 or not. And therefore, I guess what Easterbrook is2 thinking is that that isn't the kind of subject-matter3 jurisdiction dismissal to which (c) refers.4 Consequently, it is not within the scope of (d)'s no5 appellate review rule.6 MR. FREDERICK: And our problem with that,7 Justice Breyer, is that all eight district court8 decisions here thought that they were deciding subject-9 matter jurisdiction, and they thought that because10 Federal preemption ordinarily is not a basis for11 removal. And --12 JUSTICE BREYER: No. It's no doubt that all13 the lower courts then would be wrong. But the reason14 he says that they are wrong is because they looked at15 the word, subject-matter jurisdiction, in (c) without16 realizing that the reference in (c) is a reference to17 instances where subject-matter jurisdiction is not the18 whole issue; i.e., it's something other than the final19 Federal court decision.20 MR. FREDERICK: It -- it is --21 JUSTICE BREYER: That would be the argument22 he's making. I would like your response.23 MR. FREDERICK: Well, functionally it is the24 equivalent of codifying the complete preemption25 doctrine, which is how SLUSA actually works. And in121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 the complete preemption cases, Beneficial Bank is what2 spells out this --3 JUSTICE BREYER: I agree with you. You would4 also have to say that the same rule applies, one, to5 the complete preemption cases and, two, to sovereign6 immunity determinations under the Foreign Sovereign7 Immunity Act. But he would say that may be so, but8 nonetheless, Judge Easterbrook would say, well, so be9 it. That's what Congress intended. That is wrong to10 deprive someone of a right to appeal when it turns on a11 misreading of (c) and an incorporation of the12 misreading into (d).13 MR. FREDERICK: It would be a strikingly odd14 result, though, for this Court to reach that, given15 that Congress has clearly provided for appellate16 of remand orders in other contexts, including in17 Class Action Fairness Act, under tribal property18 disputes, the FDIC, the RTC, and specifically in19 1447(d) itself, civil rights cases. So Congress20 how to do this if that's what Congress had intended.21 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but isn't the -- isn't22 the argument --23 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick, can I ask24 you a question?25 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- that in those cases in131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-review theknows￼1 which Congress has provided, we -- we are not dealing2 with a situation in which the -- the removal or not,3 the preemption or not is the end of the litigation.4 Here, we've got a case in which there -- there are5 basically two kinds of preemption, as -- as you've6 recognized. There is -- there is regular preemption,7 on the basis of which there may or may not be a8 removal, and there is a preclusion of any litigation9 whatsoever.10 And in the cases in which Congress has made11 specific provision, were they -- the instances -- were12 they instances in which it was the second issue which13 precluded any litigation whatsoever? The answer may be14 yes. I just don't know.15 MR. FREDERICK: Well, I think that the16 closest analogy, again, is in the complete preemption17 area where the Court has held that, you know, the18 removal is based on complete preemption, and if that is19 found by the district court, that functionally20 terminates the litigation.21 But I would point out that even in the22 Federal officer removal statute, there's no appellate23 review of a district court's decision that the Federal24 officer statute was improperly invoked to remove an25 action. So what the securities defendants here are141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425asking for is something Congress didn't even give toFederal officers.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Let me ask you onepreliminary question just to be sure I understand thecase.  Is it your view -- when the petition for removalwas filed, did the district -- Federal district courthave jurisdiction to decide the preemption issue inyour view?          MR. FREDERICK:  It had the -- it had thepower to determine whether SLUSA applied.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  All right.          MR. FREDERICK:  And that's what section77p(c), when it says, as set forth in subsection (b),is referring to.  So the district court analyzed thosefactors and it came --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  So the -- there -- therewas jurisdiction in the Federal court to entertain theremoved case.          MR. FREDERICK:  Yes.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Then -- then why -- thenhow can you say the -- the remand was based on a lack of-- of jurisdiction?          MR. FREDERICK:  Because the courts held thatthe requisites of SLUSA of subsection (b) had not beensatisfied.151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, but they -- they hadheld it acting on an interpretation of SLUSA before ourdecision in Dabit.          MR. FREDERICK:  That's correct.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  And isn't it at leastpossible that they would -- would have decided thatissue had they reviewed --          MR. FREDERICK:  It is possible, but that'swhy the issue of the underlying district court'sdetermination is not before you.  The issue before youis can appellate jurisdiction be asserted to reviewthat decision.          But I would further point out, JusticeStevens, that the Dabit court assiduously avoided thekinds of claims that are present in our case, which iswhether or not negligence can be asserted against thesecurities defendants for failure to fair-value price. Dabit was strictly a fraud case, as this Court madeclear.  This is a negligence case, and there is a partof subsection (b) which makes very clear that whatSLUSA is getting at are claims based on fraud.          But even if you were to disagree that the --the district court had, you know, an alternate basisthat had not been properly ventilated or addressed bythe district court because it went off on the holder161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 theory that this Court rejected in Dabit, you still2 wouldn't have jurisdiction to decide that because of3 the general rule of 1447(d), which provides, as I have4 stated, that a court doesn't have jurisdiction to5 review -- 678 would you9 said? You said that our complaint isn't about fraud.appellate review of a remand order.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Frederick, will --please explain something to me that you just10 It isn't about deception. It's about negligence. But11 the Seventh Circuit reported and seemed to have no12 doubt about it that the complaints in this set of cases13 were based on allegations of deceit and manipulation,14 not mismanagement.15 MR. FREDERICK: That's incorrect, Justice16 Ginsburg. We've put the complaints before you. They17 are in the joint appendix. We have cited every18 paragraph 1920 that on a21 argument in the Seventh Circuit, which Respondent's have22 recited the Web site. You can listen to the argument23 yourself. It did not contain any type of concession by24 counsel for the class that these claims were anything25 other than the negligence claims, which on the four171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-in which those claims are asserted.The Seventh Circuit based its decision aboutmisunderstanding of the colloquy at oral￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425corners of the complaint, they assert themselves to be.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The -- the Seventh Circuitsaid precisely, in particular, they did not argue intheir briefs and did not maintain at oral argument,despite the court's invitation that their suits allegemismanagement rather than deceit or manipulation.  Sois that totally wrong, that you did do it -- mention itin your briefs?          MR. FREDERICK:  The briefs recounted what theclaims are, which are negligence claims.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then how could the SeventhCircuit have gotten it that wrong?          MR. FREDERICK:  Well, the Seventh Circuitmade five crucial errors, that it was wrong to describethe district court as saying that removal was proper.The district court didn't say that.          They were wrong to say that the remand wasbased on section 77(d)(4).  That's not what thedistrict court did.          They were wrong to evaluate section 77p(c)without even reciting or construing the language.          They were wrong to say that SLUSA'ssubstantive decisions, quote, must be made by theFederal rather than the State judiciary.  That's notcorrect.181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼12 never for3 State law45 have been6 emphasizing -- or whoever would have been emphasizing7 the -- the fraud character of -- of the claims, and8 after Dabit, perhaps the negligence boat is the only9 one left for you.And they were wrong to say that it was now orappellate review whether an action underis preempted.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But it -- it mightthat prior to Dabit, you would have been10 MR. FREDERICK: But the point, Mr. Chief11 Justice, is that this is on a basis of subject-matter12 jurisdiction. It's not waivable and we're permitted to13 say that a district court decision based on subject-14 matter jurisdiction can look at the relevant claims.15 It is true that the perception at the time was that16 these holder theories evaded SLUSA. All of the courts17 up until that time of Kircher II had held that, and18 that's not an unreasonable position for a lawyer to19 take.20 Now, certainly after Dabit, those claims are21 foreclosed where there are holder fraud claims. We do22 -- we obviously don't take issue with that.23 But here, the claims in the complaint24 themselves are based on negligence, and it is certainly25 fair --191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe this is not a2 fair -- how likely is it, given our determination in3 Dabit about how Congress intended to treat fraud4 claims, that negligence claims are going to fare any5 better?6 MR. FREDERICK: Well, this Court in the Santa7 Fe case, Mr. Chief Justice, said that negligence claims8 are not within 10b-5. Those are claims that are9 properly brought under State law.10 JUSTICE BREYER: Would it make sense --11 MR. FREDERICK: So if the -- if the State12 court applies Dabit and Santa Fe, it will come to the13 conclusion that the holder theory is preempted under14 Dabit, but the negligence theory is not preempted under15 the Santa Fe case.16 JUSTICE BREYER: Does it make -- what's17 worrying me in the back of my mind is we have decided18 Dabit since this case was brought. Then I thought,19 well, could we remand this case in light of Dabit.20 Now, if we did that, we wouldn't decide the issue that21 you all want decided, and we'd let this, unfortunately,22 slightly confused situation continue to exist.23 What would be the consequence of that? Are24 there -- are there a lot of cases, or is this something25 that comes up often?201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. FREDERICK: It does come up often because2 the securities bar, every time they get a district3 court decision that they don't like, they want to4 appeal it, notwithstanding the general bar of5 appealability. So this issue is something that is very6 important to both sides in the development of this law.7 But I would further point out, Justice8 Breyer, that as this case has come up, your -- your9 view would have to be based on do you have appellate10 jurisdiction, and our submission is that you don't,11 subject for purposes of remanding the case in light of12 Dabit.13 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm trying to think. It14 seems if you -- it ought to work out similarly to what15 happens in a case where there's a Federal issue that16 you remove under. Now you've removed. And there also17 is a State issue pendent. Now, what the judge does is18 he says, defendant, you win on the Federal issue, and19 I'm going to send this thing back now, remand it,20 because I don't think I want to maintain here the State21 issue. And so it's a remand order. The case is22 remanded.23 Now, I think you get an appeal on your24 Federal issue25 if that's so,1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400there.  And then -- then why shouldn't --shouldn't this work out the same way?21 Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. FREDERICK: Well, in the Cohill case,2 this Court addressed the situation where there was a3 Federal dismissal of the claims and the -- and the4 Federal district court remanded the State claims for5 consideration under -- under State jurisdiction. And6 the Court7 you know,8 the case.910 dismissal11 and that that is subject to appeal, but that a remand12 decision, which is what the district court made in this13 case, is not.14 JUSTICE BREYER: Shouldn't it work out the same?15 MR. FREDERICK: No, it shouldn't and the16 reason it shouldn't is because Congress has decided17 that it shouldn't. Congress has decided that there is18 a paramount interest in having decisions made on their19 merits, which is why there is not appellate review of20 remand orders. That's --21 JUSTICE ALITO: But aren't you -- aren't you22 urging a very strange result that the -- the decision23 on the merits of the SLUSA preclusion issue should be24 decided by the State courts when the whole purpose of25 -- of that provision was to take matters out of the221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-had internal discussion about whether or not,there was appealability of what was left inOur -- our position is that ordinarily aof a Federal claim is an appealable matter￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425State courts because there was a view in Congress thatthey were not being handled properly there?          MR. FREDERICK:  No, Justice Alito, to thecontrary.  They are being decided by Federal districtcourts.  They're just no subject to appellate review,and it was because --          JUSTICE ALITO:  I thought you said the meritsof the issue was not going to be decided by the Federalcourt.          MR. FREDERICK:  No.  Well, the -- the meritsof the case are going to be decided by the State court.The question of whether there's a Federal defensebased on SLUSA in the first instance is decided by thedistrict court in remanding the case, and then if therebecomes a basis through evidence or amendment to thepleadings or whatnot, if the defendants want to re-raise their SLUSA preemption argument, they arecertainly free to do that.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  So he's right that it'sultimately not decided by the Federal court.          MR. FREDERICK:  No, it is decided.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're saying the Federalcourt makes a decision which is not binding in thecase.  That decision can be undone by the State court.MR. FREDERICK: It is decided by the Federal 231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 court within the confines of what Congress has2 determined based on its wording of SLUSA and its fact3 that, as this Court has said in Things Remembered, the4 Congress is presumed to accept the general rule of5 nonappealability unless it says so.6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I understand that.7 Can you answer my question? You -- you were8 saying that the -- that the decision by the Federal9 court on this issue is not final.10 MR. FREDERICK: I'm saying that it is final11 for purposes of remand.12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, but it is not final --13 MR. FREDERICK: And that in terms --14 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- for purposes of the15 lawsuit.16 MR. FREDERICK: Because -- because what SLUSA17 does is it has an interplay between the removal18 jurisdiction provision and it says, as set forth in19 subsection (b).20 JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that, but as21 long as you say that, the point that -- that Justice22 Alito makes is -- is well taken, that we -- we thought23 that this was a -- a statute designed to have the24 Federal courts determine this issue, and it turns out25 that the Federal court just takes the first swing at241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425it, and if a State court disagrees, it's -- it's freeto do so.          MR. FREDERICK:  That is a policy choice thatCongress made when not providing a special mechanismfor appellate review of remand orders.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Of course, if the Federaldistrict court says there is preclusion, therefore,case dismissed, that would be reviewable.          MR. FREDERICK:  That's correct, and that'swhere the uniformity of decisions would comereviews by plaintiffs who's had their -- whotheir cases dismissed.  Those are subject to          I'd like to reserve the balance of          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,Frederick.          Mr. Perry.              ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK A. PERRY               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSfrom, thehave hadappeal.my time.Mr.          MR. PERRY:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court:          It was quite a litany of errors that JudgeEasterbrook is alleged to have committed in this case. I would submit, Your Honors, he committed none.          Judge Easterbrook correctly recognized thatthe only issue put into play by these Petitioners was251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 the Dabit question. In their motion to remand this2 docket, docket number 20 in the Kircher case, they3 said, it is the fourth requirement, the in-connection-4 with requirement, which is at issue in the present5 case.6 We pointed out in every subsequent brief that7 they had waived all other issues, and they never8 responded to that waiver. It is that, Justice9 Ginsburg, to which Judge Easterbrook was responding10 when he said plaintiffs never argued in their briefs11 and they did not maintain an argument that any other12 requirement --13 JUSTICE STEVENS: Could we just -- can I ask14 you suppose they didn't waive it? Would their -- would15 their position have any merit?16 MR. PERRY: No, Your Honor. Their complaint17 rests on two factors that are clearly within SLUSA.18 First, misrepresentations. They claim that our19 prospectuses misled them into investing in these mutual20 funds and then --21 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me put the question22 just a little differently. Suppose the -- in Dabit, we23 decided that the distinction between the purchaser-24 seller rule and the scope of 10b-5 did not prevent25 SLUSA from preempting. But does SLUSA preempt a claim261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that is beyond the scope of rule 10b-5?23 precisely4 is beyond5 requires scienter. SLUSA has no scienter requirement.6 So a non-scienter-based State law claim is still7 precluded 89 omission,under SLUSA.What SLUSA requires is a misrepresentation,manipulation, or deceptive device inMR. PERRY:  Your Honor, SLUSA precludeswhat subsection (b) says it precludes, whichthe scope of 10b-5.  For example, 10b-510 connection with the purchase or sale of securities.11 Period. All of that is present in this complaint.12 They allege omissions.13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they can always amend14 the complaint and pare it down and say now -- we -- we15 complained all along about negligence. Now, Judge, we16 are complaining about mismanagement on the defendants'17 part, nothing more. No manipulation. Cut out -- they18 could have such a complaint, and would that be19 precluded if -- if they started afresh in the State20 court and they said, we are complaining about21 mismanagement? We're not charging anyone with fraud or22 deception. Couldn't -- isn't that a viable claim?23 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, in this case they24 could not amend their complaint because the Federal25 jurisdiction is determined on the complaint that we271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 removed. And at the time of removal, it was clearly2 precluded by SLUSA. And the Court's cases are very3 clear that a plaintiff may not amend. For example, you4 can't lower the amount in controversy below $75,000 to5 get back to State court. At the time of removal, the6 Federal court both had jurisdiction over this case and7 it was clearly precluded under SLUSA.8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And -- and I9 understand your submission -- and perhaps it's distinct10 from the Seventh Circuit holding in this respect -- to11 suggest that those are different standards, the12 standard for removal and the standard for preclusion.13 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, I think we're the14 same as the Seventh Circuit. We may have articulated15 it slightly different, but yes, they are different16 standards.17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that under your18 view at least, it's possible that you could have19 removal jurisdiction and then determine that the -- the20 case is not, in fact, preempted.21 MR. PERRY: Yes, Your Honor.22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And so that an23 entirely State law case would proceed in Federal court.24 MR. PERRY: Mr. Chief Justice, let me give25 you an example. The answer is yes.281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          In a case in which there is removaljurisdiction because the defense is colorable, theremay be a factual issue as to whether the in-connection-with requirement is met.  In 10b-5 cases, it's notuncommon that that is a factual question, not a legalquestion.  The Federal court would then retainjurisdiction to decide that question on summaryjudgment, at trial, or whatever.  It won't know untilit finally disposes of the --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is there anotherinstance in which we've upheld Federal courtjurisdiction over a purely State law cause of action,apart from the Federal officer situation?          MR. PERRY:  You have the Federal officersituation and you have the FSIA, Foreign SovereignImmunities Act situation, Your Honor.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But those are theonly two.          MR. PERRY:  Correct.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So this would be apretty unusual creature that you're asking us tosanction.          MR. PERRY:  No, Your Honor.  It would beprecisely the same creature that happens every timeCongress makes a case removable on the basis of a291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 Federal defense. Every time Congress does that, which2 is not very often, the Court has held that the3 colorable defense is sufficient to invest the Federal4 court with jurisdiction.5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then, Mr. Perry,6 there's a whole case. See, what's peculiar about this7 is Congress says it's not really preemption. I think8 Justice Stevens pointed that out in Dabit. It is9 preclusion. It says this action shall not exist.10 Period. Not as a State claim, not as a Federal claim.11 And it wanted the Federal courts to monitor that12 determination. It surely didn't want -- if -- if the13 State claim is outside that preclusion, didn't want the14 Federal courts to sit and have a whole trial on what is15 a non-diverse, no Federal question case. I mean, it16 just seems -- if you're going to imagine what Congress17 wouldn't want in the Federal court, that would be it.18 MR. PERRY: Justice Ginsburg, three answers.19 First, Congress wanted Federal courts to make20 the decision, not monitor the decision.21 Second, we agree the Federal court has the22 power to remand the case. If all that's left is State23 law claims, the court doesn't have to keep it.24 And third, that is what -- the regime that25 Congress set up was designed because there is a risk of301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 error. Some district courts will get some SLUSA2 preclusion questions wrong. And the question before3 this Court really is would Congress have wanted those4 cases to stay in the Federal courts subject to Federal5 appellate review or --6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But now there you must7 admit that you are departing from Judge Easterbrook8 because Judge Easterbrook said this statute gives the9 Federal court adjudicatory authority to do one thing,10 to decide whether there's preemption or preclusion or,11 if not, then to remand. So they make -- they make one12 determination and bow out he said. And you're telling13 us, no, they don't bow out. They can, if they want to,14 keep the State law claim and adjudicate it on the15 merits.16 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, Judge Easterbrook17 read section -- subsection (d)(4) to require remand.18 Petitioners and Respondent's are in agreement in this19 Court for the first time that (d)(4) does not apply to20 the remand in this case. It only applies to remands21 for expressly exempted actions. The -- (d)(4), it22 says, shall be remanded.23 The corollary to that, we would submit, is24 that where Congress recognizes that certain cases shall25 be remanded, even though they're within the removal311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 jurisdiction, other cases, such as this one, may be2 remanded. Otherwise, Congress could have said all3 cases that are not precluded shall be remanded.4 And -- and, Justice Ginsburg, it's not as5 counterintuitive as -- as I think Petitioners are6 trying to make it seem because there may be Federal7 issues that continue past the preclusion --8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. I'm simply asking9 about the Seventh Circuit's understanding of the case.10 It says, after making the decision that 77p(b)11 requires, the district court has nothing else to do.12 Dismissal and remand are the only options. So Judge13 Easterbrook or the Seventh Circuit clearly did not14 think that there was any adjudication on the merits of15 a State law claim to be made. He said it twice. One16 is at 14a of the joint appendix, and the other is 11a.17 MR. PERRY: And, Justice Ginsburg, the reason18 he said that was because of -- of section -- subsection19 (d)(4), which is quoted in full at the top of page 12a20 of the petition appendix. That is because the Second21 Circuit had held that (d)(4) applies to remands in this22 situation, and both Petitioners and Respondent's in23 their Seventh Circuit briefing took that position.24 When we got to this Court and we both looked harder at25 the statutory scheme, we both realized that we were321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 wrong. Therefore, Judge Easterbrook -- you know, the2 one mistake he made was the one we led him into making.3 But that doesn't change the validity of his4 jurisdictional analysis, which is to say that the only5 requirement of SLUSA that goes to the jurisdiction on6 removal is whether this is a covered class action. The7 elements of the preclusion defense are then the8 substantive question of Federal law that Congress9 authorized the Federal court to make, and it authorized10 the Federal court to make final.11 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm confused now. You're12 saying both sides agreed that section 1447(d) does not13 apply?14 MR. PERRY: No, Justice Breyer. Both sides15 agree that SLUSA, section 77p(d)(4) --16 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, then --17 then I understand that.18 What I don't understand is the question about19 something remaining to be done. What -- what 77p(b)20 says is the covered class action, I take it, is any21 private party alleging. And when I see the word22 alleging, I think you're supposed to look at the23 complaint to see what they allege, not some other thing24 about what's going to happen later. But you're telling25 me that's wrong.331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. PERRY:  Your Honor --          JUSTICE BREYER:  And if you're right thatthat's wrong, I don't see how you could possibly getout of (c) in 1447(c) which talks about a decisionbefore final judgment, that it lacks subject-matterjurisdiction.  Because if you're right, then this isbefore final judgment, it lacks subject-matterjurisdiction.  That's the end of your case.          MR. PERRY:  Justice Breyer, I disagreerespectfully.          JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  You have todisagree with -- I guess -- go ahead.  Disagree.  I'dlike to hear the answer.(Laughter.)          MR. PERRY:  If it is a covered class action,that is, 50 plaintiffs and so forth --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.          MR. PERRY:  -- it is removable and within thesubject-matter jurisdiction of the Federal courts solong as the defendant has presented, either on thecomplaint or in the removal papers, a colorable defenseof preclusion.  Only --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, which would have to bea colorable defense that there is an allegation by theplaintiff that falls within (b).341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. PERRY: An allegation by the plaintiff as2 elaborated on by the removal notice, if necessary,3 because where Congress has waived the well-pleaded4 complaint rule, the removal court will look beyond the5 four corners of the complaint to include affidavits and6 other materials provided by the defendant. That has7 always been held the case in -- in the rare instances8 where Congress has made a Federal defense removable.9 The Court said that in the Franchise Tax Board case,10 for example, and it's well supported by history from11 the 1870's --12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I don't think that any13 of those cases are comparable, in that the removed case14 is going to be tried someplace.15 Take a diversity case. The Federal court has16 to decide -- and it's removed -- whether the parties17 are really diverse. If it decides that they are really18 diverse, it keeps the case and it's adjudicated in19 Federal court. If it decides they're not, the case is20 adjudicated in the State court.21 But here, the determination is, is there a22 claim to be tried anyplace? And if there is preclusion23 under SLUSA, then it's not a question of, as Judge24 Easterbrook put a menu, where is -- it's not a where25 question. It's a whether question. And so that makes351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 -- makes SLUSA quite different from other cases where2 the -- the case is going to be tried someplace. Here,3 the decision to be made is, is this going to be tried4 or not? Is it -- is it a claim or is not a claim?56 -- Justice Ginsburg, and I think that supports Judge7 Easterbrook's opinion.8 In the where will it be tried case, the lack9 of appellate review is less important because the10 merits of the case will go to State court and up11 through the system, and any Federal issues can reach12 this case.13 In the SLUSA case, where the district court14 erroneously, as we know the district court erroneously15 did here, denies the preclusion and sends the case back16 to State court, that is a final determination of17 Federal law that we submit is not reviewable in State18 court and can't be reviewed by this Court up on review19 through the State system. So that --20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why do you say it is not --21 why do you say that it cannot be examined in State22 court if there's no appeal in the Federal forum?23 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, this Court has always24 held and reiterated in the Munsingwear case that where25 a collateral estoppel attaches because an issue has361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-MR. PERRY:  I entirely agree with you, Judge￼1 been fully and finally litigated in a court of2 competent jurisdiction between the same parties, that3 the availability of an appeal --4 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the --5 MR. PERRY: -- does affect collateral6 estoppel.7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but -- but there is8 also exceptions to the rule of claim and issue9 preclusion, and when you don't have an opportunity to10 appeal because the system doesn't let you appeal, then11 you can say, Judge, don't give this preclusive effect.12 I did not have that full and fair opportunity because13 I was unable to appeal. And I think that that's a solid14 preclusion law.15 MR. PERRY: Justice Ginsburg, this Court has16 never held that an appeal is required to give17 collateral estoppel effect. Therefore, on remand, the18 court could -- the Madison County State court could19 give collateral estoppel effect. In fact, I expect20 Petitioners would argue precisely that. And no21 decision of this Court stands as a barrier to that.22 The Court would have to change preclusion law to say23 that the lack of an appeal is a prerequisite to an24 approval. I agree with you, Your Honor, that it can25 be taken into account by a court, but it does not --371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And a Nassau County courtcould say, we're not going to treat that as preclusive. They didn't have a fair chance to appeal.  And thatwould be all right.          MR. PERRY:  And if they came out the otherway and said, I am going to treat it as preclusive,because the Supreme Court says you don't have to have aright to appeal, we'd be stuck with that.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, you wouldn't be stuckwith it.  I mean, that would be a Federal preclusiondecision and that would ultimately be reviewable here.          MR. PERRY:  That -- that decision would bereviewable here, Your Honor.  It's an unnecessarymultiple layers of appeals and going through the Statesystem to decide a Federal question that Congresswanted to have decided in the Federal courts.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But in any case, you saidEasterbrook made only one mistake.          MR. PERRY:  Only one mistake.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But he made another onewhen he said, it's now or never for appellate review.That preclusion question could come to this Court if itwent -- the case went back and the Nassau County said,well, I'm going to follow the Federal court, I'm notgoing to -- at the end of the road, the preclusion381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 question would be open for this Court to review.2 MR. PERRY: I respectfully disagree with you,3 Justice Ginsburg. The -- if the State court gave4 preclusive effect to the Federal court judgment, the5 preclusion question would be open to question -- the6 collateral estoppel question would be open to review.7 But the substance of the remand order would not be. It8 would still be barred by 1447(d), if Petitioners are9 right, and this Court held exactly that in the Missouri10 Pacific Railroad case in 1896 and has never revisited11 that. So that we cannot get the SLUSA issue up back12 through the State system.13 Judge Easterbrook was exactly right. It is14 now or never, Your Honor. And Congress certainly could15 not have expected on an issue16 it passed a law 3 years after17 JUSTICE GINSBURG:18 question is not can you -- is19 1447(d) bar it. The question20 under State law is preempted.21 And suppose this case had gone along in the22 Federal -- in the State court, and the defense of23 preclusion is made in the State court. The State court24 could certainly decide that question. Nobody removed25 it. So the State court has competence to decide that391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-of this magnitude wherethe PSLRA --Now or never.  Thethere an appeal or doesis whether an action￼1 question, 234 decide it 5doesn't it?MR. PERRY:  Certainly, Your Honor.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And in -- this Court couldon review.MR. PERRY:  In a non-removed case, yes.6 Petitioners' theory, though, is if this is a 1447(d)7 bar, and it was removed to Federal court, decided that8 it was not precluded by SLUSA and remanded it, this9 Court could not review it directly or indirectly, could10 not review the issue of SLUSA preclusion decided by the11 Federal court.12 JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I don't understand13 that. Why can't it?14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And your best case on that15 is Munsingwear?16 MR. PERRY: No, Your Honor. Our case on17 that, where the Court held exactly that, is Missouri18 Pacific Railroad v. Fitzgerald.1920 case. 2122 there was23 the court2425 --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Oh, the Missouri PacificJUSTICE GINSBURG:  Was that a case whereno possibility of reviewing the decision ofof first instance?MR. PERRY:  Yes, Your Honor.  It was a case401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  On -- on the merits of the     issue as opposed to diversity?               MR. PERRY:  On the merits of the final     judgment in the case, correct, Your Honor.               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And why --               JUSTICE BREYER:  In other words, if -- I     mean, it's awfully surprising -- I think that's why     you're getting this resistance -- that there's an issue     in a case, does -- is the -- the State action preempted     or not.  They've never had an appeal.  So they get it     tried.  The whole case is tried out, and then the --     some State court says, in our opinion it is preempted.      But they can't decide that.  They can't decide it     because there was a Federal judge who said the opposite     in the same case before the case was final.               MR. PERRY:  Justice Breyer, I think the State     court could decide that.  It's not --               JUSTICE BREYER:  And if they don't -- and if     they refuse to decide it, why wouldn't this Court say,     this is the same case?  There is only one case.  It     isn't over yet, and we're reviewing that, and we think     that district judge was wrong.  We think that Federal     district judge never read Dabit, which isn't surprising     since it was decided after he wrote the opinion.(Laughter.)411111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. PERRY: Justice Breyer, we would2 certainly hope that if Petitioners were to prevail on3 the 1447(d) issue, this Court would make clear both4 that we could relitigate the question to State court and5 bring it to this Court.6 What we are saying is under the current state7 of this Court's law, laid out in our brief and not8 challenged in any regard by Petitioners, that is not9 obviously the case, so that we are left with the fact10 that a State court could give preclusive effect to an11 obviously wrong Federal judgment that could not be12 reviewed in this Court.13 JUSTICE SOUTER: So you're saying we would14 have to overrule Missouri Pacific?15 MR. PERRY: I think you would have to clarify16 at least that Missouri Pacific does not apply to SLUSA17 removals and remands, Justice Souter.18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is part of the dynamic19 here, Mr. Perry, that if this goes back to the State20 court, that affects the dynamics of the litigation21 because you now have a class action that has to22 proceed, and that a large part of the litigation23 strategy in these cases is determined by whether or not24 there's going to be a full trial on the merits of the25 class action to effect a settlement, and so forth, so421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that Congress wanted to have this reviewed quickly and2 in the Federal courts?3 45 Because I6 attach to7 describe it as saying that the -- the State court8 cannot be held to have decided against a Federal right9 -- well, anyway, the -- the point is there are twoMR. PERRY:  Correct, Your Honor.  And --JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask this question?hadn't, frankly, realized the importance youthe Missouri Pacific case.  And the way you10 things that are decided by the Federal court when it11 remands a case. One, there was no preemption, and two,12 therefore, there shall be a removal.13 Now, as I understood the principle underlying14 that case, the -- the correctness of the remand could15 not be reviewed. That's litigated. But could not the16 correctness of the reason given for the remand, namely17 there was no preemption, be removed by us on18 certiorari?19 MR. PERRY: Not under Petitioners'20 Your Honor, because their theory is that the21 are completely and totally coextensive. That22 jurisdictional inquiry, the -- the remand inquiry is23 precisely the same as the preclusion inquiry. Our24 position is that --25 JUSTICE STEVENS: Under their theory, but it431111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-theory,inquiriesthe￼1 seems to me very strange to say that we could not, when2 we do get the case on a petition for certiorari --3 couldn't review whether it was -- whether it was in4 fact preemption.5 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, I'd submit that it's6 very strange that this would not be just reviewable7 straight up through the Federal system, as Judge8 Easterbrook and the Seventh Circuit correctly held.9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the reason is10 there are two separate questions. They just happen to11 be identical. But I mean, the State court isn't going12 to worry about whether removal is appropriate or not.13 It doesn't have to answer that question, but it may14 well have to answer the question whether it's15 preempted. It happens to be the same analysis, at16 least under a reading of the statute, but that doesn't17 meant that you -- that just because a review of the18 removal decision -- the remand decision is -- is19 precluded, that review of the preemption decision is20 precluded.21 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, that -- that may well22 be a fair distinction of the Missouri Pacific case. We23 come to the Court today with the law as it stands and24 not knowing whether such a distinction will be drawn in25 the future --441111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE BREYER:  But it's so odd.          MR. PERRY:  -- the Seventh Circuit.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Suppose -- suppose the -- itcame up under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.The district court judge remands the case.  In hisopinion Romania is not a country.  That's what hethinks.  Never heard of it.(Laughter.)          JUSTICE BREYER:  So -- so it goes back to theState court and the State court says, yes, that'sright.  We've not heard of Romania either.  It's not acountry.          All right.  Now, you're saying there we arefor all time.  Everybody is stuck with this holding.          MR. PERRY:  Your Honor --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that right?  Maybe that'swhy I'm so surprised that such could be the law.          MR. PERRY:  If -- if it works the same waywith SLUSA, such could be the law.  The Court certainlyhas the opportunity to clarify that.          Again, I'll return to the simpler way --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You're -- you're positinga -- a State court that's going to, by golly, give thatFederal decision preclusive effect even though, say,the Restatement of Judgments says -- now if a decision451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 didn't -- if there was no opportunity for review, then2 that's a ground for refusing preclusive effect.3 MR. PERRY: And in -- and in Munsingwear,4 Your Honor, the United States cited that precise5 provision of the Restatement of Judgments to this6 Court, and six Justices of this Court held, no, if7 there's no appeal, we are still going to give this8 judgment collateral estoppel effect. Certainly a State9 court would not be unreasonable in following this10 Court's lead, since this Court has never retreated from11 that statement.12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought Munsingwear was13 about mootness.14 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, it was about mootness15 and the result of the -- the Government's complaint16 there was that it was going to have to live with the17 collateral estoppel effects of the judgment. One of18 the arguments they made was, well, because we can't get19 an appeal, we won't be bound, and the Court disagreed20 with that en route to saying, and to avoid that21 problem, precisely that problem, you should have asked22 for vacatur. But since the Solicitor General didn't do23 it, the Court -- the decision stood and it had24 collateral estoppel effect. That -- that is the25 holding of Munsingwear, Your Honor. 461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE SOUTER: But in -- in any case,2 Munsingwear turned on -- not on the availability of --3 of an appeal generally, but on the mootness of the4 case. In other words, Munsingwear said, look, your5 case disappeared, and the -- the only way to get rid of6 the order you don't like is -- is vacatur. And if you7 didn't take that opportunity to get rid of it, then the8 -- the decision that was made survives, and that gets9 preclusive effect. It -- it doesn't -- Munsingwear10 would not apply of its own force in this case.11 MR. PERRY: Well, Munsingwear reaffirmed12 Johnson v. Wharton which said that where Congress takes13 away the right to appeal, there is still collateral14 estoppel effect of the district court judgment. That15 -- that was the previous decision that Munsingwear16 affirmed.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But not if the litigant18 asks to have it vacated under Munsingwear, the litigant19 would be entitled to have it vacated. So it was a foot20 fault and the -- the Court held the counsel to the21 mistake that had been made.22 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, the -- the holding of23 Munsingwear is that Johnson v. Wharton is good law, and24 a court need not give -- may give preclusive effect to25 a case without an appeal.471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel --          MR. PERRY:  If the Court would like to changethat law, it's -- it's up to this Court, but that's howwe come to this case.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, if you -- onthe removal question, if there's a dispute aboutwhether it's a covered class action, dispute about thenumber of people involved, the dollar amount, I take itthat is litigated at the jurisdictional stage?MR. PERRY:  Correct, Your Honor.  I think --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  But you sayit gets to whether it's a -- there's a --a covered security, for some reason thatthat wheninvolvingcan't be litigated at the jurisdictional stage.          MR. PERRY:  No, Your Honor.  That is themerits determination.  And -- and the statute tracks --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  No oryes?  That that is not litigated at the jurisdictionalstage?          MR. PERRY:  That the preclusive elements arethe merits question of the case, not the jurisdictionalquestion.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why is that?  There-- it's the same clause.  What you can remove is acovered class action involving a covered security.  So481111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 why do we have such different approaches to the2 different prongs?3 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, I'm agreeing with you4 on covered security. I'm -- I'm saying that there then5 is the further inquiry of whether all of the preclusive6 elements of subsection 77p(b) are met, which is the7 merits inquiry.8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. And --9 MR. PERRY: There -- there are very few cases10 that don't involve covered securities because virtually11 every security is covered. There are very few cases12 that aren't covered class actions because if they13 involve more than 50 people, that's about all the14 requirement there is. Those are the jurisdictional15 prerequisites. That, if established, gives the court16 subject-matter jurisdiction.17 Then we have the substantive elements of the18 SLUSA preclusion defense provided in a different19 statute that is not jurisdictional, just like this20 Court described in Arbaugh. The covered security and21 covered class action Congress made jurisdictional by22 putting them in the statute. The substantive elements23 of the defense Congress did not make jurisdictional24 because they're in another statute.25 That's the disconnect that Judge Easterbrook491111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 understood so that on the face of the opinion of the2 district court, where it recites the defendants3 maintain that the in-connection-with requirement was4 met, that defense, if colorable -- and it clearly was.5 This Court has accepted it in Dabit -- conferred6 jurisdiction on the court, and then the substantive7 decision on the merits was the merits determination.8 That is the decoupling that Congress did in SLUSA, that9 Judge Easterbrook correctly recognized, and that puts10 this case11 1447(d).1213 argument,14 stressed that is, that Congress provided specifically15 in the Class Action Fairness Act, a couple of other16 acts, and 1447 itself with respect to civil rights17 actions removable under 1443? In all those cases, it18 provided specifically for review of remand decisions,19 and here the silence is deafening.20 MR. PERRY: In those cases, Your Honor, they21 work differently than SLUSA for two reasons. One,22 they're the whether -- not whether it will be tried,23 but where it will be tried. And when Congress -- and24 when it was only a where question, Congress puts in a25 specific provision.501111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-squarely within the Thermtron exception toJUSTICE GINSBURG:  How do you answer thethe third argument, that Mr. Frederick￼1 The other is CAFA, for example, is expressly2 jurisdictional. It amends the diversity statute. So3 there's no argument that it would be within Thermtron.4 Every CAFA question is a 1447(c) issue. Congress had5 to make it.6 Here, Congress knew about Thermtron.7 Congress has known about Thermtron for 30 years. This8 Court reaffirmed Thermtron while they were debating9 SLUSA. And Congress knew that this question was not10 jurisdictional. Congress decoupled them, just as this11 Court described in Arbaugh.12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't know what -- what13 Congress' knowledge about Thermtron was a district14 judge who said, they removed this case, but I'm much15 too busy. This court is much too busy to mess with16 stuff that belongs in the State court. I'm remanding17 it. That was just too much, and the Federal court --18 MR. PERRY: And, Justice Ginsburg, if Judge19 Hermansdorfer had said, I'm much too busy and therefore20 I lack subject-matter jurisdiction, it is inconceivable21 that the Thermtron case would have been decided any22 differently. Congress understands the difference23 between jurisdiction and merits. This Court24 understands the difference between jurisdiction and25 merits. Judge Easterbrook certainly understood that511111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 distinction. This determination made by the district2 court here was a merits determination not controlled by3 1447(c), and therefore, appeal was not barred by4 1447(d).5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -- but I still6 don't -- and this gets back to the question I asked7 before. I mean, subsection (c) of 77p -- it's8 unfortunate we've got a lot of subsection (c)'s here9 but -- of -- of SLUSA incorporates subsection (b).10 MR. PERRY: No, Your Honor. It references11 subsection (b).12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it says what13 can be removed is the covered class action involving a14 covered security, as set forth in subsection (b).15 MR. PERRY: Just as title VII says what can16 be brought is an action under this title or just as the17 environmental statute in Steel Company said what can be18 brought is an action under subsection (a).19 The cross reference of another provision20 containing substantive elements of Federal law does not21 make those elements jurisdictional. That's the holding22 of Arbaugh. That's the holding of Steel Company.23 There's no reason that the same principle shouldn't be24 applied when Congress makes a Federal defense removable25 as when it makes a Federal claim subject to suit within521111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 the original jurisdiction of the Federal courts.2 JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but here, what is set3 out in subsection (b) is exactly the reason for4 Congress' wanting to place these restrictions on it,5 and that, it seems to me, is the sensible reason for6 reading it the way your -- your brother on the other7 side does.8 MR. PERRY: Well, Justice Souter, we know9 from Mesa that if Congress had just made all covered10 class actions removable, we would have to find some11 Federal defense to support article III jurisdiction.12 Congress, by cross-referencing subsection (b), just13 pointed the Federal courts to the particular Federal14 defense that is sufficient, clearly sufficient, to make15 article III satisfied under the Mesa case. That's all16 that that cross reference is doing.17 It's not, however, picking up every element.18 If Congress wanted to include every element of title19 VII, that environmental statute of SLUSA, it would have20 put them in the jurisdictional provision. Arbaugh says21 --22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why would it have23 done that? That would have been a waste of time. I24 mean, you just say, as set forth in subsection (b).25 You're saying if they had repeated subsection (b)531111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425there, we'd have -- the case would come out the otherway?          MR. PERRY:  Yes, Your Honor.  We have notonly the -- the reference there, but we have the finalsentence of that clause where we say after removal,after the court establishes that it has removaljurisdiction, it shall subject the action to subsection(b).  That clause is entirely redundant underPetitioners' reading of the statute.  Entirelyredundant.  I've read the reply brief a number oftimes.  I don't understand their explanation for that. The only explanation is that Congress maderemovability contingent on the subsection (c) factors.          Thank you, Your Honor.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. Perry.          Mr. Frederick, you have 4 minutes remaining.           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID FREDERICK               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MR. FREDERICK:  Thank you.  I think it'sreally important for you to look at the complaints inthese cases because every single one of them assertsclaims on the basis of negligence and the value -- thefair-value pricing of the securities.  They are notbased on misrepresentations.  The other side hasattempted to make them look like misrepresentations,541111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 and they've quoted things out of context in order to do2 so. But the complaints themselves are pure negligence3 claims that would fall outside of SLUSA.4 But even if you were to disagree with that5 and even if you were to disagree with the district6 court's basis for saying that remand was proper because7 it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, the general rule8 of Thermtron, Things Remembered, and importantly, the9 Gravitt case applies. And this Court does not have10 appellate jurisdiction. The Seventh Circuit does not11 have appellate jurisdiction because of the plain12 language of section 1447(d).13 Respondents concede that State courts can14 decide SLUSA questions. It is up to defendants to15 decide whether to try to remove them. And subsection16 (d), about which Mr. Perry spoke, expressly provides17 that certain kinds of securities actions shall be18 remanded because Congress was not so concerned that19 Federal courts decide everything concerning securities20 cases, but only as to those that are expressly set21 forth in subsection (b).22 And, Mr. Chief Justice, respectfully, what23 subsection (c) is doing with its references to24 subsection (b) are to incorporate those criteria as one25 of the three elements or criteria for removability. It551111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 has to be a covered security, has to be a covered class2 action, and it has to meet the requisites of subsection3 (b). That's the only reasonable way to read that. And4 the last clause is simply confirmatory that if those5 are -- are met, then the district court has to find6 that the case shall be precluded.7 In the Gravitt case, in which this Court8 through a per curiam dismissed the appeal, there was a9 dispute between the district court and the court of10 appeals over whether the district court had properly11 applied subject-matter jurisdiction principles in12 deciding whether or not there was diversity. This13 Court said, no matter. That is outside the -- the14 requisite -- that is outside 1447(d), and the general15 rule against appealability applies.16 Now, importantly, they argue that they would17 be precluded by -- from arguing against SLUSA18 preemption in State court, but in fact, the last brief19 -- the last page of our brief, our reply brief, cites20 the Standefer case in which this Court held, under21 contemporary principles -- and I'm quoting now -- under22 contemporary principles of collateral estoppel, the23 inability to pursue an appeal is a factor strongly24 militating against giving a judgment preclusive effect.25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you agree that there561111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 would be Federal court review in this Court from a2 State court determination on the applicability of SLUSA3 in this case?4 MR. FREDERICK: Yes, there would be. And5 there would be -- their argument about the Missouri6 Pacific case is wrong because what the -- what was7 going on there was the remand determination, not the8 underlying Federal right. And that's what would be9 appealed, and there would also be appeal of the10 preclusive consequences because that would be a11 question of Federal law under this Court's longstanding12 determination. The Restatement --13 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you one question,14 Mr. Frederick? Because it's important to me.15 Would you agree that a complaint that alleged16 that the defendant negligently used or employed17 manipulative devices and so forth would be covered by18 SLUSA -- would preempt it?19 MR. FREDERICK: That would be covered. And20 -- and the reason is that it is -- involved a21 manipulation. The wording of SLUSA involves a22 manipulation of -- of the security.23 JUSTICE STEVENS: So the mere fact that it's24 negligently caused would not preclude preclusion.25 MR. FREDERICK: What -- what we're talking571111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425about here, Justice Stevens -- it's important -- isthat in how these securities get priced, was therenegligence in the pricing of those, that haddeleterious effects on one class of holders but not onmarket-timers that we were moving in and out of themarket.          And so, frankly, Judge Easterbrook was wrongfor a sixth reason, and that was in saying that therewould have been a derivative claim here too because aderivative case has to be brought on behalf of thecorporation on behalf of all shareholders --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Then the districtwrong too I guess because the district courtsame --court wasmade the          MR. FREDERICK:  The district courtin not anticipating what this Court held in Dabit, butit was not wrong insofar as it held that there was nosubject-matter jurisdiction because this case is basedon negligence and not fraud.Thank you.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr.Frederick.          The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 11:59 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)581111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-was wrong
