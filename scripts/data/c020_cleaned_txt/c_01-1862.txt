McLEAN                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MS. McLEAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          In Lindh versus Murphy, this Court held that10111213   time of AEDPA's enactment.  In the general run of habeas14   cases, this is determined by the filing date of thechapter 153 was non-retroactive to cases pending at the15   application for habeas relief.16             This case will resolve a split between the five17   circuits that apply this rule to capital cases and the18   Ninth Circuit which, instead, looks to the date the19   pre-application motion for counsel was filed in a capital20   case.21222324   application of chapter 153.  In light of this, we must25   determine Congress' intent, and the first place to look is31111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼We believe that the five circuits are correct.          Neither chapter 153 nor Lindh versus Murphyidentifies the commencement event that triggers the1   to the express terms of chapter 153 and, of course,2   AEDPA's purposes to expedite habeas cases and to provide3   greater deferential review to State -- State criminal4   convictions.5             Chapter 153 by its terms can only apply to a6   merits petition.  It repeatedly contains express language,7 8 9such as that contained in 2244(d), which is found atpetitioner's appendix 185, which concerns the statute oflimitations provisions and provides that the statute oflimitations applies to the application for habeas relief.1011121314   approach?15             MS. McLEAN:  Your Honor, I believe that -- that16   these are easily reconciled.  I believe that it -- that17   there's a -- I think the habeas proceedings can be -- are18   unique and can be extended.  They can also be divided          Similarly, the standard of review in 2254(d) atpetitioner's appendix 191 --QUESTION:  Well, what do we do about McFarland's￼19   into -- into segments.20             The first phase is the pre-application phase,21   which is what McFarland was concerned about.  In that22   case, this Court was concerned about providing, pursuant23   to 21 U.S.C. 848 -- concerned about the pre-application24   grant of counsel to habeas petitioners.  But that is25   entirely separable from the merits proceeding that occurs41111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051234   and a proceeding.  How -- how do you get us here under the5   words of the statute?after the filing of the -- of the petition itself whichbrings the merits before the court.QUESTION:  It's the difference between a case 6             MS. McLEAN:  The -- actually, the provisions of 7   chapter 153 themselves do not contain the word case. 8   That -- we only come to that term at all because in this 9   Court's opinion in Lindh, the Court looked to -- created10   a -- viewed the -- as being a negative inference from the11   absence of the pending cases language that appears in the12   154 provisions.13             The 153 provisions do not have that -- those --14   that term in them.  Instead, they use the specific express15   words of an application.  They clearly apply to an16   application.  And the case -- that's reconcilable because￼the portion of the case that we're talking about is themerits portion of the -- of the case.17181920   cases in a habeas proceeding.  In Slack versus McDaniel,21   the Court recognized that there could be a separateThis Court recognized that there can be multiple22   appellate case that --23             QUESTION:  How was it treated on the court's24   docket?  I mean, the -- something was going on.  There was25   a request for a stay.  There was a request for the51111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   appointment of counsel.  So something was initiated, and 2   what was that something called? 3             MS. McLEAN:  That would -- it could be 4   characterized as -- you could use the word case.  You 5   could use the word habeas corpus proceeding. 6             QUESTION:  Do you know how it was in fact?  How 7   was it treated on the court's docket? 8             MS. McLEAN:  It -- 9             QUESTION:  Was it given a case name and a file?10             MS. McLEAN:  It was -- it was certainly given a11   case name and assigned a case number, undoubtedly, but I12 do not --13             QUESTION:  And would that number indicate that14   it was a habeas petition?15             MS. McLEAN:  I'm sure it did because our courts16   in California, the -- the district courts have numbers17   that specify that it's a habeas proceeding.￼QUESTION:  So it was on the docket as a habeas1819   case.20212223   I'm -- my position is, or our position is, is that24   these -- that the habeas proceeding is unique and25   extended.  It includes three phases; includes the61111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MS. McLEAN:  That's correct.QUESTION:  And that's not good enough.MS. McLEAN:  That's not determinative.  What1   pre-application phase, which is the -- what McFarland was2   concerned about.  It -- it then has the merits application3   phase that begins with the filing of the application for4   habeas relief.  It then also has the appellate phase.5             QUESTION:  Well, McFarland was a totally6   different statute from AEDPA, was it not?  It -- it was --7 8 9it's a totally separate statute.          MS. McLEAN:  That's correct, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  And really, what we're trying to     interpret here, I take it, is the meaning of some of the11   language in Lindh.  We're -- we're not talking about any10specific language in -- even in AEDPA.          MS. McLEAN:  Well, we're concerned about --1213141516171819   to?  What -- what creates the pending case for purposes of20   chapter 153?21             For that, we have to look back to the express22   terms of the statute.  Since 153 can -- doesn't apply toLindh used the phrase that -- that there wasnon-retroactivity of chapter 153 to cases -- to casespending under 153.￼23 24 25the -- the pre-application phase --          QUESTION:  Why -- why would we look to theexpress terms of the statute when Lindh itself didn't rely71111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          So the question is, what is the commencementevent that we talked about, that -- that we're referring 1   on any express terms of this statute?  Why wouldn't we 2   look to -- to what makes sense with respect to the rule 3   that we have created? 4             MS. McLEAN:  I would agree with that, that 5   the -- what I'm saying is that in the absence of -- in the 6   absence of language -- there's clearly an absence of 7   language in 153 that addresses this commencement event. 8   So that puts us into a position of looking to see what 9   Congress intended based on what the express words of10   chapter 153 are.  Is -- is there anything in chapter 15311   that tells us that, no, we didn't mean the -- the -- a12   commencement of a habeas proceeding based on the filing of13   an application?  We meant something earlier, i.e., themotion for -- for a request for appointment of counsel.          And the answer to that is no.  Simply no.  Thereis nothing in chapter 153 that has anything to do with the14151617   pre-application proceeding.  Those provisions, as is18   demonstrated by their terms and also the habeas corpus19   rules concerning chapter 2254 cases -- those only can20   apply -- expressly apply to applications for habeas21   relief.  They do not apply to any earlier event, and it22   doesn't -- it thwarts the purposes of AEDPA by -- by23   unduly confining the number of cases covered by it,￼24   capital cases covered by it.  It --25             QUESTION:  That's the part I wonder.  I was81111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051   thinking that if it's open to -- pend -- the -- the2   case -- what is it called?  Is it -- McFarland -- suggests3   that it's at least open to calling this pending.  It's a45678   lot of proceeding that went on here.  There was a stay.9   It was opposed.  And all of this took place before the --possible construction.          MS. McLEAN:  Yes, it's a possible construction.          QUESTION:  And then -- and then it being apossible construction, I wonder, well, there was an awful10   the petition was filed.  So if the purpose of AEDPA, at11   least as we've interpreted it, is to stay away from12   proceedings that were already underway, this would seem to13   have been well underway.14             MS. McLEAN:  It was -- the -- the proceeding was15   well underway, but that doesn't -- is not determinative16   in -- in the sense that counsel had been appointed and a17   petition was in the works.  But that --18             QUESTION:  That's -- that's what I want you to19   address precisely.  That's where I'm uncertain.  It seems￼as if the language -- you could -- you could -- youcould -- the language is open to either interpretation --2021222324   it's more strong in your direction.  I -- I understand25   that.  But if -- say, if it's open to eitherMS. McLEAN:  I don't --QUESTION:  And yet -- well, you -- you think91111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051   interpretation, then why doesn't the purpose of the2   application provisions, as we've interpreted them, suggest3   don't apply it where proceedings are well underway, which4   would mean the other side would win here.  That's why I'm5   asking you.  I want to see what your response is.          MS. McLEAN:  In order to deviate from -- fromthe normal -- also, there is no question that in -- in thegeneral run of habeas cases, it's triggered by the filing6789   of the application.  So the question is whether there's10   some justification, some harm that would be caused by11   not -- by treating them -- them being the capital cases --12   under the Ninth Circuit's ruling differently than we do13   the normal run of habeas cases.  And there's nothing about14   the fact that a counsel had been appointed or that -- that15   a application was in the works, but not yet filed, that16   would prevent us or harm in any way those petitioners from17   ultimately being subject to the greater standards of18   deferential review that -- that AEDPA ultimately imposed.19   There's no harm whatsoever.20             And it doesn't further -- it thwarts the21   purposes of AEDPA to do that.  It -- it also creates a22   subclass of capital defendants who are treated23   differently --24             QUESTION:  But if everyone had focused on AEDPA,25   which they didn't because it wasn't enacted at the time101111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   all this started, then maybe the district judge would have 2   made the time lines different.  And the district court had 3   a proceeding before it with a number.  It was classified a 4   habeas case.  And the district court set a rather relaxed 5   schedule.  He gave the counsel, appointed counsel, many 6   months to file the actual petition.  And if everybody had 7   known that the -- that the time the district judge gave 8   would mean that AEDPA would apply, then I assume counsel, 9   being diligent, would have said, don't give me that much10   time.  I have to get this in quickly.11             MS. McLEAN:  This case that's before the Court12   does not involve the statute of limitations, however.  Theconcerns that you're expressing would be valid --          QUESTION:  But you don't want AEDPA to apply, if13141516   tighter.17you're diligent counsel, because the standards are much￼          MS. McLEAN:  It does affect the standards ofreview, but they don't --1819202122232425   of limitations, there was no issue here.  This case came111111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          QUESTION:  Well, counsel didn't have to take allthe time that the district court allowed, did he?          MS. McLEAN:  He did not need to, but he -- hewas fully compliant.          To the extent that the Court's concern hereappears to this counsel to be concerned about the statute1   in timely.  And in fact, in the Ninth Circuit, they2   followed the same rule that all the other five circuits3   followed all the way up until 1998.  So really the statute4   of limitations is virtually a non-issue in this situation.5   This case did -- the -- the -- any delays or long periods6   of times that were granted or anything didn't have7   anything to do with this case.  There is no harm in this8   case.9          The only issue is that now, once this case wasin the district court and in the Ninth Circuit, should itbe subject to the deferential standards of review that101112   AEDPA imposed, and the answer to that is yes.  There was13   no -- there is absolutely no harm in now saying that14   because the filing of the application came in after the15   enactment of AEDPA, that it should be subject, just as all16   other habeas cases are, to --17             QUESTION:  Do we know how many cases fall in18   this category?  This is a transition case caught in19   between.  No AEDPA when it all started; AEDPA in the￼202122232425middle before the petition is filed.          MS. McLEAN:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  How many cases are in that category?          MS. McLEAN:  We believe -- we believe that itaffects approximately -- in the Ninth Circuit,particularly in California, it affects approximately121111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   45 capital cases. 2             QUESTION:  45 cases. 3             MS. McLEAN:  It also -- it also, of course, 4   affects the other -- those cases, those capital cases, 5   that are covered by the other circuits which currently 6   use -- all of which, other than the Ninth Circuit, as to 7   those 45 cases, use the filing date of the application. 8   So if the Court, obviously, was to choose the position 9   advocated by respondent, it would change the standard of10   review from AEDPA to non-AEDPA in those States covered by11   those circuits.12             In the Ninth Circuit, what will -- would happen13   if you adopted the position that I'm advocating is that14   you -- that those 45 cases in California, approximately15   45 cases in California, will now become AEDPA cases.  And     that will primarily affect the standard of review that is     applied to them.￼1617181920   very good answer.  Do you happen to know the number of21   cases in the other circuits if we ruled the other --2223   not.2425   event.  MS. McLEAN:  I'm -- I'm sorry, Your Honor, I do  QUESTION:  It's a vanishing problem in any131111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005Garceau --QUESTION:  Do you happen to know -- that was a 1             MS. McLEAN:  That's certainly true, but it's 2   very important.  Garceau is the perfect example of why 3   this is an important issue for this Court, the -- in 4   Garceau, the -- the State -- the State supreme court 5   issued a very well-reasoned opinion issuing -- saying that 6   it had decided that error was harmless, upholding the 7   conviction that occurred in this case.  It went through 8   the district court.  The district court agreed.  It went 9   to the Ninth Circuit in 2001 -- this was a 1984 killing.10   In -- in 2001, it was reversed by the Ninth Circuit, which11   did -- because it did not believe it was an AEDPA case,12   refused to apply the deferential standard of review,13   refused to apply the precedents of this Court, instead14   looked at its own -- its own cases, and reversed it.15             And this is -- you know, this is the most16   important -- a capital conviction in California is the17   most important cases -- some of the most important cases18   that that State issues.  And -- and to have that reversed19   for the failure to apply this -- the standards that20   Congress imposed in 1996 is a very, very serious matter.21   And that's just one case.  It's happened in other cases.22   And -- and so, we believe that it's very important to have23   this issue straightened out.24             QUESTION:  Do you wish to reserve the remainder25   of your time?141111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1             MS. McLEAN:  Your Honor, I do.  At this point,2   I would like to reserve my remaining time.  Thank you.3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  Very well, Ms. McLean.          Ms. Coffin, we'll hear from you.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF LYNNE S. COFFIN                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MS. COFFIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          The issue is not whether this harms Mr. Garceau,but whether it is appropriate under this Court's precedentto rule the way the State asked this Court to rule.10111213141516171819   in this case.  Congress must be presumed to have been20   informed by this Court's majority ruling in McFarland.21   The McFarland Court ruled that -- that Congress had22   permitted a capital proceeding to be initiated by the23   filing of a motion for counsel.  That ruling was only24   2 years before Congress made major revisions to the habeas25   corpus law in AEDPA.  Under statutory construction151111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          For two independent reasons, the amendments tochapter 153 do not apply to Mr. Garceau.          First, it simply cannot be, as the Statesuggests, that after this Court found in McFarland thata capital case is commenced by the filing of a motion forcounsel, that Congress then passed a new statute,intending it to be interpreted consistent with the dissent￼ 1   principles, Congress must be found to have been aware of 2   and followed this Court's precedent set in McFarland. 3             QUESTION:  Well, are you -- are you saying, 4   Ms. Coffin, that McFarland is controlling in the very 5   strict sense of the word here, that if -- we must rule in 6   your favor without looking anywhere else just because of 7   the decision in McFarland? 8             MS. COFFIN:  No.  What I'm -- what I am saying 9   is that I believe that this Court should look to what10   informed Congress when they wrote AEDPA.  And I think once11   that is done, this Court will conclude that if you12   interpret the ruling in Lindh, where -- where 107(c)13   applies to 153 and 154 -- where did Congress get the word14   case when they were determining who would be subject to15   this law?  And I agree with Justice Ginsburg that when a16   case is begun, you get a number, you're put on a docket.17   That is your case, and that is consistent with what this18   Court decided in McFarland.19             What is not consistent is to believe that20   Congress used the word case rather than petition when they21   quite clearly used petition in many other parts of the22   statute.23             QUESTION:  When -- when did Congress pass the24   law that -- that overturned the result in McFarland?  You25   say they passed a law that overturned the result?161111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1             MS. COFFIN:  No, no.  What I said was that they2   passed AEDPA, and when they did that, they were informed3   in how they wrote that statute by McFarland.  That was in4   '96.5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  Okay.  And they -- they haven't dealtwith the issue of McFarland.          MS. COFFIN:  Well, in -- yes and no.  I mean,I think that they -- they had an opportunity to change848(q) and looked at 848(q) --          QUESTION:  Yes.1011121314151617   history that supports one side or the other.  However, if18   one looks at McFarland -- the majority decision, as well19   as Justice O'Connor's concurrence and dissent -- one sees20   that this Court made it very clear to Congress that if21   they meant something like petition or application, which22   are pretty much used synonymously, that they better put23   those words in because, in fact, the majority in this --24   in -- of this Court refused to read that kind of language25   into McFarland, and that's part of how McFarland got171111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          MS. COFFIN:  -- when they wrote AEDPA, and theychose to leave 848(q) in place.          QUESTION:  Well, now, is that supported bysomething in, say, the legislative history, or is thatjust your -- your own view of what must have happened?￼MS. COFFIN:  There is nothing in the legislative1   decided.2             So very shortly thereafter, Congress wrote a law3   completely revising or, you know, substantially revising4   habeas corpus.  And it's simply difficult to believe that5 6 7 8 9at that point, they decided not to look at the majorityopinion in McFarland which uses the word case.          QUESTION:  But it's -- it's not at all anunusual phenomenon that -- that a word in -- in statuteshas different application in different contexts whereyou --101112   final?  Congress says, you know, when -- when it's final.13   It depends on what the context is, and nothing -- nothing14   says that just because you -- you think that the case for15   one purpose, for the McFarland purpose, begins with the --16   with the initial filings, for -- for all purposes it has17   to begin there.18             And what impresses me about this case is that I19   don't see what is gained by extending the inapplicability20   of AEDPA earlier than the filing of the habeas petition21   because the purpose of -- of the non-retroactivity22   provision is certainly not to cause somebody to be23   frustrated in actions that he took in reliance upon the24   prior law.  And -- and a -- a habeas applicant could be25   frustrated in events that occur after the filing of his181111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005We had a case the other day.  When is something￼ 1   habeas petition.  But all of the events prior to that 2   filing that were covered by McFarland, they aren't covered 3   by AEDPA anyway.  AEDPA could not possibly affect those 4   earlier events.  So -- so nothing -- nothing is served by 5   making the retroactivity go back further. 6             MS. COFFIN:  Well, I -- I think there are 7   actually two answers to that question.  The first one is 8   it isn't really an issue of whether or not -- in my 9   opinion, it's not an issue of whether or not some harm is10   going to come to -- to Mr. Garceau by interpreting this11   one way or the other.  That's not the issue.12             The issue is what did Congress mean when they13   did this.  They had one purpose, I agree with you, which               QUESTION:  Right.was to reform habeas corpus and make things move in a --in a more orderly fashion.141516171819   certain cases would not be covered by AEDPA.  And so --20             QUESTION:  Well, those cases -- those cases, in21   which they did not want to frustrate legitimate￼          But they had another -- there -- there is alsoanother part to that, and that is, they determined that22   expectations.23             But my point is, there is no possible legitimate24   expectation that would be frustrated by AEDPA in the25   pre-application stage.  AEDPA simply doesn't have anything191111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9to do with that.          MS. COFFIN:  Well, the language of the statutesays case, and -- and I think there -- I think --          QUESTION:  Okay.  You're back to that argument,but on that argument, you know, what's a case depends onthe context.          MS. COFFIN:  I also think that there is a -- areason that can be discerned from their retroactivityprovisions which was --          QUESTION:  Well, in your -- in your answer toJustice Scalia, you said, well, you're not sure about theharm, but the harm exists, it -- it seems to me, in not10111213   giving full effect to the congressional scheme.  The --14   the Congress obviously thought that this was a -- that15   AEDPA was a preferred regime, and you are delaying what16   Congress has found a preferred regime.  So it's a harm in￼that sense, maybe not the harm in a particular case thatwould come out one way or the other, but you are delayingthe effectiveness of -- of a congressional scheme.1718192021222324   reasons given.  We -- we want -- we want cases that25   have -- where the merits have been addressed to be decided          MS. COFFIN:  But Congress chose to determinethat not everyone would be immediately affected --immediately affected by AEDPA, and they --QUESTION:  Well, of course, for -- for the201111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   under the -- the law before it was changed by AEDPA. 2             MS. COFFIN:  Justice Kennedy, I believe that, in 3   fact, the -- the cases that were in the pipeline, this 4   finite number of cases, were exactly the cases -- not the 5   154 cases, but the 153 capital cases that were in the 6   pipeline that Congress was aware that they were 7   pre-petition cases, petition cases, various kinds of 8   cases.  And if they wanted to make sure that it -- this 9   statute would be interpreted in a way so that anyone that10   was in Federal court and that had vast proceedings take11   place, but that had not filed a petition yet, all they had12   to do was put the word petition in.  And I believe that we13   are bound by what Congress did.  I understand that14   they want --15             QUESTION:  But -- but that -- but that's just16   not true that -- that we give a word the same meaning in17   all contexts.  We -- we evidently don't.  There are so18   many instances of that, that your argument cannot --19   cannot rely just upon that.  And it seems to me all of the20   other courts that have come out the other way from the21   Ninth Circuit have done so for a very sensible reason, and22   that is that there is nothing to be gained, nothing23   whatever to be gained, by refusing -- or by -- by refusing24   to apply AEDPA to these pre-petition activities inasmuch25   as AEDPA cannot affect them at all.211111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1             MS. COFFIN:  Well, if -- to give you a brief 2   answer, on the other -- on the other circuits, the fact of 3   the matter is none of them analyzed this in terms of 4   Congress' intent at the time that they wrote AEDPA and how 5   they were informed by McFarland. 6             However, even if this Court is not convinced 7   that Congress' awareness of McFarland is dispositive as to 8   the meaning of case pending, Garceau had a case pending 9   pre-AEDPA under this Court's definitions of what10   constitutes a case.11             Prior to AEDPA, Garceau had begun the process of12   challenging a State conviction and death sentence in part13   by filing in the district court a pleading detailing two14   fully exhausted claims of Federal constitutional15   violations.  Garceau sought and received counsel in order16   to raise claims and challenge a State conviction and death17   sentence.  He filed a document detailing the two claims I18   just mentioned with their factual and legal foundation19   which were ripe for adjudication.  The district court made20   a determination, after hearings, that these claims21   presented viable grounds for habeas corpus relief.22             Under Hohn, we believe Garceau had a case23   pending.  The determination in Garceau's case is very24   analogous to the judicial determination in Hohn concerning25   the COA application.221111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  I mean, is it true, by the way --is -- is that the case or not that -- I'm interested inthe question -- that -- that if in fact AEDPA applies toa -- AEDPA does -- there's a difference whether AEDPAdoes -- does it make a difference if AEDPA applies or notto the --          MS. COFFIN:  Yes.          QUESTION:  How?          MS. COFFIN:  Well, there's more deferentialstandard to the State -- to the State court's decision.          QUESTION:  So it does make just as much101112   difference.13141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  No, but not -- not to any decisionthat is taken before the filing of the -- of the formalhabeas application.          MS. COFFIN:  Oh.  If you're asking whether thisparticular thing that I was just talking about would havemade a difference, no.          QUESTION:  Your case.  In your case.  A personfiles a petition asking for a lawyer, and then we have alot of litigation.          MS. COFFIN:  Right.          QUESTION:  Should there be a stay?  Should therenot be a stay?          MS. COFFIN:  Right.231111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1             QUESTION:  And I guess the answer to that could 2   affect a later determination in the case.  I don't know. 3             MS. COFFIN:  I would concede that, in fact, in 4   this case and I think all the pipeline cases, that even if 5   AEDPA had applied at the time that the case originated, 6   there would not have been a different determination in 7   terms of those early proceedings. 8             QUESTION:  Yes. 9             MS. COFFIN:  However, the -- the point I'm10   trying to make now is that even if this Court doesn't11   believe that -- that case pending can be determined by12   looking at McFarland and Lindh, I think that the -- what13   Hohn has identified as what is needed for a case is, in14   fact, found in the Garceau case and that's because of the15   proceeding that Garceau followed where he actually filed16   what could have been a petition had that name been put on17 it.18             QUESTION:  Can you specify what were the19   pre-petition -- I thought that there was -- there was also20   something submitted by counsel, a kind of skeletal21   statement of issues, and -- and because there was an22   adversary proceeding, was there not?  The -- the State23   moved to dismiss the stay.  And something what -- was24   something different submitted by Garceau himself earlier,25   and then something by counsel later?  What was the241111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   sequence? 2             MS. COFFIN:  No.  What -- what happened is there 3   was an application for counsel.  Counsel was appointed. 4   Counsel then -- there was a stay before counsel was 5   appointed so that counsel could be found.  Then counsel 6   was appointed, and an additional 120-day stay went into 7   effect before counsel filed the document I'm now talking 8   about.  And this document is the Specification of Non- 9   frivolous Issues, which includes two claims that were --10   and were in the petition ultimately that put -- set forth11   the factual and legal basis for those two claims.  And12   then the judge had to determine whether or not one or both13   of those claims were non-frivolous.  Otherwise, the stay     would have been dissolved, and Garceau -- actually I would     imagine that the counsel may have been pulled, but that's     not what happened.               QUESTION:  And that statement of issues was     filed pre-AEDPA.               MS. COFFIN:  Yes.  Yes, and as in Hohn --               QUESTION:  Well, excuse me.  There was -- but     that was also after the application for habeas corpus had141516171819202122   been filed.  No?￼23 24 25          QUESTION:  No.          MS. COFFIN:  No, no.  This is before.  WhatI'm -- what I'm saying is this document, the Specification251111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200056 7 8 9in which to file the petition, you --          QUESTION:  Isn't this --of Non-frivolous Issues, which is required under the rulesof all of the district courts in California --12345   counsel is appointed.  In order to get an additional stayQUESTION:  In order to get counsel appointed.MS. COFFIN:  No.  Actually, you get it after          MS. COFFIN:  -- you get counsel and then counselmust file something that a district court determines is,in fact -- has at least one non-frivolous issue --1011121314151617   case whether they were non-frivolous issues.  It's a --18   it's a determination made by the district court.  However,QUESTION:  Is that ex parte?          MS. COFFIN:  No.  It's served -- it's served onthe other side.          QUESTION:  And it -- so is it generally arguedwhether or not these are non-frivolous issues?￼MS. COFFIN:  It wasn't argued in this particularthe other parties are served and certainly could make anargument --19202122232425   habeas, conceivably be affected by AEDPA?  Is there any261111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005QUESTION:  See, that -- that's why I thoughtthere --those events that you've just described, pre-filing of theQUESTION:  Could any -- could any of those -- of 1 2 3 4 5   don't -- I'm a petitioner.  I ask for a lawyer.  The judge 6   says, do you have any non-frivolous claim?  He says, sure, 7   this is it, and you list them.  Now, if, in fact, AEDPA's 8   in effect, we're going to apply a pretty lenient standard 9   in reviewing the State court determinations on those10   issues, but if AEDPA isn't in effect, we're --11             QUESTION:  Are the State court's determinations12   reviewable?way that AEDPA could have disappointed expectations withregard to that pre-application activity?MS. COFFIN:  No.QUESTION:  Why?  I mean, that's -- what IMS. COFFIN:  Well, I -- I certainly --13141516171819202122232425   affect the outcome.  In fact, probably -- I don't know if271111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          QUESTION:  I mean, if the State courtappoints --￼          QUESTION:  I'm sorry.  What I was thinking isthat if the standard for reviewing the State courtdeterminations is different, depending on whether youapply AEDPA or not, I don't see why, in principle, thatcouldn't affect the outcome of a judge's decision as towhether the issue in the petition in front of me is or isnot a frivolous issue.MS. COFFIN:  I agree.QUESTION:  So I think in principle it could1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9it did or not, but I -- I don't see the difference betweenthat affecting the outcome there --          MS. COFFIN:  Well --          QUESTION:  -- and the outcome of an early stagewhere you file the petition.          MS. COFFIN:  Well, in fact -- in fact, in thiscase there probably would have been a differentdetermination at least as to one of the two issues that --that Garceau put forward.               QUESTION:  I wasn't even aware that these things11   were reviewable.  You -- you mean to say that you get12   judicial review of whether, when counsel is appointed,13   the -- the trial court allows counsel to proceed with a14   habeas?  You -- you can take that up on judicial review?101516171819202122232425          MS. COFFIN:  Well, I -- I --          QUESTION:  Don't you just go ahead and whatultimately is reviewed is the -- is the substantivedisposition of the habeas application?          MS. COFFIN:  No.  I -- I don't believe so.  Infact, had the district court determined that there were nonon-frivolous issues, the stay would have been dissolved,and unless Garceau appealed that judgment of -- of thedistrict court or filed something else, he would have beenout of court.          QUESTION:  Well, what -- but what if the281111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1   district court determined that these were non-frivolous2   issues?  Does the State have any right to appeal that3   determination?  Has it ever happened?4             MS. COFFIN:  I don't believe it's ever happened.5             QUESTION:  But does the State have a right to be6   heard?  The -- the question is whether the stay will be7   continued.  The Specification of Non-frivolous Issues is8   filed.  If the State says these are frivolous issues, can9   the State be heard?MS. COFFIN:  Yes.QUESTION:  Can the State file a responsive101112   pleading?13141516171819   statement of non-frivolous -- Specification of Non-20   frivolous Issues was filed, the State objected to the stay21   that the district court had put into place to -- so that a22   petition could be filed because under the local rules, you23   can't get an additional stay to file the petition unless24   you file this document that shows that you have at least25   one viable issue.  And so prior to the filing of that291111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MS. COFFIN:  Yes.QUESTION:  Do the -- do such hearings occur?MS. COFFIN:  It didn't occur in this case.QUESTION:  Yes.QUESTION:  But there was some proceeding.MS. COFFIN:  There was a proceeding.  Before the￼1   specification by counsel, the State objected when the2   district court extended the stay.3             QUESTION:  And once the issue -- the statement4   of issues -- once that was filed, then there was no5   response?6789          MS. COFFIN:  No.  There was no response from theState at that point.          QUESTION:  If there had been a response, theState had lost, and the State wanted to contest it, couldthe State take that up?1011121314151617   said -- no.  My answer -- I'm sorry if I gave a confusing18   answer.  My answer was they didn't in this case and I'm19   not aware of it happening in other cases.20             QUESTION:  Has -- you -- you don't know that21   it's ever been done.          MS. COFFIN:  I believe -- I -- I believe thatthey could, but it didn't happen in this case.QUESTION:  It -- it would be interlocutory.          QUESTION:  You just answered a minute ago to myquestion that they couldn't.￼MS. COFFIN:  That they couldn't -- no.  IMS. COFFIN:  No.  That's correct.  That was myQUESTION:  But if -- if the district judge said,2223   answer.2425   all right, I accept these, you've got a non-frivolous301111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051   issue, at that point, the State couldn't go up to the2   appellate court because it would be very -- it would be3   interlocutory.4 5 6 7 8 9          MS. COFFIN:  I believe that's correct.          QUESTION:  Help me out and -- and tell mewhat -- what portion of -- of AEDPA would apply to thispre-application event.          MS. COFFIN:  Well if --          QUESTION:  (d) says, an application for a writof habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuantto the judgment of State court shall not be granted withrespect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in10111213   State court proceedings.  Well, that -- that provision14   certainly wouldn't apply to any -- there -- nothing has15   been -- been adjudicated on the merits.  Right?￼16             MS. COFFIN:  If the district court determined17   that -- if AEDPA applied and the district court looked at18   the issues that you wanted to go forward on, and applied19   the deferential standard of AEDPA and, therefore,20   determined that, in fact, it was a frivolous issue because21   under AEDPA you would not be able to win --22             QUESTION:  Would you call that an adjudication23   on the merits?  Just the preliminary determination that24   there is or is not a frivolous issue here?  I -- I25   wouldn't call that a -- a determination on the merits.  So311111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051   I don't think (d) would apply.2             What about (e)?  (e) says, in -- in a proceeding3   instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus4   by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State5   court, a determination of a factual issue made by a State6   court shall be presumed to be correct.  Are there factual7 8 9issues decided in these -- in -- in these --          MS. COFFIN:  Well, there are --          QUESTION:  -- pre-applications?          MS. COFFIN:  There are factual issues put forth.The factual and legal foundation of the claims that --that are in the Specification of Non-frivolous Issues areput forth.          But I think that there's an additional questionthat -- that needs to be examined, which is, is whatGarceau filed, under this Court's precedent in Hohn, a1011121314151617   case?  And I believe that it is.18             QUESTION:  Was that the view of the Ninth19   Circuit?￼202122232425          MS. COFFIN:  Excuse me?          QUESTION:  Was that the view of the NinthCircuit when it decided this case?          MS. COFFIN:  The Ninth Circuit didn't applyAEDPA to this case.          QUESTION:  So you're saying even if AEDPA had321111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   been -- had been applicable, your client still should have 2   prevailed. 3             MS. COFFIN:  No.  What -- what I'm suggesting is 4   that AEDPA should not be applied to Garceau either because 5   of the first argument that I made about McFarland, or if 6   this Court is not satisfied that, in fact, Garceau had a 7   case pending, which is the language from Lindh that 8   determines whether or not AEDPA should be retroactive. 9             And I'd like to make one other point, which is10   that there are -- it is a finite number of cases that were11   in the pipeline.  It's a very unusual situation.  In fact,     you had to be post-State court determination and in     Federal court and somewhere along in -- in the process in     Federal court in order to be in this sort of bubble area.     And I think --it not?121314151617181920   proceeding.  AEDPA was pending when this was going on, and21   the counsel that represented this petitioner was the same22   counsel who represented him in the State court.  Isn't￼23 24 25that so?lead counsel in State court was unavailable to go forward331111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005QUESTION:  Well, Lindh was a similar case, wasMS. COFFIN:  Yes, but it was non-capital.QUESTION:  I have a question about this -- theMS. COFFIN:  Actually not.  What happened was1   and neither counsel that -- there were two counsel that2   participated at one point or another in State court, but3   neither participated in the whole case and neither was4   lead counsel.  And so lead counsel was unavailable and the5 6 7 8 9court appointed two new counsel who had some familiaritywith the case.          QUESTION:  Knowing that AEDPA was on the frontburner, counsel having some familiarity with the case, whydid they use all the time that the district court gavethem instead of filing before AEDPA went into effect?101112   reasons for that.  The first is that in State court,13   they -- there was neither discovery nor any evidentiary14   hearing.  There was no mechanism -- there was very little15   money and there was no mechanism by which counsel could16   pull together an entire petition.  And the district court17   agreed with that by giving counsel funds in Federal court.18             However, the district court set forth a schedule19   by which funds would be -- would be given, and those20   funds -- you did some investigation, you got -- you21   satisfied the district court, you got more funds.  The22   last funds were not -- were not given to counsel until,23   I believe, the end of May, which was only about 4 weeks24   before the petition was filed.  So that's one reason.25             The other reason is that counsel had to make a341111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MS. COFFIN:  Well, there were a number of￼1   determination, under this Court's precedent, whether or2   not it would be a mistake not to file a full petition, the3   best petition that could possibly be made and because it4   would be possible that it might not have been able to be5   amended.  And so --6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  Ms. -- Ms. Coffin, you -- you have tomake the best argument for your client here, and -- andyou're doing that.          But it strikes me that -- that there -- this issort of a mixed bag, that actually, in agreeing with you,we would probably be -- be harming most capitaldefendants, that is to say, your client will win on this10111213   retroactivity point which will eventually vanish.  It's14   a -- it's a temporary problem.15             But the effect of our holding that -- that the16   habeas action for purposes of AEDPA commences with the --17   the initial request for counsel is that all -- all of the18   transactions -- I mean, if -- if that provision that all19   factual determinations by the State court must be deemed20   to be correct, that means that AEDPA would, in the future,21   apply to those -- to those determinations.  Whereas, if we22   came out the other way, until the habeas application is --23   is applied, the strictures of AEDPA don't -- are -- are24   not applicable.  So, you know, it's a -- it's -- it's not25   a -- not a win-win game, but it is for your client, I351111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 suppose. 2             MS. COFFIN:  Well, actually, Your Honor, since I 3   have clients in many different positions here, I actually 4   don't believe that it would be a problem for other capital 5   defendants, and I do believe that it's the correct result 6   on either basis that I have put forth for Garceau. 7             QUESTION:  Because even under AEDPA, if you just 8   come in at the threshold, the court -- the Federal court, 9   in general, is quite liberal about letting you develop the10   facts necessary to present your claim.  It may be a11   problem with amending a petition in habeas, but your12   point, I take it, is that you can't envision any real harm13   to any of your clients if the starting date of AEDPA would14   be considered the filing of the stay application and the15   request for counsel.16             MS. COFFIN:  No.17             QUESTION:  May I just ask one question?  The --18   the proceedings that took place between the appointment of19   counsel, which involved the -- whether the -- the20   statement as to the kind of issues and so forth and the21   State's motion to vacate the stay and so forth -- were22   they all given the same number that Justice Ginsburg23   referred to earlier?24             And then after the habeas application itself was25   filed, was the case given a different number, or was the361111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1234   all of this.  I would have thought that the word case is5   very obvious.  You go to district court.  They stamp your6   papers.  You have a number.  That's your district court7   case and that's your case number.  And that's the number8   that Garceau had all the way through his district court9   proceedings.  He then got a different number stamped onsame number continued?          MS. COFFIN:  This case has only had one numberin district court, and it is one of the kind of ironies ofhis case by the Ninth Circuit when he was on appeal --          QUESTION:  Oh, yes --101112131415161718192021   the statement of non-frivolous issues that's filed.  In22   your view -- and I -- I would assume, at least for23   purposes of my question, that AEDPA might make a24   difference, that it might be non-frivolous before AEDPA,25   but -- but then frivolous after.  I'm assuming that could371111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          MS. COFFIN:  -- but there's been one -- onenumber all the way through and you don't get a get adifferent number when you file a habeas petition.If there are no further questions.￼QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Coffin.Ms. McLean, you have 16 minutes left. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JANIS S. McLEAN      ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERQUESTION:  Ms. McLean, we've been talking about1234   with that.  There's nothing in AEDPA that applies5   whatsoever to the pre-application period.  The deferentialbe true because of clear -- clear and convincing evidencestanding, for instance.MS. McLEAN:  Your Honor, I respectfully disagreeprovisions of 2254(d) can only apply once an applicationis filed by its express terms.6789   district court is interested.  That's because they --QUESTION:  Well, I'm -- I -- I take it the10   that's why they require this filing -- whether or not11   there's going to be anything here for the court to12   adjudicate.  Is there some substantial issue?13             And the point of my question was going to be14   let's assume that post- and pre-AEDPA, the standard of15   frivolity changes.  Let's assume that.  Or non-frivolity.16   Would you say that there is an expectation that's17   legitimate and that exists if there's a filing of a18   statement of non-frivolous issues pre-AEDPA and then19   before the complaint is filed -- before the petition is20   filed, AEDPA comes into effect?  Would you say an21   expectation has been established?22             MS. McLEAN:  No.  And the reason for that is23   that that document that is filed is so skeletal that it24   absolutely bears no resemblance to a -- ultimately to a25   petition.  Its sole purpose is to satisfy the local381111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   district court rules that require that there be some 2   showing for the court to exercise its discretion in 3   issuing a stay. 4             This Court recognized that requirement, or at 5   least a -- the discretionary nature of the State grant in 6   McFarland.  This isn't something that automatically 7   happens.  It's something that has to be deserved, and the 8   way the local rules in -- in California work are that they 9   have to file the statement -- a specification of non-10   frivolous claims.  It doesn't ask for habeas relief.  In11   this case, it stated 2 out of ultimately 28 claims that12   were ultimately raised.  It -- it doesn't -- it's not13   labeled a petition.  There was no expectation whatsoever141516171819   purpose.  There's absolutely nothing that is in --by Mr. Garceau that that was treated as any sort of apetition --￼          QUESTION:  The only expectation is you'll get astay until you file your petition.MS. McLEAN:  Exactly.  That was its solecontained in chapter 153 that has anything to do with thepre-application proceedings.202122232425   of habeas corpus.  Okay.  That's (d) and also (e) in aQUESTION:  Well, why -- why --          QUESTION:  Would you just confirm for me the --the language of 153 applies to an application for a writ391111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051   proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of2   habeas corpus.  Now, that -- that was not quite the3   language involved in McFarland, was it?  What was the456789   proceeding is pending.  I think --language involved in McFarland?          MS. McLEAN:  In McFarland, this Court wasconstruing the term post-conviction proceeding andsaying -- because 848 -- 21 U.S.C. 848 --QUESTION:  Before whom a habeas corpus10             MS. McLEAN:  That is actually the -- the11   companion provision, the State provision, in 2251.  The               QUESTION:  Yes.               MS. McLEAN:  -- under -- arising under 2254 or               QUESTION:  So you think instituted by an     application for a writ of habeas corpus means just that.     It has to be instituted by the application.               MS. McLEAN:  It's extremely explicit.  And it     also is consistent with how we're treating all other     habeas cases.               QUESTION:  Can you -- forgetting the -- the --     I -- I'm still slightly confused on what I'd call the401111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005provision in 21 U.S.C. 848 specifies that there's anentitlement to an appointment of counsel in apost-conviction proceeding --121314151617   2255.18￼19202122232425 1   practical point.  Imagine on January 1, before AEDPA is 2   passed, they file a petition -- no, not a petition -- 3   a petition for a lawyer.  And there's stay applications. 4   And everything under the sun is litigated on that stay 5   application, as it often is in a capital case.  On June 1, 6   once the stay was granted, they file their official habeas 7   petition.  On December 1, AEDPA is enacted.  Now, the 8   question is whether AEDPA will govern future proceedings 9   in the case.  And what we've said is it doesn't govern10   those future proceedings if, in fact, that petition had11   been filed on June 1.  Right?          MS. McLEAN:  Well, this Court hasn't -- that'swhat this case --12131415   habeas.  The habeas is pending as of the time that AEDPA16   was there.  The petition for habeas was filed on June 1.17   The petition for the lawyer and so forth was filedQUESTION:  No.  I'm saying the petition for￼18   6 months before.  Am I right?  Am I right?  Maybe I mixed19202122232425up that.          MS. McLEAN:  I -- I -- in all -- the only casesthat this Court has addressed is in the non-capitalcontext, and you have -- you've said that AEDPA appliesonce the filed petition is -- if the filed petitionoccurred prior to the enactment of AEDPA --          QUESTION:  If the filed -- the habeas petition411111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112   ask for a lawyer and then they go through the stay.  On13   June 1 they file the habeas petition.  On December 1,14   AEDPA is enacted.  Now, we don't apply it to that caseapplies -- was filed, and habeas proceedings are underway,and then later on AEDPA is enacted, does AEDPA apply?          MS. McLEAN:  Once -- if the habeas petition --          QUESTION:  Yes, the habeas petition.          MS. McLEAN:  -- the application for merits isfiled before --          QUESTION:  Before AEDPA.          MS. McLEAN:  -- the enactment of AEDPA, yes,there -- that is not an AEDPA case in --QUESTION:  Thank you.Now, what I'm saying is -- is January 1, theybecause the habeas proceeding was underway.1516171819   things because there could have been things decided.  Now,20   why isn't precisely the same thing true as to the period21   January 1 to June 1, where all kinds of things were22   decided, the stay was litigated, the judge has made up his23   mind, who knows how it affected the future proceedings?24   That's what -- do you see the question?25             MS. McLEAN:  I do.421111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼MS. McLEAN:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  All right.  Why don't we?  Becausethat judge might have made up his mind about various1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  What's the answer?          MS. McLEAN:  Respectfully, though, I believethat that ignores the express wording of -- of AEDPA.          QUESTION:  I get the linguistic point.  That'swhy I said that I wanted to know the practical point,which I think maybe Justice Kennedy's question was tryingto get at; I'm trying to get at.          MS. McLEAN:  Practically also, there is no --whatever litigation might occur with regard to the Stateproceedings has nothing to do with the merits of the case1011   which is what AEDPA goes to.  So there can be no harm.12   The fact that this was tremendously litigated State13   proceedings doesn't decide any issues that ultimately will14   be affected by AEDPA.  So there's no harm whatsoever.          QUESTION:  Well, you -- you described the -- theState proceeding as, quote, tremendously litigated, close.What did that -- what did that involve?1516171819   that happened in our case.  I think that usually they￼MS. McLEAN:  And in our -- I'm not saying thatdon't have -- there's virtually no litigation involved.          In this case, what happened was that they're20212223   Specification of Non-frivolous Issues.  They have to at24   least put in one or two of the claims that are ultimately25   going to be raised.  They didn't file anything.  What they431111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005required under our local rules to present the1   filed was a conclusory statement that there were2   constitutional claims that would be made.  And we objected3   to that rightfully because they didn't satisfy our local4   rules.  And so, it was that -- that was the sum total of5   our litigation related to the State proceedings.  It6789 funds?certainly doesn't create -- nothing occurred in this casethat would affect in any way --QUESTION:  Wasn't there also a request for10             MS. McLEAN:  There was -- there was a request11   for funds under -- there was a request for funds under12   848.13          QUESTION:  And that was before the -- before thehabeas corpus petition was filed, yes.14151617181920   the district court granted the stay.  Then the State came21   in and said, we want you to vacate the stay.  And then,22   the district court asked the petitioner to file the non-23   frivolous issues, et cetera, and so there was a24   considerable argument about whether the stay should be25   vacated or not vacated, which I guess eventually the441111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          MS. McLEAN:  That's correct.  Under 848 becauseof -- it's part of that -- or that post-convictionproceeding that was construed in McFarland.￼          QUESTION:  I thought what had happened here wasthat the petitioner asks for a lawyer and a stay, and then7 8 9          QUESTION:  What is it now?          MS. McLEAN:  We filed papers that objected tothe fact that the stay had been granted based on apetitioner won.          MS. McLEAN:  I think --          QUESTION:  It sounded to me like a fairlysubstantial proceeding.          MS. McLEAN:  I think that overstates the123456   situation.10   failure -- failure to comply with the local rules.  And wefiled papers that stated that and the court ruled againstus because they corrected the deficiency, and that's allthat happened.111213141516171819202122232425   proceeding.  It goes on.  The appointment continues on451111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          QUESTION:  But you say that whether or not thiscase is governed by AEDPA, AEDPA has no effect whatever onall of that.￼MS. McLEAN:  AEDPA does --          QUESTION:  By its terms, it simply does notaffect it.          MS. McLEAN:  That's correct.  And that is reallydemonstrated -- also another a twist on that is that an848 appointment, by its very terms -- if you look at848(q)(9), I believe is the provision, it talks about howa -- how the appointment of counsel survives the habeas1   into clemency proceedings and competency proceedings and2   other things.  So clearly this is sort of an independent3   track.  There's an appointment of counsel.  It includes4567   petition.  We've had experiences in the Ninth Circuit8   where the petition that ultimately ends up being filed is9   deficient.  It gets dismissed out.  They go back intothat habeas corpus proceeding under chapter 153, and thenit survives and may go on into other areas.121314151617   issues?18It also would survive the dismissal of a10   State court and they've allowed them to continue with that11   appointment of counsel.  And so it continues on.  Itclearly is a separate phenomenon.          QUESTION:  But doesn't it --          QUESTION:  Suppose Garceau had filed ahandwritten thing, and he called it petition for habeascorpus, and it had the same thing as the statement of￼          MS. McLEAN:  I think he would have -- if --assuming that it had been -- asked for relief and statedat least one claim with a summary of facts, fact pleadingthat's required --1920212223   for counsel, once counsel is appointed?  And my scenario24   is Garceau files his own petition, it's handwritten, and25   it's got one -- one issue.  Then the lawyer is appointed,QUESTION:  Would there have been a problem then461111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051   and a Dandy petition is filed with 28 issues.  Would2345   Ninth Circuit, they're very liberal in that situation.  It6   occurs frequently.  Especially in non-capital cases where7   a -- a petitioner is initially unrepresented and files a8   limited petition, the court's very liberal about granting9   the ability to amend the petitions later.  They're notthat -- would be any problem about that being considered asuccessive petition?MS. McLEAN:  No.  In my experience with theconsidered successive.          QUESTION:  Is it ultimately beside the point10111213   so-called pre-petition, the stay stage?  Because if your14   stay is dependent upon the Specification of Non-frivolous15   Issues, and frivolousness has some reference to the16   standards that you're going to have to meet for success17   and AEDPA affects those standards, doesn't, as a matter18   of -- of implication, doesn't AEDPA affect your19   frivolousness standard and hence have at least a potential20   effect at the stay point?21             MS. McLEAN:  Your Honor, I don't believe that22   that's the case.  The -- the non-frivolous issue23   standard -- very low.  They're just trying to make sure24   that there's some colorable claim, that -- that the stay25   is not being just granted on something that has -- that is471111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005that AEDPA itself doesn't say anything about this -- the￼1 just air. 2             QUESTION:  Yes. 3             MS. McLEAN:  They want something there so that 4   the court is reasonably exercising its stay discretion 5   and -- and appointment of counsel discretion. 6             That's a substantially -- that's unaffected, in 7   my opinion -- unaffected and substantially different than 8   the question that comes up once the merits petition is on 9   file, and we're looking to see whether or not this is --10   this is -- there's a valid constitutional violation --11             QUESTION:  Oh, I -- I quite agree.  But if -- if12   the State decided that it simply was going to be less13   complacent at the stage at which there is a request for14   stay and said, okay, we're going -- we're going to start15   contesting the non-frivolous character of these -- these16   claims that are being raised, number one, wouldn't the17   State be able to do that if it thought it was worthwhile18   to spend its time doing that?   And number two, if it did19   that, wouldn't the ultimate standard of persuasion that20   AEDPA applies have an effect on -- on the argument that21   you would make as to what was or was non-frivolous at that22   stage?23             MS. McLEAN:  A State could do that.  The --24   I don't believe, again, though, that AEDPA has any25   application to that.  The question -- all we would be481111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   looking at at that phase is whether there's enough to 2   justify the stay. 3             The -- AEDPA goes to the issue of whether the -- 4   you know, what the State court adjudication of the claim 5   was and whether it was a -- involved a reasonable 6   application of Supreme Court precedent and an entirely 7   different analysis.  I don't believe that there was, 8   a) any intent to affect that, or any actual effect 9   whatsoever from changing the deference that's ultimately10   applied to a merits petition to have any effect whatsoever11   on that initial inquiry that a -- that our courts in12   California require in order to satisfy the stay13   requirement, or the --14             QUESTION:  In any event, you're saying it isn't15   having an effect.  It -- it --￼16171819202122232425          MS. McLEAN:  I'm sorry.          QUESTION:  You're saying that, in fact, inCalifornia, it is not having such an effect.          MS. McLEAN:  It is not.          QUESTION:  Yes.          MS. McLEAN:  Thank you, Your Honor.  Ifthere's --          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Ms. McLean.          The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the491111 14th Street, N.W.
