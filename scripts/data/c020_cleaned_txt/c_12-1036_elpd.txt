AU Optronics Corporation.      Mr. Massey.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. MASSEYON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. MASSEY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:      The text and structure of the Class ActionFairness Act of 2005, which is known as CAFA, show thatit does not extend to State parens patriae actions.  Ifthere are any doubt on the matter, CAFA would have to benarrowly construed as a matter of the principles offederalism that are at issue here, as evidenced by the46 States supporting Mississippi before the Court.      The disposition of the case today, webelieve, is straightforward.  There is only oneplaintiff in this case, the State of Mississippi.  It isnot a citizen for purposes of diversity jurisdiction,and therefore, the requirements of even minimaldiversity, let alone the 100­person numerosityrequirement of CAFA, cannot be met.      Our friends on the other side want to use3￼￼1 the statute of CAFA to change that result. The mass2 action definition is the key part of the statute issued3 today. It is in the Joint Appendix at pages 79 to 80.4 Essentially, the attempt to force State5 actions into the mass action definition is a6 square­peg­round­hole kind of problem. The mass action7 definition addresses the situation of mass consolidation8 or mass joinder, when there are 100 individual9 plaintiffs or more in a case. And CAFA provides that10 there's Federal jurisdiction over such a case.11 But that does not apply to this situation.12 CAFA refers to real plaintiffs asserting concrete claims13 and further provides that those claims must be proposed14 to be tried jointly. None of that happens in a parens15 patriae case, where the State is the only Plaintiff.16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Massey, with respect17 to that, there is a claim for restitution. I take it,18 if the suit is successful, the money that's collected19 will be distributed to all the people who are affected20 by this conduct.21 MR. MASSEY: Well, Justice Ginsburg, that's22 very unlikely in this case. The Plaintiffs ­­ the23 Plaintiff in this case is the State of Mississippi. The24 consumers of Mississippi have already sued in an25 indirect purchaser action that has been settled. So418 system, there are no records, obviously, of who19 purchased them, and it would cost so much money to20 identify them ­­21 JUSTICE KENNEDY:22 $10,000 for each one?23 MR. MASSEY:24 JUSTICE KENNEDY:25 for each one?5￼1 they have received compensation.2 The State does have a restitution claim3 here. Your Honor is correct. And at page 65(a) of4 the ­­ of the response to opposition of the Orange5 Briefs, 65(a) describes the restitution claim.6 The restitution claim seeks recovery to the7 State of the money, not to consumers in Mississippi.8 And what's likely to happen here ­­ and, frankly, what9 happens very frequently when the Federal Trade10 Commission or the Securities and Exchange Commission or11 any other State or agency seeks restitution, the money12 is recovered by the State.13 And in a case like this, where it is very14 difficult to trace the individuals, the consumers who've15 been hurt ­­ after all, we're talking an LCD16 price­fixing conspiracy. So every television, computer17 monitor, phone, toy, digital camera, car navigationAnd you're asking forPardon me, Your Honor?     You're asking for $10,0001 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. MASSEY: Well, the ­­ the complaint does pray that. As the case goes forward, the Attorney General ­­ and subject to all the procedures that occur in Mississippi, will have to make a judgment about how that money is to be distributed.      In the past, what I can tell you ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume a case where ­­ forget about that the consumer action was settled. And let's forget about a case in which the damages are difficult to prove.MR. MASSEY: Yes.      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:which the damages can be determined, and the State comesin on behalf of a class of consumers and says, we'reseeking their restitution.  Does your argument change ifthe facts are different?MR. MASSEY: Our argument does not change. I would say, in our case, the State ­­ just to be clear about restitution ­­ the State is proceeding under statutes that gives the ­­ the State the only cause of action. Only the State can sue under these provisions. If the State ­­ the ­­ the consumers have separate damages statutes. The consumers would sue under separate statutes in a different court.      So the ­­ the ­­ in a different court,6￼Let's think of a case in10 party­in­interest argument,11 argument that ­­12 MR. MASSEY: It13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:    So is this a realor is it a statutoryis ­­    ­­ the statute requires￼1 meaning in Mississippi, that would have to be in a2 circuit court, court of law, as opposed to a court of3 equity. But if a State were to seek restitution and to4 distribute it to consumers, just to be clear, our5 argument would not change because restitution is still a6 public remedy.7 And for years ­­ for decades, Federal8 agencies and States have ­­9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:14 named plaintiffs as opposed15 plaintiffs, but plaintiffs.16 MR. MASSEY: Yes, named plaintiffs. The ­­17 the simplest resolution of the case is simply a18 statutory argument, that, on its face, the mass action19 definition refers to plaintiffs. The only plaintiff is20 the State. Even if the State has statutory authority to21 seek restitution, it is still the only plaintiff.22 So you would not even need to get into the23 real party­in­interest test because the statute doesn't24 refer to unnamed parties or to people who might be real25 parties in interest. It refers simply to the7to ­­ named or unnamed1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425plaintiffs.      So it's simple ­­      JUSTICE ALITO:reference to persons?      MR. MASSEY:reference to persons in the mass action definition.  Itoccurs ­­ we believe, very strongly, that itequates ­­ that ­­ that section continues and equatespersons with plaintiffs, and that the statute, in fact,wouldn't ­­ would be absurd if it didn't because itrefers to the monetary claims of 100 or more persons, asYour Honor has noted.      But then it says, "that are proposed to betried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs' claimsinvolve common questions of law or fact."  Those twosets have to mean the same thing; otherwise, it doesn'tmake any sense.      And furthermore, there are severe practicalproblems that support our sort ofsquare­peg­and­round­hole problem.JUSTICE ALITO:MR. MASSEY:JUSTICE ALITO:   Well, I ­­ I realize that.Yes.￼What do you do withYes, Your Honor.  There is a                            But I'm not sure why that ­­why it wouldn't make sense to read two different termsin the same sentence to mean two different things.8￼1 MR. MASSEY: Well ­­2 JUSTICE ALITO: The persons could be here,3 the citizens of Mississippi, who were damaged by the4 activity in question. The plaintiff ­­ plaintiffs,5 here, there's one named plaintiff. The plaintiffs can6 refer to ­­ to the person or entity or multiple people7 or entities who were named as plaintiffs.8 So why ­­ I don't see what the inconsistency9 is.10 MR. MASSEY: Well, because ­­ we think that11 our reading is better because, if you're applying the12 common question test, not to the persons who were in the13 case, those abstract unnamed, unknown consumers, you're14 not inquiring as to what their claims might be, you're15 applying the common question test only to the plaintiff,16 how could that ­­ how could that produce an17 administrable result? You could have consumers ­­ you18 never ­­ you would never know whether they presented19 common questions.20 And that ­­ that can't be what Congress was21 thinking of because, then, you would have a license for22 an unadministrable ­­ this is clearly a reference to the23 kind of Rule 23 inquiry where, as this Court has24 emphasized in class action case after class action case,25 there has to be a rigorous analysis to ensure that there914 Now, is that covered as a mass action or ­­ or15 MR. MASSEY: That, of course, is a16 case when it is not involving the government.17 think Navarro would, essentially, address that18 situation.not?differentBut we￼1 are actual common questions based on the ­­ the actual2 claims asserted.3 And ­­ and we think that there's ­­ that any4 other reading produces confusion, not just in this5 section, but also in the remand section ­­ the $75,0006 remand section of the statute. CAFA provides that, if a7 claim does not make ­­ does not reach the amount in8 controversy requirement, it has to be remanded to State9 court.10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if you have an11 executor, and he's administering an estate in which 10012 people have equal shares to the estate, and the estate13 has a claim. And he brings it on behalf of the estate.19 That's this Court's decision in 1980 that20 held that the trustees of a business trust were the sole21 real parties in interest and that the beneficiaries were22 not, even though they stood to get money as a result of23 the action, so I think that would address Your Honor's24 question.25 The text of the statute still would refer to10￼1 "plaintiff." So you would inquire, in that instance,2 whether under State law ­­ this is what happened in3 Navarro ­­ the Court inquired, does the executor have4 the legal authority to represent the beneficiaries as5 the sole plaintiff?6 And if he or she does, then you would have7 the single plaintiff situation, and you would not be8 under CAFA.9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Massey, you envision10 one proceeding, it could be a class action on behalf of11 the individuals, that doesn't require everybody that12 satisfy the amount in controversy, and then this action13 by the Attorney General, which does, among other things,14 seek restitution.15 Isn't there an overlap between those two16 claims? And how do we sort out ­­ you said ­­ at one17 point, I think you described the restitution as18 "disgorgement of ill­gotten gains."19 MR. MASSEY: Yes, Your Honor.20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, now, we have the21 consumers who were affected, they've already been paid.22 So how does it work for the Attorney General's suit?23 What is the impact of the class action that has already24 gone forward and been completed on the Attorney25 General's claim?11￼1 MR. MASSEY: Yes, Your Honor.2 The ­­ when the MDL judge entered the3 settlement in the class, she indicated her view that it4 would not preclude a parens case. Of course, it's open5 on remand for the defendants to argue that the consumer6 settlement bars the Attorney General's action. That7 will have to be adjudicated on the merits in8 Mississippi.9 States are free to adopt different rules10 about this. There is no case that we have found in11 Mississippi squarely addressing this. There have been a12 dozen or so parens cases over the last 10 years.13 There is a case, though, from the State of14 Washington, which is illustrative. It's actually on15 page 35 of the Red Brief ­­ from our friend's brief, and16 it's a case from the Washington Supreme Court in 1976,17 called Ralph Winters Chrysler Plymouth.18 In that case, the Washington Supreme Court19 encountered the situation where the State had sought20 restitution on behalf of consumers and sought to21 distribute the money to consumers, and consumers also22 brought separate damages actions.23 And the Washington court said, there was no24 double recovery, no preclusion problem, because the25 restitution remedies were public in nature, and the12￼1 private damages actions proceeded under different2 statutory authority for different claims.3 And whether Mississippi would adopt that4 approach, I don't know. But that illustrates, I think,5 ultimately, that these are questions of State law, and6 there is a longstanding tradition of restitution being a7 public remedy.8 After all, the government ­­ we've cited9 some cases in the brief involving everything from rent10 control to energy price regulation. The government11 brings ­­ the Federal government, as well as State12 governments, has brought restitution actions where it13 has not returned money to consumers, has sometimes14 done ­­ also sometimes has returned money, has ­­ but in15 all those cases, consumers never participate. They are16 never permitted to intervene.17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it would18 make ­­ it would make no sense for a defendant in a19 class action brought by consumers to ever settle the20 case. It's going to have to pay twice. It's going to21 have to pay consumers, and then it's going to have to22 pay you because you can, say, well, we want restitution,23 and we are not going to distribute it to the class24 members, but we're entitled to it.25 And I assume the amount of the restitution13settlement with consumers would not      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:bar a parens ­­Is there ­­ isunder Mississippi￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425is based on some estimate of the class ­­ the consumers'claims.MR. MASSEY: Well, the evidence ­­ the evidence of loss is relevant. But the law is actually well­settled in the lower courts ­­ there's not a decision of this Court, but ­­ that a consumer releasing his claim or her claim does not bar the State from proceeding with a public parens patriae action.      The defendants, when they settled, there isa little bit of disagreement in the brief, but the MDLjudge took the defendants as conceding that theirthere ­­ what is your understandinglaw, which you know a great deal more than I do, aboutany limits on a parens patriae action?      Let's say there was one purchaser inMississippi of LCDs, whatever, or two or three.  Couldyou bring a parens patriae action on their behalf?MR. MASSEY: That would be a very different case, Your Honor.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know, but I'm trying ­­MR. MASSEY: I think probably ­­ I think very unlikely. I don't ­­ it depends on the ­­ for14￼1 example, let me ­­ let me just be clear ­­2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Unlikely as a3 practical matter or as a legal matter?4 MR. MASSEY: Both. Both, Your Honor.5 There are ­­ there are ­­ there's no bright6 line. And after all, Snapp, which is the lodestar7 parens case from this Court in 1982, involved only 7878 workers. They were agricultural workers from Puerto9 Rico. And the Court ­­ one of the objections was this10 was not a sufficient quasi­sovereign interest to support11 a parens patriae case.12 And what this Court said was that you can't13 just look at numbers because those people represent a14 public interest. They were ­­ they alleged wage15 discrimination, and there was a deterrent effect. So16 that it wasn't really just 787. It was the entire17 population of Puerto Rico.18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there parens patriae19 actions where the State attorney general brings the20 action in what is really a suit on behalf of private21 parties? And, if so, do you call it private parens22 patriae?23 MR. MASSEY: Well, we don’t think that24 would be ­­ that is not a proper parens patriae case,25 and the attorney general ­­151 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      JUSTICE KENNEDY:patriae has to have ­­ you have to ask for restitution?MR. MASSEY: Well, no, no. The parens patriae case, for example, here involves injunctive relief, civil penalties, harm to the State as a purchaser, itself, of LCD panels.

I'm sorry. I'm repeating my25 question.18￼1 MR. MASSEY: Well, I think the answer is2 that the State has separate interests. The interest in3 the ­­ that the State has qua State, yes, it should4 bring cases where the public has been harmed. Of5 course ­­6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the answer is7 that there is nothing to prevent 50 attorneys general ­­8 51, from saying, every time there is a successful class9 action as to which somebody in my State purchased one of10 the items, we are going to file a parens patriae action,11 the complaint is going to look an awful lot like the12 class action complaint, and we want our money?13 MR. MASSEY: Well, I think that ­­ I think14 that isn't going to happen because the State ­­ well,15 the complaints are not the same. The State has its16 own ­­ sues in its own name, in its own rights, and, of17 course, the problem Your Honor is hypothesizing ­­18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that means that it19 could happen?20 MR. MASSEY: Well, it could happen, right.21 The State ­­ if the State has its own rights and its own22 interests, it should sue. The attorney general is accountable to the23   general public ­­24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, counsel,25 but you told me the State's own interest was in26 protecting its consumers, so it would be able to file1914 that15 than16 has.17they are not. The State has a broader interest simply the compensation interest that an individual￼1 this suit every time its consumers have been harmed, as2 demonstrated either through settlement or suit. That's3 the State interest, protecting its consumers.4 MR. MASSEY: Well ­­ if ­­ if a State ­­5 some States may adopt a different rule from Washington.6 As the Washington court said, the State ­­ the consumer7 claims would preclude a State attorney general action.8 If a State does not ­­ if the State legislature9 authorizes its attorney general to bring a suit when10 this11 that1213 are identical. They are not. And Snapp makes clearattorney general can identify harms to the Stateare separate from harms to consumers.Your Honor is saying that ­­ that the twoJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, as a matter of18 efficiency ­­ take the Chief Justice's hypo, the19 hypothetical and back it up. The moment the class is20 certified, why can't the attorney general join it and21 say, now, our interest is a little different, but it's22 so much the same that we want to join it, and we want to23 join it as parens patriae. Would that prevent its24 removal?25 MR. MASSEY: If ­­ if the State attorney20￼1 general was combined with thousands of individual2 claimants that, otherwise, would trigger CAFA, then ­­3 then CAFA ­­ then you would be forced into this whole4 case situation.5 The whole case test, which you'd need not6 reach here because the statute and the real7 party­in­interest tests are clear, but under the whole8 case test, you weigh whether the State has an ­­ the9 essential nature proceed ­­ the essential nature of the10 proceeding is that the State is the real party in11 interest.12 In the hypothetical you posit, I think it13 would be removable. Obviously, it turns on the14 particular facts, but, yes, if the State attorney15 general is in court with 1,000 individual claimants,16 that is probably a CAFA case.17 That hasn't ever ­­ has never happened,18 and in all of the districts outside the Fifth Circuit ­­19 because the Fifth Circuit is the only court that has20 adopted the rule that we ­­ that you're reviewing today,21 every other circuit court has held that CAFA does not22 extend to State parens patriae actions.23 In all of those cases, the attorneys general24 are not running around following class actions to try to25 piggyback on top of them. They are not joining other21￼1 class actions. Those ­­ those ­­2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you can't3 provide any reason why they wouldn't do so and,4 presumably, would start doing so with greater frequency5 if you prevail in this case.6 MR. MASSEY: Well ­­7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't have to8 be the same case. It can be the next case on the9 court's docket. The first case is In Re: LCD10 Litigation, and the second case is State of Mississippi11 v. LCD Manufacturers.12 MR. MASSEY: Well, we don't think so.

MASSEY: No, I don't think there has ­­ I don't think there had been in virtually any of them.

MASSEY: The general public. The ­­ doing two things. First, the ­­ as the amicus24￼1 genesis of it, it was really to address the California2 unfair competition law situation, where there are3 private attorneys general who are able to bring suits in4 the name of the general interest ­­ the general public.5 And they ­­ that was sort of the original genesis of it.6 It is a separate reason to reverse. We7 believe we meet it as well because it addresses a8 situation where a State is ­­ where any litigant, State9 or private, is representing the general public as10 opposed to individual claimants.11 And here, because restitution is a public12 remedy and because the individual claimants cannot be13 identified, the State is proceeding on the basis of the14 general public of Mississippi. If anyone ­­ the15 district court found ­­ it's in the Petition Appendix at16 49a and 50.17 The district court discusses the18 traceability problems ­­ I'm sorry, I said the Petition19 Appendix ­­ not the Joint Appendix.20 JUSTICE BREYER: Can you tell me, when you21 come back, where the money goes if you win?22 MR. MASSEY: Yes.

If I could reserve my time.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Massey.     Mr. Curran?    ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER M. CURRANON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSMR. CURRAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:     The attorney general's interpretation of themass action definition requires this Court to conclude that a mass action can only be one of the actions with 100 or more named plaintiffs and can never be a representative action. That interpretation cannot be squared with the statutory language, the purpose of the Act, and the structure of the Act.     Justice Kagan, you referred to the general26￼￼1 public provision. That provision expressly refers to2 the possibility of a representative action. In the3 parenthetical language in that provision and ­­ you4 know, I look at it on the ­­ in the Act form on 66a, but5 it's, of course, in the codification as well, on page6 79a of the Joint Appendix ­­ the parenthetical there7 says that ­­ that this exclusion does not apply in cases8 where the action is not on behalf of individual9 claimants or members of a purported class.10 So in other words, this exclusion under the11 mass action definition is contemplating a situation12 where there are individual claimants or members of a13 purported class. That ­­ that has to be beyond the14 named plaintiff.15 In another example, farther down in the16 exceptions to the mass action definition, there's a17 reference to Section 1407, which is the MDL transfer18 provision. There, again, there's reference to the19 possibility of a mass action being converted into a Rule20 23 class action.21 Those provisions don't make sense, unless22 it's possible for a mass action to be a representative23 action.24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how do you remand a25 case when it involves unnamed plaintiffs? Not a27￼1 proposed class because you ­­ if you have a proposed2 class, that could be persons, and you could identify3 those. But under your theory, what does a court do to4 figure out which of all of those unnamed people have5 claims above or below $75,000?6 MR. CURRAN: Well ­­ well, a couple of7 things. Number one, it ­­ it may well be that the mass8 action definition, a use of persons, that, of course,9 our position is that is unnamed. Those are real parties10 in interest of the claims. The reference to plaintiffs11 may well be, as the attorney general posits, the named12 plaintiffs.13 So the $75,000 requirement ­­ and Justice14 Ginsburg referred to this ­­ this as well, that ­­ that15 can make perfect sense. It's ­­ it's a way to make sure16 that the named plaintiffs, who, after all, are being17 given the keys to Federal discovery and maybe the18 ability to negotiate settlements, that they've got some19 skin in the game, that the plaintiffs, the named20 plaintiffs controlling the litigation, have 75,000 or21 more at stake.22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You know, this language23 is very reminiscent in what's in Federal Rule of Civil24 Procedure 20, the joinder rule.25 MR. CURRAN: Well ­­28￼1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:2 joinder rule, it uses "persons" and "plaintiffs"3 essentially in the same way. It's talking about persons4 being proposed plaintiffs, as opposed to unnamed5 people ­­6 MR. CURRAN:7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:8 class, in essence.9 MR. CURRAN:Your Honor, I see similarities 10 between this provision and the PSLRA, the Private11 Securities Litigation Reform Act, that reformed class12 actions in the securities context. And there, there13 was ­­ there were provisions requiring that the named14 plaintiff be a prominent victim of the alleged fraud.15 And ­­ and here, I think it's got a similar16 idea, that we want to make sure that the named17 plaintiffs have that kind of stake. And this is an18 important point because I think there's been some19 suggestion that this is unwieldy or does it make sense,20 if all the claimants under 75,000 get remanded.21 But recall this Court's jurisprudence on22 supplemental jurisdiction. Allapattah allows for23 supplemental jurisdiction in a situation like this,24 where certain plaintiffs do not satisfy the25 jurisdictional minimum. As long as there are some that29And if I look at theWell ­­       ­­ or the proposed1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425do, the district court has discretion to allow thosethat don't to stay in the same action.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It seems that that would be hard to invoke that case when a statute commands differently.MR. CURRAN: Well, I mean, I don't see ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In that case, it's in the ­­ in the absence of statutory language that requires remand.MR. CURRAN: Well ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I ­­ I'm hard­pressed to think that we can be exercising supplementaljurisdiction in a case where Congress has expressly spoken and said you can't or shouldn't.MR. CURRAN: Well, I don't understand that because Section 1367 says supplemental jurisdiction shall exist, unless it's expressly provided otherwise in a Federal statute.     And this Court, interpreting similarlanguage in the Breuer case, which is cited in thepapers, said "expressly" means it's got to be direct,it's got to be explicit, it has to be inescapable.So I would submit that this language aboutthe 75,000, that does not preclude supplemental jurisdiction. In fact, I think that ­­ that argument is30￼￼1 foreclosed by Breuer.2 JUSTICE GINSBURG:3 the individual claims were settled in the ­­ in the4 class action, so if there ­­ if there are no individual5 claimants to be ­­ to be represented, why doesn't this6 end up being a claim where only the State of Mississippi7 has a stake because the individuals that the State might8 have been representing have already been satisfied, so9 if this is ­­10 MR. CURRAN: There are ­­ there are a couple11 of aspects to this. First of all, our position, of12 course, is that the Mississippi statute requires that13 the money goes to the Mississippi citizens and that the14 attorney general here is basically suing as a15 representative or a conduit for those citizens.16 The fact that those citizens, many of those17 citizens, not all of them, the fact that many of them18 have settled and have resolved the claims in the19 multidistrict litigation, that means that there is going20 to be a fight in one court or another ­­ we think it21 should be in a Federal court; the attorney general22 thinks the State court ­­ over what the preclusive23 effects are of that prior settlement.24 We view this case as nothing more than an25 attempt to double dip. It's the same ­­31In this particular case,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE BREYER:that in a ­­ maybe it's changed since I knew the law in this area.

LCD panels, which we now take for granted and are4 ubiquitous, back then, were just an emerging technology.5 And for that, I cite to the attorney6 general's brief at page ­­ their complaint, page 32a of7 our cert ap, paragraph 104, which acknowledges that LCDs11 understand a complaint where they have taken 10012 individuals, or 102, and they list them as plaintiffs,13 and they don't call it a class action. And that would14 fall right within the meaning of mass action, if the15 numbers are right.16 MR. CURRAN: That's right.17 JUSTICE BREYER: But if we take18 your approach and depart from that mechanical, but19 simple ­­ simply administered interpretation, what is20 worrying me, and perhaps you can help me with that, is21 that there are perhaps all kinds of State actions where22 one of the motivating reasons is ­­ behind the lawsuit23 is some person hurt our citizens.24 And so, now, we will get into the instantly25 interesting, but very difficult question of, well, when37￼1 you say hurt your citizens, do you mean hurt them by2 giving them rise to an independent cause of action for3 each of them, who we don't know who they are, and we4 don't know if the statute of limitations has run to5 some, and we don't know if others have other6 disabilities; but, nonetheless, we're not certain this7 suit is entirely for that, it may be mixed up with other8 things.9 Do you see the problem once I start down10 your road?11 MR. CURRAN:12 JUSTICE BREYER:13 clear and simple.14 MR. CURRAN:15 in our position,16 is the inclusion17 Mississippi law,18 citizens, and it's their money. If ­­ if that claim19 wasn't in this action ­­20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That seems to be ­­ that21 seems to be disputed because I understood Mr. Massey to22 say that the restitution claim would go to the State.23 And you say that that ­­ the restitution couldn't go to24 the State.25 MR.

CURRAN: Well, the Mississippi statute10 is clear. The attorney general cited that. The case11 law is clear on that. So ­­ and the Fifth Circuit found12 that Mississippi law required the money to go to the13 individuals. I think this Court should defer to those14 prior rulings of ­­ of those courts.15 And ­­ so basically, back to the statutory16 language ­­ and by the way, parens patriae is such a17 loose label that's thrown around. The ­­ the attorney18 generals seem to raise that up as a Latin shield of some19 kind, suggesting that, as long as they invoke that term,You can hold him to that,or ­­ but that seemed to be not for this Court. he says it, I guess ­­MR.

Okay?     Also, if there's a big pollution problemor ­­ or some public nuisance or some other thing likethat, where ­­ where there's no identifiable victims,but the public as a whole is injured, that ­­ thatprobably is a quasi­sovereign claim.JUSTICE SCALIA: What ­­ what do you do about this ­­ this language in the definition? I haven't heard you explain it.     It ­­ it says ­­ it means any ­­ mass actionmeans "any civil action in which monetary relief claimsof 100 or more persons are proposed to be tried jointlyon the ground that the plaintiffs' claims involve commonquestions of law or fact."Now, they're not proposed to be triedjointly here on that ground. They're being tried jointly on the ground that the suit is being brought by the attorney general under this State statute.MR. CURRAN: Well, I ­­ I view that language as contemplating a Rule 23 type analysis.40￼1 MR. CURRAN: Okay. And in this case, we've2 got a State attorney general who's suing, not only for3 the consumers, but also for himself, right? He's got4 propriety claims in there. He's also suing on ­­ for5 all the counties and municipalities in Mississippi.6 I think a basis for his combination of those7 claims in a single lawsuit is the inescapable8 commonality of fact and maybe law in those claims. So9 I ­­ I do think that it ­­ it satisfies that language.10 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Curran, really, do11 you ­­ are you saying that, as a matter of State law,12 that, in this suit, the attorney general has to make a13 proposal that ­­ that the plaintiff ­­ that ­­ that he14 can bring the suit on the grounds that the plaintiffs'15 claims involve common questions of law or fact and that16 that proposal has to be adjudicated by the Court?17 MR. CURRAN: I think, Justice Kagan, that18 the attorney general has already done that. I think19 that his complaint, beginning on the first page, says,20 I'm bringing this claim on behalf of purchases by the21 State and by its citizens of these LCD panels, and it's22 a single complaint. So I think ­­ I think ­­23 JUSTICE KAGAN: But he does not have to show24 any common questions of law or fact in the typical way25 that we demand. I mean, that's actually a really41￼1 demanding showing that we have forced lawyers to make in2 the class action context. All that the attorney general3 has to do is to stand up and say, I have a State4 interest in protecting my citizens and in deterring5 improper behavior, and here is my substantive right.6 MR. CURRAN: Well, I guess ­­ I suppose we7 could move for bifurcation to separate the ­­ the8 proprietary claims from the claims on behalf of9 citizens, and then he would say, no, it makes sense to10 keep them all together. But ­­ but the ­­ the11 sequencing of those arguments, I don't think should be12 dispositive here.13 By filing a complaint, again, I invoke14 Rule ­­ Rule 42 of the Code of Federal Civil Procedure.15 JUSTICE KAGAN: I guess I don't understand16 the bifurcation point. It seems to me that what the17 attorney general is saying is he has a set of claims.18 They're his claims on behalf of the ­­ the populace,19 but ­­ but to further State's own interests.20 And there ­­ there's none of this Rule 2321 kind of business about common questions of law or fact.22 So it's not a question of ­­ you know, one set of claims23 or another set of claims, now or later. He has a claim.24 That's all he has.25 MR. CURRAN: Well, certainly, he ­­ he at421 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425least is attemptingvarious individualscommonality, right?claims out, I mean,to combine the claims of all thein the State on the grounds of  I mean, even if you separate hisit's ­­ the reason is ­­￼JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose it's a given that we all concede that the complaint is both for private­named persons and for restitution. Both. What result?MR. CURRAN: Well, certainly, it's ­­ it's a mass action in that circumstance because restitution, under Mississippi law, is for those specified individuals.JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, the rest of my hypothetical, part of the restitution goes to the State.MR. CURRAN: Well, then, again, the statutory language says if it's a civil action ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Where's the language?MR. CURRAN: Well, it's at the beginning of the mass action definition. You can look at it on either 65(a) and 66(a) or 79(a).JUSTICE KENNEDY: I have 79.MR. CURRAN: Okay. 79(a), "Mass action means any civil action in which monetary relief claims of 100 or more persons." So as long as you've got a qualifying claim, then the civil action's removable.43￼1 And it doesn't matter if there are additional claims or2 extraneous claims.3 So the ­­ the claim here for restitution on4 behalf of Mississippi citizens is, in and of itself,5 enough to make this a mass action.6 And, again ­­ and, Justice Kagan, maybe this7 is getting back to ­­ to your point. I refer to the8 references to representative actions in the ­­ in the9 General Public Provision and in the 1407 provision that10 inescapably mean that ­­ that this provision can apply11 to representative actions.12 Maybe that doesn't satisfy your commonality13 point, but ­­ but it gets part of the way there.14 JUSTICE KAGAN: And this is the main15 provision where they're trying to define what mass16 action means. And I take your point that there are ­­17 there's some slippage between this provision and the18 various provisions that it refers back to because those19 provisions ­­ we're talking about class actions, and20 this one is talking about mass actions.21 But this is the essential definition. And22 this one seems to be pointing to a very different kind23 of suit, one in which there are 100 individual claims24 that ­­ that 100 people seek to have joined in which a25 court is going to make a determination about whether441 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425those 100 individual claims have questions of common lawor fact.MR. CURRAN: If that's all this statute was meant to reach, that would have been such an easy statute to write. Instead of this more convoluted language, it could have just said if it's a civil action in which 100 or more named plaintiffs are asserting monetary relief claims for joint ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that would have required this Court ­­JUSTICE KAGAN: That's essentially what it says. I mean, the only ­­ the only thing it doesn't say in what you just said is that it says persons, insteadof named plaintiffs. But then, if you read the sentence, it's pretty clear that persons and plaintiffs are the same.MR. CURRAN: Well, how ­­ well, first of all, how do you explain ­­ I don't mean to pose a question to you ­­ it's inexplicable that the word "persons" ­­JUSTICE KAGAN: I might not answer it. (Laughter.)MR. CURRAN: It's ­­ it's inexplicable thatCongress would use the word "persons" and then, 12 wordslater, use "plaintiffs," if it signifies the exact same45￼￼1 thing and then continue to use the term "plaintiffs"2 throughout.3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But isn’t your4 proposal mean that before someone can remove, they have5 to decide whether the class is certifiable?6 MR. CURRAN: No.7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:8 to decide whether these plaintiffs are actually going to9 be plaintiffs and part of this class until you decide10 the class question. If you use the word "persons" and11 you use the language of the statute, it's the class12 that's being proposed. It's the named plaintiffs and13 the class that's being proposed of persons that are14 being proposed to be tried together.15 MR. CURRAN: There's another provision in16 here that is incorporated into the mass action ­­ you17 know, you will recall that if something qualifies as a18 mass action then the provisions dealing with class19 actions apply as well. And sub­part 8, which is found20 at the bottom of 77a, specifically says, "This21 subsection shall apply to any class action before or22 after the entry of a class certification order by the23 court with respect to that action."24 So it's ­­ what this statute is addressing25 is possible class actions. And, in fact, I think ­­ I46Because you're not going1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425think it makes sense to ­­ to view this ­­ thisstatutory question in light of the overriding statutorypurpose here.And, Justice Breyer, you address this inyour opinion in Standard Fire. The driving force behind this statute was to put interstate claims of national importance into Federal court, to provide the option ofa Federal forum. And in that case, in Standard Fire, this Court unanimously examined the statutory question there through that lens.Here ­­ so Congress dealt with class actions proper, if you will, under Rule 23, in the class action section. And then it's got the mass action section, which is inescapably designed to catch other devices that have the same problems.JUSTICE SCALIA: Sometimes, Congress doesn't do it right, you know?(Laughter.)JUSTICE SCALIA: Sometimes, they try to catch everything, but the language they use doesn't do it.it.MR. CURRAN:JUSTICE KAGAN:MR. CURRAN: But, here, I think it does do    But more than that ­­ And if there are competing47￼￼1 interpretations, then that purpose should drive the2 decision.3 JUSTICE KAGAN: But more than that,4 Mr. Curran, is that there was actually a considered5 effort by the attorneys generals here to take themselves6 out of this statute ­­7 MR. CURRAN: And they failed.8 JUSTICE KAGAN: ­­ and that that ­­ well,9 you say they failed, and ­­ I mean, that's the statutory10 question. But it's not just Congress didn't do it right11 this time. It was that there was a very serious effort12 to get attorneys general out of this statute. And13 that's ­­ and ­­ you know, it seems to me that they did14 pretty well.15 MR. CURRAN: No, no, no, no. No. They made16 their proposal to ­­ to modify the statute after the Act17 was in this form. They saw the Act in this form ­­ and18 including Attorney General Hood sent a letter to19 Congress saying this is going to infringe upon our20 rights to parens patriae cases. That amendment21 sponsored by Senator Pryor failed.22 So I ­­ I think the only conclusion that can23 be drawn from that is that Attorney General Hood and24 many of his counterparts in other States saw this25 problem, saw this ­­ this threat.481 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Now, a response that some on the Senate￼floor gavenecessary.is becausealready protected, through the local controversy ruleand through the general public exception.to that proposal was it's not really  But the reason it was not really necessarythe bona fide interests of the State were     Congress did not intend for State attorneysgeneral to be able to use their offices to hire outsidecounsel ­­ out­of­State outside counsel, to copycat aclass action complaint from an     JUSTICE GINSBURG:didn't, but if you look at thethe definition of mass action?new subsection D­11, "expands the jurisdiction over suits that are brought on behalf of numerous" ­­ numerous ­­ "named plaintiffs." "Numerous named plaintiffs."MR. CURRAN: Yes, I am familiar with that sentence in that Senate report. I am also aware that that Senate report was issued and dated a week or ten days after Senate ­­ after President Bush signed this Act, so I question its value and its credibility.JUSTICE SCALIA: You mean it's contrived legislative history? I can’t imagine.(Laughter.)MR. CURRAN: But ­­ but even if it somehow49MDL, bring it again ­­ Maybe ­­  maybe theycommittee report, what is  And it is, under this￼1 could be considered, I don't think that ­­ that sentence2 is definitional. That, certainly, is one alternative3 to ­­ to conventional class actions that Congress was4 concerned about.5 Our point is it wasn't the only one.6 Congress was trying to close loopholes and trying to7 prevent abuses, and a miserly interpretation of the8 class ­­ of the mass action definition would undermine9 that ­­ that purpose.10 Now, in my remaining time perhaps, not ­­11 Justice Kagan, at the end of12 carve­out in the statute for13 even though that was sought.14 some sensitivity for federalism concerns.15 It's got an exception for situations where16 States are the primary defendants ­­ or State officials17 are the primary defendants. There is also a18 notification to State attorneys general when there's a19 settlement of a class action.20 Those kinds of provisions show that Congress21 was trying to be sensitive, and it was horse trading, it22 was cutting deals, it was log rolling, coming up with an23 Act here that was at once sensitive to federalism24 concerns, but also trying to solve the very real abuses25 that it had identified.50the day there was noattorney general actions,But the Act does reflect￼1 And on the federalism point, the attorney2 general's brief has a lot of citations to Eleventh3 Amendment issues, and some of this Court's precedents4 dealing with State sovereign immunity. I submit that5 those precedents and that Amendment deal only with6 situations where the State is a defendant.7 And here, where we are talking about the8 State as a plaintiff ­­ and the only intrusion we are9 talking about is removal from State court to Federal10 court, that is not on the same playing field as the11 authorities relied on by the attorney general.12 A couple of other things. There was a13 suggestion in the reply brief that the complaint here14 was not, in fact, a copycat case ­­ a copycat complaint,15 but instead, was a summary of the Federal indictments,16 and that that explains the eerie similarity between the17 class action complaint and the attorney general's18 complaint. That ­­ that's just factually not right.19 The ­­ some companies who were defendants,20 like my client, Toshiba, was never charged or convicted21 of anything in this case, yet we're a defendant in this22 case, and that's because we were a defendant in the23 class action case that was copied.24 And, in fact, the indictments against some25 companies bear very little resemblance to the complaint511 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that the attorney general has filed here, in terms ofthe duration of the conspiracy and the subject matter ofthe products that are alleged ­­ were allegedlyprice­fixed.     Unless there are any further questions,thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Curran.     Mr. Massey, you have four minutes remaining.    REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. MASSEYON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. MASSEY: Thank you.Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please theCourt:     The issues that I'd like to raise onrebuttal are limited. The ­­ the most important thing is that jurisdictional schemes should be simple, administrable, predictable.     The simplest route ­­ the simplestinterpretation is the one we have shown, that these ­­the statute is directed at actual plaintiffs withconcrete claims that are proposed to be tried jointly.The only thing our friends on the other side have pointed out is the use of the ­­ is the word "persons." Justice Sotomayor is 100 percent correct52￼￼1 that the word "persons" is basically ­­ is an echo of2 Rule 20, of the joinder rule, which also refers to3 persons and plaintiffs.4 So the fact that Congress used the word5 "person" once in a mass action definition simply6 confirms our point that the statute is really directed7 at the mass joinder, mass consolidation situation, and8 does not have anything to do with actions by sovereign9 States.10 Their primary argument seems to be that the11 attorney general doesn't really own the claims in this12 case, that these are claims that are owned by the13 citizens of Mississippi. That is a classic State law14 issue, which should be raised on remand in the State15 court. A very similar ­­16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did not the Fifth Circuit17 decide that State law question?18 MR. MASSEY: No, Your Honor, we don't19 believe so. That the Fifth Circuit ruled on its ­­ the20 interpretation of CAFA and said that, for purposes of21 the statute, the claims were removable. But it didn't22 decide the attorney general's authority to sue in the23 name of the State under the statutes which give him that24 authority.25 The ­­ we don't think the Fifth Circuit53￼1 decided that question, and I read the Red Brief at page2 33 as saying the attorney general's authority is not at3 issue here, that we assume the attorney general has the4 authority to bring the claims in the complaint as he5 pled them, which is the restitution claimed in the name6 of the State.7 And the ­­ there was a decision in8 Mississippi in 2006, the only really relevant authority.9 It's called the BASF case. And there, a lower court in10 Mississippi, the Chancery Court, upheld the attorney11 general's authority to bring a very similar parens12 patriae case.13 JUSTICE BREYER: What he says is ­­ in the14 complaint, it says ­­ "prays that the defendant be15 ordered to restitute any and all monies for the16 purchases of its citizens."17 All right. Now, you look at the statute he18 quoted, the Mississippi statute, and it says there is19 the authority to have restitution to restore to any20 person in interest any monies which may have been21 acquired by means of a practice prohibited.22 So he says that sounds as if what you're23 talking about is you want restitution, though, given to24 the State, the restitution is for individual purchases25 of individual citizens because there could be no other.54     JUSTICE BREYER:its citizens.     MR.

MASSEY:    Yes, and the purchases ofSo the State will get the    I know they'll get theRight.    ­­ but he's saying, to get     JUSTICE BREYER:the money, you have to say which money.￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425And, therefore, you have a list of people in mind, oryou must find one, where there were particularindividual purchases, by individual citizens, and getthat restitution into the treasury.All right. Now, that ­­ I think something like that was his argument, and I wanted to know what you were going to say. Are you going to give up these last five words, "and the purchases of its citizens"?JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's what I understood the Fifth Circuit to have held.MR.

Something like that is his argument. And I just wanted to know your response.MR. MASSEY: Well, the ­­ the evidence will be proven through statistical aggregate evidence, rather than a list of names.
