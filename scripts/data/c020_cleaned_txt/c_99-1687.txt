Frederick Vopper.          Mr. Collins.           ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEREMIAH A. COLLINS             ON BEHALF OF PRIVATE PETITIONERS          MR. COLLINS:  Mr. Chief Justice and may itplease the Court:          In a society that values personal freedom andautonomy, there is a vital interest in securing theability of individuals to exclude unwanted intruders fromtheir private activities.  And where the private activityconsists of speech there is a particularly vital interestin preventing intrusion so that individuals may conducttheir private communications freely and securely.  And forthat reason, Congress and the legislatures of virtuallyevery state in this country have made it unlawful to gainaccess to a private communication.          QUESTION:  Well, let me stop you right there andask you why should the question of whether privateinformation about someone is published turn on how theinformation was obtained?  Why don't you just look at whatit is and focus there?  Why does it become secondarily4                                                                                             1    such an important interest to focus on how it was 2    obtained? 3              MR. COLLINS:  Because I think Justice O'Connor 4    what Congress and the state legislatures and in some 5    respects the common law have recognized that separate and 6    apart from the question about whether there is certain 7    information that is so private that it should or shouldn't 8    be revealed which raises content discrimination problems 9    among other things, there is a vital interest in people10    having private places in their lives where a stealthy11    intruder cannot come in whether or not the individual --12              QUESTION:  Well -- well, it ought to turn on the13    public significance perhaps of the information and14    presumably the state can prevent unlawful tapping of wires15    directly and get at the bad actor, but why should it16    extend to the subsequent user who didn't do anything17 wrong?18              MR. COLLINS:  Because Your Honor, as Congress19    and some forty states have reasoned, if there is intrusion20    into an individual's private communications, a tap, a bug,21    a scanner, whatever, and then what is obtained is22    broadcast to all the world or under these statutes23    exploited in any other way, the same interests that are24    harmed by the initial intrusion are harmed again and all25    the more severely because in essence, you have invited in5                                                                                                                                 1    this instance a hundred thousand people to eavesdrop, and 2    as petitioner Bartnicki stated in her deposition, when 3    she, having no idea that anyone had intruded into her 4    communication with Mr. Kane, when she heard on the radio 5    it being broadcast she felt that she had been violated in 6    front of a hundred thousand people and that is true I 7    believe independent of the content.  If I, riding home 8    today, hear a radio station broadcasting a conversation 9    where I convey my grocery list to my wife or vice versa, a10    feel a violation of my person autonomy. Just as if someone11 --1213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  But you want to say that if I alsohear that and tell my wife that I'm committing a crime.That's what this statute says.          MR. COLLINS:  If you --          QUESTION:  Because the statute goes downstreamwithout end.  Now maybe there'll be some creativesuggestion for when it's in the public domain or somethinglike that.  But that's not what the statute says.          MR. COLLINS:  Well, the far downstream uses arenot at issue --          QUESTION:  Oh, but it seems to me with allrespect that they are because the respondents can raisethose issues on an overly-broad statute under theThornhill doctrine even if this does not apply to them.6                                                                                             1              MR. COLLINS:  Well they -- I think Your Honor, 2    first of all they can't raise it when they they've brought 3    explicitly an as-applied challenge and at no point in the 4    litigation until this Court have they started raising the 5    other applications that they now posit, and secondly this 6    Court in The Florida Star and all the preceding case 7    emphasize that in the very difficult area and it is 8    difficult of conflicts between privacy-type interests and 9    First Amendment interests the Court should decide only as10    much as it needs to decide in a particular case.11              QUESTION:  I suppose it's very difficult, is it12    not, to enforce the prohibition against wire tapping13    against the person who actually -- who actually does the14    tapping.  In other words, that person is usually not going15    to come to light or publicize the thing.  The way that16    person does the work is to push it on to somebody else who17    will do the disclosure.18              MR. COLLINS:  That is certainly true in this19    very case --20              QUESTION:  Which is what happened here, right?21              MR. COLLINS:  That's what happened in this case.22              QUESTION:  An anonymous tape was sent to the23    radio station which is almost always the way it will24 happen. 25                                                                                                                                MR. COLLINS:  And Congress -- that is what                   7 1    happened in this case and Congress was told in both 1968 2    and '86 that it happens very frequently.  I think -- 3              QUESTION:  Well, let's change the facts just a 4    little bit.  Suppose what the conversation revealed was 5    not some conversation about we're going to have to commit 6    some violent acts but let's suppose it revealed that in 7    fact, a murder had been committed because of this very 8    situation.  And the anonymous tape then is passed on to 9    the police and your going to punish the person who passed10    on that tape when a very serious crime has been committed.11    Now how is the public interest served by that?12              MR. COLLINS:  Your Honor, I believe the same --13     I think there are two responses to that.14              QUESTION:  Oh, I actually had that very15    situation as a trial court judge in a murder case.  I had16    a hard time understanding how the public interest was17    served by punishing the person who passed on the18    information.19              MR. COLLINS:  I think there are two responses to20    the question, Your Honor.  The first is there is in the21    law, as the Government's reply brief points out a doctrine22    of necessity which in some narrow circumstances, and it's23    not precisely clear how far it extends, in essence24    privileges what would otherwise be a violation of a25    statute.  If the statute doesn't rule that defense out.8                                                                                                                                 1    So an action to protect life and limb may be an exception. 2 3              The second answer though, is that -- because it 4    is a very hard question, but there are -- when there are 5    content-neutral laws that say that because of the way in 6    which information came to someone, that information is not 7    to be revealed be it these statutes or be it for example a 8    protective orders in the Seattle Times, that generally the 9    fact that what was revealed is a matter of public10    importance does not automatically say that the interests11    that are being served by the content-neutral law that says12    either you should not have this information at all or you13    should not be able to use it, they don't necessarily give14    way.  And that's indeed if this exact tape had been15    received in discovery I believe under Seattle Times the16    press could again be prevented from making use and17    publishing the tape.  And the key is that --18              QUESTION:  Well, but in Seattle Times and19    Rhinehart and in the Aguilar case, we were controlling the20    people who received the information under a court order.21    They were within our immediate control.  The Rhinehart22    case would be as if somebody surreptitiously took this23    tape and gave if to a person and then that person gave it24    to the newspapers.25              MR. COLLINS:  But in both instances, though,9                                                                                                                                 1    Justice Kennedy, we are saying that a person has 2    information, it is of public importance, and because of 3    interest bound up in the way in which they received it, we 4    will not allow them to distribute.  The interests are 5    different granted.  And the Court did not say in Seattle 6    Times that the fact that this information is coming in 7    discovery means there is no First Amendment concern. 8    Quite the contrary.  The Court said the Court has to 9    conclude that there will be harm to privacy interests and10    the like if it is disclosed and the Court applied11    intermediate scrutiny.  But the Court said that because of12    interests of the justice system that are served by being13    able to limit disclosure of that which is given in14    discovery we can tolerate the fact that the press cannot15    tell the public something of great importance.16              Here we again have very vital interests,17    different interests, but the interests of people knowing18    that they will not come home some day and have a hundred19    thousand people hearing a phone call that they made. And I20    submit that what unites those cases and in essense solves21    the problem here is the fact that we're dealing with a22    totally content-neutral statute and one which as applied23    does not unduly interfere with the ability of the press --24              QUESTION:  But merely because it's content-25    neutral does not mean you can't regulate it.  This isn't10                                                                                                                                 1    seditious.  It isn't obscene.  And there is no category 2    that I know of which allows you to regulate it. It's 3    intercepted which is now going to be a new category under 4    your rule and there is no precedent for that. 5              MR. COLLINS:  Your Honor, I don't know of any 6    case in which this Court has struck down a statute which 7    is content-neutral in the full sense that this one is 8    except in some rare circumstances where the Court in 9    essence has determined that too much speech is going to be10    supressed.  In other words, we are not saying, we don't11    have to say, that some of this is a category of speech of12    no First Amendment significance whatsoever.  What we are13    saying is that there are important governmental interests14    harmed not only by the interception but by the disclosure.1516              If those are then taken into account through a17    content-neutral statutory regime, we believe and we have18    argued that that in essence exhausts the First Amendment19    concerns both as to level of scrutiny and as to satisfying20    scrutiny as long as we are not in one of the rare21    situations such as City of Ladue, for example, where the22    Court would say granted it's content-neutral, but you're23    just restricting too much speech and we think in this case24    the question would be, the concern about whether this25    content-neutral law -- and let me just pause for a moment                                  11                                                                                                                                 1    because I think it's essential to emphasize when I say 2    content-neutral this law is neutral in a way that 3    absolutely requires a determination of content neutrality. 4    It's neutral as to viewpoint.  It's neutral as to subject 5    matter.  It doesn't allow liability to turn on 6    disagreement with a particular message.  It doesn't even 7    target speech specifically.  It targets all uses of what 8    has been unlawfully intercepted, so there is no case in 9    this Court that would characterize this law as content-10 based.11              QUESTION:  Is this an as-applied challenge in12    this suit --13              MR. COLLINS:  Absolutely.14              QUESTION:  -- or is it attacking it facially?15              MR. COLLINS:  It's as applied, Your Honor.  And16    that's clear in the question certified in the court of17    appeals.  It's clear in the briefs below.  And it's clear18    from the fact --19              QUESTION:  Well, would there be a difference on20    an as-applied challenge if the person you're talking about21    is the person who made the wrongful tapping as opposed to22    the person who just passes it on?23              MR. COLLINS:  Well, certainly, the question in24    this case is properly presented as to whether the statute25    can apply to those who are not involved in the12                                                                                                                                1    interception.2345 result?6              MR. COLLINS:  We submit that it does not for two7    reasons.  That first of all, there is -- we are applying a8    content-neutral statute based on important government          QUESTION:  Well would it matter if it's anewspaper at the end of the day commenting on theinformation that's been disclosed?  Does that alter the 9    interests and secondly -- and I do think this is critical,10    we then have to ask ourselves is this one of the very rare11    cases in this Court's jurisprudence where one would say12    that even though a statute is totally neutral, doesn't13    lend itself to Government thought control, to supression14    of ideas in any way, it's not reshaping public debate,15    totally neutral, does it in some way restrict too much16    speech?  And one area where one would worry is, does it17    prevent the press from doing what it needs to do?  We18    believe this is not such a narrow -- one of those rare19    situations because as the Court says Branzburg --20              QUESTION:  Although this had to do with21    negotiations, did it not with a public school board in a a22    labor union context, you don't think that's sufficiently23    important to warrant newspaper discussion of it?24              MR. COLLINS:  We don't deny that matters of25    public concern are involved.  What we say is that under13                                                                                                                                 1    Branzburg, for example, the Court says that we know the 2    press could get important information of public concern 3    through wire tapping.  We know the press could get 4    important information of public concern by having a system 5    of private informants.  We say to the press, you cannot do 6    that.  Even if you know that behind that wall is someone 7    communicating matter of utmost public importance, you 8    can't pierce that wall.  So why then is it crucial to the 9    press to say we can't ourselves go out and try to obtain10    this information of public concern through wire tapping11    but if serendipitously some third person has done it, it's12    vital us to be able to then use the information.  And even13    the amici, Your Honors, do not submit --14              QUESTION:  Well, the difference is in one case15    they're acting unlawfully and in the other case they have16    information that they just came across because someone17    else acted unlawfully and that'd be a big difference?18              MR. COLLINS:  I think in the final analysis, no,19    Your Honor, because as I understand Florida Star and this20    Court's jurisprudence, the question here is whether there21    are sufficient Government interests to justify a content-22    neutral application of these laws in this manner.  It's23    not a question of is the press a bad actor or not to be24    punished.  One has to be concerned undoubtedly will the25    press, by the rule that we advocate, be chilled from14                                                                                                                                 1    performing its function and we argue no because as we have 2    briefed the way that the reason to factor can be construed 3    under this statute, but I don't think that the proper 4    analysis of the issues here can ultimately turn simply on 5    did the press violate a law when they received the 6    information or not, otherwise of course Congress could 7    take a jab with the pen and say, oh, and also it's illegal 8    -- to be receiving any that has been intercepted. 9              QUESTION:  Mr. Collins, may I ask you if I10    understand your First Amendment boundaries theory11    correctly, that Pentagon Papers which was a prior12    restraint case, if Congress so provided, the Times or13    anybody else who published the materials could after the14    publication be held responsible in money damages.15              MR. COLLINS:  Possibly, Your Honor, but Pentagon16    Papers would be different not only for the reason you gave17    but because it's arguably content-based.  It's the18    Government itself determining what information by subject19 matter --20              QUESTION:  A general statute.21              MR. COLLINS:  Well if it applied to -- but it22    wouldn't be general because it's by definition talking23    only about Government information which is arguably a24    content base.25              QUESTION:  Yes.15                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. COLLINS:  And it runs -- there you do getinto of the risk of shaping debate.          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Collins.          General Waxman, we will hear from you.              ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN           ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER UNITED STATES          GENERAL WAXMAN:   Mr. Chief Justice and may itplease the Court:          I think perhaps I'll -- I've had enoughquestions in the first 15 minutes to keep me fullyoccupied --          QUESTION:   So you don't want anymore.          (Laughter.)          MR. WAXMAN:  I would welcome any and allquestions as always.  I want to start first by -- I dowant to address the Pentagon Papers point and the pointthat Justice Kennedy made about using information obtainedon the radio to talk with his own wife or make his owndecisions and Justice O'Connor's question about whatdifference does it make how get it.  I first want to makethe point because there is been some suggestion I thinkhere that it is the Government's position that the FirstAmendment does not -- the First Amendment interests heredon't require heightened scrutiny.  That's not ourposition.  We do recognize that there is an important16                                                                                             1    burden on First Amendment rights here, but we submit that 2    the appropriate level of scrutiny is intermediate-level 3    scrutiny because this is a totally content-neutral law of 4    general applicability that protects fundamental values of 5    privacy and private speech and denies third parties 6    nothing that they otherwise would have had if the act's 7    prohibition on interception itself was fully effective --8 9              QUESTION:  General, isn't the problem with the10    easy analogy to the other intermediate-scrutiny cases that11    here there in effect is a complete suppression of speech,12    whereas in the paradigmatic intermediate-scrutiny cases,13    somebody can speak somewhere, sometime.  O'Brien can tell14    what he thinks about the draft without burning his card,15    you can speak at some other time or some other place in16    the time, place, and manner cases. That's not so here.17              MR. WAXMAN:  Well, I think that is so here, and18    I also think that that is not an accurate characterization19    of all the intermediate-scrutiny cases.  I mean, it was20    not true, for example, in Cohen v. Cowles Media or in21    Zacchini and Harper & Row.22              QUESTION:  But you also and I think you're right23    there but you also had a very different kind of general24    statute in Cohen and Cowles --25              GENERAL WAXMAN:  That's exactly right and that's17                                                                                                                                1 -- 2              QUESTION:  In contract law and not speech law. 3              GENERAL WAXMAN:  Right.  And that's why -- 4    that's why we think that unlike Cohen v. Cowles Media 5    where the Court applied no heightened First Amendment 6    scrutiny and the dissenters objected on that ground, we 7    think that heightened scrutiny is appropriate here, 8    because there is a restraint on speech.  But it is not a 9    restraint on -- with respect to any topic, any viewpoint,10    any speaker.  If these -- anybody who gets wire tapped11    information or information from a bug planted in my home12    or my conference room -- gets the information otherwise,13    the identical information is fully available for speech or14    other use.  In other words, what's missing here --15              QUESTION:  Well, it may be it, it may not be16    depending on other circumstances, but, I mean, there is no17    question that if we didn't have the neutrality that you18    emphasize this would be a much easier case.  It's still19    true that when you do the balancing, whether you call it20    intermediate scrutiny or you figure out some other level21    to put it on, you're -- what you've got to balance is that22    if this law is good, then the disclosure which apparently23    has no other source of information which is of concern to24    the public is absolutely forbidden and we've got to accept25    that as one of the prices that will be paid. Maybe as you18                                                                                                                                 1    say not in every case but it will be paid if the statute 2    is going to be enforced across the board. 3              GENERAL WAXMAN:  That is absolutely true and 4    that is why heightened scrutiny applies. It is our 5    submission that it's significant that if the same 6    information comes from any other source, it can be used or 7    disseminated with impunity which is another way I think, 8    of what I'm trying to suggest, which is that there is no 9    suggestion here, unlike the Pentagon Papers case, or the10    Florida Star line of cases of a censorial motive by the11    Government, an effort to take certain facts off the table,12    and the reason that the --13              QUESTION:  Yeah, yeah, but -- to say that we've,14    as your colleague did, it's very rare to strike down15    statutes that are content-neutral.  That's not accurate.16    Miami Press v. Tornado, the reply statute case -- taxes on17    newspapers are content-neutral, the parade cases are18    content-neutral.  What you're doing here is you're19    suppressing speech that is valuable to the public.20              GENERAL WAXMAN:  Justice Kennedy, I'm not21    suggesting that we win because intermediate-level scrutiny22    applies.  I have three reasons that I'd like to articulate23    why we think we do, but I certainly acknowledge the fact24    that the -- a restriction on speech under intermediate-25    level scrutiny may fail just as heightened scrutiny like19                                                                                                                                 1    in cases like Bursen v. Freeman and Austin v. Michigan 2    Chamber of Commerce can sometimes prevail.  My point here 3    is, and this goes to the distinction with the Pentagon 4    Papers case and I think to Justice O'Connor's initial 5    question about why we should care how the information came 6    to be, is that the knowing use of illegally intercepted 7    private expression implicates other constitutional values 8    as this Court recognized in Cox and Florida Star and in 9    particular the distinction between information that is10    leaked from the Government or otherwise that is leaked as11    the result of a failure of a trusted responsibility, which12    was at issue in Florida Star and perhaps at issue in13    Landmark and certainly was at issue in the Pentagon Papers14    case, where this Court has said repeatedly that in that15    instance, where we're talking about information that was16    not unlawfully obtained, but instead was disclosed to the17    public as a result of a failure of a trust relationship,18    there is quote, almost -- there are almost always less19    drastic means of resolving the problem, both because you20    can be more careful about who you trust, and secondly,21    there is a much smaller universe of potential violators.22    Here we're talking about an interception which almost by23    definition is impossible of detection.  People don't even24    know that their conversations at home or at work are being25    overheard, let alone who did it and this case is a perfect20                                                                                                                                1 -- 2              QUESTION:  My problem is that in order to make 3    this -- no one questions, we can assume that, that you can 4    punish the interceptor, but what you're doing is you're 5    taking a class of speech and saying this is now tainted 6    speech and it can't be repeated by anybody.  And there is 7    simply no precedent for that in the cases of this Court. 8              GENERAL WAXMAN:  Well, I don't think -- I do 9    understand your point Justice Kennedy, I would quarrel10    with your characterization of this as tainted speech that11    you can't do anything about.  Again, because it doesn't12    look at the topic or the subject or anything.  It simply13    says that if you know that this is the result of an14    illegal intrusion into a zone of conversational privacy,15    you cannot use it until it becomes publicly known.  And I16    also -- I'm not sure that it is fair to say that there is17    no precedent for taking speech like this off the table.  I18    think we have talked about Seattle Times and Cowles and19    Harper & Row and Zacchini but there is also the San20    Francisco arts case involving use of the word Olympic.21    There is trade secret law which relates to fact and not22    expression. There are grand jury secrecy rules and rules23    under the Conic Pickering test about what employers --24              QUESTION:  May I ask you a question?25              GENERAL WAXMAN:  -- and employees may or may not                                  21                                                                                                                                1 say. 2              QUESTION:  Mr. Solicitor General, the strongest 3    argument that I think Judge Pollack made in his dissent is 4    that you want to dry up the market for this sort of thing 5    so you get -- just sort of like child pornography and the 6    majority said, well, there's really no evidence that this 7    will accomplish that goal.  And I would kind of like you 8    to comment on that because it does seem to me that an 9    awful lot of this illegal activity will continue to go on10    by people who just use it for their own private illicit11    purposes no matter whether you apply this particular rule.12    And I think the scarcity of cases suggest that enforcing13    this rule really would not do very much to dry up the14    market but maybe you'd comment on that.15              GENERAL WAXMAN:  Well, I think that that's16    wrong; that is the scarcity of cases shows it because if17    you look at the cases, for example, that are reprinted in18    the appendix to our reply brief and in respondent Vopper's19    brief, a very large number of those cases involved use --20     at least if you take out the marital cases -- involved21    use by third persons, and the deterrence or disincentive22    point which is one of the three points that we make23    support the importance of the use and disclosure24    provisions as a means of protecting conversational25    privacy, I think, depends just by the way just as the22                                                                                                                                 1    statute's exclusionary rule in 2515 does, it depends on 2    the -- the common sense point that if you prohibit all 3    means of exploiting stolen information, whether they are 4    expressive means or not, you will lessen the incentive 5    materially for many people to engage in the interception. 6    Now, it's true there will be people who as a hobby just 7    like to eavesdrop or intercept other people's 8    conversations and the use -- 9              QUESTION:  General Waxman, what about the10    situation, this is broadcast over a radio station in11    Wilkes-Barre, as I understand it.  Now supposing the12    Wilkes-Barre newspaper wants to do a story about the fact13    that this was broadcast, how far down the line does it go?14              GENERAL WAXMAN:  Well, we think, as we indicate15    in our brief that both the meaning of the word disclose16    which is in the statute and the legislative history17    demonstrates that the statute no longer applies once it is18    public information or common knowledge.  And we also think19    -- we also think that -- well, that's our answer with20    respect to how far it goes, and it would also be an answer21    to Justice Kennedy --22              QUESTION:  I can't tell my next door neighbor?23              GENERAL WAXMAN:  Excuse me?24              QUESTION:  If I innocently hear this tape, and25    I'm the second one to hear it, but I just hear it at23                                                                                                                                 1    Yocum's house, then I can't tell my neighbor? 2              GENERAL WAXMAN:  That's the -- the statute 3    precludes that use of it.  It's not addressed in this 4    case, but the statute precludes all use of it.  Now -- 5              QUESTION:   I wouldn't think of doing -- 6              GENERAL WAXMAN:  Now, if there was -- 7              QUESTION:   I wouldn't think of doing that, of 8    course, if somebody sent me a tape that I knew had been 9    illegally taken, I certainly wouldn't run around talking10    to people about it.  That doesn't seem to be so11    outrageous.12              GENERAL WAXMAN:   Well I -- there has never been13    a case, a reported case which is --14              QUESTION:  And Justice Kennedy lives in my15    neighborhood, too.16              GENERAL WAXMAN:  There has never been a reported17    case in which there was either a prosecution or a civil18    suit brought here, and of course the plaintiffs in this19    case did not sue the school board members that were told20    about it.  But the point it seems to me, is that what21    Congress was trying to protect here was not private facts22    and not to restrain speech on its own, but to protect the23    sanctity of what we all know to be critical to our24    society, which is the ability to speak in an uninhibited25    candid fashion.  May I reserve the balance of my time.24                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  You may.  Mr. Goldstein.          MR. LEVINE:  Mr. Levine, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Mr. Levine, I'm sorry.                ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEE LEVINE         ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS VOPPER, ET AL.          MR. LEVINE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          Respondents are before the Court this morningbecause they disseminated to the public the contents of atelephone conversation in which the president of a publicteacher's union apparently threatened to blow off the thefront porches of the homes of members of the local schoolboard.  Petitioners contend that such an act of purespeech is not protected by the First Amendment becausethat information was at some prior time unlawfullyacquired by someone else.          QUESTION:  Well, I think -- I think that theother side would have acknowledged that if it was indeedit was a clear threat to blow off somebody's porches theremight have been an exception to the statute.  I don't wantto decide this case on the assumption that this was athreat to blow off somebody's  porch.  It's at leastambiguous in the record and if all you want is a decisionthat you can disseminate it if it's a threat to blow offsomebody's porch, I'll give you that, that's an easy case.25                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9But you want us to go beyond that and you want us to sayeven if it wasn't a threat to blow off somebody's porch,it can't be disseminated; isn't that correct?          MR. LEVINE:  So long as --          QUESTION:  Okay.  So let's forget about blowingup the porch.          MR. LEVINE:  Your Honor, I --          QUESTION:  Well, I think your argument is thatblowing off -- the willingness to blow off porches is amatter of some public concern in viewing the labor crisis.          MR. LEVINE:  That is correct, Your Honor, andthat is why I gave the context to explain why this speechthat was disseminated by the respondents here was truthfuland involved a matter of public concern.          QUESTION:  Now, I don't understand there to beany exception in the statute for speech that threatens toblow off somebody's porch.          MR. LEVINE:  That is correct Justice Stevens.On its face, the statute applies to any informationconcerning the content of an intercepted communication.And content is defined in the statute as any informationconcerning the substance, purport or meaning of that1011121314151617181920212223    communication.24 25          QUESTION:   And you would be content for aholding that says that a statute that does not contain26                                                                                            such an exception is unconstitutional; is that what you'reasking us for?          MR. LEVINE:  I'm asking Your Honors to apply the          QUESTION:   You want us to decide this case onthe basis that this statute does not have any exceptionfor threatened criminal action?          MR. LEVINE:  No, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  I didn't think so.          MR. LEVINE:  The except -- what it doesn't havean exception for, Your Honor, is the dissemination oftruthful speech about a matter of public concern.          QUESTION:  You really don't care whether you winor not, you just want to win on the right grounds, is thatwhat you want?          MR. LEVINE:  Your Honor, I'll take it any way Ican get it.          QUESTION:  I'm sure.          QUESTION:  Well then stop giving out your case.          MR. LEVINE:  But the principle that we'readvocating because it derives from this Court's case lawis the Daily Mail principle. And the Daily Mail principleholds that where, as here, a speaker has lawfully acquiredthe information he disseminates and that information isaccurate and involves a matter of public concern, his27                                                                                            1234    principle.5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425 1    speech is protected by the First Amendment, absent a 2    demonstrated need to vindicate an interest of the highest3 order. 4              QUESTION:  Why isn't my ability to speak over 5    the phone with some assurance of confidentiality an 6    interest of the highest order.  I mean you have speech 7    involved on both sides of this bear in mind.  That to the 8    extent the position you urge renders the enforcement of 9    the criminal prohibition against intercepting my telephone10    conversations less effective.  It inhibits my speech.  And11    indeed it does.  I mean I don't use my home -- what is it12    it-- wire free phone --13              THE SPEAKER:  Cordless.14              QUESTION:  -- whenever I talk to anything15    involving the court, because, you know, I don't know, I16    don't know who is picking it up.  And you're saying it's17    perfectly okay for somebody not only to pick it up but to18    publish it in the Washington Post so long as, you know, so19    long as they didn't actually do the tap, just make a tape20    and mail it to the Post.21              MR. LEVINE:  Your Honor, let me make clear it is22    not perfectly okay to pick it up.  That is violated by the23    statute.242528                                                                                                                                          QUESTION:  No, it is perfectly okay to give theperson who picked it up exactly what that person wanted, 1    that is, dissemination of my private conversations.  I -- 2    you enable the criminal to achieve the object of his 3    criminality. 4              MR. LEVINE:  And Your Honor, if there was any 5    act of collaboration between the criminal and the fence, 6    as has been called in some amicus briefs, then that person 7    may be held liable for his own conduct. 8              QUESTION:  There is no collaboration but this is 9    an essential instrument for the criminal's achieving what10    he wanted to achieve.  And that is disseminate to the11    world information which he has unlawfully obtained.  It12    doesn't seem to me unreasonable for the Government to say13    no, we're not going to let the criminal get the advantage14    of his criminality.  We do the same thing where the15    highest function of Government of all is involved, the16    criminal law.  We prevent information from being17    introduced, even told to the jury when it has been18    obtained illegally.  I find it --19              MR. LEVINE:  Justice Scalia, I'm not suggesting20    that it's not unreasonable, but that's not the standard21    when you're talking about prohibition on the dissemination22    of truthful speech about a matter of public concern.23              QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Levine, you agree that24    there is an exception for matters of the highest priority.25    How about our decision in Hill against Colorado last year,29                                                                                                                                 1    which involved, you know, protected speech on one hand but 2    said nonetheless the state could permit a strong interest 3    in privacy to triumph. 4              MR. LEVINE:  Your Honor, Hill versus Colorado 5    was a time, place or manner restriction, and the court, 6    because of that properly analyzed the case under 7    intermediate scrutiny.  This case is controlled by the 8    Daily Mail principle.  This statute, unlike the one at 9    issue in the Hill v. Colorado case, is a direct10    prohibition of speech itself.  It is not a time, place or11    manner restriction. It is not a regulation of conduct that12 has --13              QUESTION:  Well, it may nonetheless deserve14    intermediate scrutiny because of its content neutrality.15              MR. LEVINE:  Your Honor, I don't believe that16    content neutrality is a factor when you're talking about17    application of the Daily Mail principle.18              QUESTION:  Do you lose if intermediate scrutiny19    is applied?20              MR. LEVINE:  No, your Honor, we do not.  The21    statute does not even survive intermediate scrutiny.  And22    in that regard, let me get to a point that both Justice23    Scalia and the Chief Justice made earlier.  This notion of24    the laundering rationale somehow being enough to make the25    statute survive intermediate scrutiny.  That rationale, we30                                                                                                                                 1    submit, is not persuasive when you're talking as we are 2    here about matters of public concern.  In the Internet 3    age, an interceptor doesn't need the press to disseminate 4    anonymously information to a mass audience.  Even if he 5    did, there is no evidence that that provides that person 6    with an incentive to intercept in the first place, 7    especially where, as in this case money does not drive the 8    market hypothesized by the petitioner.  There may well be 9    the occasional case in which an anonymous interceptor10    gratuitously throws the contents of an intercepted11    communication over the transom, but there is no evidence12    that this is a systemic problem or that --13              QUESTION:  Well, something like that happened14    here, didn't it?  I mean there is an anonymous interceptor15    who gave if to a radio station.16              MR. LEVINE:  But Your Honor, there is no17    evidence that the identity of the interceptor in this case18    could not have been uncovered.19              QUESTION:  Well, I presume that the Government20    ought to have some presumption. They are saying that it's21    very -- they enforce these laws.  They are just saying22    it's just very difficult to find this person, the initial23    interceptor.24 25          MR. LEVINE:  Your Honor, that is, with all duerespect to the Government, purely conjecture.  There is31                                                                                             1    nothing in the legislative history to support that.  The 2    scores of prosecutions under the Acts Interception 3    Provision suggest that that's not true.  And in all of the 4    cases, applying the acts, use and disclosure prohibitions 5    which are cited in the appendix to our briefs. 6              QUESTION:  Well, shouldn't the Government at 7    least have a chance to -- I mean, the Government here was 8    cut off. there hasn't been any trial.  There were 1292-B. 9    certifications.  The third circuit said the statute is no10    good.  If the question is, is it really difficult to get11    out -- get after interceptors, shouldn't the Government12    have had a chance to show that indeed it is?13              MR. LEVINE:  Your Honor, in light of the ample14    evidence that is contained in the record and available to15    the Court, that at least when you're talking about matters16    of public concern as you are here, where money doesn't17    drive the market to the interception, that that is not the18    case.  I think warrants a conclusion that the Government19    doesn't need to be able to do that, and of course if the20    Court applies the Daily Mail principle, we don't reach21    that question because the Daily Mail principle obviates22    the need to show that, especially whereas here there are23    so many less restrictive alternatives to prohibiting the24    dissemination of information, like meaningful criminal25    penalties against the interception itself.32                                                                                                                                 1              In this case, your Honors, the maximum criminal 2    penalty that could be applied against the interceptor of 3    this communication was a nominal fine with no possibility 4    of incarceration.  In the Baynor case, another one of the 5    cases that is pending before this Court, the interceptor 6    of that conversation was fined $500. 7              QUESTION:  In -- in -- suppose that a stranger 8    goes into your house, trespassing, puts his ear to the 9    bedroom door and hears your private conversation or goes10    in and steals your diary and turns it over to a newspaper,11    knowing all this publishes it, is it constitutional not to12    forbid the publication, but to collect damages from the13    newspaper?141516171819202122232425          MR. LEVINE:  Your Honor, if the information didnot involve a matter of public concern --          QUESTION:  No.  No.  It does.          MR. LEVINE:  If it involves a matter of publicconcern --          QUESTION:  Yes.          MR. LEVINE:  -- and there is no unlawful conductof any kind by the person who publishes the information --          QUESTION:  All right.  So you're saying that itsunconstitutional to prohibit trespassers from coming intoyour house, steal your diaries, and listen to your mostprivate conversations and then publish them in mass33                                                                                             1    circulation dailies and you can't get damages from that as 2    long as the newspaper itself didn't do the trespass, just 3    knew all about it? 4              MR. LEVINE:  Your Honor, I think I misunderstood 5    your question.  The person who broke into your house and 6    listened in -- 7              QUESTION:  Is not a -- is not a reporter. 8              MR. LEVINE:  Right. 9              QUESTION:  It's just someone -- it's a stranger.10              MR. LEVINE:  That person can be prosecuted.11              QUESTION:  No, I'm asking if you can get damages12    from the newspaper and I think your answer13    straightforwardly is no.14              MR. LEVINE:  That's correct, Your Honor. That's15    correct, Your Honor.16              QUESTION:  Then I don't see how you're going to17    have privacy left.  I mean, what kind of privacy is there18    if people can break into your house, steal all your19    information, can be published in the newspaper that knows20    it and you can't get any damages from the newspaper?21              MR. LEVINE:  Your Honor --22              QUESTION:  It goes with trade secrets,23    copyrighted books and your most private information.24              MR. LEVINE:  Your Honor, you can  go after the25    person who intercepted.34                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Yeah, but we don't know who thatperson is, you know.  He takes his money and runs, allright.  So the only effective redress is to stop theentire United States from knowing your most secretinformation or your trade secrets or your copyrighted bookwhich was obtained with the newspaper's full knowledgethrough trespass, breaking and entering, any kind ofstealing you want.  Is that not your position?          MR. LEVINE:  Justice Breyer --          QUESTION:  If I disagree with that you lose --          MR. LEVINE:  Justice Breyer, if I understandyour latest iteration of the hypothetical, you included apayment in there. If the newspaper paid for theinformation, that's a much closer question.          QUESTION:  No.  No.  I'll take it out then.          MR. LEVINE:  Your Honors, in the last analysis,this statute simply prohibits too much speech.  In thiscase it prohibits respondent Yokum from notifying membersof the school board that they might be in danger.          QUESTION:  Are you permitted to raise anoverbreadth challenge in this posture of the case?          MR. LEVINE:  The answer is yes, Justice Kennedy,because if an intermediate scrutiny does apply, one of theprongs of the intermediate scrutiny test is that thestatute at issue must not prohibit more speech than is35                                                                                             1    necessary.  I don't see how a litigant in our position can 2    make that point without making the arguments that we have 3    here about the fact that this statute simply prohibits too 4    much speech.  The statute also prohibits the media 5    respondents from sharing -- 6              QUESTION:  If the rationale of the statute is to 7    dry up the market, it doesn't prohibit too much speech, it 8    prohibits precisely the amount of speech that is the 9    product of what the statute is aimed at.10              MR. LEVINE:  But if you focus on the speech11    itself, Justice Stevens, and it is truthful and it12    involves a matter of public concern, that speech has13    value.  That's what the Daily Mail principle is all about.14              QUESTION:  No, but you're arguing about the15    quantity.  The quantity is precisely tailored to the16    underlying criminal conduct. It's the fruits of that, just17    like the fruits of an illegal search, to take Justice18    Scalia's example.19              MR. LEVINE:  Not when -- not when the Congress20    was focused on other kinds of interceptions and21    disclosures involving things like industrial espionage,22    insider trading, contested divorce.  Congress did not23    focus on things like speech involving matters of public24    concern.  There is nothing in the legislative history to25    suggest that Congress thought that that was problem that36                                                                                                                                 1    it was trying deal with. 2              QUESTION:  No, the problem is illegal 3    intercepts.  And it covers the product of every illegal 4    intercept.  It doesn't cover any speech that is not the 5    product of -- it seems to me their tailoring argument is 6    not really very persuasive.  It exactly fits, in terms of 7    quantity, if you're just talking about quantity, the 8    quantity is exactly the full market for this illegal9 activity.10              MR. LEVINE:  I think it's fairest to say that11    I'm talking about quantity and quality.  Quality in the12    sense that the information involving truthful speech13    without matters of public concern is at the core of the14    First Amendment and that's what this statute prohibits in15    addition to whatever it may legitimately prohibit16    involving speech that doesn't involve a matter of public -17 concern.18              QUESTION:  Well, given that, then why is it19    worse?  Why is it worse to receive a stolen diary than to20    steal the diary yourself?  Why is it worse to receive with21    knowledge, the stolen diary?  Do you see my point?22              MR. LEVINE:  I see your point and this may be a23    fine distinction in response, but I think it's an24    important one, Justice Breyer, the physical diary is25    property. Taking that, regardless of what's inside it, is37                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425not the function of the First Amendment to speak to.  Ifyou're talking about the contents of the diary, theinformation and you're then penalizing someone for nowknowing that information, having it in his brain and thendisseminating it to other people, that is something thatthe First Amendment is concerned about, especially whenyou're talking about speech that is the truth and is amatter of public concern.          QUESTION:  I guess the case points up thatchattel analogies are difficult in a modern age ofdigitized speech, et cetera.          I mean you don't have an airline ticket anymore.It's just out there in a computer.          MR. LEVINE:  That's right.          QUESTION:  And what the Government is trying todo is to recognize that in this statute.          MR. LEVINE:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Levine.          Mr. Goldstein, we'll hear from you.           ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN               ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT YOCUM          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice and may itplease the Court:          Even if the petitioners are correct that thewire tap acts redisclosure prohibition and that's what38                                                                                             1    I'll call it, it's the second, third, fourth person to 2    receive it, even if that prohibition, prophylactically 3    adds some deterrent, as Justice Scalia and the Chief 4    Justice have suggested, and Justice Breyer's concern about 5    privacy identifies, even if it does add some deterrent, 6    that prohibition is too crude a weapon, effectively a 7    thermonuclear bomb of sorts to be sustained in the 8    sensitive area of not property but free speech.  It 9    therefore should be invalidated at least under10    intermediate scrutiny.11              QUESTION:  Well, what you then presumably have12    other ideas as to how the Government might get at this13    problem, less drastic, perhaps?  What are they?14              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, we believe15    that the solution adopted by the Third Circuit, the narrow16    approach it took is the one that is appropriate under17    intermediate scrutiny and that is it left in place by and18    large the redisclosure prohibition but recognized that19    when the final disclosure is on a question of public20    significance, and is by a person completely uninvolved in21    the illegal interception, then the speech rights outweigh.22    So when you have only the circumstance where you have23    speech on a matter of public significance, not just what24    was happening on the phone, someone came in and just25    overheard my conversation in my bedroom, they adopted a39                                                                                                                                 1    line -- this a -- a principle that exists in lots of this 2    Court's cases, including in the defamation context, in 3    Pickering balancing, when you're speaking on a matter of 4    public importance, that's when the First Amendment 5    interests are at their highest. 6              QUESTION:  So is it a fact -- 7              QUESTION:  The newspaper's not going to publish 8    it unless it has public interest?  And is public interest 9    and public significance the same thing?  I mean, you know,10    somebody taps the phones of a prominent public official or11    of a prominent jurist and it turns out the guy swears like12    a trooper and this -- you know, and the whole conversation13    is published in the paper.  Is that a matter of public14    significance?15161718192021222324    no?25          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It is a matter of publicinterest.  This Court --          QUESTION:  But it may well not be a matter ofpublic significance.          QUESTION:  Well, now what's the difference if we-- do our cases articulate any difference between publicsignificance and public interest. MR. GOLDSTEIN:  The Court has -- QUESTION:  Can you answer the question yes or MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No, because it hasn't been                   40                                       1    presented, Mr. Chief Justice and I would -- 2              QUESTION:  And you're presenting it now. 3              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.  Mr. Chief Justice, in 4    three lines of cases, the Court has taken -- has drawn the 5    line at public significance and I will identify them 6    specifically.  Defamation and libel, the Hustler Magazine 7    case, the Philadelphia Newspaper v. Hepps case and Dun & 8    Bradstreet all turn on whether or not the speech in 9    question is on an issue of public significance.  The same10    is true in the Pickering balancing cases, including11    particularly the Court's opinion in United States v.12    National Treasury Employee's Union which, too, was a13    content-neutral statute.  But I need to return to what14    else we would say, what other strictures we would put on15    the statute in order to permit it to survive intermediate16    scrutiny and still fulfill what we agree is an important17    governmental interest and that is that no one wants people18    tapping phones and breaking into homes.19              The difficulty here is that there are a number20    of respects in which the statute is not tailored21    whatsoever.  And so I want to get to Justice Stevens'22    point that really this does get to the heart of the23    matter.  The real problem is that this is not a case like24    the Daily Mail case where it is a one-to-one trade off,25    we're going to reduce some speech in order to further some41                                                                                                                                 1    other interest.  We have here a statute that is so broad 2    that much speech that the Government has no interest or 3    actual intent to stop from being published will in fact be 4    published.  The different -- I will identify five 5    distinctions.  The first is that it applies equally and I 6    mean all the way down the line in terms of punishment 7    whether or not you can put someone in jail, identical 8    fines to the newspaper that is the 10th party down the 9    line to receive the information as to the intercepting.10              QUESTION:  Well, it's no longer --11              QUESTION:  Not according to Soliciter General.12    He says the word disclosed means that once it has been13    publicly disclosed, the next person is not a discloser.14              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That argument is not15    inconsistent with what I have just said.  I will explain16 why.171819202122232425          QUESTION:  I hope you will.          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  The radio station here playedthe tape in this area of northeastern Pennsylvania, Mr.Chief Justice, the New York Times comes along and listensand says oh, my goodness, look what happened here. Theythen publish it nationally.  Under the Soliciter General'sinterpretation, that is a violation of the statute becauseit wasn't known to the people in California.          QUESTION:  Is that expressed in the Government's                            42                                                                                            1    brief or is this just something that you're adding to the2    Government's brief?3              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm in4    the difficult position that this argument is made in one5    sentence in the Government's reply brief and so this is my6    understanding.7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Well, so your feeling is that if it'sjust disclosed in northeastern Pennsylvania, then someonewho discloses it perhaps in northwestern Pennsylvania isdisclosing it anew?          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Exactly.  And as ridiculous asthat sounds --          QUESTION:  It sure does.          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  And I -- I agree with you thatit's ridiculous but it is what the statute says and it'scompletely consonant with what Congress was apparentlyattempting to do here.  If you look through thepetitioner's brief, time and again, they say each time itgets out it's like a hundred thousand people interceptingthe communication.          QUESTION:   You don't have to read statutesunreasonably.  I mean if that's an unreasonable result,don't read disclose to mean that.  I mean you usuallyreads statutes to produce both constitutional andreasonable results where that's possible.43                                                                                             1              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  The plain text of the statute 2    uses a much broader term than is suggested by the 3    Solicitor General and let me continue with the other four 4    problems with tailoring.  The second is that it applies to 5    any piece of information about the conversation, not 6    merely the tape.  The fact that, and Justice -- there was 7    a question about talking to my neighbor.  In this context 8    if you receive innocently a tape recording and merely 9    mention the fact that you have -- you know that there was10    a tape recording of the conversation, it applies equally11    because the definition of content is so broad.  It's12    literally any datum about the conversation. The third is13    that it imposes civil and criminal liability and permits14    the commencement of litigation even when there has been no15    injury at all.  And the plaintiffs in this case disavowed16    any claim that they had been actually been hurt.  The17    fourth is that it applies equally no matter whether the18    information and indeed the conversation in question was19    even private.  And this was Justice O'Connor's first20    question is that the information that was spoken and was21    heard and intercepted could have been a completely public22    fact but the fact that it was said in a conversation would23    be disclosed, and fifth and this one is the particularly24    troubling one that I began with, it applies even when the25    information is of vital public significance.44                                                                                                                                 1              Now, the reason I mentioned these five is that 2    you have to look at someone who is in the position of 3    receiving a piece of information and there is the grave 4    concern that when you get a piece of information 5    notwithstanding the reason to know limitation which is 6    what the Solicitor General points had to saving the 7    statute, you had real doubts about the provenance of 8    information.  Because of the great breath of the statute, 9    it's unlike Daily Mail and it's unlike Florida Star.10    You've got a rape victim's name and you know okay that's11    prohibited.  I'm not going to say that if I followed the12    statute and its constitutional --13              QUESTION:  Well wouldn't a reporter or a news14    station ordinarily want to check out a story?  Are they15    just going to get the tape and say gee, let's put it on?16              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, if that's the17    case then I don't think that we have a problem.  If you18    are going to have a situation where you attempt to discern19    the provenance of information, this case -- this statute20    operates only in the circumstance where the newspaper21    doesn't know the intercepting party. If the newspaper22    knows the intercepting party then the statute operates23    because the newspaper will be subpoenaed and will have to24    testify about who gave them the interception and that25    person will be prosecuted.  In the situation where you45                                                                                                                                 1    don't know and if the Court's point is that look, it 2    simply won't be published in that instance we don't have a 3    problem because the broader disclosure won't happen. 4              QUESTION:  Well, I don't understand that. 5              QUESTION:  That might be quite difficult.  Is 6    the -- I think that the Congress or States pass property 7    laws in part to keep people away from my bedroom.  And 8    they are doing that in part for reasons better than trade 9    secret law or copyright law because there is something10    about human dignity that requires it.  Well, if they can11    keep people away from my bedroom to hear my private12    conversations, even about important matters, can't they13    try to protect that same kind of basic dignity in respect14    to the new world that will come through wireless15    communication?  Now, do you see there's a lot involved16    there, but that's at the bottom of what I'm trying to work17    out in this case.18              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Let me begin by stepping back to19    the variant on that question that you asked my colleague.20    And I do want to specify, that when it comes to things21    like diaries, the intellectual property laws still apply22    fully in the same way they did in Cowles, those sorts of23    copyright laws, and we don't doubt that if it's a diary24    and it's something that is your personal information, you25    have written it down, that you can claim that you have46                                                                                                                                 1    stolen something like intellectual property. 2              Your version to me was, can't we try hard to 3    reduce the incentives, and I think Congress is doing that 4    here.  There is no record that suggests there is a real 5    problem, but I think we all agree intuitively, it will 6    reduce somewhat the incentive to engage in the 7    interception.  Our problem is that it's a purely 8    prophylactic ban on someone and could result in massive 9    punitive damages or jail time on someone who hasn't10    engaged in the primary wrongdoing.  Where the prophylaxis11    has broken down, my client has no idea who gave him this12    piece of information. He has it.  It's of public13    significance.  It's a legitimate threat on page.14              QUESTION:  He knows it was illegally obtained.15    He didn't know who illegally obtained it.  Do you really16    think this phone conversation what, just dropped out of17    the air or something?  It was obviously illegally18    obtained.  Wasn't it an obvious phone tap?19              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It was an obviously -- it was20    obviously recorded and very likely recorded by someone who21    wasn't a party to it.22              QUESTION:  Okay.  Why do you have to know who23 did it?24              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Because he is not engaged in25    anything that anyone believes is wrong.  He has47                                                                                                                                1    information, a legitimate threat.  The court of appeals,2    Justice Scalia, on page 26-A of the petition appendix3    explains that this is not just an idle threat.  He says4    really, truthfully, we're going to have to do some work on5    these people, blow off --6              QUESTION:  But isn't it the case that by the7    time the publication which is the subject of this action8    occurred, the threat was over?  This publication all9    occurred after the point at which the threat was going --10              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  With respect, that is not11    correct, particularly as to my client.  Independently12    after receiving it, within a day, he published it,13    disclosed it in the sense of the statute by giving it to14    the radio station and notifying the people who were the15    subject.1617181920212223242548                                                                                                                                          QUESTION:  Why didn't he just notify the peoplewho were the subject of the threat?MR. GOLDSTEIN:  He did.          QUESTION:  Once it goes to the radio stationyou're not talking about an exception for people who areperforming the public service of warning victims.          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I think that there is somethingto be said of warning the public.  But I agree --          QUESTION:  Well, the public's porches weren'tgoing to be blown off, the school committee's porches were 1    going to be blown off, and they were notified.  So that 2    when it went to the radio station, we weren't worried 3    about potential victims of porch blowings, were we? 4              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  When he gave it to the radio 5    station, yes, we were. 6              QUESTION:  And at the same time, he was making 7    it known, I forget how, but he was making it known to the 8    victims so that the radio station was not necessary to 9    make it known to the victims and the people who learn10    through the radio station weren't potential victims.11    That's correct, isn't it?12              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That is correct.  Our point is13    that when you have a piece of information and the14    prophylactic goals of the statute have broken down and it15    is a matter of public significance, you are not involved16    in anything that Congress attempted to stop.  It is speech17    of the highest interest.  When you have a limited holding18    like the third circuit did here under intermediate19    scrutiny, if it is only speech on matters of public20    significance and by someone who had nothing to do with the21    interception, has no idea who was, that speech is22    protected.23 24 25          QUESTION:  But who knows that someone upon whomhe is depending acted illegally.          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Has reason to know.                            49                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  Has reason to know and certainlythere is reason to know here.          MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  All right, and -- and Congresscertainly did intend to stop that, it seems to me,contrary to what you said. Why do you suggest that this isoutside of ambit of what concerned Congress.  Congresswanted to dry up a market, and I can't think of a moreobvious market than the market of a radio station whichhas reason to know that it is publishing illegally seized1011    interceptions.12              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Souter, if I said this13    wasn't what Congress was trying to do, I misspoke.14              QUESTION:  I thought you did say that.15              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  We agreed that that was16    Congress' goal.  Our point in that respect is twofold, is17    that neither the Congress nor the plaintiffs or the18    Government have attempted to develop any record that that19    was a series problem.  And second is that --20              QUESTION:  Then they should have time to do it21    under the procedure as it has gone so far, they haven't.22    If that's the flaw --23              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Ginsburg, they had the24    opportunity to develop a record in this case and the other25    two cases that have come before you, that are the Peavey50                                       1    case and the Baynor case have gone through the courts and 2    no one has suggested that they are going to develop any 3    kind of record. 4              QUESTION:  Then, but tell me if I'm wrong.  I 5    thought the district court kept the case there, certified 6    questions to the third circuit. The third circuit didn't 7    say but now you have a chance to show it, just cut him 8    off. They prevailed in the district court. 9              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  They did not attempt in this10    case to put forward any record regarding the efficacy of11    the statute.12              QUESTION:  If they knew they were required to do13    something beyond the intuitive judgment that people make14    that of course nobody is going to do this if nobody is15    going to touch it, if it's going to be treated like a hot16 potato.17              MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I think maybe you I, Justice18    Ginsburg, are speaking about two slightly different19    things.  The first is a point you identified to my20    colleague before  which is, is it really difficult to21    identify people and stop them when they are doing these22    kinds of interceptions.  I think this Court can assume23    that to be the case. The point that I am making is that24    Congress when it legislated here did not operate on an25    understanding or any evidence that there was a problem.51                                                                                                                                 1              QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Goldstein. 2              General Waxman, you have three minutes3 remaining. 4                REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN 5               ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER UNITED STATES 6              MR. WAXMAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 7              Questions about the extent of the necessity 8    defense which we mentioned in our reply brief or the 9    meaning of the word disclosure are all, of course,10    questions of application that will be given judicial11    interpretation in appropriate cases where they arise.  The12    salient point here is that the respondents have not made a13    case, either in their briefs or here, that going solely14    against the wiretapper is going to significantly protect15    privacy.  And contrary to their representation, the16    legislative history does, in fact, reflect both great17    solicitude for the privacy rights involved and that's18    quoted at page 3 of our reply brief and also repeatedly19    the recognition that wiretapping and bugging and now of20    course we have hacking into e-mails is almost completely21    impossible of interception or even detection.22              The nominal fine that Mr. Levine referred to23    Levine referred to is, of course, $5,000 which is not24    nominal with respect to most people, and in any event25    exists independent of the civil remedy under 2520 that52                                                                                                                                 1    Congress thought was appropriate and Congress said in the 2    legislative history was appropriate to vindicate the 3    privacy rights of the people whose privacy interests were 4    not vindicated. 5              The notion that there is a limiting principal 6    for facts of public significance, I think, is fatal. 7    First of all, if there were such an exception, that would 8    not -- that would deprive the statute of being content 9    neutral.  And second of all, there is almost no way to10    draw the line, as Justice Scalia suggests, for what is11    publicly significant.  This Court has already held twice12    that the name of a woman who has been raped, not the fact13    that there was a rape or the name of the perpetrator, but14    the victim is a matter of public significance and public15    interest.  So we don't think that there is a16    constitutional way to draw a line here.17              The Daily Mail principle that the other side18    bases its case on is distinguishable from this case and19    this law in five critical respects.  Those were laws that20    applied only to the press and not to nonexpressive uses.21    They were content based laws reflected a determination22    that society should not know certain information.  They23    reflect -- they dealt with information that came from the24    Government that is not in the hands of private parties and25    there are, we understand, reasons to respect a sensorial53                                                                                                                                1    motive when the Government seeks to limit disclosure of2    information about its own activities.  They did not --3    they all obtained -- involved information that was4    lawfully obtained.  Every single one of the persons who5    gave that information to the person got it lawfully.6              CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:   Thank you, General7    Waxman.  The case is submitted.8              (Whereupon, at 12:03 p.m., the case in the9    above-entitled matter was submitted.)1011121314151617181920212223242554
