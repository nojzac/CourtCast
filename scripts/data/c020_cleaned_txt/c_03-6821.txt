Donal Campbell. Mr. Stevenson.ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN STEVENSON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. STEVENSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:6 days before petitioner's scheduled execution in this case, an execution that he had sought and informally requested be -- be carried out as soon as possible, prison officials went to him and for the first time told him that to deal with a medical problem that both parties acknowledged exists, he would be subjected to a procedure that would be conducted by State officials, not necessarily medically trained, not necessarily licensed, where they were going to make a 2-inch incision in his arm, cut through fat and tissue and muscle, until they had a vein that they could access for the purposes of inserting a catheter.QUESTION: Well, presumably at a much earlier date, the prisoner did know that he -- he was -- he would be scheduled to be executed by lethal injection.MR. STEVENSON: Absolutely, Your -- Your Honor.3, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: And he did know his veins were2 compromised.3 MR. STEVENSON: Absolutely, and as soon as he -­4 QUESTION: So -- so presumably in -- well in5 advance he could anticipate a problem.6 MR. STEVENSON: Yes, Your Honor, and he did. He7 immediately began contacting the warden at Holman Prison.8 He was housed in another facility some 200 miles away. He9 immediately began contacting the warden at Holman Prison,10 who had just been installed, who did not know him, and11 informed him he had this condition, that they would need12 to create protocols necessary to deal with it.13 The State admitted that they had never dealt14 with someone in this condition before and began offering15 all kinds of things that would accomplish this execution.16 Let him bring in a physician that can insert a catheter.17 Let's get some protocols established so that we don't have18 any problems. And for 6 weeks essentially this effort was19 being made.20 He had been previously told that they were going21 to do this 24 hours in advance, that they weren't going to22 make this kind of 2-inch incision, and even though he23 hadn't been assured there would be medical people, he was24 relatively comfortable with that. He did not file suit.25 It's only 6 days before for the first time that the State4, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 announced they would have this kind of invasive procedure2 carried out by someone who was not necessarily medically3 trained.4 He filed a 1983 action. I think it's important5 for this Court's judgment here today. The district court6 found that that 1983 action, if it went in Mr. Nelson's7 favor, would not invalidate his judgment or conviction.8 Notwithstanding that conclusion, the district court felt9 compelled to apply a rule in force in the Eleventh Circuit10 that effectively shields death row prisoners facing an11 execution from doing anything that can challenge12 unconstitutional conditions of -- of confinement.13 The Eleventh Circuit rule is essentially once14 you are scheduled for an execution, it doesn't matter that15 the prison begins to do something and amount to something16 that -- that is unconstitutional.17 QUESTION: Well, they're -- they're not saying18 that. They can bring actions that -- that challenge19 unconstitutional conditions of confinement. He's being20 kept in a dank and dark cell that's -- that's cruel and21 painful. The only thing they're saying he can't bring is22 -- is an action that, in effect, says I can't be executed23 the way the State intends to execute me, that that has to24 have been brought up earlier.25 MR. STEVENSON: Yes, and -- and I -- I guess5, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 that's our -­2 QUESTION: It has -- has to be under habeas3 rather than under 1983.4 MR. STEVENSON: Yes. And Your Honor, I -- I5 guess our position is -- is that this action is like the6 action that you describe. He is challenging medical7 treatment, medical procedures. He doesn't say he doesn't8 want to be executed. He's not trying to block his9 execution.1011 actions in this one crucial respect: its effect is to12 prevent the execution.13 MR. STEVENSON: No. I think the effect here was14 to facilitate the execution. Mr. Nelson went into court15 saying, let's just get an order so that my doctor can come16 in and carry this out. Let's just get a temporary17 restraining order on this 2-inch incision which makes no18 sense. The -- the court -- the district court judge says,19 can't you lawyers work this out? Mr. Nelson's counsel was20 ready then and there to effectuate a procedure that would21 carry out this execution.22 And the Eleventh Circuit judgment, Justice23 Scalia, is actually one that says once the petitioner is24 scheduled for an execution, it doesn't matter whether it's25 a conditions of confinement suit as you described, that6, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005QUESTION: Well, but it's unlike these other￼1 the Federal courts somehow have no authority to grant2 relief or conduct review because the execution -- the3 scheduling of the execution somehow divests those courts4 of jurisdiction. That's the Eleventh Circuit rule.5 They didn't argue here that because his6 litigation, because his lawsuit is, in effect, an attempt7 to bar the execution, he loses. That's the distinction.8 What they said here is that because he is9 already scheduled for execution, it doesn't matter what10 the conditions of the confinement are, whether it11 invalidates the conviction and sentence. Federal courts12 have no authority to grant relief. And that's the rule we13 urge this Court to overturn.14 QUESTION: May -- may I get clear on one thing?15 MR. STEVENSON: Yes, sir.16 QUESTION: Did he -- did his counsel say to the17 court, the district court, we want under 1983 an order18 that says admit this man's doctor to the place of19 execution at the time the State chooses so he can find a20 way then and there to allow the State to carry out the21 execution when it wants to do it? Did he ask for that?22 MR. STEVENSON: Well, what he asked for -- what23 -- what he -- what he put in his complaint was that he had24 made that offer to the State, and that was in his25 complaint, that -- that the defendant's counsel had7, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425authorized or requested the opportunity to bring in a physician to facilitate a review -­QUESTION: Is that what he was asking for when he went into court?MR. STEVENSON: Well, what he was asking for is an injunction barring them from doing this kind of 2-inch incision, but yes, he made it very clear in the complaint -­QUESTION: Was it made clear to the district court that he would be satisfied with the order I have just described?MR. STEVENSON: Only to the extent -- yes, I believe so, Your Honor, because when the district court said, can't you work this out, Mr. Nelson's counsel said, yes, I think we can.QUESTION: Did -- did he ask for a postponement of the execution?MR. STEVENSON: He did, Your Honor. He did, and that was in part because the State was, at least at the point at which this lawsuit was filed in, saying that this is what they were going to do in -- in the absence of some kind of Federal intervention.QUESTION: What would have been the terms of the postponement that you were asking for?MR. STEVENSON: I -- I think the district court8, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 could have basically issued a cease and desist order. You2 are enjoined from doing this kind of conduct because it3 violates contemporary standards of medical decency.4 QUESTION: Would it have been sufficient to say,5 don't -- postpone it until you admit the doctor to be6 present and get the catheter in?7 MR. STEVENSON: I -- I think it could have been8 sufficient to say I'm going to order that his physician be9 admitted into the facility. I'm going to order that you10 accomplish this through the method proposed by11 petitioner's counsel. I think all of those things could12 have been done, but the district court here felt like he13 did not have the authority to actually deal with this in14 the 1983 context.15 QUESTION: Was it that -- before, Mr. Stevenson,16 you said that nothing that the prisoner requests, once the17 date of execution is set, is actionable in 1983. But I18 thought that the Eleventh Circuit made a distinction19 between a proceeding that would require a stay of the20 execution. If he says that prior to the execution I'm in21 -- in a dark, dank cell, that would be actionable so long22 as he's not seeking to postpone the date of the execution,23 as I understand it.24 MR. STEVENSON: And I guess here, Your Honor,25 what we think is that when the prison waits until 6 days9, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425before the scheduled execution -- a complaint can only be filed 3 days before the scheduled execution -- a determination of whether what the prison is proposing is unconstitutional or not cannot ordinarily -­QUESTION: He -- he didn't -- he didn't know before that that -- that this was -­MR. STEVENSON: No, Your Honor.QUESTION: -- the procedure they were going touse?MR. STEVENSON: No, Your -- he had been told before that they were going to do something 24 hours in advance. It was only on the Friday before the Thursday -­QUESTION: When they're going to doitisnot the issue. It's what they're going to do.MR. STEVENSON: Well, yes, that's -- he was told for the first time on that Friday, 2-inch incision in the arm, not necessarily done by someone medically trained. That presented a very different kind of -­QUESTION: But he -- he knew that -- that something special had to be done with respect to him because he had these compromised veins. Didn't he?MR. STEVENSON: Absolutely. And -- and the record reflects that there were repeated efforts on the part of Mr. Nelson's counsel to get the State to -- to deal with it.10, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: How -- how long ago was the conviction for which he was condemned to -- to death?MR. STEVENSON: The conviction was 1978. The death sentence is 1994. He spent a lot of years on death row under an illegal death sentence that the Eleventh Circuit overturned in 1993.QUESTION: The crime was committed when?MR. STEVENSON: In 1978. The death sentenced imposed here was committed in 1994, and it's worth noting that even then Mr. Nelson was very, very sort of unsure about fighting a death sentence. He told the judge he wanted a death sentence. No appeal briefs were filed into the Alabama appellate courts. The -­QUESTION: Did -- did you at any point shape your claim for relief in the alternative, saying we want either habeas corpus or 1983? Or do we take this case on the assumption that almost everybody agrees it has to be 1983?MR. STEVENSON: Well, no, it was not styled as a habeas action, in part because the Eleventh Circuit rules would have prevented us from ever getting review in this Court or any other court if it had been framed in that way.QUESTION: Is that -- is that correct? If -- if we had to do this in a circuit with no precedents, could11, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425you argue that this would be -- could be habeas? It's not successive because it's -- the issue hasn't come up before?MR. STEVENSON: Well, yes. There -- there certainly -- it's certainly true that other circuits, Justice Kennedy, apply this Court's doctrine in Stewart v. Martinez where a claim, an execution claim, not previously ripe, can be subject to habeas review. The Eleventh Circuit doesn't. Their position expressed in In re Medina is that if it wasn't in your first habeas, it can't be presented.QUESTION: Well, what does the statute say? It says it has to be not only not previously ripe -- you didn't have the information -- but also the statute says it has to show that he was innocent.MR. STEVENSON: Yes. And that's why we --we-­QUESTION: So why isn't that conclusive here? I mean, it -- it doesn't meet the second condition.MR. STEVENSON: Well, absolutely. It's -- it's certainly conclusive, Justice Scalia. It could not be -­QUESTION: Well, of course, that's assuming it's successive.MR. STEVENSON: That's right. That's right. It certainly would not be a successive petition. What we would be arguing is what this Court has already held, that12, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425an unripe execution claim of this sort, of a competency to be executed claim, which this Court held in Stewart was cognizable would be proper. In the Eleventh Circuit that's not possible.you?QUESTION: But you don't have to go that far, doMR. STEVENSON: We do not. We do not.QUESTION: Because ripeness could be a merely evidentiary matter, whereas in this case, you did not have a claim that you could bring -­MR. STEVENSON: Absolutely.QUESTION: -- at the time. So this is more than just ripeness.MR. STEVENSON: Absolutely. And -- and, JusticeSouter, I think you're absolutely right. Here, where you're not trying to do something that invalidates a conviction and sentence, it's not arguably appropriate to be thinking about this in the habeas context.2241(c) says that to grant habeas relief, the petitioner has to allege that the conviction and sentence is illegal, is in violation of the Constitution. That's not Mr. Nelson's contention here.QUESTION: Would you say -- would you be making the same argument if his complaint was not this inch cut but the combination of chemicals?13, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. STEVENSON: No, Your Honor. I think that's2 a much -- a much harder question because that does, it3 seems to me, get closer to the execution. What's4 analogous to our claim is a claim where the prison says a5 week before the execution that we're going to and6 effectively shackle you to a hitching post and not give7 you any food for 72 hours. We contend that that kind of8 treatment would be in violation of the Constitution. What9 we'd be trying to block is that treatment, not the10 execution. The reality is in this case -­11 QUESTION: Well, I mean, you know, as you know,12 we've -- we've turned down certiorari in -- in these cases13 challenging the type of drug used. What -- what is the14 difference between, you know, your using a drug that's -­15 that's going to hurt me and your using a catheter16 procedure that's going to hurt me? I don't -­17 MR. STEVENSON: I think the primary difference,18 Justice Scalia, is that those are a method of execution19 cases. They are challenging the method of execution.20 Here we have a procedure that is not even unique to21 executions.22 QUESTION: Well, but -­23 MR. STEVENSON: Venous access can -­24 QUESTION: -- they're -- they're not challenging25 the method of execution. If you want to execute me by14, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425drugs, they're saying, that's perfectly fine, just don't use a drug that hurts me.MR. STEVENSON: Well, it's -- it's -­QUESTION: And just as here, you're saying if you want to execute me by lethal injection, that's fine, just don't use a manner of lethal injection that hurts me. I find it very difficult to separate the two -­MR. STEVENSON: Well, I guess -­QUESTION: -- categories of case.MR. STEVENSON: It's not clear, Your Honor, thatin all of those cases that they are saying if you want to use a different drug, that's okay. I think that that's one distinction.I think the second distinction is that an order -- particularly in States that have statutes dictating which chemicals can be used, in those cases it may be easier for a court to find that an order in that case does invalidate the sentence.Here we have a completely severable procedure. We have something that is not in any way required by the execution. And -- and the State is saying we want to do it this way, and there are 100 other ways that it can be done. And in fact, it's just the discretionary conduct of the State prison officials that puts us in this situation.QUESTION: Well, was it -- was it any more than15, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 the presence of his own doctor to make the cut that he -­2 he was asking for?34 even --5 to have6 when he7 never a89 action.1011 suggesting that there was -- he wasn't insisting on this12 being carried out in one way. There were dozens of -- of13 offers of -- of carrying this out, including being14 executed by electrocution, something else that the State15 rejected as -- as an option for him.16 QUESTION: But he did -- he did want more than a17 doctor. He didn't want this procedure to be used when18 there was an alternate procedure that would be safer, less19 painful?20 MR. STEVENSON: Yes. It's our position that21 this procedure is unconstitutional. It does not comport22 with contemporary standards of medical decency. It's a23 procedure that is rarely done. When it's done in the24 hospital, it's under deep sedation. That there are all of25 these alternative procedures that could be done very16, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MR. STEVENSON: No, Your Honor, and it wasn't he wasn't even insisting on that. He was prepared their doctor come in. He was promised a doctor got to the prison. He never saw one. There was physical -- never a doctor to examine him.QUESTION: Well, but this isn't a contractMR. STEVENSON: No, no, Your Honor. I'm just￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425easily. A percutaneous insertion would be very easy to accomplish. There are a lot -­QUESTION: Doesn't that require a cut as well?MR. STEVENSON: No, ma'am. It -- it would just require a -- a needle, a hollow needle, with a wire inside. And -- and they would then access the vein that way. It wouldn't require the kind of incision and all of the kind of auxiliary support systems.QUESTION: But that sounds to me more like the mode of execution with the -- with the drugs that you said was distinguishable.MR. STEVENSON: No. They wouldn't effectuate the injection that way. They would just actually get access to the vein that way. And -- and this could be done, Your Honor, 24 hours in advance. It could be done some time in advance. There was no objection expressed by Mr. Nelson in any of the lower courts to that procedure.But again, all of these issues we never got to in the district court. There was never any opportunity to develop facts, to have discussion, to have argument to resolve a basic problem.QUESTION: If a challenge is brought to the use of lethal injection as a method of execution, how must that be brought? In habeas?MR. STEVENSON: Yes. My position, Justice17, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 O'Connor, would be if I'm representing someone, I would2 put that in a habeas mostly because that's -- there is3 some historical precedent for those kinds of challenges4 coming in habeas. I think you are, in effect, saying that5 the sentence is invalid. It -- it should not be carried6 out.7 QUESTION: This comes close because you say it's8 unconstitutional to proceed with lethal injection under9 these circumstances.10 MR. STEVENSON: No. We tried really hard to not11 say that. What we say, it is unconstitutional to proceed12 with venous access in this manner, to conduct medical care13 in this manner. It violates recognized standards of14 medical care. And that's what we're saying you cannot do.15 We have no objection. Mr. Nelson doesn't object to lethal16 injection. He doesn't even object to venous access. What17 he objects to is some kind of inhumane cutting by people18 who are not qualified or competent to do that.19 And like any other condition of confinement, the20 fact that he is near an execution, the fact that he has21 been scheduled for an execution shouldn't exempt him from22 protection if the State at the last minute announces that23 this is what they intend to do. This has not historically24 been a big problem. There have been over 700 executions25 in this country involving lethal injections.18, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: What is -- as a lawyer who works in2 this area, what do you think is the correct procedure that3 should be followed in respect to Ford mental incompetence4 claims or general challenges to a whole big method of5 execution not just this individual one which arise for the6 first time after termination of a first habeas?7 MR. STEVENSON: Well, Justice Breyer, I--I8 think you're right. There is a problem. We do have a gap9 in the law in that the Congress did not contemplate the10 possibility of execution claims that arise just as you11 describe.12 In the competency context, this Court created a13 rule, which I think is a very functional rule. I think it14 is a very appropriate rule. If the facts supporting that15 claim were not ripe previously, I think that -- and it's a16 legitimate execution-related claim, I think the petitioner17 should be able to get access in front of the district18 court judge that reviewed his initial habeas petition. I19 think that's the way we should deal -­20 QUESTION: Yes, that may be. So what's the21 procedural route? That's why I'm curious.22 MR. STEVENSON: Yes.23 QUESTION: This fits into a bigger picture.24 MR. STEVENSON: Yes, yes.25 QUESTION: And I'd like to be clear about the19, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425bigger picture -­MR. STEVENSON: Yes. The big -­QUESTION: -- in your opinion.MR. STEVENSON: Yes. The bigger picture in my judgment, Your Honor, would be it would be filed as a habeas petition in front of that district court judge relying on this Court's -­QUESTION: And -- and you say that it would be -- count as a first habeas.MR. STEVENSON: Well, it would be part of the first habeas. It would -­QUESTION: Well, what the -- what the response to that is it's very hard to reconcile that with the language of the statute.MR. STEVENSON: Well, what the -­QUESTION: And -- and also they add that the right route is to file an initial habeas here or, alternatively, to go to the State court, at least if that's still open.MR. STEVENSON: Yes. And -­QUESTION: In which case it raises no constitutional question about blocking habeas because we could review the State court. I'd just like briefly your views on that kind of an argument.MR. STEVENSON: Yes, sir. Well, in Stewart,20, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 what this Court did was resolve it by saying, no, Congress2 did not intend to preclude petitioners with legitimate3 execution claims from getting that. This Court has4 created those protections. I think -­5 QUESTION: Was there -- was there anything open6 to this petitioner in the State for an application for7 relief here?8 MR. STEVENSON: No, Justice O'Connor,9 unfortunately not. In Alabama you cannot present a second10 post-conviction petition even on claims that -- that turn11 on new evidence. On execution claims, on new evidence12 claims, you have no remedy. And consequently, we would13 need access to the Federal courts to protect Mr. Nelson14 from the kind of claim that we're presenting here or even15 in the kind of claims that Justice Breyer is suggesting.16 And that's why we do think there is a problem.17 It's not presented precisely in this case. There is a18 problem with the way in which there are these execution19 claims. If some State says tomorrow, we're going to20 change our method and from here on out, we're going to21 stone people to death or beat them to death with baseball22 bats, and this Court believes that that is23 unconstitutional, in a place like Alabama, to the extent24 that -- that the Court construes that as an execution25 claim -- and that's the only way they could carry out the21, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 execution, so it might be said that that would invalidate2 the conviction and sentence -- we would need a rule. We3 would need to find some way to get access to courts, and4 we currently don't have it.5 Here --6 QUESTION: Your -- your claim here is an Eighth7 Amendment claim, cruel and unusual punishment.8 MR. STEVENSON: Yes, sir.9 QUESTION: Right?10 But -- but you say it just doesn't comport with11 what? The -- the most advanced medical procedures?12 MR. STEVENSON: No, Your Honor.13 QUESTION: Anything that does not comport with14 the most advanced medical procedures is cruel and unusual15 punishment?16 MR. STEVENSON: That --17 QUESTION: I mean, you know -­18 MR. STEVENSON: No, I hear you. I hear you.19 QUESTION: -- this man is -- is looking death in20 the face.21 MR. STEVENSON: Sure.22 QUESTION: And -- and the crime was committed23 over a quarter of a century ago for which he was -- he was24 condemned. And -- and what he's really concerned about is25 -- is an incision? I find it difficult to contemplate22, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 that this constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.2 MR. STEVENSON: Well, Your Honor, it's not our3 position that he is seeking and -- and demanding the most4 advanced procedures. What I think he is objecting to is5 something that we regard as fairly barbaric, to have a6 correctional staff member come back with a scalpel, make a7 2-inch cut in his arm, cut through fat and tissue to get8 to a vein with no assurances that that person knows what9 they're doing, violates the basic standards of medical10 decency.11 And it's not just a cruel and unusual12 punishment. This Court has created a line of cases under13 Estelle v. Gamble that talk about deliberate indifference14 to serious medical needs. This is a medical care case.15 Yes, he's in prison. Yes, he's on death row. Yes, he's16 forfeited some of his basic expectations, but he hasn't17 given them all away. He's still entitled to be treated18 with some regard.19 QUESTION: You're saying it's -- it's not the20 Eighth Amendment. You're saying it's a medical care case.21 MR. STEVENSON: No. It's -- it's both. We -­22 the complaint raises both the cruel and unusual theory and23 a deliberate indifference theory. Both are alleged in the24 complaint.25 QUESTION: It just doesn't fit under deliberate23, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 indifference somehow. It's a little bit like the case2 that the court of appeals decided that you couldn't use a3 lethal injection because it hadn't been approved by the4 FDA.5 MR. STEVENSON: I -- I agree, Mr. Chief Justice.6 I think it -- it fits more in the cruel and unusual7 category because it seems so pointless to be doing it in8 this way. However, for all of this time, there -- there9 was no protocol. There was no response. There was no, in10 effect, effort by the State to deal with this problem and11 that's why we -- we made that allegation of deliberate12 indifference as well. And the district court could make a13 determination that says, no, following this case -- this14 line of cases, we -- we can't make that determination.15 But here, we never got to any of this. We16 didn't basically have an opportunity -­17 QUESTION: But your deliberate indifference18 claim is also an Eighth Amendment claim, isn't it?19 MR. STEVENSON: Yes, sir. Yes, yes, yes.20 That's correct. And so we're still dealing with this -­21 the Eighth Amendment universe.22 But again, the district court was precluded from23 getting to any of this. If the State wants to come in and24 say, we think this is silly, we think it is not25 appropriate for the Constitution to create these kinds of24, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 protections for these kinds of prisoners, the district2 court can make a finding that says, I agree. What3 happened here, however, was the district court was4 precluded from ever even engaging in discussion about this5 issue because of this rule that, in effect, blocks people6 on death row facing execution and enforcing basic7 constitutional protections. And that's what we think is8 objectionable.9 There are several hundred executions that have10 taken place, 733, lethal injections that have taken place,11 where this has not been a problem. This is an -- an12 unusual medical problem. It's not a medical problem that13 usually presents itself, but it presented itself for the14 first time in Alabama. It's only come up a few times.15 But we do think there ought to be some constitutional16 protection.17 QUESTION: When -- when did Alabama switch from18 electrocution to lethal injections?19 MR. STEVENSON: That happened in July of 2002,20 after Mr. Nelson had already completed his Federal habeas21 procedure.22 QUESTION: And before that, electrocution was23 the only option?24 MR. STEVENSON: Yes, sir.25 Unless there are further questions from the25, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Court, I'd like to reserve the rest of my time.2 QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Stevenson.3 Mr. Newsom, we'll hear from you.4 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN C. NEWSOM5 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS6 MR. NEWSOM: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it7 please the Court:8 I'd like to make three points this morning.9 I'd like to first discuss and to convince the10 Court that a challenge to a State's means of gaining11 venous access for purposes of accomplishing a lethal12 injection, a challenge that runs to the very core of the13 execution process, is indeed tantamount to a challenge of14 the imposition of the sentence itself and subject to15 habeas corpus restrictions.16 I hope also to -- to be able to address the17 remedies issue, which we were discussing with Mr.18 Stevenson at the end of -- of his argument.19 And third, I'd like to discuss the practical20 consequences of a decision in Nelson's favor in this case,21 which I think will be not only to unleash in Federal22 courts a torrent of -- of new challenges to all manner of23 State execution procedures, but also in the process,24 fundamentally to undermine Congress' intent to stem the25 tide of what President Clinton in his signing statement26, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425called endless death row appeals.QUESTION: On the -- on your first point, areyou going to address directly whether this is second or successive?MR. NEWSOM: I can certainly address that, Your Honor, and I can address it now, if you'd like.QUESTION: Yes.MR. NEWSOM: We simply cannot agree with -- with -- with Mr. Stevenson's contention here that this is second or successive, and I would like to point out to the Court that I -- that I think -­QUESTION: He says it's not.MR. NEWSOM: I'm sorry. That -- that is not second or successive. I'd like to point out to the Court that I think in fact there is a concession on the record in this case that it, in fact, is second or successive. Mr. Stevenson, of course, has -- has given the Court essentially a two-page footnote in his brief trying to walk away from -­QUESTION: You mean if it's treated as habeas.MR. NEWSOM: Correct. Our -- correct. Our position, of course, is that this -- that this sort of challenge is fundamentally a habeas challenge, and in answer to Justice Souter's question, I think that there is a concession on the record. Of course, this -- this27, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 issue, the second or successive issue, was not raised in2 the lower courts. It was raised for the first time in -­3 QUESTION: Well, it wasn't raised because he4 brought 1983. But, I mean, as I understand the -- the5 application of the Alabama rule, 1983 was ruled out6 because this either should have been brought in habeas or7 if it had been brought in habeas, it would have been8 barred under AEDPA, and it would have been barred under9 AEDPA, because it was second or successive. So I think10 regardless of -- of how we analyze it, we've got to get to11 that point.12 MR. NEWSOM: And our position certainly is, Your13 Honor, that this would have been barred as second or14 successive. I think Justice Scalia really hit the nail on15 the head. It is -- Mr. Stevenson, in his argument, just16 has not done business, I think, with the textual and17 structural gymnastics required to -- to make this petition18 anything other than second or successive. His position,19 in essence, is that any claim that is new, in the sense20 that it could not have been brought before, is by21 definition not second or successive.22 QUESTION: Well, isn't that a possibility? In23 other words, one of the things we've got to do is -- is24 give effect to the -- to the AEDPA text. We can give25 effect to the -- I'm not saying that we should read it28, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 this way, but we could give effect to the AEDPA text if we2 say that regardless of whether a claim was ripe or not as3 a factual matter, so long as there is new evidence,4 whatever new means, the evidence is -- is not going to5 entitle him to relief unless it satisfies the -- the6 innocence prong at the end of the test. We could say that7 and at the same time say, all right, that's how we give8 effect to AEDPA.9 But if there is something more than ripeness,10 which makes the difference between bringing the claim and11 not bringing the claim, then that goes to whether we12 should regard it as second or successive. There is13 something more here because this is a claim which simply14 did not arise. He could not have pleaded this claim at15 any point prior to the conclusion of -- of his habeas, and16 for that reason, we should interpret second or successive17 as not barring this because otherwise we would have a18 universe of claims, assuming they are proper habeas19 claims, that could never be brought even though they state20 a constitutional claim.21 MR. NEWSOM: My own sense, Justice Souter, is22 that that might just be slicing the bologna a little thin.23 Congress -- the -- the point of section 2244 in my view is24 certainly to get at claims that, for whatever reason,25 could not have been brought earlier, and I think the -­29, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

What I'm suggesting to you is that this is a good reason to say that the term, second or successive, does have some limiting effect.MR. NEWSOM: Perhaps, but I think that we are coming awfully close simply to -- to reading the limitations that Congress imposed on these sorts of petitions out of the statute.QUESTION: If Congress felt that way, they simply wouldn't have added the second condition.MR. NEWSOM: That's certainly the positionthat -­QUESTION: They would have just said the facts -- the factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence. That describes a situation in which there's no way that the person could have brought the constitutional claim.MR. NEWSOM: That's precisely -­QUESTION: But Congress didn't leave it there. It went on to add (ii), the facts underlying the claim would -- would show that the applicant is not guilty of the underlying offense.MR. NEWSOM: Which is exactly the point that I'm30, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 trying to make about stripping out the limitations. In2 section 2244 -­3 QUESTION: Except that to -- in order to make4 that point, you have to assume that Congress was adverting5 to this problem, and you have to assume that the words,6 second and successive, could -- could simply have been -­7 or the word subsequent could have been inserted in place8 of second or successive, which in fact is--isasetof9 phrases that -- that are terms of art.10 MR. NEWSOM: Well -­11 QUESTION: So I think -- I think the argument is12 a stretch.13 MR.NEWSOM: It--it--I--Ithinkitisnot14 the case, Your Honor, that -- that second or successive is15 a term of art in the sense that -- that AEDPA in section16 2244 merely incorporates the old abuse of the writ17 doctrine as -- as this Court made -­18 QUESTION: It doesn't necessarily incorporate19 the old abuse of the writ doctrine, but it seems to me20 that it does allude to a body of law by which we made -­21 because there was no other law involved, we had to draw22 conclusions as to whether it was appropriate or not23 appropriate to bar this claim. That's the kind of art24 that those words plug into. If they did want to plug into25 that, all they had to use was a neutral word like31, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

I'd like to start by addressing that position with Mr. Stevenson's concession here this morning that he has reiterated, that the chemical composition claim indeed is subject to habeas corpus restrictions. Of course, he seeks to distinguish his own claim from the chemical composition claim on the basis, he says, that his claim does not challenge the sentence itself, but merely a separate and unnecessary procedure.

And it is a little curious that the State isn't willing to talk to the prisoner's counsel about considering one of the other ways of doing it. Why is that?MR. NEWSOM: Well, let me just -- if I could answer in two parts.First, I think frankly that -- that on the record in this case, he's just not right about that. The record at pages 91 and 93 of the joint appendix makes clear that the specific procedure that he has challenged here, this cut-down procedure, will be used only as a last resort in the event that other means of gaining venous access -­QUESTION: Well, does that mean that -- what is the description of the other? The -­MR. NEWSOM: The percutaneous central line placement.QUESTION: Percutaneous. Is that something the State is prepared to use first?MR. NEWSOM: By all means. And that's part of the irony of this case.QUESTION: And you make that assurance to us34, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 today.2 MR. NEWSOM: Oh, absolutely. And -- and in3 fact, the -- the affidavits that we filed make that4 assurance.5 QUESTION: That will be attempted.6 MR. NEWSOM: Yes. And -- and let me just be7 clear that -- that the State, of course, has outlined a8 three-step process in this case. Steps one and two are a9 central line placement in the femoral vein and a central10 line placement in the jugular vein in the neck. Both of11 those, in essence, are percutaneous central line12 placements. So the parties are in agreement here that the13 first two procedures attempted should, in fact, be14 percutaneous central line placement.15 This cut-down procedure comes into play only in16 the event that those two procedures fail and as a last17 resort must be used to accomplish the sentence.18 QUESTION: Are you sure, Mr. Newsom -­19 QUESTION: Mr. Newsom, can I ask you a -- a20 hypothetical question? Because -- assume there's merit on21 the -- to the -- assume -- assume you have a case in which22 a week before the election -- the execution the State23 tells the inmate that they're going to hang him up by his24 thumbs and beat him with whips until he dies.

And I can'tagree, of course, with Mr. Stevenson's description of Alabama law.

It would be a habeas corpus proceeding?MR. NEWSOM: Well, he is, of course -- I -- I should just be careful about how I answer this question. There is an Alabama procedure called a rule 32 petition which is -- is, in effect, a -- a State habeas petition to challenge things like this. And his -- his position in his reply brief is that -- that a rule 32 petition would have been time barred. That may be true now, but it was not true as of the time that he filed this petition.QUESTION: Well, let's assume he -- assume he's denied relief in the Alabama courts. What can he do?

NEWSOM: Well, because our -- our position, Your Honor, is that 1983 is not intended to be used to fill the gaps in the remedial scheme that Congress has specifically set up in the habeas statutes, that instead section 1983 deals with different kinds of claims.QUESTION: Do you think AEDPA amended 1983?MR.

But this Court's decision -­QUESTION: If AEDPA had never been passed, would there be a remedy under 1983?MR.

I don't disagree with5 Mr. Stevenson that -- that a -- that a cut-down occurring6 for purposes of venous access, wholly divorced from an7 execution, is indeed a valid conditions of confinement8 claim.9 But this simply is not a conditions of10 confinement case.

Now, you're saying there's no remedy for such a person.MR. NEWSOM: In answer -­QUESTION: And indeed, the reason there's no remedy is because the courts are unable to use their normal rules to prevent abuse of process.MR. NEWSOM: Let me try to answer these various41, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 questions in order, if I can keep up.2 With respect to your first question, I think3 that to be sure, there is -- the -- the district court can4 always reject the claim, but the problem is that when5 these claims come in at the last minute and the complaint6 is chock full of -- of inflammatory language, then the7 district courts I think in -- in many cases will feel8 virtually coerced into granting the stay. And the stay9 itself is -- is an imposition or an impediment to the10 State's imposition of the sentence.11 QUESTION: But there's nothing in the language.12 I mean, as I read the language of 1983, it says there will13 be an action, if I'm subject to the deprivation of a right14 secured by the Constitution, which is what his claim is.15 So it fits within the language.16 MR. NEWSOM: To be sure.17 QUESTION: And there's nothing in the habeas18 statute that suggests it fits because habeas is when19 you're challenging a custody in violation of the20 Constitution. So the habeas language doesn't apply and21 1983 does apply.22 And there's nothing in Preiser that suggests it23 fits because that's where in fact we're talking about a24 challenge to fact or duration, and he's not challenging25 the fact and he's not challenging the duration.42, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 And there's nothing in Heck v. Humphrey because2 it talks about necessarily implying the invalidity of the3 conviction or sentence, and he's not talking about the4 conviction and he's not talking about the sentence that5 was given in the judgment anyway.6 All right. So how is it we get this claim which7 risks people who might have a valid claim not getting into8 court -­9 MR. NEWSOM: Okay. Now -­10 QUESTION: -- into the language of any prior11 case or the statute itself?12 MR. NEWSOM: Bear with me. Section 1983, to be13 sure, does not exclude this claim as a matter of its text,14 but this Court in Preiser did make clear that -- that15 where a -- where an action falls within the traditional16 scope of habeas corpus, that section 1983 must give way.17 When there is that intersection, section 1983 must give18 way.19 Now, in answer to part two of the question, to20 be sure, the habeas corpus -- the -- the specific language21 of the habeas corpus statute talks in terms of custody,22 but for more than 100 years, this Court has dealt with23 challenges to death sentences in habeas corpus petitions.24 And indeed, in Your Honor's opinion for the Court in25 Lonchar, this Court said that -- that -­43, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

As was just8 explained to us, this claim could not have been brought9 until 6 days before the scheduled date of execution10 because it was only at that point that he -- that he knew11 about this. So I don't think that Gomez -­12 But I did want to ask you something you said13 that seemed to me inconsistent with what -- what Mr.14 Stevenson told us. You said that it was only the -- they15 -- they agreed on what would be the first steps and that16 incorporated the percutaneous. I thought we were told by17 Mr. Stevenson that, no, everybody agreed on what the first18 procedure would be, but you then went immediately to the19 cut-down and they didn't. There was an intermediate step20 that you don't have in your protocol that they said would21 have been more respectful of this man's right to have a22 painless death.23 MR. NEWSOM: I think that's just not quite24 right. Percutaneous central line placement simply means25 central line placement through the skin.44, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: But was there -- whatever labels you2 use, was there something else that they asked for that you3 were not willing to give?4 MR. NEWSOM: They -- I'm sorry. Go ahead. I5 didn't mean to -­6 QUESTION: Yes. I thought I understood from the7 briefs that there was the first step. Everybody agreed if8 could do it that way, it would be okay. And then there9 was something else that the defendant said should have10 been done before you would ever get to the cut-down, and11 if you got to the cut-down, certainly you'd want to have12 proper medical personnel there to administer it.13 MR. NEWSOM: The point that I'm trying to make14 is that -- that in fact those first two -- what the -­15 what the plaintiffs asked for in this case was indeed16 percutaneous central line placement. That's the label not17 that I'm giving it but that they gave it. That's the18 procedure that they wanted, and now I'm trying to tell the19 Court that -- that percutaneous central line placement is20 a central line placement through the skin which options21 one and two, central line placement in the thigh, central22 line placement in the neck, are indeed both percutaneous23 central line placement. So, no, there is -- I think there24 is no disagreement here that percutaneous central line25 placement is the preferred method and will, in fact, be45, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 used, a cut-down to be used only if actually necessary.2 QUESTION: I'll ask Mr. Stevenson to clarify3 that.4 MR. NEWSOM: Fair enough.5 And if I can, just in answer to the -- to the6 first question that you were asking me, my -- the point7 that I was making about Gomez at this point in the8 argument is not necessarily, although I'd like to make9 this point as well, if I have time, an abuse point so10 much. We certainly recognize that the abuse at issue in11 Gomez is in some sense more -- more egregious than the12 abuse here. The point I was simply trying to make in13 answer -- in answer to Justice Breyer's question was that14 this Court in Lonchar pointed to Gomez for the proposition15 that habeas rules apply to method of execution claims16 without respect to what label is placed at the top of the17 pleading.18 QUESTION: It wasn't an issue in that case, was19 it? I was simply describing what happened. I mean, it20 was true -­21 MR. NEWSOM: Accurately describes.22 QUESTION: -- in that case it was -- yes,23 accurately described it. Nobody challenged it. So I24 wouldn't think that's terrifically strong precedent for25 the proposition that that is what should have happened.46, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

NEWSOM: Well, I think -- I think it is fairly clear, Your Honor, from Gomez and Lonchar, read together, that method of execution -­QUESTION: But is there anything other than -­ other than -- Lonchar, which is describing the posture of the case as it appeared here on a different issue?QUESTION: I thought we had a lot of cases that -- that say you can bring habeas to challenge not only -­QUESTION: That's what I want to know. I want to know which are the ones -­QUESTION: Let's go one at a time. Go ahead.QUESTION: I thought that it -- it was our law that -- that you can bring a habeas action to show that you are not guilty of the sentence, which always seemed to me a very strange formulation, but it's -- it's been done in a lot of cases.MR. NEWSOM: I think it is unquestionably correct, Justice Scalia, that this Court has held that habeas is an appropriate vehicle for a method of execution claim or otherwise. And my point in answer to Justice Breyer is I think that this Court's decisions in Gomez and Lonchar, read together, make -- come pretty close to saying that it is the appropriate -- the appropriate vehicle for challenging a method -­QUESTION: So those are the two cases which you47, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 feel are the strongest support for you.2 MR. NEWSOM: The strongest support I think, yes,3 for the -- for the fact that a -- that a habeas -- that4 habeas is -- is the appropriate vehicle for a method of5 execution claim.6 And I should just be clear -- and we're getting7 back here to Justice Kennedy's question -- that if -- if8 we're rolling back habeas all the way to simply the fact9 of the sentence and you can challenge nothing other than10 to say I should not have been sentenced to the death11 penalty, then we have a -- an even bigger floodgates issue12 than I had -- had at first imagined. District courts13 tomorrow will be dealing with everything short of I should14 not have been sentenced to the death penalty under section15 1983 without the protections that Congress built in -­16 built into AEDPA to protect against that very floodgates17 problem.18 QUESTION: But this is -- you made the point19 earlier that if this man were just in his cell and under a20 term of years, that this would be an entirely proper 198321 case. That's not the same for somebody who's says I'm22 innocent of the death penalty. That -- that one -- you23 can say, oh, yes, that's habeas and nothing else. Here,24 you've already said exactly what they're doing to him, if25 they had done it in order to get access to his vein for48, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 some other procedure while he's incarcerated, it would be2 a good, plain 1983 claim. But somehow when it gets to be3 connected with how he's going to die, it's no longer a4 1983.5 MR. NEWSOM: To be sure. There -- there is6 clearly some common sense line between a pure conditions7 of confinement claim, the fellow in his cell that has to8 have the cut-down for some other purpose, and the -- the9 fellow on death row who has to have the cut-down as a10 means of gaining access to his veins for purposes of11 accomplishing a lethal injection. Without the venous12 access, there is no lethal injection.13 I think there is a very real difference between14 those two situations, and I can't, as I'm standing here,15 promise you that I know precisely where that line is16 between the outer bounds of an execution procedures claim17 and the outer bounds of a conditions of confinement claim,18 but what I can tell you is that this claim runs to the19 very core of the State's execution process.20 QUESTION: Well, but -- but is it? I mean, you21 -- you said without venous access, there -- there is no -­22 there's no execution by lethal injection. But there is23 execution by lethal injection without cut-down. And -­24 and the question in each case is is the cut-down25 gratuitous. Calling the cut-down gratuitous for purposes49, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 of injection does not challenge the legality of injection.2 MR. NEWSOM: It just strikes me, Justice Souter,3 that that with respect -- well, let me answer in two ways.4 First, as I said earlier, I think the record in5 this case is clear that the cut-down becomes a live issue6 only in -- in the event that it is necessary.7 Point two, and I think the more important point,8 is that it just strikes me as a bad way to administer the9 rule on a going-forward basis for a district court to have10 to sift through on a procedure-by-procedure basis to11 determine is this procedure in fact medically,12 scientifically necessary to accomplish the sentence, in13 which case Mr. Stevenson I think concedes that it's a14 habeas petition, but it's not.15 QUESTION: What you're doing is asking all the16 courts, including this one, to ignore the very issue and17 simply say, in effect, under AEDPA we don't care. I mean,18 we're somewhere between the devil and the deep blue sea19 here, and -- and I would suppose there -- there ought to20 be a middle ground.21 MR. NEWSOM: I certainly am not suggesting in22 any -- to any extent that -- and I don't think it's true23 -- that -- that to extent that, say, a -- a technically24 unnecessary but nonetheless chosen procedure for gaining25 venous access is unreviewable. That's the point -- that's50, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 the discussion that I was having with Justice -­2 QUESTION: That's I thought is what he wanted3 reviewed. He wants to be able to litigate the necessity4 of this. He claims that it is gratuitous. That's his5 point.6 MR. NEWSOM: Right. And -- and our point is -­7 is that that is fine if he wants to litigate and we will8 litigate and fight him tooth and nail in the appropriate9 forum. The appropriate forum in this case -­10 QUESTION: There is no appropriate forum because11 the appropriate forum was closed to him before you12 announced, A, that you were going to execute him by13 injection and, B, that you were going to use this14 procedure as a last resort.15 MR. NEWSOM: With respect, Justice Souter, the16 appropriate forum in this case exists. It exists in the17 State court system. It is -- it simply is not the case18 that Mr. -- that Mr. Nelson is out of luck entirely19 without a 1983 -­20 QUESTION: Well, let's try this again. What21 procedure is open to him in the State of Alabama? We were22 told that no procedure was.23 MR. NEWSOM: Your Honor, I think that there24 certainly are procedures. We outlined procedures in our25 brief, namely, the two that we have not discussed to this51, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 point were that Mr. Nelson could have filed a response to2 the State's motion to set the execution date, and two, he3 could have filed a motion to stay the execution in State4 court. Now -­5 QUESTION: Well, we're talking about now. What6 is open to the prisoner today -­7 MR. NEWSOM: Those -­8 QUESTION: -- in Alabama?9 MR. NEWSOM: Those procedures, Your Honor, are10 in fact open to -- to the prisoner today because when this11 Court stayed the execution, the death warrant expired. We12 will now need to go back to the Alabama Supreme Court,13 even -- even in the event that we prevail here and ask for14 a new death warrant, at which point Mr. Nelson can -- can15 participate in the State process -­16 QUESTION: And do you represent he can get a17 hearing on the merits of his arguments in one of those18 procedures?19 MR. NEWSOM: What I -- what I can represent to20 the Court is that I am certainly not aware of any21 procedural bars that exist to him participating in either22 one of those processes, and that certainly with respect to23 Mr. Nelson, we would -- we would be glad to waive any24 procedural bar that did exist. We would certainly expect25 the -­52, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

NEWSOM: Sure. If he -- if he chooses, as --aswehopehewill--aswehopehewouldhaveandnow hope he will, to participate in the State process, he will get a hearing on the merits of his Eighth Amendment claim. And again, I'm not suggesting -­QUESTION: But -- but if he does and loses, his only access to the Federal courts is by a petition for an original writ here.MR. NEWSOM: That's right and that's -- that's very close, Your Honor, to the -- to the very situation that this Court dealt with in Allen v. McCurry.QUESTION: He would also have the opportunity to seek a stay, would he not, from this Court from the decision of the Alabama court saying that his Eighth Amendment claim was -­MR. NEWSOM: To -- to be sure. This Court always retains cert jurisdiction over merits determinations of State courts.QUESTION: Would we have to go into the question of whether that's a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in a case, say, much worse than this one? It's horrendous. He couldn't raise it before. No access to a53, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Federal district court.2 MR. NEWSOM: I don't think, Justice Breyer, that3 this case even presents a suspension -­4 QUESTION: No, no, no. But just imagine this5 case with much horrible circumstance because your rule of6 law is the same, irrespective of the horror of the7 circumstance. So there would be no claim but a State8 court for a person who could never had brought a Federal9 habeas because the issue didn't arise. Is that a10 suspension of the writ of habeas corpus not in time of11 war?12 MR. NEWSOM: I think it's not in this Court -­13 QUESTION: And you'd refer me, because there's14 only a minute, to read on that so I'd become convinced15 what?16 MR. NEWSOM: Please read Felker. This Court's17 decision in Felker is quite clear that pointing18 specifically to section 2244, this Court said Congress, by19 and large, gets to make judgments about the scope of the20 writ. Section 2244 is not a suspension. We're not even21 in the ball park of an across-the-board bar on -- on22 jurisdiction.23 QUESTION: But if we -- we're doing 1983, then24 there's no -- there's no exhaustion requirement.25 There's -­54, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. NEWSOM: That's -- that's certainly true,2 but I guess it assumes that -- that I'm wrong about -­3 about the nature of this claim. Our position, of course,4 as I've tried to convince the Court -­5 QUESTION: But you've said it is a good 19836 claim except if it -- if it is in relation to the7 administration of the death sentence.8 MR. NEWSOM: Your -- that's right, Your Honor,9 and this will give me I think a -- as good an opportunity10 as I can to try to sum up our position in this case.11 We have certainly made the argument that a12 challenge to a State's means of gaining venous access, a13 challenge to -- to a procedure for carrying out an14 execution is in and of itself -- should be understood to15 be a challenge to the sentence itself and subject to16 habeas corpus restrictions.17 The State amici, the 30 States who have18 participated in this case on our behalf, have made very19 strongly the argument that a -- that a stay of execution20 in and of itself should be understood as a challenge to21 the sentence.22 The Court need not go so far in either respect23 with us today. All we ask the Court to hold today is that24 where -- where an inmate both challenges a procedure for25 carrying out his execution and, in essence, tries to tell55, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 the State, dictate to the State how to go about conducting2 that execution, and seeks a stay of that execution to give3 himself time to engage in that reordering of the process,4 that that should be understood as a challenge to the5 sentence.6 QUESTION: May I -­7 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Newsom.8 Mr. Stevenson, you have 8 minutes remaining.9 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN STEVENSON10 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER11 MR. STEVENSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.12 I -- I'd like to start first by -- by trying13 desperately to -- to inform this Court that there is no14 remedy available to Mr. Nelson in State court. I15 appreciate Mr. Newsom's argument on this point, but rule16 32 is not an available option. I -­17 QUESTION: Before you go into that, would you18 clarify one thing for me I want? Did they object in the19 district court to -- on the ground there was a failure to20 exhaust State remedies?21 MR. STEVENSON: No, they did not. No, Justice22 Stevens. There's never been any -­23 QUESTION: And the district court did not rule24 on the claim that there was --25 MR. STEVENSON: Absolutely, and the problem here56, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 is, again, none of these issues were -- were permitted to2 -- to develop.3 Let me just start with the State court question.4 Rule 32 has the same kind of factual innocence5 requirement. For the 6-month time line that Mr. Newsom6 was talking about, yes, you can file a new successive7 State court petition under rule 32, but just as you have8 to in the Federal context, the State court petition has to9 allege factual innocence.10 In footnote 19 of our reply brief, I cite a11 case, Tarver v. State. It's a case where immediately12 before an execution, the prosecutor admitted that he had13 excluded African Americans from jury service in a14 discriminatory manner. He said here's our new evidence.15 The execution be -- should be stopped. The Court of16 Criminal Appeals and the Alabama Supreme Court held no.17 New evidence claims must go to factual innocence. That's18 32.1(e). There is no remedy available.19 Mr. Newsom talks about filing something in the20 State supreme court. The State supreme court of Alabama21 has no jurisdiction -­22 QUESTION: But that's a little different from a23 case that alleges a current impending constitutional24 violation.25 MR. STEVENSON: Yes, Your Honor. And I could57, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 speak to that because in the other case we cite in2 footnote 19, we did that too. In the first Tarver case,3 this Court had granted cert on the constitutionality of4 execution by electrocution. The case was pending at this5 Court. We went to the State courts of Alabama saying,6 look, the State supreme -- the United States Supreme Court7 is about to review this. We've got new evidence that8 electrocutions in Alabama are being conducted in an9 unconstitutional manner. Let us in. No. Your method of10 execution claim is not cognizable because the 2-year11 statute of limitations at that time is an absolute bar.12 The courts have no jurisdiction to adjudicate any13 constitutional claim unless it is a new evidence innocence14 claim. The Alabama Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to15 give us a merits review on this issue.16 QUESTION: We were told there were a couple of17 other methods besides rule 32.18 MR. STEVENSON: There are none, Justice19 O'Connor. The only thing we could do is file a motion for20 a stay. At the point at which the stay motion was21 requested here, April of 2000, Mr. Nelson didn't want a22 stay. He doesn't want a stay of execution. He actually23 wants his execution to be carried out.24 QUESTION: Well, he did ask for a stay you said,25 in order that this could be resolved.58, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. STEVENSON: Absolutely.2 QUESTION: So, as I understand it, he does want3 a stay in order that this can be heard.4 MR. STEVENSON: Well, he wants a stay to -- he5 wants to enjoin the kind of conduct that we're talking6 about here, but filing a stay motion in the Alabama7 Supreme Court would not get him merits review where we8 could present the kind of facts that we're now presenting.9 And I have to say that access to the Federal10 courts in this case has really changed the State's11 position. Nothing that we've been talking about here this12 afternoon about what they intend to do was ever presented13 to Mr. Nelson until he got in front of the Federal judge.14 In front of the Federal judge, they said for the first15 time, we will try to do a peripheral stick, not16 percutaneous invasion. It's a different procedure. And17 at page 109 of our joint appendix, the district court18 finds -- and I'm reading here -- the defendants have19 offered no explanation as to why they intend to use a cut­20 down procedure instead of a percutaneous central line21 placement.22 They have never made that offer. They're making23 it here today. It's because we're in court, and of24 course, we can't get to court unless this Court recognizes25 our authority to bring a legitimate challenge that does59, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425not attempt to invalidate his conviction or sentence. There is a gap.QUESTION: Well, what we heard today, does that satisfy the prisoner's request that these -- all of these other things be used first?MR. STEVENSON: Well, if -- if the State had then and would now concede that percutaneous line placement would be an acceptable method, then yes. That's all we were seeking. But of course, without a remedy -­QUESTION: Is that not what was said today?MR. STEVENSON: Well, it's not said in a way that we can enforce, Your Honor. Until we can go to the district court, go to a court, and enforce any of these representations, we are at risk. And that's all we're asking. That's all Mr. Nelson asked in the first instance.And the irony, of course, is if it had been permitted to proceed, I think we would have resolved this. He'd already be executed. And I think their conduct today strengthens that position. And that's why we would urgently ask this Court to reverse the rule that the Eleventh Circuit is now applying which bars prisoners like Mr. Nelson from getting Federal review. It's not asking a lot.And I understand the fears, but I don't agree60, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 with Mr. Newsom that this is opening up anything. People2 can file complaints now. They could have done it for the3 last 20 years. But district courts are not obligated to4 review those complaints. The PLRA puts restrictions on5 1983 actions. The habeas corpus right permits -- creates6 restrictions.7 What this Court shouldn't do out of fear is to8 block prisoners like Mr. Nelson who have legitimate9 constitutional complaints from getting remedies that are10 precisely the kinds of claims that could and should be11 resolved in the manner that they've been discussed about12 -- discussed today easily. We tried to exhaust the13 administrative remedies, but until we got in front a14 Federal judge, no one would allow us to be heard. And15 that's simply the problem that we face in this case and16 why relief is required. And I think that's why there17 ought to be the kind of Federal -- Federal remedy that18 Justice Breyer has indicated because without it, our19 prisoners are at risk.20 Unless there are further questions, I'll -- I'll21 rest -­22 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.23 Stevenson.24 The case is submitted.25 (Whereupon, at 12:02 p.m., the case in the61, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.
