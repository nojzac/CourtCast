JONES:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleaseP ROCEEDINGS                                    (11:00 a.m.)CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argumentnext in Number 99-859, Central Green Company v. the United10 the Court:11              Petitioner's property is being damaged by water12    leaking from the Madera Canal.  The Canal is an irrigation13    facility and it passes irrigation water to the farmers of14    Madera County.  We were told by the Ninth Circuit panel15    below that all of the water in this canal constitutes16    flood water under the immunity provisions of the Flood17    Control Act of 1928 solely by virtue of the fact that this18    canal is part of the Central Valley project, a large19    Federal water project covering one-third of the State of20    California, with multiple component parts and with21    multiple originating purposes, only one of which was flood22    control.2324253          The Ninth Circuit made this ruling noting thatthis canal was not a flood control project by itself, andserved no flood control purpose.  The Ninth Circuit1    further indicated --2              QUESTION:  Did they concede that it served no3    flood control purpose?  I wasn't aware of that.45 Honor? 67 8    served no flood control purpose. 9              QUESTION:  And did the Ninth Circuit said that10    it served no flood control purpose?1112    decision.1314    be released into the Madera Canal for flood control15    purposes, for example to make more room in the reservoir16    for flood waters that are anticipated?  Could that happen?17              MR. JONES:  Yes.  It would be under a relatively18    limited circumstances and the problem there is, this water19    is liquid gold.  They marshall it, they organize it, and20    they know where it goes and why, and if they're going to21    spill it into that ground --22              QUESTION:  It's liquid gold until December.23              MR. JONES:  Actually, not necessarily, Your24    Honor, because for most of the years in question they25    don't put water into that canal even in December.  The4MR. JONES:  They being the United States, YourQUESTION:  Yes.MR. JONES:  No.  They did not concede that itMR. JONES:  Yes, it did, as part of itsQUESTION:  Now, do you concede that water could 1    amount of flood space that they reserve in this canal is 2    only 30 percent of the entire -- in the lake is only 30 3    percent of the entire facility. 4              QUESTION:  Well, I have to say -- I recognize 5    the case is here on dismissal of the pleadings. 6              MR. JONES:  Correct. 7              QUESTION:  And that you have indicated in your 8    brief that in some events maybe the case should go back, 9    that we shouldn't just rule for the Goverment.  I am10    troubled by the assumption of the Ninth Circuit that the11    canal is not related to flood control in any respect.12    That's the inference I get from its statement, and I find13    that somewhat troubling.14              MR. JONES:  That issue was not briefed at the15    Ninth Circuit level, Your Honor, but the canal itself was16    authorized under the reclamation laws and 100 percent of17    its costs were reimbursed to the United States under those18    rules.  The canal itself is not part of the flood routing19    system of Millerton Lake.20              QUESTION:  Well, can't it be, though -- I mean,21    the Government points out in the brief that there are22    limitations in a flood situation on the amount of water23    that can be discharged downstream, and in order to comply24    with those limitations they might have to use this canal25    to run off surplus water, so the United States is saying5 1    that there certainly are situations in which this canal 2    would have a flood control use.  Do you concede that 3    that's at least possible? 4              MR. JONES:  I do. 5              QUESTION:  Okay. 6              MR. JONES:  But the fact of the matter is that 7    the facility itself is operated -- if that ever occurred, 8    still it would be a question of fact we'd have to address 9    below, but --10              QUESTION:  And you would say that if the11    escaping water resulted from that particular kind of flood12    control use there would be immunity.  If the escaping13    water was not so related there would be no immunity, and14    you'd in effect have to apportion the damage -- well, not15    apportion the damages.  You'd have to do a causation16 analysis.17              MR. JONES:  That is exactly correct, Your Honor.18              QUESTION:  Yeah.19              QUESTION:  So you say flood waters would include20    two things, waters going through a facility that was21    primarily built for flood control purposes, no?  What are22    your categories?  What does flood waters consist of?23              MR. JONES:  Flood waters consist of, and I think24    this Court's statement in United States v. James at page25    605 is relatively clear.  It requires a Federal flood6 1    control project, and the flood waters must be waters that 2    are contained in or passing through that project for 3    purposes of or related to flood control. 4              QUESTION:  Well, related -- related to -- I 5    mean, that's pretty wide.  If we'd apply that, I think you6 lose here. 7              MR. JONES:  I would challenge that a little bit, 8    Your Honor, respectfully.  I think -- 9              QUESTION:  You acknowledge it's remotely10    enough -- it's remotely related to flood control in that11    should there be a flood they can release some of the12    excess flood waters through this canal.13              MR. JONES:  That might make the canal remotely14    related to flood control, but it doesn't make the waters15    that are passing through the canal -- under circumstances16    in the middle of summer, it's 100 degress out, the river17    is dry down below the dam 20 miles, and they're diverting18    the water into the canal under contractual obligations,19    where it's bought and paid for.  Under those20    circumstances, I think the water, which is what the21    statute speaks to, is not flood water.22              QUESTION:  Suppose at that point the dam itself23    started to leak and caused damage.  Would the Government24    be immune in that instance?25              MR. JONES:  Assuming it's a Federal flood71 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9control project, Friant Dam is, it's leaking water intothe river channel.  That is part of the floodway.  Whatyou're looking at is the natural flow of this river andthey put a dam in it, and if it leaks into the river --          QUESTION:  And you're saying the Government thenwould be immune because it's in the river bed?          MR. JONES:  It's leaking into the floodway ofthe river itself.  It's leaking into the channel, which isthe very river course.          QUESTION:  So whether or not it's flood waterdepends on where it ultimately comes out?          MR. JONES:  It might if that's part of thefacility.  I mean -- what you're looking at is, is theriver chanenl runs -- this facility, if it were operatedas a flood control facility, would impound water at mostonce every 4 years.          QUESTION:  Well, in effect you want theopportunity to go back and establish that the water in theMadera Canal has never been released in connection withflood control purposes.          MR. JONES:  Well, Your Honor, I think two          QUESTION:  Is that right?          MR. JONES:  Yes, we want the opportunity to goback, and I think that we want to be able to establish810111213141516171819202122    things.2324 25 1    that the water has never been -- or at least at times has 2    been released for purposes other than flood control. 3              QUESTION:  May it not depend on the kind of 4    claim you're making against the Government?  I mean, if 5    water is -- someone is drowned in a boat accident as a 6    result of flood waters being released out of a dam, you 7    have a single incident that occurs right then.  I take it 8    your claim is based on leaching out, or some sort of 9    damage to the soil over a period of years.10              MR. JONES:  That's correct.  The canal is -- the11    lining of the canal is cracking, and it's leaking water,12    it's raising the water table and it's --13              QUESTION:  So it didn't happen on any one day.14    It happened --15              MR. JONES:  That's right.16              QUESTION:  It seems to me that makes your case a17    little harder, because it's project-related.  This is not18    like the case where the Corps of Engineers boat was being19    driven by a drunk driver, which doesn't seem to have much20    to do with floods at all.21              But here, it has to do with the way the whole22    facility was constructed, and that seems to me to be a23    harder case for you.24              MR. JONES:  I'm not sure I understand the part25    about the way the facility was constructed.  Are you9 1    talking about the canal or the dam? 2              QUESTION:  It's a long-term damage.  The damage 3    occurs over a period of time because of the way that the 4    canal was constructed, or misconstructed, and that seems 5    to me to be more closely related to the purpose of 6    immunity, which is to protect the Government when it 7    erects this facility, than in some of these cases where 8    you have -- where people are sucked down into tunnels and 9    so forth during irrigation season.10              MR. JONES:  I don't think that that's what we're11    saying.  What we're saying is, is that the facility -- one12    of our claims is that they're just not maintaining it.13    The concrete cracks, they patch some of it, they don't14    patch the others, and some of it is deteriorating, and it15    needs to be repaired.16              QUESTION:  But you could say the same thing if17    it were the dam.18              MR. JONES:  We could, except the dam would be19    passing water right into the floodway itself.  This, it20    passes on to other people's property.  The dam got flowage21    rights.  When Friant was built they obtained flowage22    rights to pass water in cetain ways and  the fact that the23    dam is either leaking or has its gates open isn't going to24    give rise to a claim.25              QUESTION:  This whole scenario, in effect, was10 1    quite beyond the contemplation of Congress in 1928.  When 2    it's talking about flooding on the Mississippi.  There are 3    no dams on the Mississippi River, needless to say. 4              MR. JONES:  I understand, Your Honor, and that's 5    very true.  This -- the clear context, and I think this 6    Court in James said that, that the context was a 7    floodworks project like the Mississippi River, and we're 8    not dealing with a floodworks project like the Mississippi 9    River.  We're dealing --10              QUESTION:  You say, if I understand your case,11    you wouldn't take a position that flood waters are12    never -- you're not going to try to prove that flood13    waters were never released through this canal, but you14    would say categorically that the canal itself, when15    constructed, had no flood control purpose.16              MR. JONES:  I think that's absolutely true,17    because if this was -- if this canal was going to be18    constructed for flood control they would have never built19    it.  They'd have never built that dam.  They'd have built20    it much lower -- there's only a fraction of the space of21    this whole facility that serves any flood purposes.22              QUESTION:  Well, would you concede that the23    Friant dam has a substantial flood control purpose?24              MR. JONES:  It definitely provides some flood25    relief.  I don't know that I would say it provides a11 1    substantial flood purpose, because if they open the gates 2    to channel capacity it would not impound a drop of water 3    for 3 years at a time, maybe 1 year it would impound water 4    for a limited period of time and they'd never reach 25 5    percent or 20 percent of this capacity -- 6              QUESTION:  But it's part of an entire project. 7    The Sacramento River waters couldn't go to the San Joaquin 8    if the Friant didn't back -- didn't stop the natural9 tributary.10              MR. JONES:  Yes they do route the Sacramento11    River water down into the San Joaquin Valley and they do12    route the water of the river --13              QUESTION:  And they can only do that because of14    the Friant Dam.15              MR. JONES:  But you don't impound water like16    this for flood control.  If you're going to impound water17    in the way they impound it -- I mean, the United States18    said in their brief at page 3, you impound water as soon19    as posisble for irrigation, and you hold it as long as you20    can until you need it, and that's what they do with this21    facility, and they said you impound water only at the last22    moment for flood control when you have to and you evacuate23    it as quickly as possible.  This facility just isn't24    operated that way.25              QUESTION:  Well, suppose it is, in the sense12 1    that when the people were thinking of building this, they 2    thought, we'll use it mostly for irrigation, but you know 3    the San Joaquin floods sometimes too and then what we'll 4    do is we'll have the water held behind the dam.  It 5    normally will go into the San Joaquin River, sometimes 6    there's too much of it, sometimes we'll divert it up 7    through the canal, it'll run into the Chowchilla River or 8    the Fresno River.  So they're thinking both.  They agree 9    most of the time, irrigation, some of the time, for just10    overflow of flood water.  And who wins?  And moreover,11    there's a crack in the canal, so that means most of the12    time the water that's running out is water that would be13    there for irrigation, and some of the time the water that14    runs out through the crack is water that would be -- would15    have been released because there was too much water behind16    the dam and the San Joaquin River was filled up.  Right,17    now, who wins under those circumstances?18              MR. JONES:  The first presumption -- the reason19    the dam is because of the irrigation retention, but20    assuming I understand the hypothetical, and I think I do,21    the water that would go into the canal under those22    circumstances may very well be flood water, and it may23    very well carry the immunity, but it would be in a very24    limited circumstance.25              QUESTION:  All right, so you want to divide it13 1    say proportionate 90-10.  But another to do it is to say 2    that so long as the water that's sometimes in that canal 3    and running out through the crack that was too big is 4    flood water, so long as that's so, as long as that's a 5    substantial amount of the water that's causing the damage, 6    i.e. as long as a substantial amount is water that would 7    have otherwise gone into the San Joaquin River but did not 8    because there is too much water behind the dam and the 9    river was filled up, as long as that's substantial, the10    Government's entirely immune.11              MR. JONES:  Is that -- I mean, it sounds like12    that's a causal --13              QUESTION:  That's the opposite theory one way,14    it's very simple case that way.15              You know, there's no doubt that there's16    substantial -- that this is, I'd say, substantially17    related to flood control, though mostly related to18    irrigation, the canal, then there's no doubt that some of19    the time the river, the water that goes through that canal20    is water that would otherwise be dumped into the San21    Joaquin, that it was all filled up, but that's a fairly22    small but still substantial amount of time.23              And there's no doubt that that water causes some24    of the damage, but surely not even half.  All right.  So25    then I think it comles down to, do we do it on a14 1    proportional basis, or do you do it on a, well, if it's 2    substantially mixed in, you lose? 3              MR. JONES:  I think our position -- 4              QUESTION:  How do you analyze it, really? 5              MR. JONES:  Well, it seems to me there's a 6    couple of different issues, and if I understood the 7    question properly you're saying if you have a certain 8    percentage of the water going down the canal is flood 9    water, and a certain percentage of the water going down10    the canal, a larger percentage, is irrigation water, is11    not immune, then wouldn't you simply look at the damages12    and deal with that as a matter of causation, because some13    of that water was not subject to the immunity.  It clearly14    wasn't, and if that wasn't enough to damage the trees, if15    the amount of water that went in the canal was not enough16    to damage the trees, that was not immune.17              QUESTION:  Well, I gather it's already a stretch18    to say, as James said, that water which is held behind a19    dam that is not really flood water, it's water that's been20    accumulating over the summer, but if the dam is for flood-21    control purposes we're going to consider all that water22    flood water.23              That's a very unusual use of the term, flood24    waters.  I mean, you think about the raging Mississippi.25    Those are flood waters.15 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8    here. 9              QUESTION:  But that's the Ninth Circuit test, in10 effect. 111213141516171819202122232425          MR. JONES:  Well, yeah.  What the Ninth Circuitsaid is that this immunity, the way they're construing itis so broad that they could not think of a single instancewhere the immunity did not apply in the Central Valley --          QUESTION:  It almost reads as though the NinthCircuit said that but didn't want to say it, that it wasvery troubled by it's own holding.          MR. JONES:  I was there at the argument, and Ithink the court was very troubled by what they were havingto do.          QUESTION:  I think what Justice Breyer'squestion suggests is that if we were trying to determinecausation in order to impose liability, to imposeliability, if there are multiple causes, multiple actors,if there's a substantial cause then the actor is joint and16          Then what the Government wants is yet anotherextension, and what Justice Breyer was proposing, and thatis that any facility that is even used in part for floodcontrol purposes, all the water passing through thatfacility, including the nonflood water part, becomes floodwaters.  That stretches it pretty thin, pretty thin.MR. JONES:  Then that's what we think happened 1    severally liable for 100 percent of the damage. 2              The mirror image of that might be that you have 3    100 percent immunity if a substantial purpose of the 4    facility is irrigation, and I guess the problem with that 5    from your standpoint is that we're just stacking the deck. 6              MR. JONES:  Right. 7              QUESTION:  We're saying, well, you also have a 8    substantial cause, which is irrigation, and you're not 9    immune for that, which leaves us, I guess, right back10    where we started.  I guess standard tort principles don't11    seem to help us much.12              QUESTION:  Well, are you -- I take it that all13    you really want us to do here is to say that the Ninth14    Circuit test,15    not-wholly-unrelated test, either is a matter of substance16    or is a matter of creating a presumption in applying the17    James test, went beyond James, and that we ought to18    reverse or vacate because that erroneous standard was19    applied, and I take it that you don't really need to have20    us or want us necessarily to do anything more at this21    stage except send it back and say, apply James the way we22    wrote James, and then if you don't like it later, maybe23    there'll be another appeal, but am I right that that's all24    you really want us to do, is to say that not-wholly-25    unrelated goes beyond James?                                  171 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. JONES:  Yes.  I think that their test isnot-wholly-unrelated to the project, which I think is alsocompounding the problem.          QUESTION:  Yes.          MR. JONES:  And so we think the not-wholly-unrelated test is the wrong test applied to the wrong --          QUESTION:  So you're saying they're using thewrong category: project.          MR. JONES:  Right.          QUESTION:  And they're using in effect a --they're creating a kind of presumptoin in applying thatcategory and that presumption is also inconsistent withthe way we wrote James, even if they got the categoryright, is that --          MR. JONES:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  Do I understand you?          MR. JONES:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  I thought you were asking to do more,not to leave -- to say the Ninth Circuit test is no good,because it's wholly-related -- not-unrelated won't do.  Ithought you were asking us to substitute another testwhich you had identified as a primary purpose test.          Justice Breyer introduced yet another test,which sounded to me like you figured out how much of theflow was for irrigation, how much for flood control, and18 1    then you do kind of an apportionment that wouldn't be an 2    all-or-nothing immunity.  I thought that's what he was3 saying. 4              But you're saying, if the primary purpose is 5    irrigation, then there's no immunity, even if a 6    substantial purpose would be flood control. 7              MR. JONES:  What happened is, we don't believe 8    we need to go much beyond the language of James as long as910    not-wholly-unrelated means something more than remotely11    incidental, but we offered -- in the case the Court12    decided to try to use this case as a test, we offered a13    test.  We put together what we thought made sense in light14    of the Flood Control Act and the Federal Tort Claims Act15    and tried to determine how it would be applied in a16    multipurpose facility.17              QUESTION:  Well, James, as the Chief Justice18    indicated, didn't apply to a system where we had19    irrigation facilities.20              It does seem to me that the -- that your primary21    purpose does not give the Government quite enough22    protection, because a major purpose, part of the major23    design of this entire system is for flood control24    purposes.25              On the other hand, I'm not quite sure how to191 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425answer your argument that that protects the Government inevery single instance.  Is a substantial -- if we saidthe -- if flood control is a substantial reason for thefacility and for the operation that caused the damage,could you go back for trial on that?          MR. JONES:  Yes, it --          QUESTION:  And would it give the district courtenough guidance?          MR. JONES:  It would if you didn't takesubstantial-to-the-injury and say, if flood water was asubstantial contributing cause to the injury you have noclaim at all, as opposed to saying, if it's a substantialpart of the facility, flood control is a substantial partof the facility and, in order for the flood water to beflood water, it has to have a substantial relationship toflood control, then that's fine.          But if you take it to the next step of theinjury as a cause, then you could wipe out our injurycompletely, even though three-quarters of it was caused bythe United States --          QUESTION:  Well, can you sustain a propositionthat the facility that should be examined is the MaderaCanal in this case?          MR. JONES:  Yes.          QUESTION:  Because it seems to me if the only201    facility we examine is the Madera Canal, and what it may2    get -- you certainly do not give anything close to a3    substantial use for flood control.4              MR. JONES:  I think that there is no substantial5    use of that canal for flood control based on anything I've6 seen.7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Do I understand correctly, Mr. Jones,that you're willing to acknowledge that the damages yourclient received should be reduced by the proportion of thetotal water going through the canal that is really floodwater under your interpretation of flood water?          MR. JONES:  I think we'd have to.          QUESTION:  Okay.          MR. JONES:  Yes.          QUESTION:  Let me ask you a question which Ishould know the answer to, but I don't, and I want help.Who has the burden of proof on the immunity here?          MR. JONES:  It's raised as a matter ofjurisdiction, and so I think it's our burden --          QUESTION:  So it's your burden.  It's ajurisdictional issue and it's your burden.          QUESTION:  With respect to the James test, Mr.Jones, there's a phrase in it that I don't understand, andcould you tell me how you read the phrase that says thatimmunity extends to waters flood control projects cannot211 control? 2              MR. JONES:  Yeah, we read that language to say, 3    first of all, the reference to waters is flood waters, not 4    any water, and we read it to say that in the normal 5    operations of the facility, if the water overrides the 6    banks, or overrides whatever control facilities are 7    constructed, the United States would not be liable for 8    injuries caused by that overriding. 9              We think that's wholly different than what we're10    dealing with here, where it's just a continuous leak out11    of a nonmaintained facility, and if the water was not12    flood water going into the canal, it can't be flood water13    leaking out.14              QUESTION:  I have some difficulty in adopting a15    test that this is an irrigation facility.  It seems to me16    that the whole design of the Central Valley project is17    that it's an integrated whole, and I don't know how we18    could take different pieces, the Madera Canal, the Friant19    Current Canal, which I take it takes a much larger volume20    of water, and even the Friant Dam itself and say, well,21    this is primarily irrigation.  I just don't think you can22    do that with the Central Valley project.23              MR. JONES:  I think the Central Valley project24    can be identified by segments of the project.  I25    wouldn't -- I can't speak to all of it, but I can speak to221 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9the Madera Canal.          The Madera Canal itself was funded as anirrigation project.  It can relieve the lake of pressure,so to speak, into another natural waterway that itself isout of the same watershed, so when you look at thetotality of it, it doesn't make sense for them to operatethis for a flood facility.  They wouldn't put water intothe Madera Canal necessarily just to run it to anotherriver that itself would be flooding.          QUESTION:  Well, I have trouble with that intimes of high water.  I just don't think that's right, butthat's for the trier of fact to figure out.  I'm just notsure what test we'd use in order to separate out discreteparts of the Central Valley project and say some areirrigation, some are not.          Much of the time, all the project is used forirrigation.  There's no flood danger.          MR. JONES:  That's true.  This Court did --          QUESTION:  There's latent flood danger, and theentire project is designed to accommodate that.          MR. JONES:  I think that that's a fair          QUESTION:  May I just ask this -- isn't it truethat the Government itself classified -- has class I waterand class II water that goes through this project, and2310111213141516171819202122    statement.23 24 251 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that class I water would never be flood water?          MR. JONES:  I believe that that's correct, and Ithink they have conceded that.          Interestingly enough, in their contract with theMadera Irrigation District they define irrigation water aswater used primarily in the production of agriculturalcrops or livestock, including domestic use incidentalthereto and watering of livestock.  That's at page 8 oftheir supplemental lodging.          QUESTION:  Does the agreement require some kindof consent by the parties to release any flood water inthe Madera Canal?          MR. JONES:  I'm not aware of any consent beingrequired.  I think they have the power to do that underthe circumstances.          QUESTION:  Unilaterally?  I thought there wassomething in the agreement.          QUESTION:  I think Justice O'Connor is right.In a document I have called the Post Flood Assessment itsays that flood releases may also be made of the FriantCurrent Canal and Madera Canal if all parties agree, andthat's rather baffling to me --          MR. JONES:  Well, I apologize, but thatobviously is in the contract.          QUESTION:  I thought it was.                            241 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  You mentioned, or Justice Kennedyearlier mentioned some problems that the trier of factwould have.  One of those problems might be the existenceof records for the purpose to apply this apportionmentrule.  Do you -- can you represent that in fact they dokeep sufficiently detailed records to know when they'reusing the canal for flood control run-off and when they'reusing it for normal irrigation purposes?          MR. JONES:  I believe those records mostdefinitely exist.  They calibrate --          QUESTION:  Okay, but they're not -- I mean, thisis a preliminary pleading issue, so they're not in therecord of this case, and we'd better -- I suppose we hadbetter be sure of that before we come up with a rule thatrequires apportionment.          MR. JONES:  We --1011121314151617181920212223    it.24              MR. JONES:  We know that the gauging of the25    water coming into the lake, we know how much is impounded,          QUESTION:  Or at least we ought to be sure thatthey can keep these records in a practical way, and wedon't know that, do we?          QUESTION:  Well, don't we know that they chargea different rate for class I water than they do for classII water, so they have to have some way of apportioning251 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425we know what the storage is, we know what's diverted andwhen it's diverted and why it's diverted and who's payingfor it and why they're paying for it and whether it'sclass I, class II, or class II obligation.          I think that because this is operated for theeconomic use of the facility, all of that information isvery --          QUESTION:  They must have it.          QUESTION:  There's some loss from evaporation.I mean, I don't think you can take figures in the lake andjust assume that all of that water ends up in the ditch.          MR. JONES:  I think that that's true.          Unless there's any questions I'd like to reservethe rest of my time.          QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Jones.          Mr. Frederick, we'll hear from you.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MR. FREDERICK:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:          Multiple purpose projects throughout the countryoperate like the Friant Division of the Central Valleyproject, which collects water behind Friant Dam to avertflooding along the San Joaquin River and then graduallyreleases that water to serve both flood control and261 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425irrigation needs.          QUESTION:  Yes, but the Ninth Circuit did saythat the Madera Canal is not a flood control project andserves no flood control purpose.  Now, if your focus ison the Friant Dam and you look at the overall project in athird of the State of California, you can say it's relatedto flood control, but if you focus instead in the MaderaCanal, the Ninth Circuit said it just wasn't -- it servesno flood control purpose.why --MR. FREDERICK:  Justice O'Connor, we don't knowQUESTION:  So where do we focus?          MR. FREDERICK:  Well, you focus on what thereality is.          QUESTION:  Well, the reality is the Madera Canalserves irrigation purposes, that's the reality.          MR. FREDERICK:  It serves multiple purposes,Justice O'Connor.  The water that is released into theMadera Canal for 10 months out of every year has to complywith flood control rules set by the Corps of Engineers.The Bureau of Reclamation cannot release that water, andit must make daily decisions about how much water goesinto the canal, and which canal it goes into, and whetherit goes in the downstream river, and for that reason --          QUESTION:  But presumably it can't, under that                            271 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9agreement, release more than the farmers can use for floodcontrol purposes without the agreement of the parties.          MR. FREDERICK:  Wrong.  That is --          QUESTION:  Doesn't it say that?          MR. FREDERICK:  That is incorrect.  What theagreement says is that the Government can put water intothe canal, and it can be flood water, and even the waterthat the irrigators take and use for irrigation can serveflood control reasons if it has to be released fromMillerton Lake to avert a flood, or if putting that waterdown the San Joaquin River would cause a flood, the damoperator diverts it into the irrigation canals --          QUESTION:  What if the plaintiffs below showthat never in the history of the Madera Canal has that          MR. FREDERICK:  That would be --          QUESTION:  Never.          MR. FREDERICK:  Well, first, the fact that theyhave asserted in their complaint that it serves anirrigation purpose is not legally relevant to the questionof whether sovereign immunity applies, because sovereignimmunity is jurisdictional, and the court must satisfyitself that it has jurisdiction --          QUESTION:  Justice O'Connor asked you aquestion, Mr. Frederick.  I hope you'll get to the answer28101112131415    happened?161718192021222324251234567    that.8 91011121314151617181920212223          MR. FREDERICK:  Justice O'Connor, Congress, whenit created this project in the 1930's, was facing a factthat between 1900 and 1944 there were 38 devastatingfloods along the San Joaquin River, and it, in the courseof its legislative fact-finding, determined that the wayto deal with flooding along this river was to harness thatriver and then to put it to productive use.          Of those 38 floods, 15 were from rain during theperiod between October 1 and roughly March 15, 23 fromsnow melt run-off --          QUESTION:  Mr. Frederick, I don't mean tointerrupt you, but I hope you'll tell us some time in theargument what you don't tell us in your brief, whether youdefend the Ninth Circuit's test.          MR. FREDERICK:  We do defend --          QUESTION:  If you do, you don't need all these          MR. FREDERICK:  Well, Justice --                            2924 facts. 25quite soon.          MR. FREDERICK:  Mr. Chief Justice, I don't thinkthere's any way that the plaintiffs could show that inthis case.          QUESTION:  Well, but if this was dismissed onthe pleadings -- they said they were prepared to show 1              QUESTION:  All you need is some flood control 2    purpose in the project and that's enough, and you win. 3              MR. FREDERICK:  That's correct. 4              QUESTION:  Is that your position? 5              MR. FREDERICK:  Yes. 6              QUESTION:  Then we don't need these facts. 7              QUESTION:  Do you also accept the Ninth 8    Circuit's statement that the Madera Canal is for 9    irrigation purposes only?10              MR. FREDERICK:  No.  No.11              QUESTION:  You disagree with that?12              MR. FREDERICK:  We disagree with that.  The 193713    Rivers and Harbors Act said the entire Central Valley14    project is for, among other purposes, flood control.  It's15    undisputed that --16              QUESTION:  Justice O'Connor asked the question,17    suppose the trier of fact found 100 percent of the water,18    or let's say, 98 percent of the water over the last 1019    years in Madera Canal has been for irrigation purposes20    only, any difference in the case?21              MR. FREDERICK:  I don't think so, Justice22    Kennedy, and the reason is the congressional design behind23    the project, as one of your earlier questions pointed out,24    it is an integrated project, and the part of the report25    that you were talking about, if all parties agree, those301    parties are the Bureau of Reclamation and the Corps of2    Engineers.3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  The language Congress used is, floodsor flood waters.  I don't know that that affords any basisfor going down -- back to the design of an entire project,instead of looking as to whether the particular watershere were in fact flood waters.          MR. FREDERICK:  The way, Mr. Chief Justice,courts have consistently looked at the question of what isa flood water is, is that water that would overflow thebanks unless controlled by man-made structures, and thatwas the assumption that the Court in James made behindhaving the water behind this dam be deemed flood waters.          If the waters not controlled by that dam wouldoverflow the river, then it would be deemed flood watersand that's --          QUESTION:  But then 98 percent of the water inthis canal isn't.          MR. FREDERICK:  And our submission, JusticeBreyer, is that the -- first we can show as a matter ofhistorical fact that that's not the case here, that --          QUESTION:  98 percent?  You can show that the --          MR. FREDERICK:  Yes.          QUESTION:  What percent is it?          MR. FREDERICK:  Well, our brief demonstrates31 1    that even if you take class I water out of the picture, 2    and class I water in many circumstances would have to be 3    released for flood storage reasons -- 4              QUESTION:  Well, I mean, I used to live in 5    California.  I mean, it's dry most of the time, so it 6    would be amazing to me if like there's going to be a flood 7    in summer there.  I -- 8              MR. FREDERICK:  Justice Breyer, a flood control 9    project is created for the cataclysm.10              QUESTION:  No, but we're talking about flood11    water, and the flood water the Chief Justice just pointed12    out, he gave that definition, and I was saying it seemed13    to me that 98 percent -- I'll give you at the moment that14    the canal is part of a flood control project.  We could15    define that as a project that's substantially, but not16    entirely, used for flood control.  Okay, I'll give you17    that for the sake of argument.18              But what about the water?  The water, you've got19    the definition he just said.  Adopting that definition, I20    don't see how more than about 1 percent, if that, could be21    flood water, water that would have overflowed the banks of22    the San Joaquin or any other of these dry places.  I23 mean --24              MR. FREDERICK:  Justice Breyer, to answer your25    question, one must look at the flood rules that are set32 1    down by the Corps of Engineers with respect to this 2    project.  They were set out in 1955, and -- 3              QUESTION:  Well, why do we look at that when we 4    have a congressional definition of flood waters? 5              MR. FREDERICK:  Well, you -- the Congress didn't 6    define the term, flood waters, Mr. Chief Justice.  This 7    Court in James defined the term flood waters in section 8    702(c), but what the Corps of Engineers has done in flood 9    control projects is to set out the rules for how those10    projects operate so that waters do not become floods, and11    in the establishment of those rules the Corps made very12    clear that water has to be diverted from Millerton Lake to13    the canals that are adjoining the dam so that flooding --14              QUESTION:  But surely the inquiry is a factual15    one, not some directive from the Corps of Engineers that16    says what may occasionally happen, you know, what has in17    fact happened with respect to the Madera Canal over the18    last 10 years.19              MR. FREDERICK:  To the contrary, Mr. Chief20    Justice, for sovereign immunity to be a functional21    principle, the Government should be entitled to go into22    court to say Congress and the applicable agencies have23    designed and operated this facility for flood control24    reasons and avoid --25              QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Frederick, that just isn't                                  33 1    the immunity statute.  That is what we look at, not the 2    construction of the Central California project.  We have 3    to focus on the immunity statute that was passed in the 4    wake of that 1927 massive flood of the Mississippi River. 5    Congress didn't have, in this immunity section, in mind 6    the kind of situation we've got with the Madera Canal, 7    where it's used for irrigation purposes and it's alleged 8    to have been constructed in a faulty manner, it's cracked 9    and the water's leaking out.  Apparently, to a nonuser of10    the canal, but flooding the property.  Now, they didn't11    have that in mind.12              MR. FREDERICK:  To the contrary, Justice13    O'Connor.  The entire Central Valley project uses14    aqueducts and canals --15              QUESTION:  She's talking about the 1928 act --16              QUESTION:  I'm talking about the immunity17    language, and you seem to conflate the purpose of the18    construction of the Central California project, and I19    just -- I have a -- I have trouble converting --2021 then. 2223    waters within the meaning of the immunity statute is all24    waters carried in or contained through a flood control25    project for purposes of or related to flood control.34MR. FREDERICK:  Okay.  Let me see if I can help,In James what the Court said was that flood 1              QUESTION:  James had a very different situation 2    in mind.  It did have genuine flood, water escaping 3    through the system and somebody drowning as a result when 4    it flooded over.  This is far removed from that. 5              MR. FREDERICK:  We don't think so, Justice 6    O'Connor, for this reason.  On an average year, Millerton 7    Lake will have 1.7 million acre feet of run-off into it. 8    That's the average year.  It has to empty itself, or it 9    has to be emptied, and then it will refill three-and-a-10    half times during the course of the year.  If that water11    is not released there will be a flood.  If it's not12    controlled, there will be a flood along the San Joaquin13 River.14              QUESTION:  Well, but blessedly there are farmers15    who want to use it, so of course it's released.  It could16    be used five times over if there were enough water.  The17    farmers are there, dying for water.18              MR. FREDERICK:  And the fact that there is a19    multiple benefit, and the hydropower is another benefit,20    does not mean that the water loses its character as flood21    water if it is stored to protect against a flood along the22    river, and what -- in James this Court considered the23    question of flood waters that were being used for24    recreational purposes.  The specific discharge that was at25    issue in that case was deemed to be for flood control351 reasons. 2              But here, the same principle applies because the 3    water is released into the irrigation canals for a flood 4    control purpose. 5              QUESTION:  I see that, but -- okay.  Suppose -- 6    I'm now giving you this.  A flood control project is a 7    project that has a substantial purpose related to flood 8    control.  Then I think you have to get to water, and the 9    water, as you pointed out, is it's contained or carried10    through a flood control project for purposes of or related11    to flood control.12              All right.  Suppose I were to say, what that13    means is that the water is where it is for a purpose14    substantially related to flood control.15              Now, if that's so, except for a tiny little bit,16    this is not flood control water.17              MR. FREDERICK:  To the contrary.18              QUESTION:  Because?19              MR. FREDERICK:  Because every release from20    Millerton Lake has to serve a flood control purpose,21 number 1.22              QUESTION:  Ah, but I said, is where it is, and23    it's not in the San Joaquin bed, which is where it would24    be.  It's diverted over because -- and let's take it in25    August, okay.  In August, that water would normally be36 1    released into the San Joaquin bed, and now it isn't 2    released to the San Joaquin bed, why, for irrigation 3    purposes, 100 percent.  That's the answer to that 4    question, nothing to do with flood control. 5              MR. FREDERICK:  Justice Breyer, if I could 6    answer your question in two ways.  The first is, if this 7    complaint alleged a discrete release of water, there might 8    be an argument that the Government was not entitled to 9    immunity under your theory because the discrete purpose of10    the release could be identified.11              But this complaint asserts that this canal has12    leaked, and on page 54 of the joint appendix they say, we13    don't know when the leaking started, so you have to look14    at the overall purposes of the project, and you have to15    look at the reasons why water gets released from Friant16 Dam.17              QUESTION:  Okay, let's accept that.  That's why18    I think you have to get to the third part of this, which19    is the causation part, if we're going to say anything20    useful, and on that I thought you'd say, look across the21    year about 98 percent of the time it is diverted from the22    San Joaquin bed just for irrigation purposes.23              Some percent of the time -- I'll give you as24    much as you want, but it's not going to be more than 50 --25    it's diverted for, let's say, flood control purposes, and37123456789    work.now we have to say that the causation problem is solved bysaying, you know, one, this water wouldn't have beensubstituted by some other water, and the second thing is,you have to apportion the damages, I think.          Now, I'm putting that whole thing out to getyour comment.10111213141516171819202122232425    damage.MR. FREDERICK:  Well, my --QUESTION:  But I don't see how else to make it          MR. FREDERICK:  Okay.  My comment is that ifyou're looking at why Congress would have put billions ofdollars into these water projects, it did so with theassumption that the immunity would apply, and that is avery important principle here, because when establishingsovereign immunity principles you don't allow theGovernment to be engaged in fact-finding.  They've askedfor every single document relating to this project sincethe 1930's as part of their discovery effort.QUESTION:  What is --QUESTION:  Well --QUESTION:  -- the basis for your statement that38Congress assumed that immunity would apply when it didthis particular project?  It wasn't until James that weheld that immunity applied to anything except property1              MR. FREDERICK:  Because this is property damage,2    Justice Stevens.3456 then. 7QUESTION:  I know.  I know.MR. FREDERICK:  It -- the Court --QUESTION:  But it hadn't been addressed until               MR. FREDERICK:  In 1936, when Congress directed8    the Corps of Engineers in the Flood Control Act of 1936 to9    study the San Joaquin River and figure out a way to stop10    flooding on the San Joaquin River, it incorporated by11    reference the 1928 flood act which contains the immunity12    provision in this case.13              In 1937, Congress then authorized --14              QUESTION:  And of course, which except for15    property damage wasn't even necessary, because the Federal16    Tort Claims Act --17              QUESTION:  There was no Federal Tort Claims Act.18              QUESTION:  -- hadn't even been passed.19              MR. FREDERICK:  Well, no, but the case of United20    States v. Cress had been in present -- by -- decided by21    this Court, and the question of whether or not and when22    flooding would constitute a taking.23              QUESTION:  That's right.24              MR. FREDERICK:  And so the issue was very much25    how will Congress protect the Government from paying out39 1    in lawsuits for faulty structures or negligent design or 2    damage from flood waters, you know, for decades out into 3    the future, and the interrelationship between the flood 4    control purpose and irrigation is probably the most 5    important thing that we would like the Court to understand 6    here, because you cannot segregate the purposes.  They're 7    all serving these purposes simultaneously. 8              QUESTION:  All right, then on your theory -- and 9    what you've just said raises the same question that your10    answer to Justice Breyer raised with me.  On your theory,11    will there ever be a situation in which the immunity won't12 apply?13              MR. FREDERICK:  Yes.14              QUESTION:  What?15              MR. FREDERICK:  When, in an accident --16              QUESTION:  The discrete situation?17              MR. FREDERICK:  The discrete situation.18              QUESTION:  All right.  If the discrete situation19    applies in the accident, why shouldn't the discrete20    situation, in effect, rule apply here if they can show by21    the records kept by the dam that except in, let's say,22    five instances in which the canal was used for overflow23    for flood control purposes, all the other water that was24    diverted into that canal was for nonflood-control purposes25    and therefore you would get your immunity on some401 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425apportionment theory?  Why wouldn't that apply, if youaccept the discrete release exception --          MR. FREDERICK:  Well, first it would be --          QUESTION:  -- to liability?          MR. FREDERICK:  First, it would be an unusualway to treat subject matter jurisdiction of the courts, onan apportionment basis.          QUESTION:  Well, it may be an unusual way,unless we are going to allow your theory of immunity tobecome a plenary theory in which there will never beliability, isn't that what we're going to have to do?          MR. FREDERICK:  When you were talking about theproject itself and how the project --          QUESTION:  No, but isn't that what we're goingto have to do?Souter --MR. FREDERICK:  Well, I --QUESTION:  Yes or no.MR. FREDERICK:  No, I don't think so, JusticeQUESTION:  Why?          MR. FREDERICK:  -- and the reason is thatCongress wanted there to be broad immunity.  It draftedthis statute in the broadest possible --          QUESTION:  But it didn't want there to becomplete immunity, did it?41 1              MR. FREDERICK:  No. 2              QUESTION:  All right, so we're going to have to 3    have some kind of mechanism to apportion causation for 4    jurisdictional purposes, don't we? 5              MR. FREDERICK:  No, I -- no, Justice Souter, I 6    think there ought to be a discrete -- I think conceptually 7    there are two different problems dealing with this 8    statute.  James dealt with the conceptual problem of an 9    accident occurring in flood waters within a project and is10    there a relationship between the accident that occurs and11    the flood control purpose of the project, and what the12    Court there said was, if it -- if the accident is related13    to the purposes of the flood control project, the immunity14 applies.15              QUESTION:  Okay, and that was a -- that really16    stretched the statute, didn't it?17              MR. FREDERICK:  This --18              QUESTION:  Because the statute didn't have a19    related-to condition.20              MR. FREDERICK:  This problem, Justice Souter, is21    really at the core of what Congress was getting at in 192822    which is, we're going to pour billions of dollars into23    building these structures to protect flood water, and24 we -- 25QUESTION:  Now, wait a minute, you think                  42 1    Congress was talking about damming the Mississippi River? 2              MR. FREDERICK:  No, but Mr. Chief Justice, when 3    Congress created the extensive levee system it spent four 4    times the amount that it had on the Panama Canal, and it 5    also appropriated money in the 1928 act to put dams on the 6    Sacramento River and to protect against flooding on the 7    Sacramento River, which is integrated in the water system 8    with the San Joaquin River. 9              QUESTION:  And you think Congress really thought10    that if they built the levee on the Mississippi, and the11    if the levee leaked during the middle of the summer, when12    there were no flood waters in sight, that the immunity13    would attach?14              MR. FREDERICK:  Yes.15              QUESTION:  Then I still --16              QUESTION:  It isn't clear to me.  I think it's17    already a stretch to say that the waters held behind a18    flood control project even during a period when there's no19    risk of flood are flood waters.  That's just a stretch of20    the English language, and to carry it further, as you now21    want us to do, that even canals leading off of the main22    flood control project which are sometimes used for the23    release of flood waters, it's so breathlessly beyond what24    Congress has said in the statute.25              MR. FREDERICK:  Justice Scalia, first the Court431    took a different view in James, and that view is2    certainly --3              QUESTION:  Whatever view it took in James was4    dictum.  It couldn't be clearer that the accident there5    occurred from flood waters, in the real sense of flood6 waters. 78910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. FREDERICK:  No, those waters were capturedbehind the dam, and they were being released to createmore flood storage space in that lake, just as here, thewaters released into the irrigation canals to create moreflood storage space --          QUESTION:  Well, but it will create much moreflood storage space.          MR. FREDERICK:  I'm sorry?          QUESTION:  It will create more flood storagespace by releasing into the canals, but I don't know thatwe can or should make the assumption that it was releasedinto the canals for that purpose.          MR. FREDERICK:  We can because in -- the way theproject was designed, in 1944 the Corps of Engineersreported back to Congress and it said that if more than7,000 cubic feet per second of water is released into theSan Joaquin River there will be a flood at Skagg's Branch,and it also said the flood capacity of the dam is 12,000cubic feet per second, and if you add 1,000 for the Madera44 1    Canal and 4,000 for the Friant Current Canal, it is 2    unmistakably clear the Corps of Engineers intended for 3    these canals to receive the flood waters. 4              QUESTION:  But that's true -- that's true, and 5    so you take those times when in fact the San Joaquin below 6    the dam is filled to more than 7,000 -- what is it, cubic 7    feet per second. 8              Now, when we look at those days, we get maybe -- 9    I don't know how many days per year, but not all that10    many, and maybe one every 3 years or something, but let's11    say it's 100 days a year.  It's not more than that, which12    it isn't anywhere near that, but still, let's assume that.13              Very well.  On those 100 days, those releases14    put water in the canal where it is at that time because it15    is flood water, but on all the other days the water in16    that canal is not where it is, because of any flood17    control purpose, so we're talking about the water on all18    those other days.19              MR. FREDERICK:  Justice Breyer --20              QUESTION:  Yes.21              MR. FREDERICK:  -- as a factual matter --22              QUESTION:  Yes.23              MR. FREDERICK:  -- 4 out of the last 5 years, if24    the water had not been put into the canals, there would25    have been flooding on the San Joaquin River.45 1              QUESTION:  On some days. 2              MR. FREDERICK:  Through some months. 3              QUESTION:  All right, fine. 4              MR. FREDERICK:  -- through months-long periods. 5              QUESTION:  Through some months.  How many months 6    you want, two? 7              MR. FREDERICK:  That's related to flood8 control -- 9              QUESTION:  Excellent. Now let's talk about the10    other 10 months.  The other 10 months, the water, on your11    theory, is not where it is in the canal because of flood12    control, and so I think what Justice Souter was driving13    at, and what I was, if all the water in the canal is14    causing that damage, what reason would there be for15    calling the water in those other 10 months flood water and16    subjecting it to immunity?17              MR. FREDERICK:  Because they are making space so18    that floods don't occur in those months.19              QUESTION:  But let me ask you -- let me ask you20    a hypothetical I have.  Suppose in the Madera Canal21    there's a valve, and it goes into field A or field B.22    Both are -- just for irrigation, and by mistake they open23    the valve and it goes into field A and they leave it open24    for 24 hours when it's only 12, and the barn gets flooded.25 Immunity?461 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. FREDERICK:  No.          QUESTION:  Why?          MR. FREDERICK:  The water's left the Federalproject.  It's -- that's  --          QUESTION:  Well, the water's left the Federalproject in this case, too.          MR. FREDERICK:  Yes, and --          QUESTION:  It's leaked out the canal.          MR. FREDERICK:  Right, but in your hypotheticalthe Madera district is operating those cut-off valves.          QUESTION:  No.  No, I'm assuming the Corps ofEngineers.  It's a hypothetical case.          MR. FREDERICK:  Okay.  Okay.          QUESTION:  Assume the Corps of Engineers opensthe valve and they do it the wrong way.          MR. FREDERICK:  Then there would be --          QUESTION:  Instead of irrigating field A, theyirrigate field B, or vice-versa, and there's damage.          MR. FREDERICK:  Yes.          QUESTION:  Liability?          MR. FREDERICK:  No.  That would be immunity.  Imean, if the Government's actions are negligent inreleasing the water, the immunity applies.  The statutesays --          QUESTION:  Because it's flood waters?                            471 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. FREDERICK:  Yes.  Yes.  That's water that'sinundating an area where it is not supposed to be.  That'sthe definition of a flood.          QUESTION:  Oh, I see --          MR. FREDERICK:  Inundating an area where thewater is not supposed to be.          QUESTION:  -- now -- well then, why don't youwin in this case, anyway?10111213    flood.1415    flood.161718MR. FREDERICK:  We do.(Laughter.)MR. FREDERICK:  We think we do, Justice Kennedy.QUESTION:  But on a theory that there's a newQUESTION:  So, yeah, overflow is basically aMR. FREDERICK:  Yes.QUESTION:  In other words, if every --QUESTION:  Let me just change Justice Kennedy's19    hypothetical --20              MR. FREDERICK:  There's no difference in our21    view from an overflow and a leak if the structure isn't22    working properly --23              QUESTION:  No, no, just change the hypothetical24    to say that the release didn't cause a flood, it didn't --25    but it was sudden release and somebody drowned in the481 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425accident, then would there be immunity?          MR. FREDERICK:  Yes, and every court of appealshas so held.          QUESTION:  There would be immunity there?          MR. FREDERICK:  Yes.          QUESTION:  Even though it was released forirrigation purposes?          MR. FREDERICK:  If the project is a floodcontrol project and there is a relation to flood control,the courts have upheld the Government's immunity.          QUESTION:  In response to a question fromJustice Souter you agreed there could be an accident wherethere wouldn't be immunity attached.          MR. FREDERICK:  Yes, and that would be --          QUESTION:  What is your example?          MR. FREDERICK:  Where a Government official likea Fish & Wildlife Service official is on a flood controlfacility, commits an act of negligence that causes aperson to drown --          QUESTION:  Okay.          MR. FREDERICK:  -- that would not be covered bythe immunity.          QUESTION:  So it's only the differencebetween --          QUESTION:  But it would be covered under the                            49 1    Ninth Circuit test, would it not? 2              MR. FREDERICK:  It -- arguably, yes.  Yes. 3              QUESTION:  All right.  So you don't really 4    support the Ninth Circuit test. 5              MR. FREDERICK:  Well, Justice Stevens, let me 6    just say that the Ninth Circuit itself is not wholly 7    consistent on this point.  In the McCarthy case, which was 8    a personal negligence case, the Ninth Circuit said there 9    must be a substantial factor between the Government's10    activities and the accident, so even in the McCarthy case11    the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit did not12    strictly hew to its wholly-unrelated standard.13              But I would point out --14              QUESTION:  Mr. Frederick, may I go back to your15    answer to Justice Stevens' question?  I take it, then,16    that the only -- that there will always be immunity if the17    release is, in fact, an intentional release as opposed to18    the negligent release, because whenever there is an19    intentional release, as I understand your reasoning, there20    will be, in fact, the creation of space to hold flood21 water. 2223 24 25          QUESTION:  And so that the only case in whichthere will be -- there will not be immunity is thenegligence case, as in your example.50MR. FREDERICK:  That's correct.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. FREDERICK:  No.  The immunity would apply tonegligence cases, too, Justice Souter, for precisely --          QUESTION:  Well, you just gave --          MR. FREDERICK:  For precisely the same reason.That's flood water --          QUESTION:  -- an example of a case in whichthere would not be immunity.          MR. FREDERICK:  Well, let me distinguishbetween --          QUESTION:  A negligence case like the negligencecase you just posited to Justice Stevens, that will be theonly kind of situation in which there will not be10111213    immunity?141516171819202122232425          MR. FREDERICK:  Yes.  Escaping waters cases,which is what this one is.  This water is not where it'ssupposed to be.  It has escaped from the project.Congress built the project to keep the water contained,and that project is --          QUESTION:  But wait --          MR. FREDERICK:  -- collectively failing, isfoursquare within what Congress debated in the 1928 act.It wanted these structures to succeed, but it did not wantthe Government to have to defend lawsuits like this onefor time immemorial if they did not.          QUESTION:  I'll grant you, and this is directly                            51 1    related to what was just said, that the water has come out 2    from behind the dam in order to make space for other 3    water.  That's flood control. 4              But the question here is, the water that came 5    out from the dam would naturally go into the San Joaquin. 6    It wouldn't naturally go into the Merced Canal, and if you 7    focus on the month of August, and you focus on the 8    decision to turn it from the San Joaquin below the dam 9    over to the Merced Canal, what has that to do with flood10 control?111213141516171819202122232425          MR. FREDERICK:  Justice Breyer, I conceded thatif you were not to accept our broad view of every releasebeing for flood control, that you would then look atwhether or not there was a relation between the releaseand flood control activities.          QUESTION:  Well, isn't part of the answer thatit allows release from the Sacramento into the SanJoaquin, which --          MR. FREDERICK:  Yes.  I mean --          QUESTION:  -- greatly alleviates the floodwaters on the Sacramento?          MR. FREDERICK:  That's correct.  It is a totallyintegrated system, but Justice Breyer, if you were not toaccept our broadest submission, even under our narrowersubmission we should prevail and get immunity in this521 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9      case, because it can be shown through contracts, through      regulations, through statutes that this canal serves and      is related to a flood control purpose, and the empirical      water data collected by the U.S. Geological Service that      we quoted in our brief indicates that well over half of      the water released in the last 20 years undoubtedly serves      a flood control purpose.                I mean, you know --                QUESTION:  Was this brought out at trial?                MR. FREDERICK:  No.  This was done on the      pleadings, Mr. Chief Justice, and we are allowed to defend      the judgment on an alternate ground and to provide public      record material --                QUESTION:  We rarely affirm on an alternate                MR. FREDERICK:  Well, in a way this is and this17    is not an alternate ground.  It is support for the18    judgment and the rationale for the judgment by showing the19    relation of flood control in this particular project, and20 we have --21              QUESTION:  -- what the judgment on a different22    ground, this Court rarely takes submissions, even judicial23    notice submissions as a matter of first instance.  You24    would be asking us to sit essentially as the court of25    first view on this theory and to look at things that were53101112131415    ground.16 1    never presented below, and that is an extraordinary thing 2    to ask this Court to do. 3              MR. FREDERICK:  Not when they're legal sources, 4    Justice Ginsburg.  This is the statutes.  This is the 5    regulations.  This is historical public record material. 6    This is stipulations they have agreed to in the 7    stipulations of fact. 8              QUESTION:  No, but don't we have to understand 9    the terms of the contract where they have class I water10    and class II water and class I water is for irrigation,11    they pay a higher -- or they pay a lower rate, I guess, or12    a higher rate for class I and so forth?13              MR. FREDERICK:  No, you don't need to understand14    all the terms of the contract to get the central point,15    which is that --16              QUESTION:  You don't want us to know about water17    being in two classes?18              MR. FREDERICK:  No, Justice Stevens.  What we19    want you to know is that the contract provides for flood20    water to be put into the Madera Canal, and therefore it21    serves a flood control purpose.  That's all you really22    need to understand about the contract, because it is a23    matter that they've stipulated to, this is how the water24    gets into the canal, and the parties have agreed that25    flood water will be put into the canal as a matter of541 agreement.2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          So when you look, Justice Ginsburg, at thesources that we have relied upon to defend the judgmentand the rationale of the court of appeals, there is notanything that would be developed by going back.  All thatwould be accomplished is that the Government would beforced to defend, you know, document requests that calledfor every scrap of paper in the Central Valley project andin the Madera Canal over the last 65 years, and thequestion of sovereign immunity would not be one that couldbe established at the pleadings stage.          It would, in fact, be subject to proof at everystep of the way, and this Court has made clear that notonly is sovereign immunity a principle of jurisdiction,but it  -- to prevent against the Government being liable,but it's also a principle to avoid the Government havingto defend against vexatious litigation.          QUESTION:  But often it hinges, when you'retalking about immunity it hinges upon factualdeterminations that can only be found later.  That's notat all unusual.          MR. FREDERICK:  I --          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Frederick.          Mr. Jones, you have 2 minutes remaining.            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY JONES                            551 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. JONES:  Thank you, Your Honor.          If I could take you to our reply brief, becausewe did address, although we objected to the judicialnotice of all the facts we did address them there, and wenoted that in a majority of the years in the 1979 to 1999period selected by respondent, flows from the dam into theriver bed never approached 8,000 cubic feet per second,which petitioner gauged by setting thresholds of 7600cubic feet per second on a single day of the entire yearand so, as far as petitioner could determine on those daysthat flows into the river bed did approach 8,000 cubicfeet per second they showed no correlation with the higherflows in the Madera Canal.          Point 2.  This project was funded as areclamation project.  The canal was identified as anirrigation canal.  This is not a project where Congressput money out and exposed its treasury to something itwasn't going to be reimbursed for.  This is not thecontext of the Mississippi River flood project.          And I would like to answer any questions, ifthere are any others.          QUESTION:  Was the Shasta Dam funded andconstructed by the Bureau of Reclamation?          MR. JONES:  The Shasta Dam, as I understand it,                            561 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425was, and I don't know the answer to that.  I should know,but I don't.  It probably was.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.Frederick.  The case is submitted.  Not Mr. Frederick,Mr. Jones.  Excuse me.          (Whereupon, at 11:59 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)57
