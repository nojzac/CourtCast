FMR LLC.      Mr. Schnapper.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPERON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. SCHNAPPER: Mr. Chief Justice, and mayit please the Court:      Section 1514A is written in the classiclanguage which Congress utilizes to regulaterelationships between employees and their employers.Legislation regarding how an entity is to treat anemployee is understood to refer to the entity's ownemployees.  And that is particularly true here where thephrase "terms and conditions" of employment is used inthe statute.      If Section 1514A forbade only contractors toretaliate against employees under the terms andconditions of their employment, I don't think there'd beany question that the courts would understand it wasreferring to the contractor's own employees.  Thestatute has the same ­­ that language has the samemeaning, even though it's combined in this instance withprohibitions against retaliation by other types of3￼￼1 actors.2 The First Circuit's decision interpreting3 1514A to permit a contractor to retaliate against its4 own employees is inconsistent with its general usage and5 it leads to four implausible consequences. First, it6 renders the statutory language regarding contractors7 virtually meaningless. Secondly, it renders that8 language with regard to contractors in the mutual fund9 industry literally meaningless.10 Third, it has the implausible consequence of11 permitting the very type of retaliation that we know12 Congress was concerned about. Retaliation um­ by an13 accountant such as Arthur Andersen. And finally, it14 renders incoherent the provisions in 1514A and the15 related remedial provision regarding scienter,uh the16 burden of proof and an affirmative defense.17 JUSTICE ALITO: Is it your position that18 employees of any officer, employee, contractor,19 subcontractor or agent of a public company are covered?20 They're all covered?21 MR.

SCHNAPPER: We ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG: ­­ hand in executing the contract?MR. SCHNAPPER: We ­­question correctly, we ­­ we haveand the standard we advanced doesquestion of a ­­ of a personal employee of an employer, such as Ken Lay ­­￼      JUSTICE ALITO:      MR. SCHNAPPER:issues ­­      JUSTICE ALITO:then ­­ then how do you avoid that with your reading ofthe text?MR. SCHNAPPER: Your Honor, our view of this is that the ­­ the meaning of the term "employee" depends on the context in which it's used and it ought to be assessed separately for each of the actors. So when it says no publicly­traded company may retaliate against an employee, it means an employee of the publicly­traded company. But ­­ and the same thing with contractor and subcontractor.      But if we had a statute which by itself saidno employee of ­­ personal ­­ no employee of an officershall do something, the ­­ the normal reading of that5to the ones that had aif I understand thenot taken a positionnot address theWell, if doesn't ­­It doesn't raise distinctIf it doesn't include that,￼1 would be to refer to an employee of the officer's2 company. And we have statutes that impose personal3 liability on officials for things they're doing in their4 companies and that's the way5 JUSTICE SCALIA:6 peculiar. I mean, really, I7 it out like that, that it includes employees of8 contractors, subcontractors, but not ­­ not of any9 officer.10 But let me ask you this: If it does include11 employees of ­­ of an officer, is it ­­ is it as much of12 a disaster as ­­ as your opponent suggests? That is to13 say, would ­­ would a firing for something that had14 nothing to do with the securities laws be swept in?15 MR. SCHNAPPER: The ­­ the statute forbids16 retaliation for protected activity related either to the17 securities law or to certain criminal fraud provisions.18 And that's quite deliberate. The statute ­­19 Sarbanes­Oxley is not limited to corporate misdeeds and20 related things. Title VIII and Title IX also deal21 specifically ­­ deal much more broadly with criminal22 fraud.23 Title IX increases the penalty for wire24 fraud and mail fraud without regard to whether it has ­­25 it was by a corporation or an individual.6they read.

SCHNAPPER:statute.      JUSTICE SCALIA:subjects.  And is ­­ is the personal employee of anofficer likely to be involved with any of thosesubjects?MR. SCHNAPPER: No, Your Honor. They're unlikely to know of such things. But ­­ but theCongress deliberately wrote the statute to deal with ordinary wire and mail fraud, not just corporate public company related fraud. The statute is­ is broader in that regard.JUSTICE BREYER: So what's the limitation?That is, if the argument against throwing thecontractors in the way you want, I think is, well, thenthere is no limitation. So a company that let's say isa publicly traded company, lives in a ­ they have a building and they hire a gardener.      And the gardener is a gardening company andit has three employees and it works one day a weekcutting their lawn and it works four days a week cuttingsomebody else's lawn.

This is not reallyfor anywiththis10 case.11 MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes, I understand, I12 understand.13 JUSTICE BREYER: But I'm trying to foresee14 is are you arguing for no limitation or ­­15 MR. SCHNAPPER: I think there are two16 relevant limitations here, one of them statutory and one17 of them practical. The statutory one is that, although18 it wouldn't deal with, I think, the situation you19 hypothesized, that the counterparty, so to speak, of the20 public company is described as a contractor. And we21 think that is not anyone who has ever had a contract22 with a public company.23 "Contractor" in the ordinary parlance refers24 to an ongoing relationship. The paradigm is someone25 providing services on an ongoing basis, which of course8￼1 of fraud. Now, the fraud has nothing to do with the2 company that they're cutting the lawn for. It has to do3 with some other customers. All right.4 So what ­­ how ­­ I don't think the statute5 intends to get that. I mean­ Does it want to make every mom and6 pop shop in the country, when they have one employee,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425fits lawyers and accountants perfectly.JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.MR. SCHNAPPER: And so if someone from aprivate firm goes down to Walmart, buys a box of rubberbands, that in ordinary parlance wouldn't be referred toBut if you have someone come      JUSTICE SCALIA:in for ­­Well, you just hire thema contractor?￼as a contractor.  So we think that as athat rules out most mom and pop stores.that kind of relationship with people .JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course,out the accounting firm that is only used once, right?MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, it would have to be very fast. I mean, I think an audit takes some time.for this one audit; are theyMR. SCHNAPPER: I think an audit takes longenough that they would be.  It's not like the  momentsthat it takes to buy something at the gift shopdownstairs.  I think it typically takes weeks if notmonths, and I think in ordinary parlance you would callsomeone a contractor in those circumstances.JUSTICE BREYER: Could you limit it as also ruling out frauds by companies that are not publicly traded themselves of course, but where the fraud has nothing to do with the contract? That is, the whole9practical matter They don't haveit also rules￼1 activity just has nothing to do with the contract. It's2 just chance that they happen to have a contract.3 MR. SCHNAPPER: That's the way the Congress4 wrote the statute, and we think for two kinds of5 reasons. First of all, that ­­ the statute is also6 about, as you put it, garden variety fraud. It's7 increased the penalty for wire fraud, for mail fraud.8 For the first time there is a provision for attempts and9 conspiracy. It is an antifraud statute in addition to10 dealing with the Enron issues. So we think that's11 deliberate.12 Secondly, Your Honor, although ­­13 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure.

It said Section 806 applies whereemployees of the contractor are reporting possibleviolations of law by the public company for which thecontractor is performing work.      So it did put a limitation on the kinds thatJustice Breyer has suggested.  In other words, yes,employees of the contractor, but only when the employeesare engaged, you know, only when the violations of lawthat the employee is reporting relates to the work thatthe contractor is doing for the publicly held company.Do you think that that's a possible reading of thestatute or not?MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, it's certainly possible. We think it's not the correct reading. And there's a ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I didn't hear you.MR.

I2 don't want to pick a fight with the government.3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:4 suppose the ­­5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:6 JUSTICE BREYER:7 statute that says "any policeman," they don't mean a8 policeman on Mars, nor are they likely to mean a9 policeman in Europe. The "any policeman" is likely,10 although it says "any policeman," to mean a policeman in11 the United States.12 And similarly where they talk about this,13 the contractors, they don't mean frauds related to ­­14 you have to use some kind of scope for the word ­­ for15 the kinds of frauds that are included in the statute,16 and you have to read that into language that says17 nothing about it.18 And that's ­­ I don't say that that is19 necessarily easy to do and that's why I started with my20 first question.21 MR. SCHNAPPER: As I said, we think22 that's ­­ we think that's not the correct reading of the23 statute, for a couple of reasons. Another one is that we24 think it unlikely, over and above the fact that Congress25 was concerned with fraud generally, was that I think12Suppose that the ­­ I       Justice Breyer.The road is when you see a￼1 Congress would have been reluctant to try to define what2 was sufficiently related to the corporation.3 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, to go back to4 Justice Breyer's hypothetical which gets at this point5 where you have the gardening ­­ the gardening company,6 privately held, that's working for a public company, and7 there's some kind of employee of the contractor is fired8 and claims that the company is engaging in some kind of9 fraud that has nothing to do with the public company.10 So you have that situation.11 Now you have the identical, another12 privately held gardening company, exactly the same thing13 is going on, except they don't have a contract with a14 public company. Why would Congress have wanted to cover15 the former and not the latter?16 MR. SCHNAPPER: Justice Alito, I think17 that's just the way they wrote the statute. They were18 concerned with all fraud, but they didn't extend the19 whistleblowers to all fraud.20 JUSTICE ALITO: But why? If they are21 concerned with all fraud, why not cover them both?22 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, this is sort of a23 hybrid piece of legislation dealing with corporate24 problems and fraud, and they kind of melded the two25 here.13￼1 But I think there are ­­ it's also important2 in this situation to­ to bear in mind the following: I3 think Congress would have ­­ was reluctant ­­ it didn't4 itself draw a line because the experience of the Enron5 scandal was that all sorts of terribly complicated6 arrangements had been drawn up between Enron and these7 hundreds of off­the­books entities, Jedi, Raptors, LJM,8 and the like.9 I think Congress correctly concluded that if10 it tried to write out a description of what else it was11 covering, someone would think of a way to get around it.12 And I think it certainly wouldn't have contemplated that13 Federal courts were to try to untangle these14 relationships to the point where they could figure out15 whether, for example, if Andrew Fastow was skimming off16 money from Chewco, whether that would be sufficiently17 related to Enron. It's just, it's enormously18 complicated and I think Congress didn't mean to open the19 door to that.20 And that's brought home by the fact that the21 statute is written more broadly than AIR­21. It's22 essentially modeled on AIR­21, which is a statute23 adopted a couple years earlier about whistleblowing in24 the airline industry, particularly with regard to safety25 work. In that statute, "contractor" is specifically1425 MR. SCHNAPPER:It's a ­­￼1 defined to mean an airline contractor dealing with2 safety. They did not put that kind of limitation here,3 and I think it, in part, because it simply would have4 been very difficult to do. And I don't think they meant5 to give the courts a commission to try to sort that sort6 of thing out.7 The core problem with the interpretation of8 the court of appeals is that it really renders almost9 meaningless the decision of Congress to prohibit10 retaliation by contractors and subcontractors.11 Contractors and subcontractors would rarely be in a12 position to engage in retaliation, but particularly to13 engage in the very specific kind of retaliation14 specified in the statute, retaliation in the terms and15 conditions of employment.16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is one of the limitations17 in the statute where it says, in sub (1), "to provide18 information relating to fraud against shareholders"? Do19 you think "shareholders" means just the shareholders of20 the public company or does it mean shareholders of the21 ­­ suppose you have an accountant which has shareholders22 in it.

SCHNAPPER: Yes, it modifies the last clause, exactly.      With the Court's permission, I'd like toreserve the balance of my time.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.      Ms. Saharsky.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY,     FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERSMS. SAHARSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      The statute protects an employee of a16I would think so, Your  You would think so.I think so.  But this clause￼1 contractor from retaliation. That's what the text says.2 That's what Congress intended to cover, these3 accountants, lawyers, and outside auditors who were so4 central to the fall of Enron. I'd like to go right to5 some of the questions that the Court had about the6 limits of the statute and how it would be applied.7 Now, of course, what we're talking about8 here is really the core of the statute, a contractor9 retaliating against its own employees. And we think10 that when the First Circuit said that that is11 unambiguously not covered by the statute, that it's12 wrong. But moving beyond that, assuming that that is13 covered and asking some of these ­­ or answering some of14 these questions about the limit.15 First of all, as Justice Scalia suggested,16 the statute applies to individuals who are in a position17 who have information about fraud or securities law18 violations are in a position to report it. So it is19 very unlikely that that would be the gardener. It's20 incredibly likely that it would be an accountant or21 auditor, like a person who worked for Arthur Andersen.22 Another ­­23 JUSTICE ALITO: It's not ­­ it's not24 unlikely that an employee of a subcontractor will have25 information about something that can be ­­ that can be17￼1 alleged to be mail fraud by that ­­ by the contractor,2 that's not at all unlikely. If you see ­­ you know, if3 you see some civil RICO complaints, you see the kind of4 things that are alleged as mail fraud.5 MS. SAHARSKY:6 JUSTICE ALITO:7 MS. SAHARSKY:8 your question raises a ­­ another limitation on the9 statute, which is when the statute talks about10 contractors and subcontractors, it's contractor of a11 public company. So that it's talking about the12 contractor working in its capacity for the public13 company, not the contractor doing some other type of14 work.15 So if the contractor's work is for the16 public company and there is fraud being committed17 contractor, yes, that is something that Congress was18 concerned about. It was concerned about the fact that19 Arthur Andersen was committing fraud, not against Enron.20 JUSTICE ALITO: Yes. But you think this is21 limited to ­­ to fraud by the contractor relating to the22 public company, not ­­ not fraud that has nothing to do23 with the public company.24 MS. SAHARSKY: I think that it can be fraud25 by the contractor while the contractor is fulfilling its18Right. Do you disagree with that?No.  But I think it raises ­­by the￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425role as a contractor for the public company, not thecontractor in some other capacity.JUSTICE ALITO: What do you mean while? Temporal ­­ during the same period of time or in relation to?      MS. SAHARSKY:capacity.      JUSTICE ALITO:the statute?      MS. SAHARSKY:"contractor and subcontractor of such company."      Now, it says ­­JUSTICE ALITO: It says, "The contractor of such company," not "the fraud of such company."MS. SAHARSKY: Right. But we think that when you're reading the statute holistically, that that's the most natural reading.      Now, I point out here that these are notquestions that the courts of appeals or the Board, whichis entitled ­­JUSTICE BREYER: The argument about this, the reason that we're ­­ that I've brought this up is ­­ is because I think that the strongest argument in those courts of appeals that kind of held against you is that they fear that otherwise this statute would create any19In that capacity.  In that And where do you see that in"Of such company."  The words￼1 fraud by any gardener, any cook, anybody that had one2 employee in the entire United States and engaged in any3 alleged fraud would be covered. But it seems to me4 there are many ways to skin that cat.5 And ­­ and one way that I suggested and now6 Mr. Schnapper said, no, that's ­­ that kind of thing7 related to the contract isn't going to work very well8 because it's too complicated to try to figure out. So9 maybe we don't have to figure it out in this case. I10 mean that's possible. I ­­ I just wanted a universe of11 possibilities.12 MS. SAHARSKY: Yes. I think this is a13 completely understandable concern that was raised by the14 First Circuit. I have several responses to it. First15 of all, I don't think you don't need to decide it in16 this case. It's ­­ this is a fairly mainstream17 application.18 Second of all, this is the kind of thing19 that the expert agency should consider in the first20 instance. There have not been cases, except for the21 Spinner case, that really has ­­ that really have22 considered these questions about contractors and23 subcontractors. In the history of this statute,24 are only about 20 published cases that have ever25 the courts of appeals.20therereached￼1 JUSTICE KENNEDY:2 this is ­­ this is a mainstream application. We still3 have to give a rule. Do we write in the opinion, this4 is a mainstream application case and therefore it is so5 confined? That ­­ that doesn't make any sense.6 MS. SAHARSKY: No, Justice Kennedy. My7 suggestion was, because the Court doesn't have to decide8 some of these more far­fetched applications of the9 statute in this case, that it should leave it to the10 expert agency in the first instance. The rule that we11 would ­­12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that ­­ that was13 your second point. Your first point was just talk about14 the mainstream in this case and leave other cases. But15 I don't see how you can do that and interpret the16 statute. That's what I'm asking. Your statutory17 interpretation rule to keep this the mainstream is what?18 MS. SAHARSKY: I'm sorry. I should be more19 clear. What we think that this Court should say is that20 the natural reading of this provision covers, protects21 employees of contractors. The First Circuit said that22 employees of contractors are not protected at all from23 retaliation. And we think that that is wrong. So that24 would be step one.25 JUSTICE KENNEDY:21Well, you say ­­ you sayI understand that and I ­­￼1 I think that's a plausible reading. I don't see how2 it's confined to so­called mainstream, which is what we3 were talking about.4 MS. SAHARSKY:5 Justice Kennedy, is6 retaliating against7 the work that the contractor is doing for the mutual8 fund. This is investment advising. This is the heart9 of what contractors of mutual funds do for mutual funds.10 JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that, but ­­11 but I think you're ­­ I don't agree with you that ­­12 that we don't have to get into these ­­ these other13 situations, because to my mind, the principal argument14 made by the Respondent is if you read the statute15 literally the way you like, it covers a wide range of16 things that ­­ that one would have no reason to believe17 Congress wanted to cover. And unless you come up with18 some ­­ with some limiting principle that ­­ that19 eliminates that argument, I'm not inclined to go along20 with your ­­ your broad interpretation of the statute.21 So, I at least do have to grapple with ­­22 with whether there are limitations, with ­­ with what is23 ­­ what is the central mainstream of the statute and ­­24 and what is outside the statute.25 MS. SAHARSKY: Right. And what we're saying22       What I was trying to suggest,that this is a contractorits own employees and it's within￼1 is that there are ­­ there are several limitations. The2 first is that it has to be a person who is in a position3 to detect and report the types of fraud and securities4 violations that are included in the statute.5 Second, we think that "the contractor of6 such company" refers to the contractor in that role,7 working for the public company.8 Third, the expert agency that has considered9 this question has looked at whether there would be a10 floodgates open and has concluded ­­ and this is on page11 166 of the petition appendix ­­ that there are built­in12 limits so that there would not be those floodgates.13 And fourth, I can tell you as an empirical14 matter, that no floodgates have been opened. The15 Department of Labor has consistently interpreted the16 statute this way since the beginning of SOX and you'll17 find on OSHA's website that it's only 150 or maybe 20018 complaints per year that are filed with the agency.19 JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Saharsky, if I could20 take you back to second. "Contractor of such company,"21 you're saying we can read that to impose a limitation,22 that it's ­­ it's not anything that the contractor does23 in any capacity for anybody, whether relating to the24 contract or not. We could instead read it as, you know,25 "the contractor" means the ­­ the entity doing a23￼1 particular contract for a particular public company; is2 that correct? Do I get that?3 MS. SAHARSKY: Yes.4 JUSTICE KAGAN: In other words, inherent in5 the ­­ in the word "contractor" or in the phrase6 "contractor of such company" is a sort of status of a7 company, and that one should not read this statute as8 applying outside that particular status.9 MS. SAHARSKY: I think that that's right.10 And the only thing that I would add to that is that it11 could be fraud that's being reported that the contractor12 is engaging in fraud in that contract or that the public13 company is engaging in fraud. But Congress would have14 wanted both those covered.

But I think on the main question21 that's raised by this case, which is whether contractors22 can ever be covered, and the First Circuit said that23 they can't, we're in complete agreement.24 I also want to point this Court to the25 Board's opinion in this case, which we think is entitled24￼1 to Chevron deference. It's an2 opinion when the Board went ­­3 JUSTICE GINSBURG:4 we are reviewing a decision of5 the First Circuit. And this Spinner case from the ARB6 postdates. We have a district court, a court of7 appeals. Chevron didn't raise its head until after the8 First Circuit was through with the case. So how does9 Chevron come into this particular case?10 MS. SAHARSKY: It's because the agency has11 been given this authority. And the Court has faced12 cases before where it has afforded Chevron deference13 even though that was not an issue considered by the14 court of appeals. I point the Court to INS v. Agere Agere.15 It's the ­­ Congress has entrusted this expert agency16 with making decisions through formal adjudication.17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, even though it18 delegated rulemaking authority to a different agency,19 right?20 MS. SAHARSKY: No. There is no rulemaking21 authority for this provision under 1514A delegated to a22 different ­­23 JUSTICE BREYER: Then why isn't the SEC ­­24 sorry.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the SEC has no25exceptionally thoroughBut it just came up.

But the anti­retaliation4 provision in SOX, like about 20 other anti­retaliation5 provisions, is entirely handled by the Department of6 Labor and it's entirely handled through formal7 adjudication.8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: As I understand the9 ARB's decisions, they said that they were bound by10 OSHA's interpretation, right?11 MS.

I point the Court to21 footnote 8 at page 143 of the board's decision where it22 says: "In addition to this regulation, we're relying on23 several of our prior decisions" ­­ many of which do not24 even cite the regulation ­­ "and our decades of25 experience in looking at similar statutes like AIR­21."261 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      So to think that ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we should ignore the part where it said it's bound by OSHA's interpretation?MS.

Mr. Perry.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK A. PERRY      ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSMR. PERRY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      Justice Alito asked why didn't Congress sayall employers or no employers?  There are approximate 40whistleblower statutes on the books as of today, YourHonors.  And more than 30 of them, in fact, 36 of them,are phrased exactly that way.  They say "No employer mayretaliate" or "Any employer is prohibited fromretaliating."This statute is not phrased that way. This27￼￼1 statute, which Congress could have written that way, and2 Dodd­Frank 922 is written that way, this statute is3 written quite differently. This statute says, "No4 public company may retaliate," and then it has a5 subordinate clause and the subordinate clause is what's6 at issue here, that references officers, employees,7 contractors, subcontractors and agents.8 Justice Alito also asked my friend,9 Mr. Schnapper, do you contend that the same construction10 should be given to officers and to contractors, and he11 acknowledged they have to say no, because the ARB has12 also said no. In other words, an employee, the phrase13 that we are construing at the bottom of all of this,14 these turtles, is different they say for officers and15 employees and agents, presumably, than for contractors16 and subcontractors.17 But that doesn't fit with the statute. It18 doesn't fit with the tools of statutory construction,19 and it doesn't fit with what Congress was trying to do20 here.21 This was the ­­ the failure of Enron. This22 was a bankruptcy situation. Congress was acutely aware23 that corporate bankruptcies, failures, left victims high24 and dry. One of the other provisions in this title,25 Section 803, specifically deals with the28￼1 dischargeability of shareholder fraud debts in2 bankruptcy.3 And what these sub ­­ the subordinate clause4 that added these corporate representatives does is make5 sure that if the employer, the public company, goes out6 of business, the way Enron had just done, somebody is on7 the hook for the money damages that Congress authorized8 for these employees like Sharon Watkins. It's a very9 simple regime to make sure that the victim, the10 whistleblower, is not left high and dry if the company11 that is, by hypothesis, riddled with fraud goes out of12 business.13 JUSTICE ALITO: What happens if another14 Enron situation comes along and the corporation's15 accounting firm retaliates against an employee of the16 accounting firm because that employee wants to report17 illegal activity by the corporation?18 MR. PERRY: Justice Alito, the accounting19 firms are not covered by 806, and let me explain that.20 Accountants, accounting firms, and auditors are21 referenced by name 153 times in the Sarbanes­Oxley Act,22 including in Section 802 in this title. It says, "No23 accountant shall shred documents." 806 doesn't refer to24 accountants anywhere. It refers to contractors. And25 nowhere ­­291 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can an accountant be a contractor?MR. PERRY: No, Your Honor, because the ­­ the contractor that's being referred to here ­­ there's nothing in the statute, nothing in the legislative history, that suggests that an accountant is a contractor. And more importantly, the reason forthis is ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then ­­ but the bottom line of your argument Mr. Perry, is that the whistleblower who is working for the accountant ­­ you say there are separate provisions that deal with the accounting firm and the law firm. But the whistleblower who wants to disclose what nefarious thing is going on would have no protection against retaliation by the accounting firm or, if it's a law firm, the law firm?MR. PERRY: Justice Ginsburg, that is the matter that the Congress left to the expert agencies. The accounting firms are regulation by Section 105 and the PCAOB.JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the answer to my question is right, they wouldn't have ­­MR.

They could. And ­­ and I would refer the Court respectfully to Section 501 dealing with securities analysts, where Congress required the SEC to write a rule protecting whistleblowers at the investment banks that are securities analysts. So when Congress wanted to protect those people ­­      What Congress did for the accountants andlawyers was not to protect whistleblowers.  It imposed amandate.  Section 10(a) ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm sorry. You told me that Congress didn't provide for the whistleblower, but it allowed the agency to do so.                        The SEC for the lawyers.  That'sSection 307.  And the PCAOB for the accountants.  That'sSection 105.  And Section 10(a) of the Exchange Act,which is incorporated by reference, Your Honor.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the ARB?MR. PERRY: The ARB is nowhere involved with lawyers or accountants, as this Court made clear inthe ­­ in the PCAOB case. The Congress decided to put the entire accounting profession under the thumb of that31￼1 new board. That is a ­­ a purpose­built regulatory2 agency that regulates birth to death of the accounting3 industry. And if they want to protect whistleblowers or4 not protect whistleblowers, that is the board's5 business.6 Congress didn't do anything there. What7 Congress did in 806 was regulate the public companies8 and their employees. And we can see this. This ­­ this9 tracks very clearly through the legislative history.10 JUSTICE BREYER: When you're going to go11 through this, I'd appreciate your telling in your12 opinion ­­ what the statute says, taking the extraneous13 words out, is that no contractor of a publicly­traded14 company may discharge, demote, et cetera, any employee15 because of his lawful act in reporting a fraud. That's16 what it says.17 So, what did they have in mind if they18 didn't have in mind forbidding any contractor of a19 publicly­traded company from a contractor ­­ and, you20 know, maybe there are limitations there ­­ but a21 contractor from demoting an employee because of his22 lawful act reporting a fraud?23 MR. PERRY: Let me answer that in two steps,24 Justice Breyer. First, with due respect, the Court25 inverted the statute. It actually says, "No public3220 first primary clause of this21 firm, the contractor.22 JUSTICE BREYER:23 interested in here, you say,24 but not for example where you have a fund which has25 virtually no employees and does all its work really33￼1 company," comma, "or" ­­2 JUSTICE BREYER:3 the extraneous words and instead of the not the word4 "such," I put in what "such" refers.5 MR. PERRY: It's not extraneous here because6 it is ­­ it is subordinating the contractors to the7 public employees. And what ­­ more importantly, second,8 what Congress is doing ­­ and this is in response to my9 friend's question was this a meaningless act? If I10 could point the Court to the Kalkunte case. The11 Kalkunte case is an ARB decision from 2009. It's cited12 at page 16 of the government's brief.13 Here is a bankrupt company and the estate14 brings in a workout firm, a privately­held contractor to15 wind down the affairs of the company. And this private16 contractor decides that there's a squeaky wheel employee17 within the legal department and fires her. And she sues18 under Section 806 both the estate of the bankrupt19 company, that is the public company employer in theOr any ­­ I just eliminatedstatute, and the workoutAll right.  So all they'reis this workout contractor,JUSTICE BREYER: Now, all that's a conceivable reading, I agree.￼1   through investment advisors such as here, and you think2   Congress didn't want to include the investment advisor3   firing its whistleblower even if it's directly related4   to the fraud, the  hot fund and everything else, but it did5 6 7 8 9just want to include the people who ­­ who are therebecause the contractor is a workout firm, and ­­ and notthe investment advisor.MR. PERRY: Your Honor ­­MR. PERRY: We ­­101112131415161718   1940.  And for this I can point you to Dodd­Frank 922,19   the parallel whistleblower's provision that my friends20   haven't talked about, but is very important here because21   it does cover all employers.22 And when Congress covered all employers in23   Dodd­Frank, it amended the 1940 Acts to make clear that24   investment advisors were included.  And the SEC has25   issued its Form TCR that applies to investment advisors.34JUSTICE BREYER: But what is it that leads you to that conclusion other than ­­MR. PERRY: Three points here, Your Honor. First, when Congress wishes to reach investment advisors, in SOX and elsewhere it amends the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisors Act of25 JUSTICE SCALIA:­­ that it has no power to￼1 Congress didn't do any of that in Sarbanes­Oxley.2 Second, we know the very next Congress after3 Sarbanes­Oxley, took up the Mutual Reform ­­ Mutual Fund4 Reform Act, which would have amended Section 806 to5 include investment advisors, to do exactly what the6 Petitioners in this case say the statute did. Why would7 Congress have taken up, the very next Congress ­­ all8 the same members are still there; Senator Sarbanes was9 still there ­­ taken up a bill to do that?10 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's sort of11 post­legislative history, which we usually don't pay12 attention to. The ­­ the problem that I have is if ­­13 if the statute does not cover contractors',14 subcontractors', firing of their own people, what ­­15 what coverage does it have? A subcontractor usually16 cannot fire somebody from the principal company that's17 traded on the exchange.18 MR. PERRY: Justice Scalia, it's not just19 firing. It's also harassing. It's also threatening.20 These are contractors who may be working ­­21 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't ­­ I don't see how22 it can harass or threaten either if it's ­­ if it's an23 employee of another company ­­24 MR. PERRY: Sure, Your Honor.35￼1 fire.2 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, it can ­­ there have3 contractors that are in the operation, management4 consultants and others that are working side by side5 with public company employees who can make their lives6 difficult, who can make their lives intolerable, who can7 lead to a constructive discharge if it's bad enough.8 And this Court has said in the Title VII9 context, that that kind of discrimination does not10 require a supervisory relationship, and these11 contractors, just like agents and officers, employees,12 may have that ability to affect the terms and conditions13 of the public company's employees.14 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you ­­ you're ­­ you're15 eliminating the ­­ the principal contractors who might16 have that kind of power. You say they're not covered.17 MR. PERRY:18 JUSTICE SCALIA:19 MR. PERRY:20 there are ­­ I mean, they are not covered by ­­ for21 their own employees. If they were to discriminate22 against a public company employee ­­ the public23 company's employees are always protected. That is the24 subject of this statute, the employees of the public25 company.36The accountants and lawyers.     Yes, yes.Absolutely.  But, you know, if1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Let's look at the title. We know Congress didn't leave a big mystery about who they were protecting here: Whistleblower protection for employees of publicly­traded companies. That's what the Congress told us ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Including by accountants and lawyers.MR. PERRY: Against the public company's employees, I ­­ I absolutely agree.JUSTICE SCALIA: How so if ­­ if accountants and lawyers are not ­­ are not contractors?MR. PERRY: If I said that, I ­­ I misspoke, Your Honor. I didn't say they weren't contractors. I said they weren't regulated as contractors here because they were specifically regulated as accountants elsewhere. If they fit within the statute ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: What does it mean that they're not regulated as contractors here? Unless it means that contractor here does not include them.MR. PERRY: Let me ­­ let me try to be much clearer. The government makes the point that this statute is written to cover Arthur Andersen. I can't agree with that. Arthur Andersen appears all over this statute, and there's two titles of this statute that deal with accountants.37￼￼1 Arthur Andersen might be included here if2 it ­­ if it discriminates against a client, an audit3 client's employee. That ­­ that's just a normal4 contracting or agency relationship. That's what5 Congress was dealing with. What's not covered is Arthur6 Andersen retaliating against its own employees. That is7 what Congress gave to the Board to decide or for the8 lawyers to the SEC to decide.9 And, again, I would have to point the Court10 to Section 501, which ordered the SEC to make a rule11 protecting securities analysts.12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Apparently, that's not13 the view of the SEC because I think they are ­­ they are14 represented by the government. And the SEC apparently15 takes the view that this provision does cover16 contractors. It covers lawyers who couldn't be17 contractors and accountants.18 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, they ­­ they are19 defending the ARB's decision. I agree with that. The20 ARB's decision, however, is ­­ all comes back to this21 procedural regulation that OSHA promulgated that they22 agree is not entitled to deference. So it's not a23 reasoned articulation of the government's position. It24 is, rather, a post hoc rationalization of what the OSHA25 said a long time ago.38￼1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's a lot like the2 dissent in the First Circuit.3 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, the dissent in the4 First Circuit, like the ARB, I agree, disassociates the5 statute, the language "an employee" from its context,6 from its grammar, from its syntax, from the title of the7 statute, from the legislative history. I mean, the8 Senate report, Your Honor, goes through six times to9 explain what is the problem being addressed. And10 Congress says, "There is no current protection for11 employees of publicly­traded companies." That's at page12 18.13 So what does this legislation do, Section14 806? It provides protection for employees of15 publicly­traded companies. That's at page 19.16 JUSTICE BREYER: You're right on that. I17 mean, it is correct that that's what they talk about.18 And so that sends us on a search for limitation. You19 have one limitation. Your limitation says the person20 who is dismissed has to be an employee of the21 publicly­traded company.22 Now, the government, and ­­ and even your ­­23 Mr. Schnapper has come up with accepting some24 limitations. There are possibly others. One would be25 on the nature of the contractor, which you want to do,39￼1 but it would be somewhat broader than yours. Another,2 possibly, is on the nature of the fraud. Is it related3 to the contract? Another might be the one the district4 court proposed, and there could be others.5 So I think if you want to say anything about6 this, it seems to me that taking as given ­­ I will for7 argument's sake anyway ­­ say all the legislative8 history is about publicly­traded companies. And I do9 look at it. But nonetheless, they did use this language10 in their other possible limitations that would serve the11 same purpose.12 Then you say to that, saying yours is the13 best, what?14 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, first, the very need15 for this discussion about limitations, which is found16 nowhere in the statute and nowhere in the legislative17 history, is eliminated if the Court were to construe the18 statute as Chief Judge Lynch and the majority did below19 for ­­20 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, that itself is a big21 limitation. Huge.22 MR. PERRY: That's exactly right. Well,23 it's the limitation that Congress put in the statute,24 Your Honor. If we go beyond that, it seems to me25 universally accepted by my friends on this side that40￼1 some limitation is needed. It can't be every company2 with a contract to the public company, except that is3 what the ARB said a contractor is. Okay? And it can't4 be every kind of misconduct, except that's what the ARB5 has said this statute covers.6 And I point to the Lockheed case, which has7 nothing to do with fraud against shareholders. This is8 a run­of­the­mill adulterous affair by a ­­ by a9 gossip ­­ by an office gossip and a supervisor that the10 person brings a lawsuit under Section 806 saying that is11 fraud because she submitted her expense accounts. So12 what we have is ­­13 JUSTICE KENNEDY:14 MR. PERRY:15 correct.16 JUSTICE KENNEDY:17 fraud was in this ­­18 MR. PERRY:19 So, Justice Breyer, your gardener, your20 three­person gardener, there's a couple of problems with21 it. First, if the same gardening company works for Ken22 Lay and for Enron ­­ this goes back to Justice Alito's23 question ­­ my friend's argument is they're covered when24 they work for Enron but not covered when they work for25 Ken Lay. That's a bizarre reading of the statute.41      That was fraud under 1343?As wire fraud, Your Honor,      Well, was that what theIn the Lockheed case, correct.￼1 Okay?2 Second, they're covered under the ­­ all of3 the so­called limitations they've been offered if the4 junior gardener thinks ­­ hears gossip that the senior5 gardener is having an affair and submitting false6 expense reports regarding the hotel receipts ­­ that's7 the facts of the Lockheed case ­­ and reports that to8 the middle gardener, and nothing happens, and then the9 junior gardener gets fired because the economy downturns10 or something.11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, those ­­12 that's an easy hypothetical. What about the butler who13 does, in fact, hear all this information about a14 conspiracy and wire fraud?15 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, there are still the16 state law protections, of course, for public policy and17 other protections. There is the Dodd­Frank Act. We18 haven't talked about it enough. Dodd­Frank 922 came in19 eight years later and said ­­ Congress said we think we20 need to do more. We think we need to cover all21 employers, but we're going to provide more limitations.22 We're going to require a written submission to the SEC23 under penalty of perjury, and we're going to limit it to24 securities fraud.25 So if the butler learns that the boss is42￼1 doing something untoward, the butler then can go to the2 SEC and make a complaint. If it pans out, he can even3 get a bounty under that program. And if he gets fired,4 he's completely protected and has reinstatement and back5 pay.6 Congress dealt with that. There ­­ there is7 a gap of eight years. We definitely acknowledge that.8 But Congress moves incrementally in this area. The ­­9 the Sarbanes­Oxley Act was the first major widespread10 corporate governance reform at the Federal level, and11 Congress didn't purport to do everything at once. It12 went a long way. It subjected every public company to13 these new things.14 But for my friends to suggest that they15 covered not just the 5,000 public companies, but all 616 million private companies without ever mentioning the17 fact, without ever discussing it, without debating it,18 without acknowledging that that would be the consequence19 is a dramatic ­­ a dramatic expansion of this statute20 that was already pretty dramatic to begin with, that21 barely passed, as the Court may remember.22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So doesn't that drama23 reduce itself if we accept the government's limitation24 that it has to do only with the fraud related to the25 public company?43￼1 MR. PERRY: Your Honor ­­2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because that was the3 center of this bill ­­ what motivated this bill.4 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, I agree that would5 be a ­­ a limitation. I don't agree that it's found in6 the language of the statute. I mean, as a ­­ as a7 defense lawyer, I would like that down the road. But ­­8 and the ARB in the Lockheed case didn't seem to suggest9 that there is any such limitation. The ARB simply said10 fraud. And Mr. Schnapper, Petitioners here certainly11 took that position today. So it's every fraud of any12 sort by any company that has a contract ­­13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But we're not being14 asked to give deference to the Petitioner. We're being15 asked to give deference to the government.16 MR. PERRY: That's why I pointed to the17 ARB's decision in Lockheed, Your Honor. And the18 language there is exceedingly sweeping. It rejected all19 limitations that were offered in that case. The20 government's so­called limitation is no limitation at21 all. It is simply anything that is fraudulent is22 covered according ­­23 JUSTICE BREYER: They didn't say that today.24 And ­­ and if, in fact, the fraud is related to the25 contract or by certain kinds of contractors who do44￼1 investment work, who do all kinds of important work for2 the company, why shouldn't it be covered? I mean, and3 the language, of course, does say what I read, as you4 agreed. It says a contractor.5 MR. PERRY: Justice ­­ Justice Breyer, if I6 could return to the point of this discussion of7 limitations, which is fascinating, but we are having it8 for the first time in the Supreme Court of the United9 States. Congress never had this discussion. Congress10 never discussed limitations because Congress never11 contemplated covering private companies.12 JUSTICE ALITO: What the statute says is13 "any conduct," "any conduct which the employee14 reasonably believes constitutes a violation of Section15 1341, '43, '44, or '48." Do you see in there any16 limitation that says that the conduct has to be17 fraudulent conduct relating to the activities of a18 publicly held company.19 MR. PERRY: It is not in the terms of the20 statute, Your Honor, and, as21 holding of the Lockheed case22 JUSTICE SCALIA:23 limitation. Unfortunately, it's not there.24 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, that's the danger of25 moving beyond the text of the statute. If we­ They won't45I just said, that was thein the  ARB.It's a very sensible￼1 admit, my friends won't admit, that every contractor and2 every fraud is covered. But that is the import of their3 argument. We submit that that's not right, or at least4 that that decision, if it is5 the Congress or by an agency6 on the public record to take7 it. No ­­10 not the Labor Department. But then, as was pointed out,11 fine, then you're going to have that rulemaking and12 given their position here, it looks as if they will hold13 something you don't like. But ­­ so what are we14 supposed to do about that, in your opinion?15 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, they have not had16 that rulemaking since this statute was enacted in 2002,17 and we don't know whether they will have that18 rulemaking. The Court's opportunity and I would submit19 obligation, respectfully, is to read the statute as it20 was passed by Congress.21 JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume you would say that22 that rulemaking would be ultra vires, if it took the23 position that the government's taking here, right?24 MR.

I ­­ I am not going to quarrel with her on that.2 JUSTICE SCALIA: But even if they did and3 they came out with a rule that reads just the way the4 government presented it today, you would say that that5 is an unreasonable reading of the statute, wouldn't you?6 MR. PERRY: We would, but we would also have7 a rulemaking record and a cost­benefit analysis of the8 impact on private companies and the impact on employment9 and all of the things that agencies have to take into10 account when they make these determinations, none of11 which exists on this record. We simply have the ARB12 deciding 5,000, 6 million, good enough, let's move13 forward. And that is not, we submit, what Congress14 intended here.15 Congress did not intend for the ARB to be16 able to make that decision. Both of my friends here17 agree that our reading, the First Circuit's reading, is18 a plausible construction of the statute. There is no19 argument that it is unambiguous on their side. Okay?20 So their argument must be that Congress intended not to21 be able to22 it's 5,00023 companies,24 of lawyers25 plausible.answer this question, not to know whetherpublic companies or 6 million privateand so they punted that to an unelected boardwithin the Labor Department.  That is not47￼1 JUSTICE BREYER:2 get to this. I thought Section 3(a) of3 Sarbanes­Oxley ­­ that's what we found here. Quote,4 "The Securities and Exchange Commission shall promulgate5 such rules and regulations as may be necessary and6 appropriate in the public interest or for the protection7 of investors and in furtherance of this Act."8 So why doesn't that delegate right to the9 SEC the power to interpret the general provisions of the10 Section 802?11 MR. PERRY: To be quite blunt,12 Justice Breyer, before the government's concession13 20 minutes ago, I would have thought the same thing.14 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, so I mean, I don't15 know that we should interpret that provision since no16 one has briefed, given ­­ on that basis.17 MR. PERRY: We can certainly say this,18 though. What we know is the SEC has not exercised its19 power under 3(a) or under 307 or under 501, also dealing20 with contractors of sorts, to provide for whistleblower21 protections. If it chooses to do so in the future, then22 we would have a different lawsuit.23 What we have now, however, is the unadorned24 statute passed by Congress, which deals with public25 companies. We have the First Circuit in an exhaustive48Why is it ­­ we may have to￼1 opinion construing it, again using all the ordinary2 tools of statutory construction, which this Court has3 directed the lower courts to do, to determine plausibly,4 as everyone agrees, plausibly that it only covers public5 companies.6 We have a reading, then, that gives meaning7 to every single meaning to every single word in the8 statute, that is comprehensible, that fits the purpose9 of the statute. Remember the overall purpose of the10 statute is disclosure by public companies. It is not11 protection of investors, as some at times have said. It12 is disclosures by public companies.13 Private companies make no disclosures. They14 are not governed by the securities laws. So excluding15 private company employees makes perfect sense in that16 respect. Mutual funds, Mr. Schnapper at page 13 of his17 reply brief says: Well, the advisors make all the18 disclosures for the mutual funds. We had that argument,19 Your Honor, two years ago. Justice Thomas wrote the20 opinion for the Court in the Janus case, which rejected21 that very argument and said the mutual fund and the22 advisor are separate companies; the mutual fund makes23 the disclosures. Congress has set up the mutual fund24 industry that way.25 The ICI's brief in this case explains very49￼1 cogently, I believe, all of the separate protections,2 including the independent board of directors and the3 chief compliance officer mandated by the SEC's '40 Act4 regulations that protect the investors in mutual5 funds.6 So we have a coherent, on the First Circuit7 side, a coherent reading of the statute that my friends8 admit is plausible, that gives meaning to every word in9 the statute, that fits exactly the title that Congress10 used. And the title is legislative language passed by11 Congress signed by the President. It fits every word of12 the legislative history. It makes perfect sense and it13 doesn't have any untoward results. We submit that ­­14 JUSTICE ALITO: It gives the reference to15 the subcontractors or to contractors and the16 subcontractors such a narrow meaning. And except for17 this concept of the axe­wielding specialist, those18 provisions mean nothing under that. That's what gives19 me pause about your interpretation.20 MR. PERRY: Justice Alito, it gives21 employees two things. They give another defendant,22 which means another insurance policy. So for example,23 if you sue the company you get the E&O policy. If you24 sue the president at the same time, you get the D&O25 policy. So you get two separate insurance policies ,50￼1 which is more money, more availability. You get the2 personal liability. Officers hate to be sued; so do3 contractors. And if the public company goes out of4 business, you get that protection of monetary relief.5 JUSTICE ALITO: My question wasn't clear.6 If you say that the employees, only the employee of the7 publicly held company and not the employee of the8 private ­­ privately held subcontractor, then that ­­9 the only situation is covered with respect to the10 contractor is this so­called axe­wielding specialist.11 MR. PERRY: You have the axe­wielding12 specialist. The real world is Kalkunte. I gave you13 that case where that actually happened.14 JUSTICE ALITO: Yes, it can happen, but it's15 really very small, isn't it?16 MR. PERRY: Well, Your Honor, that was one17 of six cases the ARB decided under this statute in 2009.18 So that year that was one­sixth of the cases. That's19 not ­­ I mean, it happens, okay?20 And it is a ­­ it is a conceivable scenario21 in many more things because, again, it's not limited to22 discharge. It's also threats and harassment, and we23 certainly can see situations where contractors,24 particularly those kinds of contractors like management25 consultants, photocopy vendors, and so forth, are in the5125 JUSTICE SCALIA:Who was it, counsel?￼1 facility with the public company employees, can make2 their life miserable.3 And remember, I am going to agree with my4 friend Mr. Schnapper on something. Congress recognized5 that Enron was structured in a way to try to get the6 liability out of headquarters. They had all these7 subsidiaries, they had Chewco and Ponderosa and all8 this. And Congress recognized that corporations might9 try to avoid their liability, so that by picking up10 officers, employees, contractors, subcontractors and11 agents, they were trying to make sure that if the12 company tried to lay off the responsibility on somebody13 else, they would still get captured because their14 employees were doing it.15 They could have done that just under agency.16 Many employment laws, of course, speak only of officers,17 employees, and agents. But many contracts disclaim18 agency, disclaim ­­19 JUSTICE BREYER: Where did it come from?20 That is, where did the words "contractor"? Some human21 being wrote them for the first time.

There is nothing ­­ the word "contractor" specifically appears nowhere in the legislative history. In the entire legislative history of the Sarbanes­Oxley Act, every hearing, every floor statement, every report, it nowhere appears.      It came, the word "contractor" came from the53      JUSTICE BREYER:human being who wrote them and what did he have in mind,or she?(Laughter.)5 about 67 said, 8JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the language did talk Arthur Andersen and Enron.MR.

That is language from3 Title VII.4If I could just finish with this point. The 9 Senate report lists four examples of the so­called10 corporate code of silence: The Andersen partner, the11 Vinson and Elkins lawyers, the UBS securities analyst,12 and Sharon Watkins at Enron.13 Congress dealt with them in four different14 provisions: Section 105 for the accountants, section15 307 for the lawyers, Section 501 for the securities16 analysts, and Section 806 for the public company17 employee. And then ­­ we haven't talked about this yet,18 either ­­ it added, for good measure, Section 1107,19 which says whoever shall retaliate against anybody who20 provides information to a law enforcement officer, which21 includes the SEC, is subject to a criminal offense under22 Title 18.23 So we have this interlocking, connected,24 nested series of provisions that deals with each of the25 concerns identified by Congress in an industry­specific54MR.

And at no point did Congress suggest,intimate, hint, that, oh, by regulating these things,the lawyers, the accountants, the securities analystsand the public companies, that they also were going tosweep in 6 million private employers.      And if a member of Congress, I would submit,had stood up on the floor and suggested that, it wouldhave been met with debate, derision, and defeat.      The First Circuit's judgment, Your Honors,should be affirmed.  Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.      Mr. Schnapper, you have five minutes left.     REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPERON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. SCHNAPPER: Thank you, Your Honor. Let me begin by just referring the Court tosome materials that might be relevant to some of thequestions you asked.  With regard to the SEC's viewprior to this case coming to this Court, those viewswere expressed in a separate brief the SEC filed in theFirst Circuit, which is consistent with the government'sapproach here.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But we know they don't have rulemaking authority in this area.55￼1 but the question came up about what their views were.2 With regard to the suggestion earlier that3 the ARB has taken the position that every contract ­­4 every firm that has a contract with a public company is5 a contractor. Actually, in the Fleszar case, which is6 mentioned in both the Respondent's brief and our yellow7 brief, the ­­ the ARB is for the opposite position8 and ­­ and took a position, I think, consistent with9 the view we've advanced, which is not every contract10 renders you a contractor.11 With regard to Arthur Andersen, the12 discussion in the Senate Report about why there's a need13 to deal with retaliation is repeatedly about Arthur14 Andersen. Many of the people who actually understood15 what was going on at ­­ at Enron were Arthur Andersen16 employees, not most of the run­of­the­mill employees at17 Enron, and they were the ones who remained silent in the18 face of this very, very serious problem.19 With regard to the origins of this phrase20 contractor, my brother, Mr. Perry, was right, it comes21 from AIR­21. The preliminary AIR­21 regulations22 regarding what it means were issued prior to the23 adoption of SOX and they said it included employers ­­24 employees of employers, which has remained the view of25 the agency throughout.56￼1 My colleague ­­ with regard to AIR­21, the2 history here is, I think, important. This statute3 referred to air carriers and contractors and4 subcontractors, and the court below assumed that that5 meant that employees of subcontractors and contractors6 were covered.7 The First Circuit's theory was that Congress8 meant to narrow the meaning of contractor employees9 because it added retaliation by officers and employees.10 And it seems to me that that is precisely the wrong11 conclusion.12 When Congress added to the entities that13 could not retaliate, when it rewrote AIR­21 to add some14 other people that couldn't retaliate, it didn't mean to15 tacitly then eliminate the employees of contractors who16 were governed under AIR­21.17 Finally, with regard to the question the18 Court has raised about whether it should explore the19 possibility of a limitation based on whether a20 contractor was acting as a contractor, we think it would21 probably not be prudent to take that on at this time for22 a couple of reasons.23 First of all, a fair amount of work that was24 done by Arthur Andersen was not ­­ that was relevant25 wasn't done for Enron. It was done for the571 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425off­the­books enterprises.  They did $5.7 million ofaccounting work for Jedi, where the debts ­­ one of theplaces where the debts were being hidden.  So you ­­you'd get into that problem.      Secondly, this provision is adopted againstthe background of a series of executive orders, mostimportant which is Executive Order 11246, about racialdiscrimination by Federal contractors.      That executive order has always beenunderstood to cover all the employees of the contractor,not just the employees who are working on the governmentproject.  And I think that's an important part of thebackground.  Congress has not tried to ­­ the ExecutiveBranch hasn't limited it to that.      And in the Civil Rights Restoration Act ofabout 1986, Congress rewrote Title 6 and Title 9 to haveinstitution­wide application rather than to do littleparts of it.      This issue about what a contractor might bedoing as a contractor hasn't been vetted in lower courtsand we think it would be not prudent to try to ­­ totake that on here.Thank you very much.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:The case is submitted.58Thank you, counsel.￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425
