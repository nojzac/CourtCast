Noel Canning.      General Verrilli?    ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERGENERAL VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court:      The interpretation of the RecessAppointments Clause that Respondent urges wouldrepudiate the constitutional legitimacy of thousands ofappointments by presidents going back to GeorgeWashington, and going forward, it would diminishpresidential authority in a way that is flatly at oddswith the constitutional structure the Framersestablished.      Respondent simply has not advanced thecompelling case that would be needed to strip Presidentsof their traditional authority to make appointmentsduring intra­session recesses and to fill preexistingvacancies.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You say ­­ you say that it would repudiate the constitutionality of3￼￼1 appointments. You don't suggest that those ­­ the2 actions of those appointees would be invalid going back3 however far you want to go back, do you?4 GENERAL VERRILLI: No, but they ­­ no, I5 don't, Mr. Chief Justice, but it certainly would6 repudiate the legitimacy of those appointments.7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why not?8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How did it ­­ how did it9 affect the ­­ how many board decisions will have to be10 redone, or how did ­­ how is the board coping with that11 problem?12 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, there are many13 dozens of board decisions and, perhaps, many hundreds of14 board decisions that are under a cloud as a result of15 the D.C. Circuit's ruling in this case. And so the16 board will have a considerable amount of work to do17 in ­­ if the D.C. Circuit's decision were to be18 affirmed.19 Now, there would be issues about waiver,20 there'll be issues about whether there ­­ there is21 authority sufficient to justify what the board did under22 other circumstances or apparent authority arguments. So23 that would all have to be sorted out with respect to the24 board's ruling ­­25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:4What would happen if ­­1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425under the reasoning of this case, what would happen tothe decisions of recess­appointed judges?      JUSTICE SCALIA:you would argue the de facto      GENERAL VERRILLI:      JUSTICE SCALIA:      GENERAL VERRILLI:      JUSTICE SCALIA:Well, surely, you would ­­officer doctrine.  Yes, we would.Of course, you would.  Yes, we would.And we've applied that in￼      GENERAL VERRILLI:      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:quite a few.      GENERAL VERRILLI:very serious question, Justice Sotomayor, and I think itdoes point up the ­­ the difficulty with the positionRespondent is urging.innumerable cases.  You don't really think we're goingto go back and rip out every decision made.GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I would certainly hope not, Your Honor, but it certainly casts a serious cloud over the legitimacy of all of those actions. And it does point up the fact that the recess power, including appointments during intra­session recesses and to fill preexisting vacancies has been used to fill offices of great importance.JUSTICE SCALIA:You started off by5Well, I think that ­­ Of which there's beenI think that would be a￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425saying ­­ you know, it would ­­ it would repudiate somany actions that have been taken.  I have a very, verystark question:  Suppose I agree with the court ofappeals that the only ­­ the only interpretation of ­­of the Constitution is that the vacancy must have arisenduring the recess, just by hypothesis.  I agree withthat, okay?      What do you do when there is a practicethat ­­ that flatly contradicts a clear text of theConstitution?  Which ­­ which of the two prevails?GENERAL VERRILLI: Now, I think the practice has to prevail, Your Honor, but I do ­­ and I ­­      JUSTICE SCALIA:Constitution ­­      GENERAL VERRILLI:      JUSTICE SCALIA:meaning changes?      GENERAL VERRILLI:course, in this situation, the meaning of the clausewith respect to the timing of ­­ of the vacancy has beena matter of contention since the first days of theRepublic.JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, you're ­­ you're questioning my hypothesis.

Should I say, oh, yes, it ­­ it says something else, but the practice for over 200 years has been something different, and it's the practice that must prevail.GENERAL VERRILLI: The practice has started with George Washington, and it has worked through the ­­      JUSTICE SCALIA:hypothesis again.      GENERAL VERRILLI:You're questioning my ­­ my  No ­­I am assuming a clear text      JUSTICE SCALIA:of the Constitution and a practice that is ­­ iscontrary to it.￼      JUSTICE SCALIA:      GENERAL VERRILLI:already answered that.      JUSTICE SCALIA:over the clear text ­­      GENERAL VERRILLI:meaning to the ­­ the practice gives meaning to theConstitution ­­7Well, I think I'veYes or no?  I think ­­ I think I'veDoes the practice prevailThe practice gives￼1 GENERAL VERRILLI:2 that would arise if the text were so free of doubt.

I think I already answered it once,8 Justice Scalia, but I'll answer it again. The answer is9 I think, given this ­­ a practice going back to the10 founding of the Republic, the practice should be ­­ the11 practice should govern, but we don't have that here.12 This provision has been subject to13 contention as to its meaning since the first days of the14 Republic.15 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me ask you about16 the premise. A vacancy is something that begins at a17 particular point in time, and then it continues for some18 period. And I was trying to think of some other things19 that might fall into the same category. One would be an20 appointment to a Federal office.21 So you were appointed as Solicitor General22 at a particular point in time, and the appointment23 continues. Another example might be a marriage. It24 happens at a particular point in time, and it continues25 for a ­­ a period of time.8It's extremely unlikely￼1 Now, would we say that your appointment as2 Solicitor General is happening today and will happen3 again tomorrow and happened yesterday? Is that the way4 the English language is used?5 GENERAL VERRILLI: But the word "happens"6 may not always be an apt phrase, the phrase "may7 happen," the constitutional phrase, but it is a natural8 use. And if I may, Justice Alito, I'll give you a9 counterexample.10 If Congress had enacted a statute in the11 summer of 2008 that said the Federal Reserve is invested12 with all powers necessary to deal with any financial13 emergency that may happen in 2009, if that emergency14 first arose in November of 2008, I don't think anybody15 would interpret that statute as denying the Federal16 Reserve the authority that Congress conferred.17 And that's because "may happen" ­­ "may18 happen" won't cover every situation of a persisting19 state, but it's certainly a natural reading of it that20 covers some. And as Jefferson said, it's certain ­­ in21 this context, it's certainly susceptible of being22 interpreted to mean ­­23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Verrilli, we've24 taken you off your starting point. Your starting point25 was what is it ­­ what constitutes a recess. And your9￼1 position is that it can be an intra­session recess. But2 if we look back historically, Congress met, and they met3 continuously. And then they went on horseback back4 home, and they were away for 6 months, even 9 months.5 Today, there's nothing like that. The6 inter­session ­­ the inter­session recess could be ­­7 could be an hour. So what do we do with that? There8 was the vision of a long recess running for months, and9 today, the inter­session recess might be momentary.10 GENERAL VERRILLI: So I think I have two11 points to make in response to the question of what to12 do. The first one is that, with respect to the original13 understanding, we do think that the term "recess" and14 the phrase "the recess" certainly, at the time of the15 founding, did encompass recesses that occurred during a16 session of Congress, during a session of a17 legislature, and not just in between sessions of the18 legislature.19 I would point the Court to Jefferson's20 Manual of Parliamentary Procedure, which describes a21 recess by adjournment as occurring within a session. I22 would point to the Adjournment Clause itself, which says23 if the ­­ one house of Congress wants to take a break of24 longer than 3 days during the session, it needs the25 consent of the other house, which indicates that the10￼1 Framers contemplated the possibility of a break longer2 than 3 days.3 I would point the Court to the parliamentary4 practice of the House of Commons, where the speaker of5 the House of Commons had authority to call elections6 when a member died during the recess.7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, Justice8 Ginsburg's question points out that your argument is, it9 seems to me, in search of a limiting principle. A lunch10 break, a one­day break ­­ you've ­­ you've thought about11 this ­­ a 3­day break, a 1­week break, a 1­month break;12 how do you resolve that problem for us?13 GENERAL VERRILLI: I think the ­­ the way we14 resolve that problem is by looking to the Adjournment15 Clause. We think, if it's a break that is sufficiently16 short, that it wouldn't require the ­­ wouldn't require17 the one House to get the consent of the other, but18 that's a de minimis recess, and that's not a recess in19 which the President would have authority ­­20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that 3 days?21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what about the pro22 forma sessions, then? They don't ­­ or correct me if23 I'm wrong. They don't require the consent of the other24 house.25 GENERAL VERRILLI:11Well, but the problem19 conducted." Does that suffice20 as a recess?21 GENERAL VERRILLI:22 that's a different case, and I23 significantly harder case for the Executive because24 here ­­25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah. Well, it's12￼1 with the pro forma sessions, I think, Justice Kennedy,2 is in thinking about the length of the recess. The3 recess, we would submit ­­ and this is based on the4 formal dictionary definition of "recess" at the time of5 the founding and now, which is "a suspension of6 business," the recess was from January 3 when the7 session started until January 23.8 And the reason I think that ­­9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So ­­ so you think there's10 no recess during pro forma sessions?11 GENERAL VERRILLI: There is a recess. And12 the reason is because the Senate has issued a formal13 order that no business shall be conducted and that's a14 formal ­­15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let's just16 talk ­­ let's focus on that. What, instead of17 saying, "No business shall be conducted," the order18 said, "It is not anticipated that any business will beto eliminate that periodI think that it's a ­­think, concededly, a￼1 difficult and harder, but it also suggests that you're2 just talking about a couple of magic words that the3 Senate can just change at the drop of a hat, so maybe4 the point is not that significant.5 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I think it is6 significant, Mr. Chief Justice. It's a formal action by7 the Senate by rule saying that no business shall be8 conducted.9 And then in addition, there are other formal10 actions that the Senate took during this period that are11 confirming indicia. The Senate passed ­­ the Senate12 passed a resolution that gave committees the authority13 to submit reports and report bills. They passed a14 resolution giving the ­­ the President Pro Tempore the15 power to sign enrolled bills. It passed ­­16 JUSTICE KAGAN: But General, I think you're ­­17 you're not answering the real thrust of the Chief18 Justice's question, which is that we could just be back19 here if we ­­ if we said, well, they didn't phrase this20 in the right way.21 Well, they'll phrase it differently, and we22 would be back here with the same essential problem, that23 you're asking us to peg this on a formality that the24 Senate could easily evade, and that suggests that it25 really is the Senate's job to determine whether they're13VERRILLI:SOTOMAYOR:Sure.  Of course, it And ­­ and to work everyThat's true. ­­ lots of people do.That's true.  Theyto take a recess. So ­­That's absolutely true.that is the choice thatVERRILLI:SOTOMAYOR:VERRILLI:could decide not￼1 in recess or whether they're not.2 GENERAL VERRILLI: I think there has to be a3 limit to that point, Justice Kagan, because, after all,4 what we're talking about here is a power that the5 Constitution gives to the President, the power in6 Article II, and the President has got to make the7 determination of when there's a recess.8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But why? You're making9 an assumption, which is that the Senate has to take a10 recess, but the Senate could choose, if it wanted to,11 and I think there might be some citizens that would12 encourage it to, to never recess.13 GENERAL14 could.15 JUSTICE16 day, which ­­17 GENERAL18 JUSTICE19 GENERAL20 could ­­ they21 (Laughter.)22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:23 GENERAL VERRILLI:24 But ­­ but it seems to me that25 the Constitution puts ­­14￼1 JUSTICE BREYER:2 the Twentieth Amendment, which says that that3 January 3rd was a meeting? Are you saying they violated4 the Twentieth Amendment? January 3rd. This says the5 Congress of the United States shall meet on January 3rd6 every year, unless they appoint a different day.7 GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes.8 JUSTICE BREYER: And they haven't. And,9 therefore, they met in pro forma session. Or do you10 think it wasn't a meeting? And what do you think about11 the other part of the Constitution, which says they12 can't adjourn for more than 3 days without the approval13 of the House, which they didn't have.14 So are you saying that the Senate violated15 those other two amendments of ­­ the two parts of the16 Constitution, or are you saying that they have different17 meanings in the three parts?18 GENERAL VERRILLI: I think our view is that19 it's hard to see how the ­­ what the ­­ what the Senate20 did with pro forma sessions complies with either and ­­21 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So you're saying22 they violated, if that ­­ if they have pro forma23 sessions on January 3rd, they violate the Twentieth24 Amendment to the Constitution. You are saying that if25 they had a pro forma session on January 3rd, that since15So what do you say about￼1 their meeting ­­ their recess was still on and lasted2 more than 3 days, it was a violation of that Adjournment3 Clause of the Constitution.4 Now, that's one way to interpret it. Over a5 long period of time, they have apparently met pro forma6 on those days. Or we could try to make them mean the7 same thing, which would mean it was up to the Senate.8 They consider that a meeting, it's a meeting. What do9 we do?10111213141516171819202122232425GENERAL VERRILLI: Or there is another option, Justice Breyer.JUSTICE BREYER: Would you write that opinion, saying the Senate of the United States has violated two ­­ two provisions of the Constitution?GENERAL VERRILLI: No, no. I don'tthink you need ­­ I don't think you need to write that opinion.JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Why not?GENERAL VERRILLI: Because you might, perhaps, give the Senate some deference with respect to requirements that apply only internally to the Congress. But when what you're talking about is the Senate's use of pro forma sessions in a manner that deprives the President of authority that Article II would otherwise give to the President ­­16￼1 JUSTICE BREYER:2 mean, that's my basic question, really. Why is this an3 important case? I see what you're saying on this one.4 That's fine for an answer. Thank you.5 GENERAL VERRILLI: So why ­­6 JUSTICE BREYER: What my really basic7 question is why is this an important case, in your8 opinion? Now, you've said, oh, because there are9 thousands of recess appointments, not on the happen10 clause.11 You've listed 7600 or so, really, on the12 recess part, but on the happen clause, you've only been13 able to find 102. And moreover, we've had an example14 of ­­ where this Court, for better or for worse, said15 that two members of the board is not a quorum, and we16 got some more members, they dealt with the problem.17 They ratified all those opinions, they dealt with it.18 It didn't take them too much time.19 So ­­ and we have different political20 parties taking absolutely opposite sides, it seems to21 me, or some members thereof, depending on the political22 party of the President. And we have a clause that had23 to do with the Constitution and the problem of intra ­­24 inter­session recesses when they were 7 months and25 nobody could meet. Okay. That isn't true anymore.17Would it ­­ would it ­­ I￼1 So explain to me.2 wrong. I just want to hear from your mouth why this is3 an important case.4 GENERAL VERRILLI: So it's important for5 multiple reasons, with respect to practicalities and6 fundamental questions of constitutional structure.7 Let me start with practicalities and with8 the happens point, the "may happen" point, that our9 appendix doesn't purport to be comprehensive or anything10 like comprehensive. Part of the reason why it can't be11 comprehensive is that there really aren't records of12 when the vacancy first arose with respect to huge13 numbers of recess appointments, and that's because, I14 submit, it wasn't considered material.15 But second, I can ­­ there are ­­ there are16 numerous practical examples in our history of when it17 made a very great deal of difference that the President18 had the authority to make an appointment to a vacancy19 that preexisted the recess.20 We have mentioned the 1948 example; the21 Secretary of Labor dies on the verge of a very extended22 intra­session recess by the ­­ by the Senate. They're23 going to be out for a month, back for 12 days, and then24 out all the way from June ­­ they go out in June,25 they're out for a month, they are back for 12 days, and18I'm not saying you're￼1 then they're out all the way until December 31st.2 The Secretary of Labor dies just in advance3 of them going out in June, and this is ­­ remember, 19484 is a period of significant labor unrest. They needed a5 Secretary of Labor in place.6 JUSTICE KAGAN: General, would you agree7 that this clause now is not mostly used to deal with8 emergencies arising from congressional absence? That9 most modern Presidents ­­ and I say this sort of10 going ­­ going back to President Reagan, Presidents of11 both parties, essentially, have used this clause as a12 way to deal ­­ not with congressional absence, but with13 congressional intransigence, with a Congress that simply14 does not want to approve appointments that the President15 thinks ought to be approved?16 You know, absence in this day and age ­­17 this is not the horse­and­buggy era anymore. There's no18 real ­­ there's no such thing, truly, as congressional19 absence anymore. And that makes me wonder whether we're20 dealing here with what's essentially a historic relic,21 something whose original purpose has disappeared and has22 assumed a new purpose that nobody ever intended it to23 have.24 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, two answers. I25 don't think its original purpose has disappeared. I19￼ 1   mean, the NLRB was going to go dark.  It was going to 2   lose its quorum.3 JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, as a result of 4   congressional refusal, not as a result of congressional5 absence.6 GENERAL VERRILLI: And that gets to the 7   second point, which is that it may be true, as a matter 8   of raw power, that the Senate has the ability to sit on 9   nominations for months and years at a time, but that is10   100 miles from what the Framers would have expected.11 If you look at what Hamilton said in12   Federalist 76 about the advice and consent role of the13   Senate, he said he thought it would be a power that was14   rarely exercised and would operate, if at all, invisibly15   or silently.  And in the early days of the Republic, it16   was ­­ advice and consent was a matter of days, not months and years.17 JUSTICE ALITO: But you are making a very,18   very aggressive argument in favor of executive power19   now, and it has nothing whatsoever to do with whether20   the Senate is in session or not.  You're just saying,21   when the Senate acts, in your view, irresponsibly and22   refuses to confirm nominations, then the President must23   be able to fill those ­­ fill those positions.24 That's what you're arguing. I don't see25   what that has to do with whether the Senate is in20￼1 session.2 GENERAL VERRILLI:3 this ­­ I think the recess power may now act as a safety4 valve given that intransigence, and that is actually5 quite consistent ­­6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it isn't ­­ it isn't7 tied then to the availability of Congress,8 availability of the Senate. I think you said throughout9 your brief that the rationale for the recess power is10 the President must be able to have the government11 functioning and staffed even though ­­ although the12 Senate isn't ­­ isn't around. But now the ­­ you seem,13 in your answers, to be departing from the Senate not14 available and making quite another justification for15 this.16 The Senate ­­ I think, to be candid, the17 Senate is always available. They can be called back on18 very short notice. So what is it that's the19 constitutional flaw here? It isn't ­­ it isn't that the20 Senate isn't available. The Senate is available. It21 can easily be convened.22 GENERAL VERRILLI: So let me take a half a23 step back, if I could, Justice Ginsburg, and answer that24 question in this way ­­ you know, perhaps it sounds like25 this is an aggressive assertion of executive authority,21Well, I do ­­ I think￼1 but I'd ask the Court to think back to Federalist 51.2 And what the Framers were most concerned3 about was that Congress, in the separation of powers4 calculus, was going to amass authority and drain5 authority and energy from the Executive, and therefore,6 the Executive needed to be fortified against those7 actions by Congress.8 And one specific way in which the Framers9 decided to fortify the Executive was by rejecting the10 notion that the appointment power should reside with the11 Senate. The Framers considered that, and they rejected12 it.13 And the reason they rejected it, as this14 Court noted in its Edmund opinion, was ­­ was to protect15 the Executive against encroachment by the legislature.16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the compromise17 they settled on in moving away from that is that the18 President will nominate and the Senate, if it so19 chooses, can confirm a nominee. You spoke of the20 intransigence of the Senate. Well, they have an21 absolute right not to confirm nominees that the22 President submits.23 And it seems to me, following up on Justice24 Kagan's point, you're latching on to the Recess25 Appointment Clause as a way to combat that22￼1 intransigence, rather than to deal with the happenstance2 that the Senate is not in session when a vacancy becomes3 open.4 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, but those things ­­5 there are often situations in which the Senate is not in6 session when a vacancy becomes open or needs to be7 filled, I guess would be the more accurate way to say8 it. The examples ­­ I'll give you another example, if I9 could, from the 1940s. Taft­Hartley gets enacted in10 1947 in the summer.11 One requirement of Taft­Hartley is that the12 general counsel of the NLRB must enforce the ban on13 secondary boycotts within a fixed period of time, 30 or14 60 days. Well, it turns out there is no general counsel15 of the NLRB at that time, so President Truman ­­16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the Senate17 has ­­ the Congress and the Executive have come together18 to address those sorts of problems in a vast number of19 cases by providing that there can be an acting general20 counsel of the NLRB to deal with that situation.21 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, actually,22 Mr. Chief Justice, with respect to multi­member boards,23 the Vacancy Act doesn't cover them. That's one reason24 we have the problem here. But beyond that, the Framers25 made a judgment that this wasn't going to be left to23￼ 1   congressional largesse.  That's why there is a Recess 2   Appointment Clause, and it's not left to the Congress.3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, let's ­­ let's talk about your 4   1948 emergencyof the Secretary of Labor.  There was 5   a vacancy in ­­ in that post.  The President has the 6   authority to convene Congress.  And whatever was the 7   case in 1948 or ­­ or in 1789, Congress can be back here8 in one day.9 Article II, Section 3 says, "He may, on10   extraordinary occasions, convene both houses."11 GENERAL VERRILLI: That's true,12   Justice Scalia.  But the ­­13 JUSTICE SCALIA: So what's the problem? If14   there is indeed this ­­ you know, this terrible15   emergency you're talking about, the President has the16   power to call them back.17 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I think it seems to18   me the Framers made a different judgment because they19   gave the President both the power to call back in20   extraordinary circumstances and the recess appointment21   power.  And if the Framers had intended the power to22   call back to be the way to deal with vacancies during23   absences of the Senate, then ­­24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but my only point is25   what ­­ what the recess appointment power consists of24￼1 cannot be determined on the basis that, well, there are2 going to be terrible emergencies, so it must enable the3 President to do this or that. Extraordinary emergencies4 are handled in the Constitution. You don't have to5 expand the ­­ the vacancy appointment power in order to6 handle those.7 GENERAL VERRILLI: So what I would say about8 this, and also to your point, Mr. Chief Justice, is we9 have, I would submit, a stable equilibrium that has10 emerged over the course of this country's history11 between the two branches. After all, what we are12 advocating for here is the status quo. It is the13 equilibrium that has emerged since Congress ­­ since the14 Senate started taking lengthy intra­session recesses,15 Presidents started making recess appointments during16 those recesses.17 That began in the Civil War days. It's18 continued to the present. The President ­­19 JUSTICE KAGAN: General, I think that's a20 really strong argument, but I have to say I'm not sure21 it applies consistently throughout each of the three22 claims that you make. Because if you are going to rely23 on history and on the development of an equilibrium with24 respect to what "happens" means, and if you are going to25 do that again with respect to whether intra­session25￼1 recesses are included, then it seems to me you also have2 to look to history and the development of an equilibrium3 with respect to Congress's definition of its own power4 to determine whether they are in recess or not.5 In other words, your third argument about6 pro forma sessions, the history is entirely on the7 Senate's side, not on your side. And if we're going to8 take a kind of continuing practice and the development9 of equilibrium seriously, you might win on questions 110 and 2 and then lose on question 3.11 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, winning on12 questions 1 and 2 would be of great importance to the13 Executive, but we also should win on question 3, and14 here's why: There isn't a long history reflecting the15 equilibrium with respect to the use of pro forma16 sessions in order to restrict the President's ability to17 use the recess appointment power.18 There really is no history before 2007 of19 this daisy chaining of one pro forma session after20 another after another in conjunction with an order that21 no business shall be conducted.22 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, there's no practice ­­23 there is no long practice of doing it. There is also no24 long practice of rejecting it.25 But if I could take you back to that, you26￼1 said that the pro forma sessions may violate the2 Adjournment Clause in the Twentieth Amendment. Would3 you also say that they violate the Presentment Clause,4 because the Senate has passed legislation during these5 pro forma sessions and the President has signed that6 legislation.7 GENERAL VERRILLI: No, we don't. I think8 the right way to think about that is the same way that9 you would think about if the Senate declares that it's10 in recess from August 1st until September 15th and then11 comes back early because an emergency has happened, for12 example, with Hurricane Katrina. Once they are back in13 doing business, they are doing business.14 Now, what the Senate did with respect to the15 legislation Your Honor identified was they came out of16 pro forma session, they passed legislation, and then17 went back in to ­­ they went back in under the order of18 pro forma session. So they take that action ­­19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it seems ­­ it seems20 to me that we're searching here for a proper21 interpretation of the word "session," which, after all,22 is in the provision that we are looking at. It talks23 about "next session." And we have a long tradition of24 Congress defining what that session is.25 They have the first ­­ this is, what, the27￼1 113th Congress? I think something like that. And they2 have the first and second session. That's how their3 records are based.4 This is a considered judgment by both houses5 of the Legislative Branch as to what "session" means,6 and it seems to me that that has very powerful bearing7 on the question of inter­ and intra­session appointments8 that we are arguing, forget the ­­ when the vacancy9 happens to arise.10 And so why don't ­­ why don't we defer to11 Congress as to what the term "session" means and say12 that this gives us guidance as to when the ­­ there is a13 recess. There is a recess between those sessions.14 GENERAL VERRILLI: I don't think that that's15 an interpretation that really could be squared with the16 body of contemporaneous evidence from the time of the17 framing. And I would start with the text of the18 Constitution itself and the Adjournment Clause, which is19 at page 91a of the appendix to our brief.20 And it ­­ one thing it says is that,21 "Neither house during the session of the Congress shall,22 without consent of the other, adjourn for more than 323 days." It seems clear from that language that "the24 session of the Congress" is referring to the period that25 commences on the constitutionally prescribed date and28￼1 continues until the Congress adjourns sine die because,2 otherwise, these recesses wouldn't be during the session3 of the Congress.4 It's also clear from this language that the5 framers at least contemplated the possibility of breaks6 longer than 3 days within sessions because they provided7 a mechanism to get permission to do it.8 JUSTICE ALITO: But where does this 3­day9 rule ­­10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you are relying on11 adjournment. That ­­ that ­­ that does not have the12 word ”recess” in ­­13 GENERAL VERRILLI: No, that's right. But14 I'm going back now to think about what "session" means15 in the Recess Appointment Clause where "the session" is16 also used. I would submit, Your Honor, that it means17 the same thing as it means here, which is the full18 session of the Congress.19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If it means the same20 thing, then what you are tying the two together, which21 actually might have some validity, but wouldn't that22 require the definition of a recess to be a period in23 which both houses have chosen to consent to an24 adjournment?25 GENERAL VERRILLI:29No, I don't think so￼1 because the dictionary definition then and now of recess2 is a suspension of business. And you could have3 recesses of that kind, suspensions of business within4 sessions. That's ­­ Jefferson's parliamentary manual5 refers to recess by adjournment ­­6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you have an7 adjournment without a suspension of business? Aren't8 the two the same?9 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I'm just talking10 now, Justice Sotomayor, if I may, about the11 intra­session recess point.12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But I'm talking about13 tying the two together.14 GENERAL VERRILLI: Right, but with respect15 to ­­ putting the pro forma issue aside for a second,16 with respect to intra­session recesses, the meaning of17 the "session," it seems to me, is the session, the full18 session, because you can have ­­ you can have recesses19 by adjournment, as Jefferson's parliamentary manual20 said.21 And as I think I said earlier, there is22 quite substantial evidence that the term "the recess" at23 the time of the framing could refer to a break during a24 session and not just breaks between sessions. So I just25 don't think there is contemporaneous evidence from the30￼1 framing generation that would lead you to conclude that2 intra­session recesses are not within the meaning of the3 word "recess."4 JUSTICE BREYER: What, where is this ­­5 the most surprising thing6 to me that you have said, and it's important, is not7 just the view of language at the time of the framing,8 but what the purpose of this clause was. I mean, this9 is a very well­briefed case, and I have looked at them.10 I have read them, actually.11 (Laughter.)12 GENERAL VERRILLI: Okay.13 JUSTICE BREYER: And I’ll tell you, I cannot find anything, so14 far, and I may have missed it ­­ I'm asking ­­ I can't15 find anything that says the purpose of this clause has16 anything at all to do with political fights between17 Congress and the President. To the contrary, Hamilton18 says that the way we're going to appoint people in this19 country is Congress and the President have to agree.20 Now, that's a political problem, not a21 constitutional problem, that agreement. And it was just22 as much true of President George Bush, who made six23 appointments that happened previously, as it is with24 President Obama, who's made four. All right?25 So ­­ so where ­­ and he says this clause is31￼1 a supplement, a supplement, to the basic clause to take2 care of the timing problem. So, what have I missed?3 Where is it in the history of this clause, in its4 origination, that it has as a purpose to allow the5 President to try to overcome political disagreement?6 GENERAL VERRILLI: I don't ­­ I don't think7 that that's ­­ I don't think that that ­­ I don't think8 that's its purpose, but it is in the Constitution. The9 President has the authority to make appointments ­­10 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if it isn't a11 purpose, can you give me an example where the language,12 particularly that word "happen" ­­ I mean, your example13 was a good one but I don't think it applies, but that's a14 different matter. I can't ­­ the language is over here.15 The number of appointments on "happen" is few. If you16 are worried about James Tobin, Congress has passed a law17 that can be taken as looking at a vacancy occurring when18 it occurs within 30 days of the beginning of the recess,19 which would have taken care of Tobin.20 So look at the language difficulty. Look at21 the comparatively small practice in that area. Look at22 the other ways to get around the problem, and then give23 me another example in the Constitution where you have24 both language and purpose pointing one place and yet25 this Court because of practice has come to the opposite321 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425conclusion.      GENERAL VERRILLI:￼                               Well, I don't think thatlanguage points unambiguously in one direction.JUSTICE BREYER: "Happen?" Of course, battles happen. That's because battles occur over time. Give me an example with the word "vacancy," where that word "vacancy" is used with the word "is," but not "occurred."GENERAL VERRILLI: A vacancy is an enduring state, and from the perspective of the ­­JUSTICE BREYER: But just give me an English example where it’s natural to say ­­GENERAL VERRILLI: I tried with my statutory example before, but from ­­JUSTICE BREYER: Your statutory example has to do with a battle, not a vacancy.GENERAL VERRILLI: No, it was an emergency. It was the statutory example about a financial emergency that may happen, which is a state, just like the vacancy.JUSTICE BREYER: A financial emergency, correct. I'm sorry. I'm asking you for an example with the word "vacancy." That's what I am having trouble with.GENERAL VERRILLI:Well, a vacancy is an33￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425enduring state. From the perspective of the ­­JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not talking about ­­ I just say, could you find an example, and I'm gathering,from my answer, you couldn't.     GENERAL VERRILLI:     JUSTICE BREYER:either.     GENERAL VERRILLI:statutory ­­ maybe the language in the Constitutionlooks unambiguous to you now, but it has been thesubject of contention, it has been thought to beambiguous from the time of George Washington to thePresident ­­ to the present.     And with respect to the question of thepractice and there being ­­ I don't think it's correctto assume that because there are a certain number ofidentified examples of preexisting vacancies beingfilled in our appendix, that that's a sum total.

It's what Jefferson thought. It's what ­­ it's ­­ it has been the understanding, since the framing, that there is ambiguity here and there ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your ­­ it's your argument ­­ your friend on the other side says one flaw with your argument is that it makes the words "it may happen" or "happen during" superfluous, that the clause would mean exactly what you say it means if you took those words out.      And your response ­­ the only one I couldsee on the reply ­­ your reply brief, page 13, is thatthose words were put in there to quote, "confine thePresident to filling vacancies that actually exist atthe time of appointment."      Now, is that ­­ do you really think that35￼￼1 they put that language in there because they were afraid2 the President would fill appointments that don't exist?3 GENERAL VERRILLI: I don't know why they put4 the language in there, Mr. Chief Justice, but it5 doesn't ­­ it isn't superfluous because it does serve6 that function, whatever their intent.7 JUSTICE BREYER: One reason they could have8 put the language in is because they were afraid,9 otherwise, the President would have the power, simply,10 when somebody died two or three years before, and11 they've had a big fight in Congress to save up all the12 controversial nominations and then put them through as13 recess appointments. That could be one thing they14 didn't want to happen. I don't know. You see, it's the15 same problem. Same problem.16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You do have ­­ you do17 have the one that you relied on in your brief, and this18 understanding goes back at least to 1823, and the ­­ the19 Wirt letter, Attorney General Wirt said, on the20 wording ­­ maybe on the wording, the case is not strong.21 But the purpose, he said, you would be honoring the22 letter and defying the spirit. That was the ­­ on the23 question of the ­­ when the vacancy ­­24 GENERAL VERRILLI: And we don't disagree25 with that. We think it's just what Wirt said. It's ­­3625 GENERAL VERRILLI:I think that's a way￼1 does no violence to the language and is consistent with2 the purpose of the ­­ of the clause. And from the ­­3 from the perspective of the purpose of the clause, the4 office is equally vacant, whether that vacancy arose the5 day before or the day after the Senate went into recess.6 The Senate is equally unavailable to act7 because they're dispersed, whether the vacancy arose the8 day before or the day after. And the public's need that9 the office be filled so that the laws can be faithfully10 executed is the same whether the vacancy arose the day11 before or the day after.12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Before you ­­ before13 you ­­14 GENERAL VERRILLI: And so you do have that15 very established practice that is completely in accord16 with the purpose and the structure.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The ­­ we sort of drifted18 away from the new ­­ the new practice, the pro forma19 session. And you were asked, suppose there was nothing20 in the resolution about they would conduct no business.21 It was an informal understanding that they wouldn't.22 But there is no express agreement that they're not going23 to conduct business. Then do you lose on that part of24 the case?37￼1 harder case for us. I would agree with that, Justice2 Ginsburg, and ­­ but they're two things. One is that3 formalities do matter; and two, going back to the point4 you made earlier, Justice Kagan, I think it's not an5 accident that there's a no­business order in place.6 It's because that's what gives the Senators7 the protection to know that they can leave town without8 somebody else going to the ­­9 JUSTICE KAGAN: Suppose it was ­­ suppose it10 was the exact same no­business order, but the single11 senator who was there got up and asked for unanimous12 consent to name a post office, and every three days, he13 got up and said unanimous consent to name a post office.14 The post office is named.15 So they can do ­­ you know, trivial business16 in each of these sessions. Would that make a17 constitutional difference?18 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I think if they did19 business each of the three days, then you wouldn't have20 a situation in which no business was conducted and you21 wouldn't meet the definition of a recess. But that's a22 different case than this one.23 JUSTICE KAGAN: But that, again, suggests24 that the rule that you're asking us to establish is ­­38￼1 is so easy to evade that why bother establishing it at2 all. The fact that it's so easy to evade suggests that3 this really is ­­ the question of how to define a recess4 really does belong to the Senate.5 GENERAL VERRILLI: No, I think the problem6 with looking at it that way, Justice Kagan, is that7 that's the end of the recess appointment power. You8 write it out of the Constitution, if you look at it that9 way, because all the Senate needs to do is stay in pro10 forma session until 11:59 a.m., on January 3rd when that11 term ends and the next term starts, and then there are12 no inter­session recesses ­­13 JUSTICE KAGAN: I totally take your point on14 that. But what I'm suggesting is they could just come15 back, and by naming post offices, have the same effect,16 that they would write it out of the ­­ of the17 Constitution as much as you say this does.18 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, this does. This19 does. And whether something else might or might not, I20 guess we could try to fight that out if the Senate were21 ever to do it. But I assume, if this Court were to hold22 that pro forma sessions of this kind are not real and23 they don't defeat the President's recess appointment24 power, that maybe the Senate would think twice25 before doing something like that.391 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what is significant is whether they're available to confirm nominees; isn't that right?GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes.JUSTICE ALITO: So suppose they say, instead of no business will be conducted, no nominations will be considered.GENERAL VERRILLI: That would be a different case because they would be ­­JUSTICE ALITO: I know it would be a different case, but ­­GENERAL VERRILLI: ­­ they would be there ­­ they would be here. You know, they're not ­­ they're in business for something.JUSTICE ALITO: So what? The point of the question is whether they're available to consider nominations. So if they say, we'll do other business, but no nominations will be considered, why isn't it exactly the same for purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause?GENERAL VERRILLI: It's not because the recess ­­ or the definition of recess is when no business shall be conducted. And that's exactly what the Senate said. If I may reserve the balance of my time.40￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.      Mr. Francisco.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF NOEL J. FRANCISCOON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSMR. FRANCISCO: Mr. Chief Justice, and mayit please the Court:      The Advice and Consent Clause imposes animportant check on executive power.  Each of our threearguments preserves that check, and provides a separateand independent basis for affirming the court below.      The government's position, in contrast,would eviscerate that check, creating a unilateralappointment power available for every vacancy atvirtually any time with advice and consent to be usedonly when convenient to the President.JUSTICE GINSBURG: But your argument would destroy the recess clause. There would be ­­ under your argument, it is totally ­­ totally within the hands of the Senate to abolish any and all recess appointments.MR. FRANCISCO: Yes, Your Honor. And that reflects the fact that the recess appointment power is a contingent one. It arises only when the Senate chooses to trigger it by ending its session and beginning its recess. So the Senate always has the power to prevent recess appointments.41￼￼1 The Constitution, however, gives the2 President corresponding powers. If the President thinks3 that the Senate is being derelict in its duties, he can4 convene an emergency session, and he can force the5 Senate to consider his nominees.6 And if they refuse, he can subject them to7 withering criticism for being derelict in their8 responsibilities. But one ­­ the one thing that the9 President may not do is force the Senate to act against10 its will, nor should the President be permitted to do ­­11 and run around the Senate's refusal to act, because that12 conception of the Recess Appointments Clause is at war13 with advice and consent itself.14 JUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you a variant of15 the question that Justice Scalia asked General Verrilli?16 Suppose we think that the language in the Constitution17 is perfectly clear in some respect, but that there is a18 200­year­old consistent practice, agreement by the19 President, going back to Washington and by the Senate20 that the language actually means something else. What21 would we do in that situation?22 MR. FRANCISCO: Your Honor, I think that the23 language has to govern. And I would like to address the24 issue about the consequences of a ruling in our favor in25 this case. Of course, if you were to rule on the third42￼1 question presented, it wouldn't call into question any2 past recess appointments at all, given the unprecedented3 nature of the appointments at issue in this case.4 But, frankly, if you ruled on the first two5 questions, I don't think it would be particularly6 disruptive in terms of calling into question the7 decisions of past appointees.8 Justice Sotomayor, to take the Article III9 courts, for example, since 1960, there have only been10 four potentially improper appointments to the Article11 III court's recess appointments. Each of them served12 approximately a year or less. Three were to the court13 of appeals, one to a Federal district court judge in14 1981.15 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Francisco, I'm sorry,16 but could we go back to Justice Alito's question?17 Because I really have the same issue with your argument.18 You know, suppose that on one ­­ let's say19 the "happens" argument, that yours is at least the most20 natural reading of the statute, at least the way we21 understand the word "happen" today, and maybe a22 compelled reading, but the history points so much in the23 other direction; and that that history brings with it a24 whole set of practices and traditions and ways of25 dealing with each other that has grown around a certain43￼1 interpretation of what "happens" means, right?2 The idea that we would wake up one fine3 morning and chuck all of that because all of a sudden we4 happened to read the clause, I mean, that at least needs5 to be defended.6 MR. FRANCISCO: Yes, Your Honor, and I7 believe that the relevant history actually supports us,8 that is the history at the time of the founding.9 JUSTICE KAGAN: I know, but now, you're ­­10 you're again ­­ I mean, assume that there is a11 200­year­old established practice, everybody has agreed12 to it, but the text, when you really look at it, points13 the other way.14 MR. FRANCISCO: Yes, Your Honor. I would15 dispute the premises, but I will accept the premises for16 the purposes of the question. The political branches of17 the government have no authority to give or take away18 the structural protections of the Constitution. They19 don't exist to protect the Senate from the President or20 the President from the Senate.21 These are liberty­protecting provisions that22 protect the people from the government as a whole. So23 if the Constitution is quite clear as to what those24 structural protections are, but the political branches,25 assuming for the sake of argument, have conspired to44￼1 deplete them, that is illegitimate, and it should be2 rejected by this Court.3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that ­­ but that4 assumes something, which is ­­5 MR. FRANCISCO: Yes, Your Honor.6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ let's go back to the7 "happenings" words ­­ that is so unambiguous, that they8 knew it was unambiguous, but 200­year history, starting9 with President Washington, who filled two vacancies that10 occurred before the Senate broke, to every ­­ almost11 every President thereafter has done the same.12 So why should we conclude that today's13 understanding is the same as the understanding of the14 Founding Fathers? Why don't we take their unbroken15 practice as giving us that definition?16 MR. FRANCISCO: Yes, Your Honor, a couple of17 different responses. First of all, we dispute the18 government's historical account of President19 Washington's and the first four Presidents' position ­­20 actions. But even putting that aside here, everyone who21 actually spoke to and addressed the issue at the time22 agreed that the text means precisely what it says,23 including President Madison, who refused to make a24 recess appointment to Andrew Jackson, the hero of the25 War of 1812, precisely because the vacancy had arisen45￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425during the Senate's session and in its recess.      Second, we also don't have an unbroken andnever­contested practice.  Indeed, the Senate hasregularly resisted.  In 1863, the Senate passed the PayAct, which prohibited pay to any appointee to apreexisting vacancy.  So you don't have a kind ofuniform ­­ uniformly­held practice.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me ask you this: Suppose that we were to conclude that the history is simply too overwhelming to rule in your favor on the "happens" problem. Could we still use history to saythat ­­ or overlook historyinter/intra­session point?      MR. FRANCISCO:      JUSTICE KENNEDY:      MR. FRANCISCO:founding ­­      JUSTICE KENNEDY:80 years or ­­      MR. FRANCISCO:that.  From the time of the1948, there was a uniform understanding that the recessand the session as used in the clause were interchangingperiods.  You were either in recess or you were insession.  And so an appointment made during the recess46to rule for you on theYes, Your Honor.  How do we do that?From the time of the  Is it because of theI think it's longer thanfounding until, I would say,￼1 lasted until the end of the next session.2 Now, in 1921, Attorney General Doherty's3 opinion kind of muddled things a bit because he assumed4 that, if you took a long break in the midst of a long5 session, it broke that break into two recesses for the6 purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause. But you7 still had that dichotomous view subject to the arguable8 and quite ambiguous exception of President Andrew9 Johnson.10 So what you see is from the time of the11 founding until 1921 there were some 63 mid­session12 breaks, all longer than 3 days, so all recesses under13 the government's definition. Yet during that entire14 period, with the arguable exception of Andrew Johnson,15 no President ever attempted to make a recess16 appointment.17 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Francisco, tell me if I18 am wrong about this, but it seems to me that19 intra­session recesses really only arose in the 1940s or20 so, right? There is the period with Andrew Johnson and21 Andrew Johnson used intra­recess ­­ intra­session22 recesses to make a lot of appointments. Other than23 that, intra­session recesses of more than 3 days that24 are not Christmas simply do not exist.25 So that assume that as intra­session47￼ 1   recesses came to be, Presidents started making 2   appointments in them.3 MR. FRANCISCO: Let me address it this way. 4   I'm not sure I agree with the factual understanding, 5   Your Honor.  There were intra­session recesses longer 6   than 3 days prior to 1867.  I think there were some 10 7   of them prior to 1867, including 7 that were longer than 8   10 days.  And bear in mind, yes, they were Christmas 9   recesses, but so were the ones at issue in this case.10   They were Christmas recess appointments.11 But I do take your point that intra­session12   recess appointments did not become very common ­­ or I13   should say it this way:  Intra­session recess14   appointments did not become very common until the ­­ really15   they started with Truman, but then they broke off for a16   long time with three Presidents, Johnson, Kennedy, and17   Ford, making no mid­session recess appointments.18 Then beginning in the Carter and the Reagan19   Administrations is when they became very common and20   particularly a very common way to do an end­run around21   advice and consent.22 JUSTICE BREYER: What happened in that23   period at around 1970 is that's about the first time24   that you have intra­session ­­ an intra­session recess25   that's longer than an inter­session recess.48(Laughter.)MR. FRANCISCO:­­ unless you are not going￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      And so now if we look from 1970 on, that'sfairly common.  And so all that's happening is that thePresidents are appointing recess appointees duringperiods where they are out for a longer time.  Now, howare we supposed to go and say that this thing ­­thousands of people on the recess part ­­ isunconstitutional?I mean, it isn't unheard of. What about the Due Process Clause? Does that easily cover the language? Substantive due process.      What about the Interstate Commerce Clauseand the doctrine of ­­ you know, the implicit clausethere?  I mean, it isn't unheard of that over timelanguage in the Constitution takes on a somewhatdifferent meaning.MR. FRANCISCO: Yes, Your Honor.JUSTICE BREYER: How do we ­­ I mean, probably different judges have different approaches. But if I'm concerned about the basic practicality and the basic objective here, why would I agree with you?MR. FRANCISCO: Yes, Your Honor. I certainly am not going to attempt to purport to resolve this Court's differences on those issues, but on ­­49Justice Breyer gives are examples where we gave it ameaning that was different from what it said.(Laughter.)JUSTICE SCALIA: We don't have a case involving this particular issue yet.￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   Your Honor.  And it reflects the fact that the Recess10   Appointments Clause and the Appointments Clause and all11   of the structural protections, again, are not meant to12   protect the branches against one another.13 JUSTICE BREYER: If I do place more14   weight on this, should we ­­ I mean, I do believe and15   agree with you to this point that this is basically a16   matter of politics for other branches basically.  That17   doesn't help me resolve this.  But it does lead over to18   this possibility.  Congress did pass the No Pay Act.19   And then they passed the Pay Act.  And in that Pay Act on this20   "happen" part, which I think is the strongest ­­ very21   strong for your side, but it defines the vacancy in22   terms of 30 days prior to the recess.23 And that would take care of most of these. You24   see, if vacancy could be defined as something that25   stretches, because Congress says it stretches in terms50to let me off the hook, Your Honor.JUSTICE SCALIA: The two examples thatMR. FRANCISCO: That's precisely correct,￼1 of pay for 30 days.2 MR. FRANCISCO: Right.3 JUSTICE BREYER: What do you think of that?4 And I would love to know what the SG thinks of it.5 MR. FRANCISCO: Yes, Your Honor. A couple6 of different responses. First, of course, the third7 question calls into question no past recess appointees,8 the third question.9 JUSTICE BREYER: The third question, by the10 way, just put in your mind, if you digress in your11 answer, put in your mind what would have happened in12 1830 if someone, when they had a 9­month recess, close13 to 10 months, someone had the bright idea, well, you14 live near Washington; go show up at wherever we are15 holding our sessions and sit there for 5 minutes, and16 we'll stop President Andrew Jackson from making recess17 appointments. What would we be saying then?18 MR. FRANCISCO: Sure. Well, I will put my19 finger on that question and answer your first question20 first as to the Pay Act in 1940. The Pay Act of 1940,21 in our view, clearly repudiates the government's22 inter­session view for the reason you put your finger23 on. It ties pay to appointments being made either right24 before or after the session ends.25 So most mid­session recess appointees can't51￼1 get paid under the Pay Act.2 With respect to the second question3 presented, at best it creates three exceptions to the4 general rule against any pay to any preexisting5 appointees, so you have got somewhat of a compromise. I6 would say that is no more Senate acquiescence in the7 President's position than the President's acquiescence8 in the Senate's position when he signed that law. So to9 me that's a jump ball.10 Coming back to your historical example, I11 think it reflects the fact that the Recess Appointments12 Clause is not about timing, it's not a temporal issue;13 it's about procedure. What it does is it creates a14 contingent power that arises when the Senate decides to15 trigger it.16 Back at the time of the founding, the17 senators wanted to trigger that power. It was important18 to trigger that power, because when they were gone, the19 President needed to be able to act unilaterally, unless20 they wanted to be subject to a recall in emergency21 sessions every time he needed to confirm nominees. They22 obviously didn't want that.23 Today, the situation has changed; not the24 principle, but the historical context. And today, the25 Senators can get back to Washington, D.C. very easily.52￼1 They are there for much less ­­2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose ­­ suppose we3 have an inter­session break. It's three days. On your4 reading of the Recess Clause, in that three days, the5 President can fill up vacancies.6 MR. FRANCISCO: Yes, Your Honor, because7 under the second question presented, there would not be8 very many vacancies in that context, because the vacancy9 would have to ­­10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, leave out the11 second question. Just on ­­ the first question,12 because it seems to me that if the rationale was when13 Congress was out of town for 6, 9 months, of course, the14 President has to be able to make the government work.15 But now you're saying that in that time,16 it's only three days, they are going to be there17 available very soon to confirm. And let's say18 somebody ­­ somebody dies on day 1. The President puts19 in ­­ makes an appointment on day 2. You would say20 that's okay?21 MR. FRANCISCO: Yes, Your Honor, but I ­­22 first of all, I'd say I don't think you can really23 separate it from the second question presented because24 that's why ­­ it explains why it wouldn't have been much25 of a problem. Very few vacancies would arise during a53￼1 3­day break, and so there wouldn't2 opportunity to make those kinds of3 Let's put that aside.4 reject my argument on the second question presented.5 Then you're really in the world of the 1905 Senate6 report when they were dealing with President Roosevelt's7 midnight recess appointments, where he made them8 in between gavel drops.9 If you reject our argument on the second10 question, then I do think that you may need to confront11 the notion that an inter­session recess is too short to12 make recess appointments. Not at issue in this case,13 because here the appointments came on January 4th, the14 day after Congress commenced the second session. So by15 anyone's definition, this was an intra­session recess16 appointment, not an inter­session recess appointment.17 And all of this really reflects the fact18 that the Recess Appointments Clause is a contingent19 power that arises only when the Senate triggers it,20 which is what gives the Senate the power to prevent the21 President from making recess appointments.22 If I could turn back to the consequences ­­23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, before you do24 so, I mean, is the Senate's power, in your view, so25 comprehensive that if they passed an order saying, we're54be that much of anappointments.Let me assume you￼1 actually never in recess, people can be reached ­­ you2 know, we can call people back. So for purposes of the3 Recess Clause, we are never in recess.4 MR. FRANCISCO: Your Honor, under the first5 question presented, I think the answer is, yes, they6 could do that, because it really is the Senate's ability7 to trigger the power.8 It's ­­ in a sense, the Recess Appointments9 Clause is of a piece with the Inferior Officer's Clause.10 The Senate always has the power of advice and consent,11 but what the President can do ­­ what the Senate can do12 is authorize the President to act unilaterally in13 certain circumstances.14 It can authorize the President to act15 unilaterally with respect to inferior officers and it16 can authorize the President to act unilaterally in17 certain time periods where it ends its session and18 begins its recess. So it's always within the Senate's19 power. And that's precisely why advice and consent20 serves as an important check.21 On the third question presented, I think ­­22 where you're deciding whether or not a session is a real23 session, then, no, I don't think the Senate could do24 that. I think that it's for the Court to look at the25 Senate's journal to see what the facts are, and those551 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425facts must be taken by this Court as undisputed.      So if those facts show that there was aSenator who actually gaveled them into session each day,and that during that period they were capable ofconducting business, as they were here at every sessionthat they held every three days, then this Court wouldhave to take those facts as a given.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you ­­ could you tell ­­ let's go back to this. What's your definition of a recess? When the Senate actually says we're taking a recess ­­MR. FRANCISCO: Yes, Your Honor.      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:consent of the House or not?­­ whether it got the￼MR. FRANCISCO: It's when the Senate ­­ again, it depends on which question you're talking about. On the first question presented, the recess of the Senate is the period between when the Senate says that it is ending its session through an adjournment sine die, and the period when it begins its next session, as the clause says.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does it have to do that? By what command does it have to do that?MR. FRANCISCO:JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:Sine die?    Yes.561 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. FRANCISCO:JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:MR. FRANCISCO:It does not ­­    No.  Sine die or any ­­￼                            It does not have to adjournsine die.  That, though, in this country, is the waythat the Senate has traditionally signaled to thePresident that it was ending its session.  And I thinkthat's what it would have to do.      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:of the House to do that?      MR. FRANCISCO:    Does it need the consentYes, Your Honor, it does.    So ­­ so does it have to      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:do that in between the two congressional sessions?MR. FRANCISCO: I don't ­­ I think ­­ no, I don't think it has to. I think the Senate can adopt its own rules for determining how it ends its session and how it begins a new one. I think the important point, though, is it has to communicate that to the President.      So, for example, during President Madison'stime, the tradition was the Senate would dispatch acommittee to the President to inform this President thatit had ended its session.  So the President now knewthat it was in recess and the powers that imbue upon thePresident during that recess had been triggered, therecess appointment power.      Here, ruling on our ­­ in our favor on the57￼1 third question would, of course, call in the question no2 past appointees. But I would like to ­­3 JUSTICE ALITO: On the first question, does4 your argument depend on the fact that ­­ on the5 assumption that the ­­ the possibility of a lengthy6 intra­session break was never even contemplated by those7 who framed and ­­ and ratified the Constitution?8 Because if they had thought about that, there's a real9 chance the Senate may take a two­month break ­­10 MR. FRANCISCO: Right.11 JUSTICE ALITO: ­­ over Christmas. Would12 there be any reason why they wouldn't have wanted the13 recess appointment power to apply there as well as at14 the end of the session?15 MR. FRANCISCO: Your Honor, our argument16 does not turn on that because to us, it is not a17 temporal question; it's a procedural one. Back then,18 the Senate had the power not to trigger the recess; just19 like today, it has the power not to trigger the recess20 appointments power.21 The difference is not in principle; it's in22 historical context. At the time of the framing, they23 wanted to trigger the recess appointments power because24 when they left during long periods of time, they wanted25 the President to be able to act unilaterally since it58￼1 was very difficult for them to get back. And if they2 didn't trigger the power, the only way the President3 could act unilaterally would ­­ the only way the4 President could confirm nominees would be by convening5 an emergency session. Highly inconvenient.6 The historical facts today have changed.7 Not the principle, but the surrounding facts. And8 today, it is very easy for the senators to get back to9 Washington, D.C., and so they don't want to trigger a10 unilateral power. They're perfectly willing to be11 hailed back if necessary.12 JUSTICE ALITO: I'm ­­ I'm not sure I13 understand the answer. If the purpose is to permit the14 President to fill vacancies when the Senate is15 unavailable to consider nominations and the country16 would be harmed by having these offices vacant for a17 period of time, why would that not apply to any lengthy18 break, whether it's at the end of the session or in the19 middle of the session?20 And so if you're arguing that it only21 applies at the end of the session, doesn't that depend22 on the assumption that23 possibility that there24 middle of the session?25 MR. FRANCISCO:they never thought about thewould be a lengthy break in the     Your Honor, it is possible59￼1 that they never thought about it. But even if they had,2 I don't think it would matter, because I think that ­­3 that the purpose that you've laid out is not quite the4 full purpose of the clause. The purpose was also to5 ensure that the President could not easily do an end­run6 around advice and consent, which after all is the7 principal method of appointment.8 And so what they did, as they did with9 respect to inferior officers, is they vested with the10 Senate the power in certain circumstances to authorize11 the President to act unilaterally. With respect to12 recesses, that authority was triggered when the Senate13 decided to end its session. The Senate did, for14 example, take 7 mid­session breaks of longer than 1015 days prior to 1867. It is inconceivable to me that the16 senators at that time believed that they were entering17 into a recess that would have empowered the President to18 make unilateral appointments during those 10­, 11­, or19 12­day periods. And that reflects the fact that the20 Recess Appointments Clause is a ­­ is a contingent one21 that arises when the Senate triggers it.22 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Francisco, can I ask a23 question about the second question presented, the24 "happens" question?25 MR. FRANCISCO:60Yes, Your Honor.￼1 JUSTICE KAGAN: And if you put aside all the2 history and you look only at the language and you look3 only at our own modern view of what happens, that surely4 seems to favor your position.5 But ­­ you know, given all the statements6 in the founding period itself about how this is7 ambiguous and it might have two meanings, if you look at8 the dictionaries of that time ­­ so I went back and I9 looked at the Oxford English Dictionary, and one of the10 definitions of "happens" there is "chance to be,"11 essentially the exact same definition that Thomas12 Jefferson said made this ambiguous.13 And we would never use "happens" in that way14 now. If you look at the examples that the Oxford15 English gives, they're laughable. Nobody would ever say16 that now. But it just suggested to me that maybe what17 we think is pretty clear is only pretty clear because18 one meaning of “happens” has ­­ you know, over19 200 years ­­20 MR. FRANCISCO:21 JUSTICE KAGAN:22 MR. FRANCISCO:23 think the word "happens" had the same meaning then as it24 does now, which is why at the time of the framing25 everyone who actually studied the issue ­­ Madison,61Sure.­­ lapsed.Well, Your Honor, I actually￼1 Hamilton, both of the first two attorneys general,2 Edmund Randolph and Charles Lee ­­ agreed that it meant3 what it said, as did even ­­4 JUSTICE KAGAN: No, I don't think so, right.5 Essentially, Thomas Jefferson says it could mean one6 thing or the other, and the other thing that he said,7 which is "happens to exist," is sort of exactly this old8 definition, which is "happens" means "chance to be."9 MR. FRANCISCO: And then Jefferson in his10 other letters conceded that the Recess Appointments11 Clause as it stood was going to frustrate his ability to12 make appointments. And he therefore described ­­13 JUSTICE SCALIA: I ­­ I think "happens"14 continues to mean "chances to be." We still use it that15 way. But we only use it that way when it is followed by16 an infinitive. "I happened to see him," it means a17 chance that I saw him. Or ­­ you know, 9/11, the18 destruction of the Twin Towers happened to occur on19 9/11. But you wouldn't say ­­ you wouldn't say it20 happened on ­­ on 9/13, simply because it continued to21 be destroyed.22 I don't know what the OED examples that23 Justice Kagan referred to were, but I bet they ­­ they24 used "happen" followed by an infinitive, and I think we25 still use it that way.621 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE KAGAN: You know, I don't remember them exactly. I just remember kind of laughing at them, as things that ­­(Laughter.)      JUSTICE BREYER:remember what they were ­­      JUSTICE KAGAN:￼                             Actually, I think I                            ­­ nobody would say ­­                             ­­ and they were 1483 andJUSTICE BREYER: And in fact ­­ in fact, I couldn't figure out what they were talking about.MR. FRANCISCO: And, yes, Your Honor, but in addition, though, there ­­ there is not just the word "happen." It's preceded by three other words, that ­­ "vacancies that may happen." And the only purpose that those words serve is to constrain the universe of vacancies that are eligible for a recess appointment.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the Constitution as it ­­ as it first was has now been amended and it is no longer a part of the Constitution, with reference to appointment of Senate, uses the word "vacancy" in much the same way as the clause we're discussing here, and I think favors your position, because if a vacancy happens63      JUSTICE BREYER:1490­something, and then there was an asterisk that said"obsolete."(Laughter.)￼1 by resignation during the recess of the legislature then2 the governor can make the appointment. And you3 certainly wouldn't think that that could happen over 34 days ­­5 MR. FRANCISCO:6 JUSTICE KENNEDY:7 say occur over 3 days.8 MR. FRANCISCO:9 than that because at the time of the framing, a10 legislator ­­ a governor tried to appoint somebody to11 the Senate pursuant to that clause that had arisen ­­12 where the vacancy had arisen during the legislative13 session rather than during the legislative recess, and14 the Senators actually refused to seat that individual.15 So, yes, that further supports our position16 on that.17 JUSTICE BREYER: Do you want to say anything18 before the ­­ about the ­­ the language on the "happen,"19 I support you.20 But the ­­ the practice, and in particular,21 the practicalities, because you say, well, the President22 can make an acting appointment, make a recess23 appointment even. I mean ­­ you know, they have much24 less authority, somebody appointed in that way, much25 less than a person who's been confirmed by the Senate.64Exactly, Your Honor ­­  ­­ occur over ­­ I shouldAnd ­­ and it's even better1 So if2 faces3 4the government won't grind to a halt, it stilla problem.MR. FRANCISCO:And Your Honor ­­ What do you want to sayJUSTICE BREYER: 5 about that?￼6 MR. FRANCISCO:7 advice and consent. That problem arises not just when8 the Senate takes breaks, but when the Senate is in9 session. The Senate could show up every day for an10 hour, sit at their desks, and announce to the President:11 We're not going to do anything, no nominations, no12 legislation, because we don't like what you're doing.13 And by the way, the only reason we're showing up here at14 our desks and sitting here for one hour a day is because15 we don't want you to be able to make recess16 appointments.17 Nobody would claim that the Senate was in18 recess during those sessions. Well, that is effectively19 what it was doing here.20 I would, though, like to address the21 practicality issue. I talked about how there have only22 been four recess appointments to the Article III courts23 that are potentially invalid since 1960. I likewise24 don't think, if you were to rule in our favor on the25 first two questions, that it would be particularly65That's a consequence of￼1 disruptive to the Executive Branch either.2 If you look at the government's appendix, I3 would hazard to say that most of those officials4 probably don't exercise much, if any, agency rule­making5 or adjudicatory power at all. But as to those who do,6 going forward the government can solve the problem7 through agency ratification of past decisions. Going8 backward, there are a variety of doctrines that would9 limit anybody's ability to actually challenge those past10 actions, including, for example, the APA's 6­year11 statute of limitations on challenging final agency12 action, various finality rules that would prohibit a13 party from raising an issue that they could have but14 failed to raise in an earlier proceeding, and various15 justiciability doctrines, like mootness, standing, and,16 Your Honor, the de facto officer doctrine, at least17 outside of the context of direct appeal.18 I think this constellation of issues19 probably explains why this is the first time this issue20 has reached this Court in 225 years. This is not to say21 that a ruling in our favor on the first two questions22 wouldn't have any past impact. It would undoubtedly23 have some. But as this Court's decisions in cases like24 Chadha and Booker and Blakely make clear, this Court has25 never shied away from enforcing the strictures of the66      I am happy to answer any additionalquestions that Your Honors may have.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Estrada.ORAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL ESTRADA,FOR SENATE REPUBLICAN LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL, AS AMICI CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS MR. ESTRADA: Thank you, Mr. Chiefcounsel.ET AL.,Justice,￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Constitution simply because it could have some impact onprior cases.      Here the structural protections of theConstitution exist to protect the liberty of the people.They were clearly transgressed with these unprecedentedappointments, and therefore we believe that the courtbelow should be affirmed.and may it please the Court:      As Justice Kagan recognized earlier in theargument, this case fundamentally is about who gets todecide whether the Senate is in recess, the Senate orthe President?  Our submission today is that the Senategets to decide whether the Senate is in recess.JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Estrada, you said in your brief that that was true within wide limits. What are the wide limits?MR. ESTRADA: This is ­­ this is all about67￼1 how the Senate chooses to arrange its affairs, Justice2 Kagan, under the Rules of Proceedings Act.3 And what the Court said in the Ballin case4 was that the exercise of rulemaking authority by5 Congress was almost absolute and beyond the challenge of6 any body or tribunal unless it usurped some independent7 constitutional authority.8 The only possible offer here that the9 Solicitor General has as to how the Constitution could10 have been violated by the actions of the Senate in11 arranging its own affairs is the notion that this has12 invaded the purported recess appointments power of the13 President.14 And the reason, as we say in our brief, why15 that is completely insubstantial is because, as the16 Solicitor General recognizes in the closing two pages of17 its brief, the Senate by the design of the Constitution,18 the Appointments Clause, the primary method of19 appointment, has an absolute veto over nominations.20 The Framers could not have been more clear21 that the standard power of appointment was a joint power22 of appointment. And therefore, the Solicitor General is23 forced to concede that this appointment power, this24 right that the President is asserting here as a stop on25 the exercise of the rulemaking authority, is a68￼1 subsidiary power that only arises if the government ­­2 if the Senate, excuse me, chooses to recess.3 JUSTICE KAGAN: Is the Chief Justice's4 example before, if the Senate just said, we're ­­ we're5 never in recess for purposes of appointments, would that6 be permissible?7 MR. ESTRADA: If the Senate says, we're8 never in recess, and the Senate then is not in recess so9 that it can exercise the duties of its office as it10 does here, yes, it would be. If the Senate says, we’re11 checking out and going to Hawaii, we'll never again be12 in Washington, Kona is very nice this time of year, that13 would not be permissible, because, A, the Adjournment14 Clause requires the consent of the House for the Senate15 to be not only gone for 3 days but to be in a different16 place.17 And ­­ and second ­­ you know, the Senate18 cannot leave ­­ you know, the chamber, and ­­ other than19 with the ­­ with the consent of the House. And maybe if20 the Senate has effectively given up ­­ you know, the21 business of legislating, in that case, maybe the22 President could say that it is, quote, a "recess."23 Now, the fundamental problem with the24 President's position here is twofold. We have Senate25 records. There is ­­ the Journal Clause of the69￼1 Constitution directs each house of the Congress to have2 a journal of its proceedings. The Journal of the3 Senate, which is in relevant part printed in our4 appendix, shows that on each of the disputed dates the5 Senate was called to order and then adjourned. It is an6 official record of the Senate. It says the Senate was7 called to order and then adjourned.8 It doesn't say two guys who happened to be9 Senators met at a bar and had a beer. The official10 records of the Senate say the Senate was called to order11 and adjourned. And under the Rules of Proceedings12 Clause, that ought to be conclusive, full stop.13 JUSTICE BREYER: That's the end of it,14 exactly the same, if this all took place during the15 9­month inter­session recess in 1835.16 MR. ESTRADA: It would be the same, unless17 the Senate chooses to recess.18 JUSTICE BREYER:19 facts. Same facts.20 MR. ESTRADA:21 JUSTICE BREYER:22 view, the clause, even if they were all scattered to the23 winds in 1835, there would have been not possible for24 President Andrew Jackson, if I have that right, to make25 the recess appointments.70No, no, no.

ESTRADA:      JUSTICE BREYER:In￼Yes, constructive recess.   Yes, yes.Well ­­   And by converse reasoning,the Congress would not have been able, in 1835, toprevent recess appointments simply by having a nearbysenator show up for a ­­ for one second, once every 3days, over a 9­month period.      It seems to me what goes around comes aroundin this ­­ in this ­­MR. ESTRADA: Well, let me ­­ let me take that as an opportunity because I think it doesraise ­­ you know, the question to speak to the implication that the Solicitor General makes in his brief, that the Senate, as a body, doesn't have a view on whether it was in recess or in session.      For the reason that I started out byoutlouding ­­ by outlining ­­ excuse me ­­ the Senate'sofficial records do show that the Senate was in session72￼1 on each date, and therefore, the Senate does have an2 official view.3 But from the practical point of view, we do4 know that the Senate has a view on these things. And5 how do we know? The President's party controls the6 Senate. If the Senate wanted to recess, Rule 22nd of7 the Senate says that's not a debatable proposition.8 If a majority of the Senate wants to recess,9 even before the evolution of the filibuster,10 non­debatable proposition. So the Senate says, which is11 controlled by the President's party, says, we want to12 recess, we want to go away, we don't care if the13 President has this power. They vote for that. House14 says no. What happens then?15 Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution,16 the fight goes to the President, and it is in that event17 that the President gets to adjourn them until such date18 as he shall see proper.19 So if the Senate had any view that it wanted20 to recess, they could have had a vote, and the issue21 would have ended up in the White House, in the lap of22 the President. He had plenary constitutional power to23 give himself an inter­session recess by terminating the24 session and have a real recess appointment power if he25 could find somebody whose vacancy had actually arisen at73￼1 the time.2 But this is the cockeyed way of going about3 the instruments of the Constitution. There is no power4 in the Constitution to use the Recess Appointments5 Clause to overcome the opposition of the Senate to the6 President's nominees. And for all that we hear about7 today, which has to do with how the heaven will fall,8 and the parade of horribles, there is no parade, and9 there is no horrible.10 The only thing that will happen is that the11 President, heaven help us, will be forced to comply with12 the advice and consent that the appointments power ­­13 excuse me ­­ the Appointments Clause actually calls for.14 That was not viewed as an evil by the Framers. That was15 what the Framers unanimously agreed was going to be the16 principal means for appointments for the principal17 officers of the union.18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Estrada ­­19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If there is a 3­day20 recess between sessions, then your argument is that is ­­21 that is a recess and the President can make ­­ can make22 appointments in that time.23 MR. ESTRADA: Justice Ginsburg, that is a24 very interesting and somewhat difficult question. On25 the facts of this case, there is a substantial question,74￼1 which no one really has litigated, as to whether there2 was, in fact, an inter­session recess, whether the first3 session of the 112th Congress ended on the morning of4 January 3rd and therefore, we have the same Teddy5 Roosevelt situation, or whether by adjourning on6 December 30th and contemplating no further meetings7 until January 3rd, whether that in effect ­­ in effect8 was a sine die adjournment that ended the first session9 of the Congress.10 If the President had the same view about the11 nature of the pro forma sessions, he could have taken12 the view about the sessions between December 17th and13 January 3rd and could have had a better legal argument14 in attempting to claim that between December 30th and15 January 3rd, there was at least an arguable16 inter­session recess. And he did not do that.17 Why didn't he? Because by waiting until the18 convening of the first session ­­ of the second session19 of the 112th Congress, by making an appointment on20 January 4th instead of the morning of January 3rd, he21 gives an extra year to his appointees to serve. That22 shows that this is, indeed, the bottom of the slippery23 slope on the Recess Appointments Clause.24 It is a complete abuse of the process. It25 is being used for no other purpose than to overcome the75￼1 Senate opposition or the Senate disinclination to agree2 with the President's nominations.3 What the Framers contemplated in coming up4 with a joint power of appointment was you have to act5 jointly. You have to play nice. And in a country of6 300 million people, when the President wants a nominee7 and the Senate does not agree, it is always possible for8 the President to come up with another nominee who is9 even more qualified and acceptable to the Senate.10 The key here is acceptable to the Senate.11 He has to be able to proffer someone to the Senate that12 the Senate is willing to engage in a joint power of13 appointment.14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Estrada, in your15 earlier example, you said that if the Senate decides to16 recess and the House doesn't approve, that the President17 can then do it.18 Is it your belief that a recess is only19 something that both Houses have agreed to? A break in20 business that both Houses have agreed to?21 MR. ESTRADA: I don't think so. It is22 usually the case, Justice Sotomayor, but not23 necessarily. The example I would give ­­24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what do you need ­­25 why does the President have to adjourn the House in your761 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425example?      MR.

What ­­ what ­­ in what rule makes a recess defined as something without date?MR. ESTRADA: This takes us back to the first argument, and I think the contemplation was that the recess would be the period of time that intervenedthe 20th Amendment.  You know, the date was a muchdifferent date in the original Constitution.77￼1 But to answer your earlier question, it is2 usually the case that a recess is going to be longer3 than 3 days, but it needn't be. If the Senate finished4 all of its legislative business, for example, in this5 year on December 30, 2011, and then voted to adjourn6 sine die, and did not again meet until the beginning of7 the second session of the Congress on January 3rd, that8 would be an inter­session recess even though it would9 not be one that would require consent of the House.10 But in the usual case in which a recess is11 taken for an extended period of time, it would be the12 type of break that the Framers contemplated would need13 the consent of the House.14 And the reason for that should be obvious.15 We have a system of a bicameral legislature. The houses16 too are supposed to work together to accomplish the17 business of the people. If the House is working on18 something and the Senate wants to go away, or19 vice­versa, they need the consent of each other because20 they may need each other to frame out ongoing21 legislative projects.22 And if the House in its own judgment thinks23 that the Senate is sufficiently available to the House24 in our bicameral system so that it ­­ so that it has been25 full compliance with the Adjournments Clause, it is78GENERAL VERRILLI:Thank you,￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425very difficult to see how in the agreement of bothhouses of Congress that the Senate is in facteffectively available, that is there with its full powerof unanimous consent every third day.  If the Housethinks that that is adequate for the discharge of itsconstitutional functions and the constitutionalfunctions of the Senate, it's very difficult to see howthe President gets to second­guess that.      One final point that has to do with theSolicitor General's insistence on the no­businesslanguage.  Rule 5.1 of the Senate ­­ may I finish?CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.MR. ESTRADA: ­­ makes very clear ­­ it's also in our appendix ­­ that any business mayconducted – may be conducted at any time, without notice, by unanimous consent.      And so that effectively, what we have hereis merely an announcement by the Senate that betweenDecember 17th and January 23rd, only unanimous consentbusiness would be agreed to.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.      General Verrilli, 6 minutes.   REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,      ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER79￼1 Mr. Chief Justice.2 Let me begin with a couple of points on3 intra­session recesses. With respect to the question4 that Justice Alito raised, it would have been perfectly5 familiar to the Framers that a legislative body could6 take an intra­session recess. Jefferson's parliamentary7 manual written while he was Vice President and presiding8 over the Senate specifically refers to recesses by9 adjournment that occur within a session and the session10 resumes when they are over.11 The adjournment clause itself contemplates12 the need for approval by the other branch for a period13 longer than three days during the session.14 I think it's difficult to imagine that if,15 as Justice Alito's hypothetical suggested, that the16 Senate had in the first years under President Washington17 decided to take a two­month, intra­session break, that18 President Washington wouldn't have been able to staff19 the offices of the fledgling republic using the recess20 appointment power.21 JUSTICE ALITO:22 on the first question, then23 be a number or a functional24 where the number would come25 the functional test would play out, so maybe you could80Well, if we agree with youthere needs to eithertest.  And I don't knowfrom and I don't know how￼1 say just a word about that.2 GENERAL VERRILLI: We think the number3 should ­­ should be the number in the Adjournments4 Clause, 3 days or less. Now, Presidents have exercised5 restraint and there haven't been recess appointments in6 periods below 10 days, but we think that would be the7 line. Now ­­8 JUSTICE ALITO: The presence9 of that in the Adjournments Clause but the absence of10 any number in the Recess Appointments Clause, how do you11 explain that?12 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I think that there13 isn't really a need for explanation. A recess is a14 suspension of business, and what the Adjournment Clause15 says is if you are gone for 3 days or less you are not16 really suspending your business, but if you are gone for17 more than 3 days you are. And I think that is quite18 consistent with the argument that my friends on the19 other side are making.20 Now, with respect to the history on21 intra­session recess appointments, really if you look at22 the congressional directory, which is a document that we23 cite in our brief, and you just look at the column that says24 intra­session recesses, you will see page after page of25 blank space until you get to the Civil War era when811 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9intra­session recesses become more frequent.     And intra­session recess appointments reallyjust precisely parallel the increasing use by the Senateof intra­session recesses.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you argue that the Senate sort of acquiesced in that and everybody's come together, but what would you expect a Senator to do?GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, if they ­­￼CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You know, the President appoints somebody during a recess contrary to the Respondent's view, what's the Senator who objects to that supposed to do?1011121314   about that, Mr. Chief Justice.  The Pay Act, of course,15   was first enacted in this period, in the 1860s, when the16   first intra­session recess appointments occurred. The Pay Act,17   even in its original form never said ­­ and since,GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, a couple of things18   never said anything about trying to restrict19   intra­session appointments.20 If the Congress felt that these were21   improper, they could have done what they did in the22   Tenure of Office Act and passed a statute of making it a23   crime for somebody to take one of these appointments.24   But they didn't do anything like that.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:Well, you would821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425object to that, wouldn't you?      GENERAL VERRILLI:      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:that you're objecting here.      GENERAL VERRILLI:terms of ­­      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:not something that is effective for the Senate to do if ­­￼Of course.     On the same groundsWell, we would.  But in      GENERAL VERRILLI:      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:unconstitutional.      GENERAL VERRILLI:of their disagreement as opposed to acquiescence itwould certainly be a question of disagreement, and itdidn't happen.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that’ll show them. The Senate says we don't agree with your recess appointment, and yousay, well, that’s too bad, the appointee is still inoffice.GENERAL VERRILLI: But they didn't, I guess, would be, or the point being ­­      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:Senator Byrd ­­      GENERAL VERRILLI:      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:     Well, some of the Senators did ­­­­ senators ­­     ­­ famously objectedWell, then that'sBut in terms of ­­     ­­ you think it'sBut in terms of an expression831 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425to the President's assertion of that power.GENERAL VERRILLI: Yeah, but he famouslyobjected to it, Mr. Chief Justice, by saying that theintra­session recess ought to be 30 days or longer, notthat intra­session recesses are inappropriate as amatter of constitutional power.      So I actually think that is just hagglingabout the length of the recess, not about the existenceof the power.      Now, if I can move to the question of ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I just want to make sure I understand. Your idea is the Senator who objects should do what?GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, the Senator who objects can say whatever the Senator wants, but we don't have a historical record of objection. We have a historical record of acquiescence.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But suppose the Senator says, look, I object to that, I think it's unconstitutional, but I'm not going to ­­ what can I do? The only think you do is impeach the President,right, for violating the Constitution. And he says it's not worth it for the ­­ one of the officers on the NLRB ­­GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, if the Congress as a body thought that these were inappropriate they could84￼      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:minutes.     Take a few moreI was thinking the same(Laughter.)      GENERAL VERRILLI:thing, Your Honor.￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425take legislative action to try to limit the President'sauthority, and they just, they never have.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but you say that action would be totally ineffective?GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, we agree onthe ­­ we certainly agree on the criminalizing point, but in terms of the Pay Act, for example, they just never in all their ­­ in their original consideration of the Pay Act and subsequent, they never tried toaddress this.      Now if I could turn to the ­­JUSTICE KAGAN: But people object all the time to things that in fact they can't do anything about, right?GENERAL VERRILLI: And, yes, Your Honor, and of course ­­ and that's an individual objecting and it's not the Senate objecting.JUSTICE BREYER: The question of reports. There were reports, remember? Sorry, I didn't mean to ­­ your six minutes couldn't be up already.85￼1 There were a couple of committee reports but2 I believe those were on the "happen" issue, and let me3 turn to that, if I could. Now Your Honor had pointed4 out the number of – on happens, the number of appointments. As5 I said, don't6 in our brief,7 and of course8 appointments.9 Now, the purposes of the clause as wetake that chart as comprehensive.  As we saidit's not; we think there are many more,39 Presidents have made those10 discussed earlier, I think, are far better served by our11 reading than the other side's. Jefferson gave a12 reasonable textual reading, and then Your Honor asked13 about the Pay Act. The Pay Act of course says if the14 nomination ­­ if the vacancy arose within 30 days, but15 it says something else, too, which is if a nomination is16 pending ­­17 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, but I'm focusing on18 30 days and the reason I'm doing that is this seems to19 me, hypothetically at least, a real matter for the20 political branches to resolve among themselves.21 Now, we have to decide this, so I thought,22 well, why not look and see what Congress objects to the23 least? And I got that 30­day thing from the Pay Act by24 analogy.25 GENERAL VERRILLI:86I guess what I ­­￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      JUSTICE BREYER:on that.is that there is another provision in the Pay Act, thevery same statute, that says so long as a nomination ispending, even if the vacancy arose more than 30 days,that's the same expression of Congress's views aboutwhat's appropriate.  What they care about is the chanceto exercise their advice against the ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that was that Senate. I mean, that's not the Senate that is sitting now. You are attributing the views of one Senate to the Senate over ­­ over time.GENERAL VERRILLI: That is an expression of the law of the United States that the Congress enacted.JUSTICE BREYER: I'm really interested in how you think the 30­day idea, if practical, plays out in terms of your concerns.GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I think it, as I said, I think there is an equilibrium here and the30 days doesn't fully capture it.      And let me just talk about that if I could.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Briefly.87                       So I want to get your view                         Yes, of course.And what I would point out by analogy alsoGENERAL VERRILLI:1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, briefly.      The vast majority of appointees aresubmitted for advice and consent.  That was truehistorically; it's true now.  The vast majority ofrecess appointees are subsequently confirmed.  So it'sjust not the case that this is an end­run around theadvice and consent role of the Senate.      And there are powerful reasons, of course,why Presidents do that.  They don't want to havetemporary appointments that they have got to then dealwith vacancies again, and they don't want tounnecessarily create inter­branch friction.      The real problem, I would submit here, isthat if you go with Respondents on the pro forma issueor under the ­­ on the two underlying issuesthat the D.C.Circuit ruled on, you really are writing the recessappointment power out of the Constitution, and that'santithetical to the liberty­enhancing properties ofseparation of powers that Madison described in Federalist51, because ambitions should counteract ambitions. Theyshouldn't disarm one side.Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:The case is submitted.88Thank you, General.￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      (Whereupon,
