MarketingDisplays, Inc.          Mr. Roberts.           ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court:          The president and founder of Marketing Displays,Incorporated, MDI, invented a new type of sign stand, onewith a dual-spring design that allowed the stand to resistthe wind.  MDI patented that invention and, for the termof its patents, MDI labeled its sign stands as patent-protected to warn of copiers, touted in its tradeliterature the benefit of its, quote, patented dual-spring design, end quote, and when another company,Windproof, tried to market a copy of MDI's patented stand,MDI sued it for patent infringement and won.          But then MDI's patents expired, as under theConstitution all patents eventually must.  Sometimethereafter, Traffix Devices, the petitioner, copied MDI'sstand, added some improvements of its own, and marketed acompeting version.  No longer armed with its patents, MDI31    tried a new tack to exclude competition.  It claimed that2    the configuration of its stand, the same dual-spring3    design that it had touted as patent-protected during the4    term of the patents, was protected as trade dress and5    could not be copied.6              QUESTION:  Mr. Roberts, how do we determine what7    the patent covers?  Does it -- I mean, I can look at it,8    but I'm still not sure.  I think in the record, in the9    material here, we have a copy.  Does it include in this10    case the legs and the whole structure, or just the dual11    spring, and how do we normally determine what the patent12 covers? 13141516171819202122232425          MR. ROBERTS:  Well, in this case, of course,it's easy to determine that the patent covers thisparticular sign stand because MDI labeled that sign standas patent-protected.          QUESTION:  The whole thing?          MR. ROBERTS:  The whole sign stand, yes.          QUESTION:  Legs, spring, and all?          MR. ROBERTS:  And all, but in its tradeliterature, for example, it focused on the dual-springdesign.  That is what makes the invention work. That'swhat allows it to resist the wind, and it said, this isour patented dual-spring design and, of course, it notonly labeled the stands but in its trade literature, and4 1    in the Windproof case it sued when somebody made an exact 2    replica, the same replica that Traffix Devices -- 3              QUESTION:  So under your view of the case, if 4    the legs that the patentee had had a very special color, 5    like the John Deere green or something, that could be 6    copied after the patent ran?  Because I notice -- 7              MR. ROBERTS:  Well -- 8              QUESTION:  -- in the pictures the legs were 9    orange in your client's stand and aluminum in the other.10              MR. ROBERTS:  Well, incidental ornamentation11    that is not part of what the patent protects does not give12    rise to the right to copy.  There should be an exact13    symmetry.  Whatever the patent had protected as part of14    the patent bargain, the public has the right to copy.15              Now, the color of the legs probably would not16    have been claimed in the patent, and wouldn't have been17    part of the invention, and therefore it would not give18    rise to a right to copy that color.19              QUESTION:  In any event, they're different in20    this -- if I'm looking at the right diagrams the -- your21    client has a different -- has the orange color.22              MR. ROBERTS:  Well, it depends on which stand is23    involved.  The steel stand is one color and the aluminum24    stand is another, but in terms of what they claimed in the25    patent as -- the part that makes the invention work, it's5 1    not the legs that made this invention.  It's not the sign. 2    It is the dual-spring design.  That's what they said was 3    patented.  When they marketed this, when they had the 4    exclusive right to do so, they focused on that in their 5    trade literature, said this is our patented dual-spring 6    design, and that is the same claim they now raise in their 7    trade dress assertion. 8              QUESTION:  But Mr. Roberts, didn't the court of 9    appeals say, at least as I understood it to say, okay, the10    dual springs Traffix could have, but you have to devise11    some kind of other stand, curved legs, or a double stand.12    I thought that's --13              MR. ROBERTS:  It said we -- it said we basically14    had to design around their stand.  Now, if they said, you15    could use three springs or four springs, I guess it would16    never end, five springs, or you could put a little skirt17    around the springs so people wouldn't see them, or, as18    Your Honor points out, if you're going to use the springs19    you have to change something else so it doesn't look like20 it.21              But that's not what this Court's cases have22    held.  What the Court has said, Singer and Kellogg and23    Sears, is that the public has the right to copy the24    patented invention in precisely the form in which it was25    practiced, and that's critically important.  The idea of6 1    designing around what had previously been patented is a 2    significant hindrance to competition, and this case is a 3    good example. 4              When we copied the sign we added an important 5    improvement of our own, the step-and-drop leg.  Under 6    MDI's stand you have to bend over and pull the pins out. 7    Under ours, you just step and the legs come out. 8              Now, if the rule were the rule that the 9    respondents are arguing for, we would have had to add that10    new improvement to some different sign stand, but the11    right to copy attaches to the product as it was practiced12    during the term of the patent.  We don't have to design13    around their superior stand -- that's why it succeeded in14    getting the patent -- to add improvements of our own.15              QUESTION:  Does it depend in part on how we16    define functionality under the trade dress inquiry?17              MR. ROBERTS:  We think there is a freestanding18    right to copy from an expired patent, that it doesn't19    depend upon what functionality is.20              QUESTION:  And you think that there can never be21    a trade dress protection in some aspect of an expired22    patented item?23              MR. ROBERTS:  If the item was simply incidental24    ornamentation -- one of their amici used the example, if25    you're patenting a chair and the drawing shows a purple71 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9bow.  Well, we don't think there's a right to copy thepurple bow, because the purple bow is not covered.  That'snot the invention.          QUESTION:  So there could be a trade dress in anexpired patented item.          MR. ROBERTS:  In the item itself, yes, but notin the subject of the patent.          QUESTION:  And I suppose that depends on how wedefine functionality, in a sense.          MR. ROBERTS:  Functionality I think leads to thesame place that we come to from looking at patent law, ifyou define functionality as it has traditionally beendefined, as turning on usefulness.          If functional -- if functional means useful,then our case comes out the same way, because you have tobe useful to get a patent, and if it's been the subject ofa patent, the feature has been useful, therefore it'sfunctional, therefore it's not eligible for trade dress10111213141516171819    protection.202122232425          QUESTION:  Justice O'Connor's question suggeststhis to me.  You're arguing for the rule that you maintainhere so that you will not have to litigate functionality.          MR. ROBERTS:  Exactly, and functionality --          QUESTION:  But why isn't functionalitysufficient protection, particularly in this case?8 1              MR. ROBERTS:  Functionality is sufficient if 2    functionality means useful, but if functionality means, as 3    the lower court said in this case, something for which 4    there is a competitive need, or for which there are not 5    available alternatives, and there's a multi-factor 6    balancing test to determine so-called legal 7    functionality -- 8              QUESTION:  Well, I guess the court, the Sixth 9    Circuit pulled that out of Qualitex' opinion.10              MR. ROBERTS:  Well, we --11              QUESTION:  The competitive need.12              MR. ROBERTS:  I don't think Qualitex opined on13    the exact definition of functionality in this case, or it14    was misread by the lower court.  The definition in15    Qualitex had a very important connector there.  It said, a16    useful product feature, or, and then it went on to talk17    about competitive need, so --18              QUESTION:  So as far as you're concerned, if19    it's useful, then it's functional?20              MR. ROBERTS:  Period, without regard to21    competitive need, available alternatives -- MDI's position22    is, look, you can make a sign that stands up to the wind23    that's just as good as our sign stand, so don't make it24    the way we made it, but the patent, the expired patent25    gives us the right to copy --9 1              QUESTION:  Well, it gives you -- this -- I think 2    my question is related to Justice O'Connor's, and this is 3    a problem that I have in understanding, and maybe you can 4    help me.  You have a right to copy the invention.  Does it 5    follow that you have a right to copy the configuration 6    that that invention took in the hands of the patent7 holder? 8              MR. ROBERTS:  I think Justice Brandeis' opinion 9    in Kellogg answers that.  Kellogg did not have to show10    that there was no way to make or sell shredded wheat other11    than in the pillow-shaped biscuit form that Nabisco had12    made famous when it had its patent.  It was enough that13    that was the form in which Nabisco had practiced its14    patent.  Kellogg therefore could copy it, even though they15    could have made shredded wheat some other way, and that's16    important precisely because of the purpose of the patent17    bargain to promote competition.18              As I said, why -- if we have an improvement to19    this sign stand, the step-and-drop legs, why should we20    have to add it only to a very different sign stand?  It's21    the commercially proven version that the public has the22    right to copy.  That is important to enhance competition.23    To require people, if they're going to make improvements,24    to design around the form that the public had become25    accustomed to, would inhibit competition, and --                                  10 1              QUESTION:  If we were dealing, Mr. Roberts, with 2    just the patent law, that would be one thing and, as I 3    understand it, although it's confusing, the word useful is 4    a patent term of art and functionality is a trade dress 5    term of art, but you're trying now to equate these two 6    terms in answer to questions that you've had as one and 7    the same, but they have different purposes, as I 8    understand it, in the patent law, the idea of useful, 9    trade dress, the idea of functionality.10              You recite the old cases like Kellogg.  It's11    been argued that on the trade dress side the law has12    evolved since those old cases, and it's now, trade dress13    gets more protection.14              MR. ROBERTS:  Yes.  You're dealing with what is15    in the trade dress area essentially judge-made law, and it16    has expanded in various ways, and functionality -- it17    doesn't interfere with the patent bargain if functionality18    means a broad range of other things, but so long as it is19    also satisfied completely by a demonstration that it is a20    useful product feature.21              There may be other limitations on a trade dress22    claim going to competitive need, available alternatives,23    any of the various multi-factor tests, but if24    functionality is going to serve the purpose of demarking25    the regime of trademark and trade dress and patent law, it11 1    must be satisfied by a showing that it is a useful product 2    feature and in our case that's significant, because you 3    can't get a utility patent as MDI had, without showing 4    that it's a useful product feature, so the fact that they 5    had a utility patent, that it covered the dual-spring 6    design, should be enough to establish functionality and 7    therefore should be enough to reject their trade dress8 claim. 9              QUESTION:  Do you agree that at least one basis10    on which we could decide this case would simply be on the11    basis of how expensive a concept of configuration trade12    dress we want, because if we take your position,13    configuration trade dress is going to be, at least in14    formally patented matters, a pretty narrow concept, and if15    we're going to have coherence within the concept of16    configuration trade dress, we're going to have to make it17    equally narrow.18              I mean, we can't have different functionality19    tests, I presume, and if on the other hand we find good20    reason to think configuration trade dress is desirable,21    then we're going to go the other way with a different22    concept of functionality, I suppose.23              MR. ROBERTS:  I think it is the expansion of the24    concept of configuration trade dress that has given rise25    to this issue and the problem.  If you go back to where12 1    trademark was limited to marks on the product, of course, 2    the product could be patented, the trademark is fine.  If 3    you even then go the next step, and you're talking about 4    trade dress and packaging, again, so long as it's distinct 5    from the product, there's no interference with patent. 6              But when you start saying that the configuration 7    of the product itself is entitled to protection as trade 8    dress, you bump right into the patent law, because the key 9    to the patent bargain is, if you're going to control a10    useful product feature, as the Court said in Qualitex,11    that's the regime of patent law, and it's no answer to12    say, well, we're protected by patent law and when the13    patent expires we're protected under trade dress law,14    because that takes away the public's half of the patent15    bargain.  We're giving exclusive right to an inventor for16    a term of years on the condition that he or she disclose17    what the invention is, and that the public obtains a right18    to copy it when the patent expires.19              So yes, I mean, it is the expansion of product20    configuration trade dress that has given rise to this21    problem, and I would at least suggest that the Court22    should not get on board with that expansion without23    waiting for Congress to say something about it,24    particularly given the fact that it so directly impinges25    upon the central patent bargain underlying the patent131 system. 2              QUESTION:  Of course, Mr. Roberts, you rely 3    heavily on the patent in this case, and that's the 4    question presented.  You've presented only that narrow 5    question.  But I take it you would argue even if there had 6    been no patent issued in this case, no patent application, 7    that this was nevertheless functional? 8              MR. ROBERTS:  Certainly, yes, and -- 9              QUESTION:  The fact of the patent really is just10    evidentiary support for the ultimate conclusion that this11    is a functional feature.12              MR. ROBERTS:  Well, it gives rise to an13    important distinction.  In other words, having been14    covered by the patent, another producer knows that when it15    comes off patent he can copy it, and that's how it worked16    in this case.  Traffix Devices knew -- they were in the17    business -- this was a patented sign stand, they couldn't18    make it, it comes off patent, they can make it.19              Now, if they at that point had to -- instead, if20    respondent's position were adopted, they had to go to21    their lawyer and say, is this legally functional, their22    lawyer would tell them, well, it depends.  There are six23    factors in this circuit, there are eight factors in the24    other circuit.  We've got to get expert economic25    testimony.  It depends on consumer surveys.  By that time                                  14 1    the producer says, forget it, it's not worth the candle, 2    I'll go make something else, and competition suffers. 3              QUESTION:  The difficulty, I guess is, would you 4    make the test absolute, because if you make it absolute, 5    you know, you're going to get into huge litigation about 6    whether this thing in the patent was or it was not an 7    essential element, and then somebody will say, oh yeah, I 8    guess I did include it as one of the specifications in the 9    patent, but it really wasn't that important.10              I mean, should you make it absolute never, or11    should you allow somebody to defend on the ground that,12    look, it wasn't that crucial to the patent, and13    everybody's come to identify it, and please let me make an14    exception here, and then they give some fabulous reasons.15    Should it be absolute, or leave them a little bit of a16 loophole?17              MR. ROBERTS:  Well, you know, a little bit of a18    loophole suddenly expands, particularly when you have a19 multi --20              QUESTION:  But it goes both ways, because if you21    allow no loophole you're going to get the same kind of22    arguments about whether it was or was not an essential23    part of a patent.24              MR. ROBERTS:  Well, of course, in this case it's25    easy.  The key to the invention --15 1              QUESTION:  In this case it may be easy, but the 2    question is, what about the rule? 3              MR. ROBERTS:  -- and producers all the time 4    compete all the time in the confines of patents.  They 5    have to look at a patent and decide, can I make a 6    competing product or not, so it's not a new inquiry, and 7    in the typical case such as this, where you have a product 8    coming off patent, you will have the conduct of the 9    patentee, which will illuminate exactly what he thought10    was covered.  Here, we not only have the labeling and the11    trade literature, we have the Windproof litigation.12    Someone made the exact same sign here and he said, a-ha,13    that infringes my patent.  Well, if it did infringe his14    patent, and the Ninth Circuit concluded it did, then the15    public has a right to copy.16              I'd like to reserve --17              QUESTION:  Wasn't the exact same sign -- I18    thought one of the points that was made was that in the19    patent infringement case, that sign didn't look as much20    like the Market Display signs --21              MR. ROBERTS:  Yes.  The patent displays what22    they call a business sign, with two springs far apart.23    The Traffix sign, the one at issue in Windproof and at24    issue here, the springs are closely together.25              MDI argued successfully that made no difference,161 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that the two closely spaced springs were covered by thepatent to the same extent as the farther apart springs.          Thank you, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Roberts.  Mr. Wallace,we'll hear from you.           ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE     ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,                 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER          MR. WALLACE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court:          Our brief is built on the premise that thefunctionality doctrine, the traditional functionalitydoctrine of trademark law is what makes trademarkprotection of trade dress and other symbolic elementsconsistent with this Court's patent law jurisprudence, assynthesized and reaffirmed as recently as the Bonito Boatscase, but I think part of the reason the two lawsharmonize is because the use of functionality doctrine isto limit the scope of protection of the device.          Its traditional function was to bar the holderof a patent or other utilitarian device, even ifnonpatented, from withdrawing that device from the publicdomain when there's no longer the protection of the patentas trade -- withdrawing it from the public domain as tradedress because people have a right to practice and use as17 1    the building blocks for further innovation whatever 2    devices are in the public domain that are utilitarian in 3    nature, including their overall configuration, but there 4    is still protection against confusing similarity through 5    requirements of labeling, packaging, avoiding palming off 6    and other misrepresentations. 7              Functionality really goes to the scope of 8    protection, and limits the scope of protection available 9    under trademark law by preventing someone from10    monopolizing and withdrawing from the public domain11    utilitarian features or the entire utilitarian device in12    the absence of valid patent protection.  That is the13    domain of patent law, and one must qualify for a patent14    and have a valid patent in order to have a legal monopoly15    that withdraws, that prevents others from using the16    device, but there -- as I say, these other protections are17    still available as well as the ability to exclude18    ornamental or incidental features.  That is what to us19    harmonizes the two statutory schemes.20              The traditional understanding of functionality21    was not an artificial concept.  It was the ordinary22    meaning of the word.  What enables the device to function23    is what is functional.  That was reflected in a very terse24    quotation we have in a footnote on page 17 of our brief by25    Representative Lanham himself, when someone raised18 1    concerns about whether the trademark law might result in 2    compromising of the public's right to use useful 3    inventions, and he said -- 4              QUESTION:  Mr. Wallace, may I ask if you would 5    answer the question that Justice Stevens posed to Mr. 6    Roberts in the same way?  That is, the definition you're 7    now giving us as functional sounds like you would come out 8    the same way on this alleged trade dress infringement, 9    even if there had never been any patent in the picture,10    because this sign, all the ingredients are functional.11    There's no purple bow on it.12              MR. WALLACE:  That is absolutely correct.  We13    would come out the same way as we were -- I think this14    Court's decision in Bonito Boats is an example of that,15    because there was no patent shown in the record, as the16    court noted, of the boat hull that they said could not be17 copied.18192021    issue?2223 24 25          MR. WALLACE:  With regard to the scope ofprotection, that others cannot be excluded from usingsomething utilitarian.          As we compressed our brief down to our allotted                            19          QUESTION:  So your position is the utilitarianfeature of the patent is a conclusive presumption in atrade dress suit where functionality would otherwise be at 1    30 pages we carefully preserved a quotation on page 11 2    that you can see at the top of the page from the 1917, or 3    1911, excuse me, Seventh Circuit decision because it 4    states the common sense of it.  If you have utilitarian 5    features that didn't even meet the standard for getting a 6    patent, they should not be given a perpetual monopoly in 7    contrast to what was then the 17-year monopoly that you 8    could get if you met the criteria for patentability. 9              The other protections available against10    confusing similarity make the need for a right to exclude11    imitation of trade dress relatively unimportant compared12    to the policies this Court has reiterated at least since13    1896 in the Singer case about the need for utilitarian14    features to be used as building blocks and to be in the15    public domain except for the limited period of time in16    which they are protected by a valid and unexpired patent,17    and we understand this Court's decision in Qualitex to18    mean much the same thing.19              The difficulty has arisen because an alternative20    test of functionality has also become appropriate as the21    scope of trademark protection has extended to matters that22    don't have utilitarian features to them.  We point23    particularly to the protection of color as an example,24    where there is relevance to looking at competitive need25    in -- we give an example in our brief of an orange-colored201 can of soda. 2              There were other amicus submissions in the 3    Qualitex case in which people were making claims that 4    raised issues that went quite beyond what was involved in 5    the press pad that was at issue in Qualitex.  One of them, 6    for example, involved orange-colored sprinkler system 7    piping.  Well, it raised other questions.  I don't say the 8    result would necessarily be different, but one would have 9    to examine whether a competitor who wanted to compete for10    replacing a portion of the piping would be disadvantaged11    if he couldn't match the color of it.12              It was a different case from the Federal13    Circuit's Corning, Owens-Corning case involving the pink-14    colored insulation, because that goes behind the wall and15    people don't see it.  The orange coloring in some contexts16    connotes danger, and perhaps there is marketing17    significance to that.18              But the mistake that I think some of the courts19    of appeals have made, including the Sixth Circuit in this20    case, is to say that that is now the exclusive approach,21    and you wind up with multi-factored tests that don't22    really give an adequate guidance to what the law is.23              A very good example is found on page 17 of the24    light green amicus brief filed by the International25    Trademark Association in this case, in which they speak211 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425approvingly of various multi-factored tests that thecourts of appeals have adopted in this area, which leavesopen what this Court in its salutary opinion in Wal-Martv. Samara Brothers referred to as the plausible threat oflitigation which can discourage competitors and become animpediment to the benefits that consumers would get fromcompetition, and to have tests of this kind applied todisplace the traditional approach to functionality wouldbe very detrimental to competitors for the very reasonsthe Court has recognized in the cases synthesized in theBonito Boats opinion.          QUESTION:  Mr. Wallace, I'm not sure what yourproposal is, that we use the simple test for what, foruseful features --          MR. WALLACE:  That --          QUESTION:  -- whether or not they are patented,and the more complex test for -- for what?          MR. WALLACE:  Both -- either test can show thatsomething is functional, whichever one suits the needs ofthe particular factual situation.          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Wallace.          Mr. Artz, we'll hear from you.               ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN A. ARTZ                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MR. ARTZ:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please                            221 the Court: 2              This Court granted certiorari due to a conflict 3    between regional courts of appeals on one issue, and that 4    is whether or not the visual image and appearance of a 5    product -- with a product whose operation and performance 6    was covered by a utility patent, can still be protected as 7    trade dress under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act.  The 8    imposition of any per se rule, whether the Government's 9    rule or Traffix rule, which says it cannot be protected in10    my opinion is unnecessary, unjustified, and unworkable.11              It's unnecessary because there are already12    adequate rules in place, the trade dress rules and13    functionality that have been referred to already.  It's14    unjustified because it would cause harm to the public's15    right not to be confused or deceived.  Those are paramount16    in trade dress and trademark cases under the Lanham Act.17    That's a touchstone of the Lanham Act.  It would also --18              QUESTION:  It's a touchstone of patent law that19    an expired patent can be copied, so we really do have to20    make the two doctrines mesh well.21              MR. ARTZ:  Yes.22              QUESTION:  And the concern we have is with this23    expanded competitive need test that some of the lower24    courts have begun employing, and I am quite interested to25    know how you think the two doctrines can fit neatly23 1    together, because in an ideal world a trade dress could 2    not cover something that was covered by a patent that's 3    now expired. 4              MR. ARTZ:  Well, Justice O'Connor, the mediating 5    factor between the two is the functionality test, in my 6    opinion.  There's -- you've got the patent laws, you've 7    got the trademark laws and the Lanham Act, two federal8 laws -- 9              QUESTION:  And it's possible that some of the10    courts have lowered the bar too much on the functionality11    inquiry.  I mean, I think that's what we need to look at.12              MR. ARTZ:  Well, in the Qualitex case, the13    Qualitex gave a specific definition of functionality, and14    remember now, in 1998-1999, Congress made some amendments15    to the trademark act, or Lanham Act, and in this they16    specifically mentioned functionality several times.17              They added it to the fact that you can't have18    functional trademarks -- you can't have trademark that's19    functional but if it's nonfunctional you can, and they20    knew about the Vornado case at that time because it was21    decided in 1995, and that's the Tenth Circuit, and there's22    a lot of flurry of activity in the intellectual property23    bar because of that, so all that was before Congress when24    it amended it, and Congress did not go to any per se test25    at that time, and so you've got two Federal laws here, and241    under the Morton case and the Ruckelshaus case which are2    cited.3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Is there evidence, Mr. Artz, thatCongress affirmatively approved the Tenth Circuit case?          MR. ARTZ:  No, they did not.  I mean, becausethey -- what they -- they actually -- the legislativehistory mentions the fact that their patent expiration,and people might be trying to get trademark protectionafter the expiration of the patent, and then they go on toadd functionality.          QUESTION:  Well, I -- you -- I thought part ofyour argument was that the Tenth Circuit had decided thiscase in 1995 and it was quote, before, close quote,Congress at the time it made the amendments.  What is thepurport of that?          MR. ARTZ:  Well, what I'm saying is, in 1995that Vornado case was there, and in 1998 Congress amendedthe trademark act.  Now, there's no legislative historythat I can see that actually mentioned the Vornado case.I'm saying that it probably --          QUESTION:  But you're not -- you're arguing, Ihope, something more than post hoc ergo propter hoc.          MR. ARTZ:  Yes.  Yes, I am, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Would you go back to JusticeO'Connor, which I thought was the key question, and I251 didn't -- 2              MR. ARTZ:  Yes. 3              QUESTION:  -- hear the answer.  I mean, I know 4    Qualitex.  I'm surprised not at your reading, because 5    that's your job, but I'm pretty surprised at the Tenth 6    Circuit, the court, which -- I learned you read the whole 7    case, what the context is not just a sentence taken out of 8    context, so I obviously thought that Qualitex was about a 9    doctrine called aesthetic functionality.10              I thought, on page 165 where the court quotes11    the tradition, what's in quotes, the definition, a product12    feature is functional if it is essential to the use or13    purpose of this article, all in quotes, or if it affects14    the cost or quality of the article, okay, end of the15    matter.  Now it adds, because that's what happens to be16    relevant to aesthetic functionality, that is, if exclusive17    use of the feature would put competitors at a significant18    nonreputational disadvantage.  That last clause is19    relevant to what happens to be the subject of this case,20    called aesthetic functionality.21              MR. ARTZ:  Yes, Your Honor.22              QUESTION:  Two pages later, in case that wasn't23    clear, the case quotes Restatement Third about aesthetic24    functionality and says, in respect to aesthetic25    functionality, i.e., color, quote, the ultimate test is261 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425whether the recognition of trademark rights wouldsignificantly hinder competition, all right.          MR. ARTZ:  Yes.          QUESTION:  But nothing in the case --          MR. ARTZ:  No.          QUESTION:  -- purports to change any earliertest in respect to anything else --          MR. ARTZ:  Well, that's --          QUESTION:  -- or even change anything there, soas I read the case that seemed to be its reading, whichwould say in this case, which isn't about aestheticfunctionality, we apply what is the traditional test.          MR. ARTZ:  Well, every case which has actuallylooked at functionality actually has come up with theresult that the Sixth Circuit did, the Seventh Circuitdid --          QUESTION:  Maybe, but I thought the place youlook for a test is in the Supreme Court opinions, and inthe Supreme Court opinions, Qualitex quotes thetraditional test.  It didn't make it up.          MR. ARTZ:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  It said, in general terms a productfeature is functional if it is essential to the use orpurpose of this article, or it affects the cost or qualityof the article.  That's all in quotes.  The rest is271 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9explanation as applied here.          So if we take that as the test, why isn't thatthe test?          MR. ARTZ:  Well, the Supreme Court goes on inthe Qualitex case and says, that is -- that is, ifexclusive use of the feature would put competitors at asignificant nonreputational related disadvantage.          QUESTION:  Well, that was my question.  Myquestion was as to that add-on, doesn't that have to dowith an explanation of the test as relevant to the issuebefore the Court in Qualitex --          MR. ARTZ:  I think that --          QUESTION:  -- namely, aesthetic functionality,which is an aspect of quality I think people could argue101112131415    about.16          MR. ARTZ:  I think that is the test, Your Honor,whether or not --171819    functionality?20              MR. ARTZ:  Yes.21              QUESTION:  Fine.  Is this a case of aesthetic22    functionality?23              MR. ARTZ:  I believe it is, yes.24              QUESTION:  Aesthetic?  It involves color?25              MR. ARTZ:  It involves how things look, the28QUESTION:  The test in the case of aesthetic1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425appearance, visual --          QUESTION:  Everything in design involves howthings look.          MR. ARTZ:  Okay.          QUESTION:  I mean, that's --          MR. ARTZ:  Well, it's aesthetic in that sense,but it's not -- it doesn't involve color, no, it does not.It's not like the color that was allowed in the Qualitexcase, but I think that is the test.          QUESTION:  It involves size and shape, and thisdiscussion about Qualitex and aesthetic functionalitydoesn't get into what effect the patents, if any, has onfunctionality, and in your view does the patent -- yourhaving had a patent, building up goodwill, free, over 20years, nobody can compete with that, so if you've gotsecondary meaning it's because you have been able to keepeverybody off.          We've been dealing with cases in your discussionwhere there was no patent in the picture.  How should thefact that there was a patent bear on the inquiry that wasmade in cases where there was no patent?          MR. ARTZ:  Justice Ginsburg, I think that thecase, Midwest case by the Federal Circuit, the Thomas &Betts case of the Seventh Circuit, our case, SixthCircuit, and the Sunbeam case, Fifth Circuit, all apply29 1    the proper test.  There are different forms of 2    intellectual property laws, or IP laws, as I call them, 3    you've got five different basically Federal laws on 4    intellectual property, patents, copyrights, trademarks, 5    trade dress, unfair competition.  They're all separate and6 distinct. 7              The fact that you have a patent on something, 8    that is different than whether or not you can have a trade 9    dress on something.  Patent would be relevant in the sense10    that under this commercial necessity test, if there's only11    one way to make that product, that was look and12    experience, then it's functional, and so in that sense the13    functionality test would apply and the patent, if it says14    something about the functionality, that would be relevant15    to the functionality test in the trade dress area, but16    they're separate and distinct, and they always have.17              Design patents, for example --18              QUESTION:  They may be separate and distinct,19    but they bear upon one another, and there seems to be20    something horribly unfair about allowing someone who has21    acquired a secondary meaning in the trade dress only22    because of the patent -- let's say the shape of a Coca-23    Cola bottle.24              I mean, you know, if that wasn't patented,25    somebody else could have come out with the same shape30 1    bottle as soon as it -- you know, as soon as the first 2    ones came off the line they could say, gee, that's a nice- 3    looking bottle, and they could have copied it, but you 4    couldn't copy it because it was patented, and therefore, 5    by reason of the patent, for 17 years Coca-Cola acquires a 6    secondary meaning.  Anyone who sees that bottle would say, 7    it's Coca-Cola. 8              Then, when the patent expires, Coca-Cola in 9    effect extends the patent by parlaying what was the design10    patent into what is now trade dress protection, because11    they say, well, gee, everybody knows that that's a Coca-12    Cola bottle, but the only reason they know is because13    you've been given a monopoly for 17 years, and it doesn't14    seem right to enable you to extend that monopoly15    indefinitely.  The only reason you acquired the secondary16    meaning was because of the patent.  That's unlike other17    companies that get secondary meanings without a patent.18    Doesn't there seem any incompatibility with the patent law19 to you?20              MR. ARTZ:  No, I don't think it's unfair at all,21    Your Honor.  I think they're separate and distinct.22              I agree that perhaps, if you have this 17-year23    monopoly on this patent, that might help you on the trade24    dress area with respect to secondary meaning, but then, of25    course, just as we found here, the functionality test, the31 1    fact that you had a patent on it actually hurts you.  It 2    might be a wash between those two. 3              The trade dress has three separate and distinct 4    tests.  You have to show it's distinctive -- in other 5    words, it has secondary meaning -- and the public 6    recognizes it as something which comes from a certain 7    source.  It's a source identifier.  You have to show it's 8    nonfunctional.  However, trademark law has been amended, 9    which specifically says you have that burden of proof if10    it's unregistered.  You have to show it's nonfunctional.11    Under the Qualitex case in my opinion you have to show12    whether it's competitive necessity, then you've got to13    show whether there's a likelihood of confusion.14              You may have a product that looks exactly the15    same as yours, but if you can't show there's a likelihood16    of confusion, you don't win.  You need all three of those17    tests in the trade dress area.18              QUESTION:  There's a problem --19              QUESTION:  Well, it's the second that we're20    arguing about, I think.  I think it's the second, when you21    have to show that it's functional, and I find it hard to22    think that it's not functional when you have a patent on23    it.  You only give patents to things that are functional.24              MR. ARTZ:  I think functionality, Your Honor,25    legal functionality is really a misnomer, like I believe32 1    in the Wal-Mart case the secondary meaning was looked at 2    as being a misnomer.  It was really acquired meaning, 3    acquired meaning afterwards.  Legal functionality really 4    is a misnomer. 5              Every product has a function.  The Coke bottle 6    has a function, obviously.  It's useful, has a purpose. 7    It's got a flat bottom so it doesn't tip over.  It's got a 8    narrow waist so you can grab it, a narrow spout so you can 9    drink it easier, it's clear so you can see it. Those are10    all functional, useful, purposeful.11              QUESTION:  Aesthetic functionality isn't12    conceivably in this case.  They're the ones that argue13    functionality, not you.  They're the ones that say that14    the product is functional.  They're not saying that the15    functionality of your product arises from the way it16    looks.  They're not saying, like color, it warns people17    that the boat's black.18              They're saying that the functionality of the19    product is that the springs prevent it from twisting in20    the wind.  Now, that isn't a claim of aesthetic21    functionality, and I don't see how you could even closely22    claim that it is.23              MR. ARTZ:  Well, I think the functionality test24    that's been developed in Qualitex applies to any type of25    trade dress --33 1              QUESTION:  Ah, wait.  I thought what you said 2    is, you agreed with me before that Qualitex is talking 3    about aesthetic functionality, that we apply the normal 4    test without that little add-on, but we apply Restatement 5    Three, the aesthetic functionality test, which is the add- 6    on, where they make the claim that the reason this product 7    is functional is because of the way it looks, i.e., the 8    pipes are painted orange as a warning, which is not their 9    claim in this case.10              Am I -- now, where am I wrong in that?11              MR. ARTZ:  I think the test that's set forth in12    Qualitex that Your Honor says is for just aesthetic13    functionality applies in every functionality test.  I14    think that's the difference.15              QUESTION:  So then the pages written at 169 and16    170, and trying to explain just what we're driving at are17    sort of beside the point.18              MR. ARTZ:  Yes.  It says in general terms a19    product feature is functional and cannot serve if, and20    then you say it's essential to use or purpose.  I mean,21    that's broad and ambiguous.  Everything has a use or22    purpose, and then you say, if it affects the cost or23    quality.  Virtually everything affects the cost or24    quality, so it seems to me the only objective test you25    have here, because it relates to competitors and34 1    consumers, is whether or not it puts competitors at a 2    significant disadvantage in the marketplace. 3              QUESTION:  Can we apply that test, because I'm 4    having a little trouble connecting to the real world and 5    the device before us and these multi-factor tests and even 6    what you've just been saying. 7              Tell me what it is in your formerly patented 8    device that Traffix can copy now that the patent has 9    expired.  Can it make a sign with those two coil springs10    adjacent to each other?11              MR. ARTZ:  Yes, it can, Your Honor.12              QUESTION:  If you could describe to me what it13    can copy and what it must change I would have a more14    secure handle on what your case is.15              MR. ARTZ:  Our trade dress, Your Honor, it's16    really a combination of five features.  It's got your X-17    shaped legs, a narrow base, a pair of upright vertical18    coil springs, an upright attached to that, as well as this19    diamond-shaped sign above it, and I have a model of it20    that actually shows what it is here.  This is in the21    record before the court of appeals.22              Now, they could change any one of those.  They23    could keep the coil springs if they change some other24    configuration to make it look different, to give it a25    visual -- different visual appearance.  Like, right now,351 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425even the vice president and their technical expert saythat when they see a sign like this one driving along theroad, they know it comes from Marketing Displays.  Theyknow it's a Windmaster.          QUESTION:  But there aren't that many things toadjust.  I mean, one of the things about Qualitex and thegreen/gold you could have tan/silver, any number ofcombinations that would serve that purpose, but for thatroad sign that's not going to blow in the wind you have tohave those springs, and you have to have some kind ofbase, and there aren't that many variations.          QUESTION:  And the law requires the shape of thesign.  I mean, in many States that shape of a signindicates a certain type of warning, so what's left?There's nothing left but the legs, and --          MR. ARTZ:  You have --          QUESTION:  And your friend over there says thatthey changed the legs.  They did change the legs.          MR. ARTZ:  Now --          QUESTION:  Somebody who sees their legs say,gee, it has the -- what do you call them -- step-downlegs, or whatever it is, so the one thing it seemed to methat they could have changed, they did change.          MR. ARTZ:  No, they kept the same visualappearance and image, Your Honor.36 1              This was what the patent covered with a product 2    such as this.  They could have gone to something like 3    this, with a wide base, a pair of springs way apart, they 4    could have gone to straight legs like this, they could 5    have gone to an upright like this, rather than this, and 6    attached the sign to it. 7              This is what the patent covered.  This is what 8    was shown in the patent.  This is only found to infringe, 9    under the doctrine of equivalents, which took several10    years and several thousands of dollars for MDI to prove11    it, and that's the problem with a per se test.12              QUESTION:  Because that one in your right hand13    probably works better.14              MR. ARTZ:  I think so.15              (Laughter.)16              QUESTION:  Yes, and that's why they wanted to17    copy it, and not something that worked less well.18              MR. ARTZ:  Well, the thing here is a competitive19    necessity test.  I think it's important, because there are20    really, like, eight competitors in this marketplace, MDI,21    Traffix, and six others.  Six others all came up with sign22    stands which looked different.  They have different spring23    mechanisms in particular.  There's flat springs,24    horizontal spring, there's a torsion spring, and so25    Traffix said, I had to copy MDI's, yet all the other371 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9competitors made their own design.  They came up with signstands which look different.  They have different visualappearance.  So there are seven types of sign stands outthere, MDI's, six others, and then Traffix'.          QUESTION:  You know, I have to confess thatI'm -- I find it a little difficult to imagine that mostmotorists are looking at what -- the legs of the signinstead of the message on the sign.(Laughter.)          QUESTION:  I find it hard to believe that peoplereally identify with two legs or three.  I don't have theslightest idea how many legs there were on most of thesigns I've looked at when I was driving along.          QUESTION:  I've been looking in the last week.It's very interesting.(Laughter.)          QUESTION:  I gather you don't care about themotorists.  You just care about the highway purchasing10111213141516171819    departments.202122232425          MR. ARTZ:  That's it, yes.          QUESTION:  Right?          MR. ARTZ:  It does -- confusion as to thepurchaser, who the relevant purchasers --          QUESTION:  You couldn't care less about themotorists.  You just want to sell the signs.                            38 1              (Laughter.) 2              QUESTION:  Could I ask you a question about the 3    patent part?  I'd like to ask you about the patent part, 4    and will you assume for purpose of this that Qualitex is 5    about color, which is a matter that doesn't easily fit 6    within the terms, you know, purpose, use, cost or quality, 7    and suppose here we're dealing with something that does 8    easily fit within those terms, all right, so keep Qualitex9 out of it.10              Now, assuming that that's so, what would be11    wrong -- and they come in and they say, look, these12    springs are part of the function.  They're part of the13    function.  They're essential to the use, these springs, in14 this way.15              Now, should there be an absolute presumption16    that if you one day said -- I'm not saying what you did17    say, but we'll assume this.  If you one day said in the18    patent application, I have a great idea here, and my idea19    is to have two springs just like this, and then later on,20    when it's expired, they say, that was the heart of it.  It21    was useful.  Should the fact that you said that one day in22    the patent be the end of the matter, nobody ever looks23    further?24              There is a -- what the Government said here is25    where as an expired utility patent discloses that the391    feature alleges trade dress contributes to the operation2    of the formerly patented device, the feature must be3    considered function.  Now, that's the Government's4    suggestion.5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. ARTZ:  Okay.          QUESTION:  All right.  Now, you can of courseargue that wasn't essential, et cetera, but my problem's ageneral one, leaving this case out of it.  Should that bethe test?          MR. ARTZ:  No, it should not be the test.          QUESTION:  Because?          MR. ARTZ:  Because I think what you say in thepatent could be relevant, and the patent obviously isgoing to be put into every trade dress case, and that isone of the reasons I think that trade dress tests, thattheir absolute test is unworkable, because in everytrademark case now what you're going to have is, adefendant's going to run out and scour the 5 millionexpired patents, find one which has a claim which may readon this trade dress, accused trade dress and say, a-ha,it's dedicated to the public on this other, somebodyelse's patent.          See, one of the things that --          QUESTION:  It would seem to me that would be,even under your rule, a -- well, maybe not under your, but401 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425under the Government's rule, quite an appropriate thing todo, to show that there is functionality that the patentoffice has recognized.          MR. ARTZ:  Well, again I don't want you toconfuse legal functionality with something that's usefulin purpose, because legal functionality is different.It's a legal test.  It means, as in the Qualitex case, Ibelieve, or it means what is competitive necessity to useit, and just now, recently, in the 1998-1999, Congressmade amendments to the Lanham Act and it did not go for anabsolute test.  It did not go for a test for use orpurpose.  What it did, it just said, if it's -- you know,burden of proof of functionality is going to be on theparty saying it's nonfunctional.          QUESTION:  Mr. Artz --          MR. ARTZ:  Yes.          QUESTION:  -- I hadn't realized it, you are notcomplaining about their use of the double spring feature.That's not the complaint.  You said they could have --MR. ARTZ: No.          QUESTION:  -- used the double springs if theyhad put them separate --          MR. ARTZ:  Yes.          QUESTION:  -- separately and apart.          MR. ARTZ:  -- possibly, in a bit different41 1    visual image and appearance, Your Honor. 2              QUESTION:  And the double springs next to each 3    other was not part of your original patent application -- 4              MR. ARTZ:  No, it was not. 5              QUESTION:  -- that they were originally apart. 6              MR. ARTZ:  That's right. 7              QUESTION:  So the issue, really, is simply the 8    functionality of putting the springs close together. 9              Now, what if putting the springs close10    together -- it would have nothing to do with the patent,11    but what if putting the springs close together makes the12    sign more stable?13              MR. ARTZ:  Actually, technically it would make14    it less stable.  It would make it easier, more easy to15 twist.16171819202122    dress.2324 25          There's a -- the -- our trade dress has a numberof features, as I mentioned before.  It's not just thecoil springs.  They could use coil springs close together42          QUESTION:  Okay, but if it made it more stable,then you would acknowledge that they could copy even thatfeature, the unpatented feature?          MR. ARTZ:  No.  They have an improvement inperformance that they say is more stable, but it doesn'tmean that they can still copy it if it's part of our trade1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9as long as they change the base, or change the legs, orchange something which gave it a different visualappearance to the public.          One of the touchstones here of the trademarkLanham Act is to prevent confusion of the public, thepublic buying this.  You don't want to confuse or deceivethe public, which this does --          QUESTION:  Well, the public isn't buying it.It's highway departments that are buying it.  The publicisn't buying this sign, is it?          MR. ARTZ:  That's the relevant public for thispurpose, Your Honor, yes.1011121314    purchasers.15161718    you?19202122232425QUESTION:  Yeah, it's the highway department          MR. ARTZ:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  And doesn't the State typicallyregulate the shape of the sign, as Justice Scalia asked          MR. ARTZ:  Yes.          QUESTION:  I mean, diamond shape indicates acertain kind of warning, does it not?          MR. ARTZ:  Correct.          QUESTION:  So they can use that shape and color,presumably.  That's necessary.          MR. ARTZ:  Yes, I agree, Your Honor.                            431              QUESTION:  So what are we arguing about, the2    legs?3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112131415161718192021    to.22              QUESTION:  But obviously you're holding up one23    that's a rectangle, so it makes sense to have the posts on24    either side, as opposed to the diamond shape, where it25    makes sense to have it in the middle.  I mean, you're not                                  44          MR. ARTZ:  The -- yes, legs, the shape, thebase, and the springs, and then the upright.  It's asingle upright, too.  This doesn't have the single uprightbecause it's a small model.          QUESTION:  Well, what is the base, after you getthrough with the legs, and the upright, and the springs?          MR. ARTZ:  Uh-huh.          QUESTION:  I mean, could you -- you indicate,what are we arguing about, the legs and the base.          MR. ARTZ:  There's no -- I don't think there'sany doubt that these have a different visual appearance.One has a wide base, one has a narrow base, one hasstraight legs, one has X-shaped legs.          QUESTION:  So when you say base, that really isanother way of saying the legs?          MR. ARTZ:  No, it's what the legs are attachedto.  It would be this -- this part in between the legs,and here are the bases.  It's what the legs are connected1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425showing us an equivalent-shaped sign.          MR. ARTZ:  Well, this, under the doctrine ofequivalents, this was held to be an infringement.  Butright, individual appearance, I think they are different,and so from a trade dress standpoint these are twodifferent products.          QUESTION:  Well, you're willing to fight outthe -- I gather you're willing to fight out thefunctionality battle as to whether putting the two springsright next to each other instead of apart is a functionalmatter.  You're willing -- are you willing to combat onthat ground?          MR. ARTZ:  Well, I -- whether it's useful, has apurpose, I mean, if that's functionality --          QUESTION:  Whether it's functional within themeaning of the trade dress restriction.          MR. ARTZ:  Well then the answer, I agree -- Ithink is no, because is there a competitive necessity tohave them together?  The answer is no.          QUESTION:  Okay, but you would agree that thatinquiry would be addressed to the spacing of the springs.          MR. ARTZ:  Only --          QUESTION:  Even if we think that the use ofdouble springs is automatically no basis for giving youtrade dress protection, since you had patented the double45 1    springs, you hadn't patented whether they were close 2    together or far apart and so whether putting them close 3    together, as your opponent did, is a violation of trade 4    dress protection would depend upon whether putting them 5    close together is functional within the meaning of trade 6    dress law, right? 7              MR. ARTZ:  It's whether or not their whole 8    visual appearance, of a combination of five features, is 9    functional in the competitive necessity test.  That's10 why --11              QUESTION:  I thought you a minute ago12    acknowledged that if the two springs were closer together13    it would be less wind-resistant than otherwise, which14    seems to me demonstrates it has some functional15    significance whether they're close or not.  If one is a16    -- better resistant to the wind than the other, doesn't --17    isn't that functional, isn't that enough to prove18    functionality?19202122232425          MR. ARTZ:  Not the legal functionality test --          QUESTION:  Not under all these tests, but whyshouldn't it be enough?          The Government argues that the competitive needis a sufficient proof but not a necessary proof of it as adefense to the trade dress argument.          MR. ARTZ:  Well, the problem you have, Your                            46 1    Honor, is that tests -- either the Government's test or 2    Traffix' test is going to be unworkable, because you could 3    have company A that makes this product, or comes up with 4    this idea, company B.  Company A gets a patent on it, goes5 17 years. 6              Company B doesn't get a patent, and gets trade 7    dress protection on it, and yet company A for some reason 8    doesn't sue them, but when this patent expires, that means 9    all the trade dress that company B has developed over all10    those years is shot.  It's out the window, because it11    happens to be the subject of a patent.12              See, that's a problem with this per se test that13    they're saying.14              QUESTION:  I don't -- I thought as a factual15    matter that there are five features in your patent,16    including the legs, all the other things of appearance,17    but the district court found that there are a lot of other18    competitors that have every one of those features, so it's19    not unique but for the spaced-apart coil springs, so that20    all were -- is that true?21              MR. ARTZ:  That's true.22              QUESTION:  All right, so all we're talking23    about -- and then I thought also as a factual matter that24    somebody before the patent expired used those two spaced-25    apart springs in that narrow configuration that your471 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425finger's on right now.          MR. ARTZ:  Uh-huh.          QUESTION:  And you sued them, and it was foundin your claim, in your view, those spaced-apart that much,not wide apart, violated your patent, and you won.          MR. ARTZ:  Well, the patent covered some otherthings other than that.  They had to have initialcompression along the coils of the spring.  They also hadto meet a certain geometric relationship with the centerof gravity --          QUESTION:  But they didn't get out of it -- theydidn't get out of your patent, because the springs wereclose together rather than being far apart.          MR. ARTZ:  Well, that's the doctrine ofequivalents, and --          QUESTION:  Yeah.          MR. ARTZ:  -- one language of the claim whichcalls for spaced-apart springs, and then we --          QUESTION:  That's right.          MR. ARTZ:  It was equivalent from a patentstandpoint whether two springs together were theequivalent of two springs spaced apart.          QUESTION:  That's right, so I --          MR. ARTZ:  That was that issue.          QUESTION:  Yeah.48 1              MR. ARTZ:  That's only one of several issues in 2    that patent case, and the fact that the others happened to 3    use this coil spring, they used the other parts, that 4    shows you that you can change one or two parts of this 5    particular trade dress and comes up -- have something that 6    looks completely different.  In that case, the competitors 7    made a flat spring, they had a horizontal spring, they put 8    two springs at 45-degree angles, you could change the 9    legs, you could change the upright -- all of those might10    give a different visual impression.  That's what the Sixth11    Circuit said.12              See, the district court in this case13    concentrated on just the two springs, and the Sixth14    Circuit said that was not proper because it's the overall15    appearance, visual, visual and image of the product which16    really controls.  You can't look at one --17              QUESTION:  But it seems to me if the different18    spacing is the functional -- is a functional equivalent19    for patent law, then it seems to me that the spacing of20    the spring is part of your patent protection.21              MR. ARTZ:  All right.22              QUESTION:  As well as the nature of the springs,23    and so the square stand is no different for purposes of24    the issue in this case than the diamond-shaped stand.25              MR. ARTZ:  As long as you don't confuse the49 1    patent law with the trade dress law, Your Honor, two 2    separate and distinct, but from a patent law standpoint 3    you're right, but not from the trade dress standpoint. 4              There's another -- right now we're looking at 5    the public domain, and the difference is where it comes 6    from.  If it comes from a patent, it's given special 7    recognition.  You can't use it for the trade dress, but if 8    it doesn't, then you can use it.  Now, that to me is not a 9    real consistent -- not a real consistent argument.10              You also have the fact that as -- where do you11    look at the trade dress and this functionality, look at12    one patent, look at two patents, what if there are several13    patents that show it.14              You know, what if you don't even own the15    patents?  What if we were just a licensee and asserted it?16    What if you didn't own it?  Would that make a difference,17    or if a third party owns the patent.  There are several18    things, questions we raise at the back of our brief that19    Traffix and the Government really can't answer.  They20    really do admit that if someone is the subject matter of21    one patent by one person, and it expires, somebody else's22    trade dress will expire.23              I mean, right now we also have a situation where24    they're trying to get special protection for utility25    patents, which is different than, for example, for design50 1    patents.  Or, talk about something being nonfunctional, 2    design patenting in which having this right, as you 3    mentioned before, of an exclusive period of 14 years 4    develop secondary meaning. 5              There's no question whatsoever that courts do 6    allow parties to get trade dress protection in such a 7    matter of design patents, and there you've got this 8    secondary meaning over 14 years in which you've used it 9    exclusively, and that goes to the look and appearance of10    the product, but there's no problem with having trade11    dress protection afterwards because it isn't functional,12    so why should utility patents be treated any differently?13              And as I said initially, there are different14    areas of intellectual property law, you have different15    standards, different tests, different remedies.  You know,16    in trade dress law you have -- in trademark law you have17    much different remedies to protect the public and18    consumers.  Here --19              QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Artz.20              MR. ARTZ:  Thank you, Your Honor.21              QUESTION:  Mr. Roberts, you have 2 minutes22    remaining.23 24 25REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.       ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER MR. ROBERTS:  Thank you, Your Honor.                   51 1              There was until this morning no dispute that 2    moving the springs closer together was functional.  If you 3    look at petition appendix page 54a, there is the 4    explanation from MDI's chief engineer that doing so makes 5    the sign more compact and weighs less, very important if 6    you're ferrying these things up and down the highway, and 7    also makes it less expensive to manufacture. 8              As far as the two different sign stands, the 9    diamond one with the closely spaced springs, joint10    appendix page 236, MDI said that those signs, even though11    the other one was depicted in their patent, that the12    closely spaced springs were, quote, slavish copies from13    the standpoint of function of the sign stand described and14    claimed in the Sartesian patents.15              Third, that is the form in which they practiced16    their patent, the closely spaced springs.  Kellogg,17    Singer, Sears, that line of cases gives Traffix Devices18    and any member of the public the right to copy the patent19    in the form in which it was practiced.  That is critically20    important to maintain competition.  Whether you begin with21    patent law and the right to copy from an expired patent,22    or trade dress law and the definition of functionality23    that focuses on usefulness, is it a useful product figure,24    you come to the same point.  Traffix Devices had the right25    to copy the MDI sign stand when it came off patent, and it521    did so.  It did so in the way Bonito Boats explains2    enhances competition, imitation and refinement through3    imitation by adding an improvement of its own that made a4    more competitive product better for highway safety5    departments.6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          Thank you, Your Honor.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.Roberts.
