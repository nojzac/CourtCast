MEOLI:  Well, it covers --QUESTION: It greatly expands the number of students covered by the policy.MS. MEOLI: It -- it covers a wider variety of interscholastic competitive activities.QUESTION: And the evidence is not as strong, is it, in this case of drug use in the school as -- as was the case in Vernonia?MS. MEOLI: Well, Your Honor, we do not believe that is true.QUESTION: Well, if you go by the district court's findings, that's what you'd conclude.MS. MEOLI: The district court in Vernonia? QUESTION: In this case.MS. MEOLI: In this case. No, Your Honor, I --I really don't think so. I think there is ample evidence in the record to demonstrate a drug problem in Tecumseh.41111 14th Street, N.W.

MEOLI: Yes, we do have evidence of drug use with these students in extracurricular activities.QUESTION: Well, what do you make of the -- the reports that have been filed up to the eve of the adoption of this regulation by the school district with the Feds, year after year after year, saying, things are fine here? The only thing we have to worry about is some beer. Were they lying?MS. MEOLI: No, Your Honor, I don't think they were lying. Number one, the district has always admitted that alcohol really is the number one problem in the school district, and that's what the applications for the Federal --QUESTION: Yes, but they were -- they were saying at the same time that they didn't have a problem with -- with what we usually refer to as drugs.MS. MEOLI: They said it -- it wasn't a major problem at that time. And -- and I think if you compare --QUESTION: And -- and in point of fact, as I understand it, since the testing has been carried out51111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          QUESTION:  What do you --QUESTION: By the -- by the young people who were involved in these particular extracurricular1234    activities?￼1 among the -- the class of people subject to this2 challenge, there have been only three instances of any 3    drug use found.4 MS. MEOLI: From the -- from the drug testing?5 QUESTION: It would seem -- it seems to me that6 your evidentiary problem is up to the eve of adopting the7 regulation, the school district was saying, we don't have8 a problem. And once the regulation was, in fact, in --9 was -- was placed into effect, you've gone for several10 years and you found three instances. I -- I don't see how11 you -- you don't lose whether we look at it ex ante or ex12 post.13 MS. MEOLI: Let me answer the second part first.14 First of all, the -- the policy was only in effect for a15 limited amount of time in the 2-year span of time. It was16 implemented halfway into the first school year, and so a17 limited amount of students were covered in that first18 year.19 The second year, the lawsuit was filed at the20 beginning of August, and therefore only a very limited21 number of initial testing was done before the district22 determined to hold the policy in abeyance. There were23 four students in -- under those limited amount of students24 that tested positive. I know the court of appeals25 referred to three in one area, but that was just in the61111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1    high school.2 QUESTION: But didn't one --3 QUESTION: Well, I suppose the existence of a4 policy might be expected to deter drug use so that you5 would have fewer instances after it was imposed.6 MS. MEOLI: Yes, Your Honor, and -- and in fact7 really --8 QUESTION: We will never know, will we?9 QUESTION: Well, let her answer the question.10 (Laughter.)11 MS. MEOLI: Your Honor, in fact, it -- it really12 did. I -- I mean, if you even take the limited amount of13 testing that we did in the 2-year period of time, the14 first year three students tested positive, the second year15 one student tested positive. The only full year that the16 testing was applied in the Tecumseh School District was17 after the district court made its decision but before the18 court of appeals overruled it. And that evidence is not19 in the record, but it was -- there was a greater number of20    students that tested --21 QUESTION: Ms. Meoli, didn't we say in Vernonia22 that in Skinner, which was the railroad employee testing23 case, we did not demand that it be shown that the24 particular railroad had a drug problem? Didn't we say it25 was enough that there was a nationwide problem?71111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MS. MEOLI:  Yes, Your Honor.QUESTION: We said that in Skinner, and we adverted to that in Vernonia.MS. MEOLI: And -- and Vernonia's evidence as well showed that there was not a specific drug problem among athletes.QUESTION: I thought the argument in Vernonia and I thought the opinion in Vernonia, in assessing the particular interest of the district, repeatedly emphasized the particular problems with the athletes. The athletes were the ones that the kids looked up to. They were the role models. There was rampant drug use among the athletes. There was a rampant disciplinary problem among the athletes. Athletes were getting injured. There was a very specific showing of a specific interest of the10111213141516    district.17￼1819202122232425And now you're coming in and saying, well, that -- that really does not matter. And it seems to me that the implication of what you're saying is that this so- called special needs requirement will apply to every child in every school in the United States.--IMS. MEOLI: I'm not saying that, Your Honor. I think there is a corollary --QUESTION: But isn't that the implication of what you're saying?81111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 MS. MEOLI: No, Your Honor, I don't. For2 instance, you were talking about in Vernonia the athletes3 were looked up as role models. Well, the athletes in4 interscholastic competition in Tecumseh are looked at as 5    role models to some students --6 QUESTION: Except for one startling difference.7 The -- in -- there was a problem with athletes. Here,8 one thing that is clear in the record is the -- the school9 board's admission that the -- that the drug and alcohol10 problem is more of a problem with those who are not11 engaged in these extracurricular activities. In other12 words, the testing is directed to a group, those engaged13 in competitive activities, that is less of a problem, as14 far as drug use is concerned, than the rest of the15 students who are idle. And just naturally one would16 expect what turns out to be the case, that there's more17 drug use in the group that's not tested than there is in18    the group that's tested.19 MS. MEOLI: Well, Your Honor, we have never said20 that the -- the students in interscholastic competitive21 activities are the only students or even the most likely22 students to be abusing drugs. But the evidence that we23 have in the case demonstrate that they do abuse drugs.24 QUESTION: Well, I'm -- I'm referring25 specifically to page 100 and 101 of the joint appendix91111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 where the question is whether the students who tend to be2 involved in drugs are the ones most likely to be choosing3 extracurricular activities. And the answer ultimately is,4 we have students that are on drugs, and they are in5 extracurricular activities. They are -- they are -- there6 are probably more that are not in activities.7 MS. MEOLI: That was the testimony of the -- of8 the board president, Dean Rogers. There's also testimony9 of James Blue that said he really didn't find that10    difference between --11 QUESTION: Where is that testimony?12 MS. MEOLI: I think it is at page 106, Your13 Honor. Page 106. Now, national studies show that band,14 vocal and non-athletic extracurricular activities15    students, they are the least16    drugs.  Would you agree that17    would hold true for Tecumseh18    answer was, no, I would not.19 QUESTION: He had no basis for saying yes or no.20 MS. MEOLI: Well, yes, he -- he says that21 initially, and then he goes on to say, I just know that22 all age levels, all categories -- if we're categorizing23 the students that frequent the park. This part of the24    deposition was referring to this --25 QUESTION: Yes, but he's not saying, as was the101111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005likely of all students to usethis same -- the same thingHigh School students?  The￼1 case in Vernonia, that here is a group that we can2 identify that has this problem. Either there's no3 particular problem with this group as opposed to all4 students -- so, my question is if -- if you can, on the5 absence of any special showing with respect to this6 extracurricular group, then it seems to me that your7 argument is really that all students can be tested. I8 mean, there was a special circumstance with the athletes9 in Vernonia. Your argument for these extracurricular10 people I think would hold as well for -- for all the11 students because there's no more of a problem and probably12 less among those engaged in extracurricular activities13 than the -- than among the students that don't do anything14    after school.15 MS. MEOLI: Your Honor, the use of -- of drugs16 among the students in competitive activities was just one17 of the factors as to why the Tecumseh board selected that18 group. I really do think that, in fact, the -- at the19 meeting that the school district held for the community to20 give input, they asked that same question, why can't we21 drug test all students? And I think there's a couple of22    reasons as to why you can't.23 One of the reasons I think is because students24 in general have a property right in their education.25 Hence, they have a legal entitlement to a free public111111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1    education.23 4 5 6 7 8 9Secondly, the State compels them to be there, and parents, if they do not send their -- their children to school, face criminal prosecution. So -- so they are there. And I don't think that you can fashion a drug testing policy that could have the kind of consequences that would deny them that opportunity or -- or prevent parents from being persecuted for not --QUESTION: Well, if you want --QUESTION: You don't -- you don't have to go that far, do you, in order to -- in order to justify limiting it to those who participate in -- in voluntary10111213    activities?141516171819202122232425MS. MEOLI: No, Your Honor. We -- we --QUESTION: It seems to me you could say even if we could drug test anybody, we made the choice of giving a student who feels that strongly about not undergoing drug testing the ability to avoid it by simply not engaging in the extracurricular activities. You don't have to forego going to school entirely or go to a private school. You can simply not participate in extracurricular activity. Isn't that in itself a valid reason for limiting it to extracurricular activities?MS. MEOLI: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. I -- QUESTION: It's an equally valid argument -- I121111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 -- I suppose an equally valid argument would -- for -- for2 testing everybody would be our object is to stop drug use,3 not to penalize people who go out for band. And there's4 some evidence in this record that there is more drug use5 about the -- among the people who are not going out for6 extracurricular activities, but among those who do. And7 therefore, if your argument is good for this case, it8 seems to me your argument, a fortiori, is good for testing 9    everybody in the school.10 MS. MEOLI: Your Honor, the -- the purpose of11 this program is not to discipline students. It's not to12 catch them. It is to deter drug use and to help those13    students --14 QUESTION: Don't you want to deter drug use15 among those who do not go out for band?MS. MEOLI: Yes, Your Honor, I -- I believe we1617    do.1819202122232425￼QUESTION: Then why isn't the argument good that you can test everybody?MS. MEOLI: Well, number one, I -- I think there is a deterrent effect for implementing this program among the student -- general student body. If they want to --QUESTION: Well, I think -- go ahead.MS. MEOLI: If they want to try out or -- or audition for one of those competitive activities, they131111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 know in advance that one of the regulations is to be 2    subjected to drug testing.3 QUESTION: No, but with respect, what you're4 arguing is -- is a justification for the present policy5 that you've got, and I understand your position there.6 What I'm interested in and Justice Ginsburg was7 amomentagoisitseemstomethatif--ifwetakeyour8 argument and we take the evidence that is indicated on the9 record, there is at least an equally good argument for10 testing everybody in the school, whether they go out for11 band or whatnot or -- or do not. And -- and isn't that12 the case? That's what we're interested in.13 MS. MEOLI: Well, I think there is a reasonably14 good argument for that. We're not espousing that, but I15 think --16 QUESTION: No, I realize --17 MS. MEOLI: -- even though -- even -- even if we18 utilize the balancing test that was utilized in Vernonia,19 I -- I think there is a really good argument --20 QUESTION: But if we get to that point, then the21 whole notion of special need has -- has, more or less,22 evaporated. We don't have the kind of special safety need23 as -- as in the railroad case. We don't have the unusual24 temptation to crime need as in the immigration case, and25 the special need is simply the need to deter drug use141111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9among all children in all schools of the United States. And -- and if the -- if the theory of this is special need, it seems to me that the concept of special need seems to have gotten lost.QUESTION: I suppose the distinction that you draw is based on the fact that you have a sanction for the people that you apply it to. You can tell them you cannot participate in extracurricular activities. But as -- if you applied it to the whole school board -- to the whole school population, rather, you couldn't sanction them by saying you cannot come to school.10111213141516171819    class.20MS. MEOLI: Exactly, Your Honor, and -- and that really is our position because we have to educate the --          QUESTION:  But you could say --MS. MEOLI: You can -- you can remain in theMS. MEOLI: Yes, Your Honor.QUESTION: Or how about taking elective classes, classes that the State doesn't require you to take, but some students might like to take?151111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005QUESTION: And the only sanction you impose is you just can't play in the band or -- or cheerlead or whatever it is they want to do.￼21 22 23 24 25QUESTION: So, you have a special burden if you want to engage in extracurricular activities.1 MS. MEOLI: Well, Your Honor, we have to draw a2 line somewhere, and -- and even though elective classes3    are a choice --4 QUESTION: Well, I wondered what -- the line5 that you would draw as a question of the school's policy,6 but you were saying at least you see a problem with7 testing everyone because people are compelled to go to8 school and -- so that's why you resisted drawing the line9 there.10111213    thing.141516171819202122232425MS. MEOLI: Well -- well, elective courses are really mandatory, Your Honor, in many cases. I mean, you have your core curriculum that are required for graduation, and you also have your electives. You need 24 credits in order to graduate from high school. 18 of them have to be in the core subjects. The rest of them are electives. But those are required.QUESTION: Except for that, it would be a good idea, though, wouldn't it?(Laughter.)MS. MEOLI: Yes, Your Honor. I -- I think if -- if we could fashion --161111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005My question is if you're doing a voluntary, then why don't you say as well, you volunteer for -- you're taking a certain course, this is an elective course. Same￼1 QUESTION: That's what I thought you'd say.2 MS. MEOLI: If we could fashion a way to do it,3 I believe the majority of school boards would be behind4 it. But -- but at the state of the constitutions of -- of5 the 50 States and the states of the compulsory education6 laws that all the States have, I -- I don't think that is7 possible. So, if a line is going to be drawn, I think the8 line can be drawn between the students in the general9 school population and students in extracurricular --10 QUESTION: May I ask? Is there any other11 sanction other than -- other than ineligibility for12 extracurricular activities? Is there any other sanction13 imposed on a student who is found to have been using14    drugs?1516171819202122232425171111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005that onlyMS. MEOLI: No -- no, Your Honor, and in fact, happens in this policy under the third time -- QUESTION: So, really the student could say, worst -- if I go out for extracurricular￼well, theactivities and get caught, it'll be back where if I had gone out at all.(Laughter.)QUESTION: He gets back to square one.MS. MEOLI: Well, I think -- I think childrenwho engage in these activities really want to compete. I mean, they are really interested in what they are doing.1 So, they don't want to get caught. And it's also a -- a2 way for these students to say no. Peer pressure among3 elementary and secondary school children is -- is very 4    significant, and --5 QUESTION: Could you, for that reason, adopt as6 a -- as one of our sanctions or a supplementary sanction7 simply publicity that the person has been caught? Anybody8 who fails the drug test will have his name and photograph9 posted on the bulletin board. Would that be -- would that10 be constitutional too? I presume it would be under your11 theory.1213141516171819202122232425MS. MEOLI: I -- I think it would be very cruel, Your Honor. As -- as to whether --QUESTION: It would get the job done.MS. MEOLI: -- as to whether it is constitutional or not -- we're -- we're not in -- in the job of disciplining students. And -- and we seem to be going into that realm more and more. This program -- we don't want to put an A on them or a big substance abuse on them. What we really want to do is help those students. And it may be constitutional to do that, but that's not what we are asking this Court to do. We're just asking you to give us the tools to deter drug use, to help those drug users.And -- and if there are no other questions --181111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼123456 AS 7QUESTION: Very well, Ms. Meoli. MS. MEOLI: -- my time. QUESTION: Mr. Clement.   ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT    ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERSMR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 8 please the Court:9 A school district that reasonably concludes that10 it faces a drug problem may adopt random drug tests for11 students engaged in competitive extracurricular activities12 without violating the Constitution.13 QUESTION: Suppose you've had hard statistical14 evidence to show that the kids that go out for the15 extracurricular activities are the ones that really do not16 use drugs, that the high drug user population is in those17 that don't engage in the activities. What -- what would18 your recommendation be to the school board at that point?19 MR. CLEMENT: I think in a case like that, it20 still might be appropriate for the school district to test21 the students involved in extracurricular activities, and I22 think that is because, as this Court has emphasized on a23 number of occasions, by making the -- the testing program24 applicable only to an avoidable activity, the -- the25 school district would be ensuring the reasonableness of191111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 the program under the Fourth Amendment.2 QUESTION: But there's some -- we -- we had an3 amicus brief by some -- a pediatrics association and so4 forth that pointed out that students that engage in these5 extracurricular activities are, indeed, the least likely6 to be involved in drug use. And it seems so odd to try to7 penalize those students and leave untested the students8 that are most apt to be engaged in the problem. 9              MR. CLEMENT:  Well --10              QUESTION:  It's just -- it's so11    counterintuitive, isn't it?12 MR. CLEMENT: A couple of points in response to13 that, Justice O'Connor. First, there's contrary evidence14 as well, and the petitioners in their reply brief point to15 some evidentiary studies that showed that really drug use16 is distributed evenly across all groups in the student --17    in the student population.18              The second thing I would add is that as -- as I19 was noting in answer to Justice Kennedy's question, there20 is a sense, and which the majority and Justice Ginsburg in21 -- in Vernonia emphasized, that by making the program only22 applicable to activities that are avoidable, you -- you23 limit Fourth Amendment difficulties. You make the program24 more reasonable. And as Justice Stevens pointed out, you25 also avoid any difficult questions that might be201111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 occasioned by the consequences of a drug testing program 2    that applies to school-wide.3 QUESTION: Well, this in the face of a school4 district that is certifying to the Federal Government they5 don't have a drug problem. I mean, the whole thing is 6    absolutely odd.7 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I don't think it's that odd,8 Justice O'Connor. First of all, in terms of the9 certifications, I would direct you to footnote 23 of the10 district court opinion. And the district court found in11 that footnote that what those reports really emphasized12 are the relative natures of the problem. Alcohol was the13 major problem they faced, but in each one of those --14 those reports, they note that they do have a drug problem.15 QUESTION: Well, if alcohol is the problem, why16 don't they address that? This is just -- I mean, it's17 structured in a way to do very little good it seems to me.18 QUESTION: Mr. Clement, do you think any school19 in the country doesn't have a drug problem?20 MR. CLEMENT: I would be surprised to find a21 school district that didn't. The national figures on --22 on the -- the amount of drug use are really staggering.23 As we note in our brief, over half of all 12th graders24 have tried illegal drugs by the time they graduate from25 high school. So, I really think that, you know, if211111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9anything, the burden ought to shift in these cases to the other side to show that this one school district is the one school district --QUESTION: Can -- can you tell me --QUESTION: In both Skinner and Von Raab, we imposed or we permitted the imposition of drug testing on the basis of a nationwide problem, didn't we, without -- without showing that the particular entity in question shared in that national problem?MR. CLEMENT: That's correct, Justice Scalia.And I would also point out I'm not sure you want to put school districts in the business of trying -- when they -- when they find some incidental evidence of drug use, to try to pin it down to the exact extracurricular groups involved. If a student comes in --QUESTION: Well, do --MR. CLEMENT: -- for some sort of anonymous drug counseling, I'm not sure they want to ask him what groups are you in.QUESTION: May I ask? What is your view on -- on the validity of a -- a school-wide drug testing10111213141516171819202122    program?23￼24 25MR. CLEMENT: Justice Stevens, we think such a program would be constitutional, but we think the program at issue here --221111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 QUESTION: So, you would differ from the 2    petitioners then.3 MR. CLEMENT: We -- we do have that difference,4 but we think a program like this is constitutional for5 three reasons. One, extracurricular students agree to6 additional intrusions on their privacy and have additional 7    safety risks.  Second, as --8 QUESTION: No. But you say they agree to it.9 They agree to it only under the circumstances that if they10 don't agree to it, they can't engage in any of these11 activities. They know perfectly well they'll never get12 into a competitive college if they don't. And the -- the13 agreement is not simply something that is -- is arrived at14 sort of in the abstract. There's -- there's tremendous15    pressure on them to agree to it.16 MR. CLEMENT: Two points, Justice Souter.17 First, we're not suggesting this is -- this is18 constitutional because it's consensual. I think Justice19 Kennedy, in -- in his separate opinion in the Ferguson20 case, pointed out that in these special needs contexts,21 there's an element of voluntariness which is important to22 the constitutional analysis, even if it's not voluntary in23    the full sense of the word.24 This -- a second and related point about that,25 though, is that these are avoidable programs, and I think231111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 that makes the important difference. And again, as I2 noted earlier, because they're -- they're avoidable in3 that sense, it avoids any difficult questions with the4 consequences that a positive test might generate.5 QUESTION: But it doesn't --6 QUESTION: May I ask you a question that -- that7 is -- concern -- concerns me about the difference between8 this case and Vernonia? If we -- if we look at what9 people might expect in the real world, where people know10 that athletes, professional athletes, Olympic athletes,11 athletes are tested for drugs, but people who are just12 everyday people aren't. So, Vernonia could be regarded as13 all the students who are athletes -- they will be treated14 as athletes are generally. But that's not true of the --15 the large population of high school students.16 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I mean, I -- I think one17 fact is that I think it is increasingly becoming true that18 -- that these sorts of policies are in society as a whole.19 And one of the petitioners in this case who -- who didn't20 wanted to be drug tested at school had to go get drug21 tested for the job at the Kmart, at the McDonald's. And I22 do think that probably does have some influence on the23 reasonable expectations of privacy in this area.24 But I also think that it really doesn't make a25 lot of sense to draw a line on -- on sports, and even241111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 within sports, of course, there are differences. The2 Vernonia policy applied to golfers, as well as football3 players. Now, I'm not aware that golfers, as a general4 matter, are tested for substance abuse even on the PGA5 Tour. I could be wrong about that, but the point is there6 are differences in the risks even among the athletes, and7 I think this Court in Vernonia didn't make anything turn 8    on those differences.9 The dissent in Vernonia pointed out that there10 wasn't any evidence of drug use at the grade school in the11 7th and 8th grade, and that the evidence really wasn't an12 evidence of a disciplinary problem that was specific to13 student athletes. And the majority in Vernonia did not --14 was not -- was not moved by those two points. The15 majority said that the evidence was good enough in these16 contexts.￼1718 the local19 nature of20 particularly the particular students that are going to be21 tested is quite appropriate. It's important to22    recognize --23 QUESTION: But you would make -- you would make24 -- and I think you've said this -- the same argument if25 they had decided to have a universal drug testing policy251111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005And I think this is an area where deference to school boards in their determinations about the the problem, the nature of the solution, and 1    in the school.2 MR. CLEMENT: I would, Justice Souter. I do --3 as I said, I think it's a more difficult question. And I4 think the most difficult problem with a school-wide test5 is what Justice Stevens pointed out, and that would be6 what are the consequences of a positive test. But if you7 imagine a school district that -- that faced -- reasonably8 concluded it faced a serious problem and instituted a drug9 test where the only ramification of a positive drug test10 was a confidential notification of the parents, I don't11 see why that test would violate Fourth Amendment12    reasonableness.13141516171819202122232425QUESTION: But at that point, I -- the so-called special need has become virtually a universal need.MR. CLEMENT: I would like to say two things in response to that.First, in Vernonia itself, this Court didn't identify the special need as being the drug problem. This Court identified the special need as being the school setting, and that's consistent with this Court's decision in T.L.O.QUESTION: And -- and the special need would be a universal need in every school in the United States.MR. CLEMENT: I -- I do think it would properly recognize that the school context is different, and that261111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 school boards have a freer hand in testing their students2 than the Government has testing either employees or its 3    citizens at large.4 QUESTION: But if -- if that is the case, what5 is the danger in the school case, comparable to the -- to6 the railroad worker's danger or the -- the customs7 officer's danger? What is the danger as distinct from8 simply the desire to deter illegal drug use?9 MR. CLEMENT: I think the danger is this. I10 mean, it -- and I think Von Raab actually is -- is an11 excellent counterpoint. This Court in Von Raab said that12 you could test the customs official because they are on13 the front line of the drug problems on the supply side. I14 think by parity of reasoning, children today are on the15 front lines of the drug problem, but on the demand side.16 The evidence shows that if you can stop children from17 using drugs before their 18th birthday, they're not likely18    to start using drugs after that --19              QUESTION:  But if --20 QUESTION: The danger is getting young people￼21    used to a drug culture.22    school.  And the -- the23    adults.  You're forming24    the rest of their life.25 MR. CLEMENT: You're raising young people inspecific danger is unlike with-- you're forming their habits forI agree with that, Justice Scalia,271111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425and I would -- I would add that this is not the only context where -- where the Federal Government has recognized that difference. The penalties for dealing drugs in a school area or selling drugs to a minor are much more substantial than those selling drugs to adults.QUESTION: I think that's hardly a revelation that the Government is concerned about what drugs do to our culture.MR. CLEMENT: Absolutely, and I think it's perfectly --QUESTION: It's not exactly rocket science, isit?MR. CLEMENT: No, and -- and I don't think it's rocket science also to say that that -- that concern is particularly acute with respect to the youngest and most vulnerable members of society. And as I say, if you look at 21 U.S.C. 859, 860, 861, all of those provisions put added penalties on someone who deals drugs involving children.Thank you.QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Clement. Mr. Boyd, we'll hear from you.ORAL ARGUMENT OF GRAHAM A. BOYD ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSMR. BOYD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please281111 14th Street, N.W.

And so, rather than2 just start off, as you did, assuming that that's it, I'd3    like to hear some argument for it.45 to set up6 move from7 Vernonia.89 principle, I think there has to be some nexus to aMR. BOYD: Of -- of course. Let -- let me try what -- what I see as -- as basically how you the general rule of T.L.O. to the exception ofIn order to set aside that core Fourth Amendment10 problem, some connection that is demonstrated to a problem11 either, and preferably both, in terms of safety and drug12 use.13 Both of those are missing here. The reason this14 school expanded its initial policy from athletes to15 include non-athletes was because it wanted to appear16 evenhanded. Now, that's not a value that this Court has17 recognized in the -- in the special needs context. They18 didn't want to stigmatize the athletes alone through the19 drug test, so they said, who else can we get? Their20 lawyers said, well, the Seventh Circuit said you can get21 the non-athletes, and so they expanded it.22 But let's look at the safety rationale here.23 Now, in Vernonia, the school board said up front, this is24 about the safety of our athletes, and that's why we're25 doing it. In this case, the school board's testimony and311111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 the testimony of everyone else who has been -- who's --2 who's testified is that safety is not a reason for this3 test. There is nothing about the band or the choir that 4    is dangerous.5 And this is a very important too that we did not6 make in our briefs I want to bring out. In Vernonia, the7 drug test was for in-season athletic activities. While8 you're playing football, you're drug tested. They were9 concerned about that. In this case, they test year in,10 year out. If you look at page 198 of the joint appendix,11 the policy itself says it is in season and out season.12 So, there's nothing about the activities of Lindsay Earls13 in the choir, who's here today, not a drug user -- there's14 nothing about her activities in the choir that requires15    her being drug tested.16 QUESTION: But the choir is presumably a year-17 round thing in a way that football is not.18 MR. BOYD: No, it's not, Your Honor. All of19 these activities have competitive seasons, and the20 competition is what triggers the drug testing. It's quite21 clear that in the academic team, choir, band, all of these22 activities, they are participating at a certain point, and23 yet they are drug tested throughout the year.24 QUESTION: Are you saying that, for instance,25    choir in Tecumseh is only in the fall?321111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1              MR. BOYD:  The --2 QUESTION: Or only in the winter or only in the3    spring?456789MR. BOYD: Yes, Your Honor, in terms of the competitions, they are. There's a class which -- which they are very clear, it is not the reason that drug testing takes place, and someone who's merely in the class is not drug tested. But if you go out for the team, as it were, which competes during a limited season, then you are drug tested, although it is for the entire year. So, again, it's not the activities of the choir competition that are of concern to the school.QUESTION: Well, give me the quote. Whichfour seasons is for band in Tecumseh? BOYD: I honestly don't know what months of compete in, and -- and in rebuttal, if I'mQUESTION: They can't be for all four seasons, IBut --MR. BOYD: Excuse me?QUESTION: -- let me -- let me ask you this.What -- what they're -- what they're trying to do is to find a basis on which they can implement a program which has an element of consent to it. The Government does not331111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 2000510111213141516171819    guess.20season of the          MR.the year theywrong, I'm --￼21 22 23 24 251 think that's necessary, but that's the case that we have2 before us. And so, what the school district has done has3 taken a set of programs and they said, this is a surrogate4 for consent, and that's what's happening here. This -- I 5    -- I think this goes beyond Vernonia.6 MR. BOYD: Right.7 QUESTION: But we take cases as they come to us,8 and in this case, it is clear that the student who is --9 is so offended by the idea of a search and does not care10 about the school district's policy of ensuring that drugs11 are school-free doesn't need to participate in the12 extracurricular activity. That's their choice.13 MR. BOYD: Well, Justice Kennedy, you're14 absolutely right. That's the position here. And frankly,15 I think that's what it comes down to for them. They don't16 have the safety rationale. They don't have the drug use17    rationale.18 And -- and I would actually point to the -- to19 your concurrence in the Ferguson case where you -- where20 you, albeit briefly, survey the special needs in drug21 testing jurisprudence and point out that in all of those22 cases, the activity was, in a sense, consensual or23 voluntary. I mean, this goes back to Justice Scalia's24 question in -- in the initial round, too. If you want to25 drive a train, if you want to be a customs agent, if you341111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 want to be a football player in Vernonia, if you want to2 run for office in Chandler, these are all activities which3 you're perfectly free to not do. Now, maybe that weighs4 into the balance, the constitutional reasonableness5 balance, somewhat but it certainly is not dispositive.6 And when that's all you have, when there isn't the history7 of drug use, when there isn't a safety rationale, when all 8    you have is this, then it's nothing. 9              Now, I think also I need to --10 QUESTION: It -- it seems to me if a school is11 better than other school districts insofar as drug use,12 they have less drug use, that they're maybe entitled to13    keep it that way.14              MR. BOYD:  Well --15 QUESTION: You seem to say not. You seem to say16 there has to be some great crisis where we lose a couple17 years of kids to drugs, and then we -- and then we move.18 National statistics just don't support that.19 MR. BOYD: Well, there -- there are a couple of20 things. I mean, first of all, the -- the crisis21 nationally of drug abuse is one that certainly we need to22 be concerned about, and I think Justice O'Connor is right23 to point out that the pediatricians, along with the public24 health social workers and teachers, all say that this25 policy of setting up barriers for extracurricular351111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 activities is actually counterproductive. It promotes2 drug use and other dangerous activities.3 But let me get to precisely the question that4 you're asking, too. This is a school that has in place5 cameras in the halls, security guards, drug dogs that6 sweep through the school and the -- and the parking lot7 and the students. They search lockers. They have8 teachers who are trained in looking for drug use. They9 have all of these things in place, and they have a10 mandatory reporting policy that if they discover any drug11 use, they have to report it. Now, over the years, that's12 added up to two instances of drugs being found, none of13 them associated with non-athletes, none of them associated14 with extracurricular activities.15 QUESTION: Yes, but they have a record here16 that, of course, suggests if you want to know if drugs are17 going on in your school, you ask the kids. You don't find18 them because nobody is stupid enough to take them into the19 school. But it's all around and they use them. And here20 they ask the kids, and the teachers ask the kids, and they21 say, sure, there's a lot of drug use going on over in the22 park, at parties. That's the record that I saw.23              MR. BOYD:  Well --24 QUESTION: And I don't really see how that -- I25 mean, you know, you might be able to drive a millimeter of361111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425light between that and Vernonia.          MR. BOYD:  Well --can't --QUESTION: So, go ahead and try. But I -- I(Laughter.)QUESTION: I mean, I -- I -- they did what I would have done. I would have asked my children what's really going on in this school, and they get a positive response when it's a question of drugs.MR. BOYD: Justice Breyer, I -- I think you're right. I'm going to go ahead and try. But I think there's -- I think there's an important distinction here. What the kids said in this case is, to the extent there's drug use going on, who's doing it? It's not the choir and the band and so forth. And I think that that's critical.I think that the jurisprudence of this Court in looking at when do you set aside individualized suspicion, it says there has to be that connection between --QUESTION: Why? Now, I --MR. BOYD: Why.QUESTION: Of course, if I read the cases, as Ido, and they logically require you to win, that's the end. You win.MR. BOYD: Sure.QUESTION: But just in case it's open --371111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425(Laughter.)QUESTION: -- I would like to know why. I take it they've given you some reasons why they've limited it. One, these are the school leaders and maybe it'll spread.          MR. BOYD:  Sure.QUESTION: Two, we don't want to put the student, although we'd really like to, to the choice of school versus drug testing. We'll put him to the choice of extracurricular versus drug testing. It's a little bit better. Okay. That's their reason.          Now, what do you say?MR. BOYD: Well, I -- perhaps behind your question is law and why is the law that wayI mean, I think what'sa little bit of what's theand a little bit of whythe policy --QUESTION: I'll tell you what's behind thequestion. What's behind the question is that I think undoubtedly you're right, that this is a slight expansion of Vernonia. You want to say a lot. They'll say hardly any. So, it's hard for me to see why, if I came out one way in Vernonia, I'd come out differently here. And that's what I want you to --MR. BOYD: Okay, fair enough. I -- I think the question is where do you want to put your focus. If your focus is solely on is there evidence of drug use in the381111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 high school alone, then the difference here I think is2 still very important. In Vernonia, you had athletes who3 were skipping class and being arrested. You had people4 smoking marijuana across the street in plain view. You've5 got none of that here. I think there is that difference. 6              But I think that also I would ask you to focus7 somewhere different than what is the overall general8 problem. I would say that if you take seriously the idea9 of the nexus, or connection, being there in order to take10 what is a serious step from individualized suspicion to11 blanket intrusive search, I would say you have to look at12 what are the reasons for picking this group. Is it simply13 to be fair to the athletes where a problem may exist, or14 is it -- which is the case here, or is it because there's15 a problem here, which is certainly not the case here.16 And there's another difference too, Justice17 Breyer, which I think is absolutely critical. In18 Vernonia, that was a school where discipline was out of19 control. Discipline throughout the school jurisprudence20 of this Court has been a critical factor. In Vernonia, it21 was a school that said, quote, we don't have a major drug22 problem for many years, just like this school. But then23 in the space of 2 or 3 years, they said, discipline24 referrals have increased by almost threefold. Teachers25 are threatening to quit. We're thinking about mass391111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1    expulsion 2    school. 34 contrast,5 their Federal reports, they say -- now, I'm not talking6 about the drug use here. I'm talking about discipline.7 They say on page 192, minimal problems have been8 experienced due to violent safety and discipline problems.9 That's right in the middle. And in the very last sentence10    on that page --11 QUESTION: I don't understand the point of this12 argument, counsel. I mean, is -- is the only reason13 schools want to prevent drug use is that they have unruly14 classrooms when they have drug use? I should think that15 is the least of the reasons to prevent drug use.16              MR. BOYD:  Well, it --17 QUESTION: And -- and what I miss in your18 argument is any recognition of the fact that we are19 dealing here with minors. I mean, you're talking here20 about a search rather than a seizure, but in the case of21 minors, you can keep them, in effect, imprisoned after22 school, can you not, if they haven't done their homework23 or something else? The school is standing in loco24 parentis. It is trying to train and raise these young25 people to be responsible adults. And I think that -- it's401111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005of the students. We can't keep control of thisNow, if you look what this school has said, by let me refer you to the joint appendix. In￼1 a -- it's a world of difference from -- from what -- from2 what the State can do with regard to adults.3 MR. BOYD: Let -- let me -- let me do two4 things, if I may, Justice Scalia. Let me just quote the5 last sentence of what I was about to say and then I -- and6 then, if I may have your permission to address the in loco7 parentis argument, because there's a good answer to that.8 In terms of the discipline argument, Justice9 Breyer, what the school said is we don't have that10 problem, and in the last sentence, the discipline policies11 in place at each site have been effective in dealing with12 the problems. So, I think if one of the things, maybe not13 the only thing, Justice Scalia, but if one of the things14 we care about is can the kids learn here, is this a school15 environment that is conducive to learning and safety and16 discipline, Tecumseh High School has that in hand with17 their cameras and guards and dogs and everything else.18 They don't need this policy. Especially they don't need19 it for Lindsay Earls. I mean, if they want to voluntarily20 test all the students, they apparently will get many of21 them, but why should we force Lindsay Earls to -- to give22    up her privacy as part of that?23 QUESTION: You're willing to rest your case on24 the proposition that the only valid basis for conducting25 drug searches is to -- is to enable the school to maintain411111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1    discipline. 2              MR. BOYD:  No, no.3 QUESTION: So long as you have a bunch a4 druggies who are orderly in class, the school can take no5 action. Is -- is that what you want us to --6 MR. BOYD: Absolutely not. Given that we have7 here a school that has not only discipline in hand, but8 also drug use itself in hand, especially among these9 activities, which themselves aren't dangerous, it seems it10 adds up to me the mirror image of Vernonia.11 But let me address your point, Justice Scalia,12    about in loco parentis.13 QUESTION: Except for one point that was made in14 Vernonia, and it does go across the board, and that was15 the statement that drug testing on suspicion, which is the16 alternative, because in life, it's everything as compared17 to what. So, if we didn't have the -- the random testing,18 it would be on individual suspicion. And the point was19 made there that if you had -- if you treated the children20 that way, you would transform this random process into21 what the opinion author called a badge of shame, and that22 it might be worse the risk of singling out the23 troublesome, but not drug likely student, the one that the24 teacher -- the one that's always the bad boy in the class25    and diverts the teachers --421111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1              MR. BOYD:  Right.2 QUESTION: -- who are engaged in that exercise3 from the job of teaching to being a police officer.4 MR. BOYD: Justice Ginsburg, there's a good5 answer to that question. Let me focus on the facts of6 this case, as they come to this Court. This is a school7 that already has not had this problem of pointing the8 finger of -- of accusation at students, although it could9 do that with its drug dogs and locker searches and10 everything else. When it gets a student for whom there is11 some suspicion of drug use, say, a -- a drug dog hits on a12 student who could easily have had dad's beer spilled on13 the -- on the sleeve. That will make a drug dog alert.14 That student is then questioned. That already happens in15    this school.1617 missed in18 that even19 suspicion-based drug testing can and will go forward in20 this and many other schools. So, even if you have a21 blanket policy, if there is, say, some malicious teacher22 out there who wants to -- to pick out Johnny because23 Johnny is acting bad and -- and put that badge of shame on24 him, she or he can certainly do that. I don't think that25 that is a reason to go ahead with the policy that doesn't431111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005But there's also a key point that I think was that -- in that discussion in Vernonia, which is if -- whichever way you rule in this case,￼1 have a basis in the safety, discipline, or drug use 2 rationales.3 Now, Justice Scalia, I'm feeling like I'm not4 getting to the in loco parentis question, and I do because5 the -- the short answer is, I believe the brief by the6 parents, the amicus brief -- Jean Burkett is the lead one7 -- really engages this question in a very vigorous and8 intelligent manner. And what they say is this. In loco9 parentis is a doctrine that does not say the school is the10 parent, can take over from the parent. The parent still11 retains certain roles, and the parents in this community12 -- a good number of the parents in this community say I13 want to raise my kid and I've succeeded so far in raising14 my kid by having open communication where they can come to15 me and talk and we will -- and we will have that trust16 there. The school has interfered with that relationship17 by forcing me, the parent, to sign off on this drug test,18 which is a different way of raising kids.19 QUESTION: Well, but the in loco parentis20 argument works against you there too because in loco21 parentis also indicates that all children are forced to go22    to this school.23              MR. BOYD:  Yes.24 QUESTION: And we have to accept that a majority25 of the parents want to make sure that those children are441111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425in a drug-free atmosphere.          MR. BOYD:  In --QUESTION: And they have -- they -- you seem to me to be disparaging about police dogs and locker searches, and maybe that's what you're going to challenge next. But what the -- what -- what the school board has said is that this is a necessary and effective policy, and that's -- that's all it said.          MR. BOYD:  Justice --QUESTION: And there are rights of other children who want to go to a school which is drug-free, if they can.MR. BOYD: Absolutely, Justice Kennedy.QUESTION: And it seems to me that's part of in loco parentis too because those students are required to go the school just as -- as the drug user is.MR. BOYD: You're absolutely right about that, and please don't hear me to be disparaging of those other tools because those are tools that do not include a blanket intrusive search, which is the principle that's at issue here. And I actually applaud this school forbeing --QUESTION: Well, why does it make difference why you applaud it or not?MR. BOYD: Oh, it probably doesn't. It probably451111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 doesn't.2 QUESTION: We're talking about a constitutional 3 question.4567 successfully.8 In loco parentis I think comes into play when9 you have a school like Vernonia where, as -- as you putMR. BOYD: It -- it does. But -- but the point I'm trying to make is that -- is that these other tools, which they have the legal right to use, are being used10 it, Justice Kennedy, the rights of the other students,11 their ability to get an education and to themselves stay12 drug-free is being interfered with. Now, if we were13 talking about the Vernonia school --14 QUESTION: Are you saying that the in loco15 parentis principle does not apply in the case of a school16 if a minority of parents object to what the school is17    doing?1819202122232425461111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼MR. BOYD: That's not my position.QUESTION: Well, I thought that was what you were saying a moment ago?MR. BOYD: Let -- let me please try to be more clear about that. It depends on what the issue is and what's happening in the school. When there is an issue of school discipline, say, in the Fraser case or the Hazelwood case, where you had student conduct that was in1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425a sense -- well, certainly had -- had a element of connection to constitutional protection, but yet affected the rights of other students to be able to learn in that environment, then --QUESTION: Well, how did -- how does Hazelwood fit that description?MR. BOYD: Well, because of the disruption that could be caused by the -- by the school paper articles. My -- my point is that where disruption --QUESTION: I don't think the reason in Hazelwood was -- where the discipline was justified was -- caused disruption, but because when you're learning in school, you follow the instructions of the teacher.MR. BOYD: Well, and also the form issue. I mean, I -- I think that's certainly there and I don't -- I -- I brought this upon myself by bringing up the case, but I hope --QUESTION: You did, yes.(Laughter.)MR. BOYD: I did. I did. I did and I apologizefor that.But my point is that the in loco parentis doctrine more broadly comes into play when the rights of the student who says, I want to -- or the minority comes into conflict with -- with the environment of the school471111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 of learning and discipline. And that's -- that was the2 case in Vernonia. That's not the case here. And it's3 certainly not the case if you think of it in terms of the 4    rights of the student --5 QUESTION: Now, say again why you -- you think6 the Vernonia situation, with respect to this point, is 7    different than the Tecumseh.8 MR. BOYD: Sure. It's -- it's really the point9 I was making to Justice Breyer about discipline in the10 school. Vernonia had convincingly shown and the district11 court found that there was a discipline problem that was12 out of control that was directly tied to drug use by13 athletes.14 after the1516 that. It17    have the drug use.18 QUESTION: Well, but that -- that question has19 been batted back and forth -- you're -- you're not saying,20 are you, that unless the school has the sort of discipline21 problem they had in Vernonia, it can't do this?They wanted to address this problem by going thing that was connected to it.Now, this is a school that doesn't have any of doesn't have the discipline problem. It doesn't￼22 MR. BOYD: No, I'm not. No, I'm not, although I23 think that when you have neither a discipline problem nor24 a drug use problem among the tested students, nor a safety25 among the students tested, I don't see how you get within481111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 Vernonia at all unless Vernonia sort of quietly,2 implicitly said what we really meant to say was drug test3 everybody because those principles do apply to all 244 million secondary school students in this Nation. And so5 I don't --6 QUESTION: May I ask on the drug test? If you7 had a choice, in terms of which is the -- I understand you8 think this is clearly unconstitutional. Would it9 unconstitutional or less unconstitutional to test10    everybody?111213141516171819202122232425be moreMR. BOYD: I'm not really sure that onecan rank more and less constitutional. Both seem plainly unconstitutional. The only constitutional way to go beyond individualized reasonable suspicion is to identify a problem in a school and devise a solution that has a close nexus to that particular problem, and that certainly isn't the case here.Let me put that a little bit differently, Justice Stevens.QUESTION: Of course, Justice Scalia would -- would respond by saying, well, everybody knows there's a potential problem in every school in the country, and that's enough. And why isn't that an effective argument?MR. BOYD: It's not -- it's not enough because what I would say is that it is really that the balancing491111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005can -- to me￼1 test behind the Fourth Amendment reasonableness2 requirement becomes one where there's no weight3 side of the -- of the balance. That's a little4 let me --on onevague, so5 QUESTION: Why is that? Now, they've6 with a brief on the other side and said, you know, despite7 the fact that we're spending X billion dollars, two-thirds8 of which goes on the supply side for interdiction --9 MR. BOYD: Right.10 QUESTION: -- demand has stayed constant among11 teenagers, and it's about 20 to 30 percent of all of the12 children in these high schools who take drugs. Now, if13 you know that that is a fact, why is it -- and if you know14 this is a typical high school, why isn't that enough to do15 just what you said would be constitutional, to say here's16 a particular problem, 20 to 30 percent of the kids are17 taking drugs, and we want to come in with a solution18    that's tailored to that?19 MR. BOYD: Well, it's -- you know, the number is20 probably, according to Mr. Clement, is more like 5021 percent, and -- and that 50 percent of -- of the kids in22    the high schools are using drugs.23 QUESTION: All right. Then it's much worse than24 I thought.25              MR. BOYD:  And --501111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005come in￼ 1              (Laughter.)2 QUESTION: And then if that -- if that's fine,3 then -- then there is the problem you talked about, which4 I just heard you say. And so, if -- you said if there's a5 problem of a serious sort, and that this is tailored to6 that problem, they can do it. All right. So then why 7    couldn't they do this on that theory?8 MR. BOYD: Well, if it's 50 percent nationally,9 this school in its reports to the Federal Government says10 that its school-wide drug use based on its own surveys,11 which is where the national data comes from, surveys, is 512    percent.  5 percent.13 QUESTION: All right, 5 percent. I mean, maybe14 -- maybe they exaggerated in that report. I guess I'd15 have to take the finding of the district court here, and16 when I read the district court opinion, I thought the17 district judge thought it was a fairly serious problem.18              MR. BOYD:  Well --19 QUESTION: He didn't put numbers on it.20              MR. BOYD:  Right, he did not.21 QUESTION: But you used the word serious22    problem.  So --23 MR. BOYD: Okay. What -- what I wanted to say,24 Justice Breyer, is this. If you take the school at their25 own word, that their data shows that it's at 5 percent,511111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 and you take the school board president and all three2 teachers at their word in saying, to the extent that that3 drug use -- that 5 percent is there, it tends not to be4 among these activities, and if you take this Court5 seriously in articulating a nexus test, there simply is6 not a nexus between choosing these non-athletes who, both7 in terms of school versus Nation and the non-athletes and8 the school versus the other students, are really9 exceptionally unlikely to be using drugs. It's a terribly10 poor --11 QUESTION: Now, in your opinion a school that12 did find that it was within, let's say, half the average,13 say 20 percent or 25 percent, and they did feel that a14 significant number of their extracurricular activity15 students were involved in that, if -- if they've heard16 that through hearsay or any other way that was reasonably17 plausible for policy makers, they could then do this in18    your opinion.19 MR. BOYD: No, they could not because there20 still is a need for a safety rationale. There is not a21 single case in which drug testing has been upheld by any22 court, outside of this line of cases for extracurricular23 non-athletes.24 QUESTION: Well, what was the safety rationale 25 with golfers in Vernonia?521111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. BOYD: Well, the safety rationale -- I mean,2 certainly the Court in Vernonia didn't talk about golfers3    one way or another, but --4 QUESTION: Well, 5    that Vernonia was based on 6    testing included golfers. 7              MR. BOYD:  Well,8 at some length about the safety rationale. Justice9 Kennedy, in his -- in his Ferguson concurrence, also10 described the Vernonia holding as -- as being about11 students who are athletes and face these danger risks.12 Now, reasonableness, Your Honor --13 reasonableness -- it does need to turn in the end on some14 kind of reasonable line drawing. I think it was15 reasonable for the Court to say in Vernonia, the line that16 was drawn by Vernonia among athletes, the vast majority of17 whom are doing things that, if not involving physical18 contact, certainly involve exertion of the court, that in19 the opinion of the Court could cause death. Death was20 what was -- the word that was used by this Court. Also,21 in Skinner, death from train accidents; in Von Raab, death22 from misguided bullets. Those were the stakes in those23 cases.24 Here you've got a choir.25 QUESTION: How about death from overdose?531111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005but you're -- you're sayinga safety rationale.  Itsin Vernonia, the Court talked￼12345    drugs?67 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. BOYD: It absolutely is, Justice Scalia, and -- and where there's --MR. BOYD: Death from overdose is certainly a concern, but there's no --QUESTION: I mean, do you think life and death is -- is really not involved in -- in the fight againstQUESTION: Let's not minimize that.MR. BOYD: I don't mean to, and where there is evidence of drug use among a group of students, then I -- QUESTION: As far as -- as far as the extent ofthe drug use is concerned, this is an elected school board, isn't it?          MR. BOYD:  It is.QUESTION: Why -- why should I trust your assessment of how serious the drug problem is and what measures are reasonable to counter that -- that seriousness over the assessment of -- of the local citizens who -- who elect their school board, and their school board says we have a big enough problem that we want to use this draconian measure?MR. BOYD: Well, I think if we listen to the school board and to the school administration, who themselves are even closer to that problem, what they say is, we've identified enough of a problem that initially we541111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 want to test our athletes. And they directed Mr. Jacobs2 to go off and draft a policy for athletes. He did so.3 They came back and he said, you know, we feel kind of bad4 about stigmatizing our athletes. Who else can we test?5 Now, that's not identifying a drug problem.6 In fact, the best evidence in this case is what7 the school itself says to the Federal Government where the8 Federal Government says, now, remember these reports, when9 they write them, they say, tell us what you know, not10 based on just sort of vague evidence, but tell us what you11 really know about drug use, do some surveys, ask some12 questions, look around. The school did that, and over the13 course of a number of years, they said consistently14 exactly what Vernonia said back before it had a problem.15    We don't have any --16 QUESTION: Suppose -- suppose the school17 district said, we're going to have two schools and you can18 go to either one. One, they don't have dogs or -- or19 tests or anything else. It's the druggie school.20 (Laughter.)21 QUESTION: And -- and the other school -- and22 the other school is they have mandatory testing for23 everybody. Would that be constitutional? And then your24 client could go to the druggie school.25 MR. BOYD: I don't think so because I think even551111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 by the nature of that hypothetical, it presupposes one of2 the schools is going to be vastly inferior on a number of3 grounds.4 QUESTION: Vastly experience why?5              MR. BOYD:  Excuse me?6 QUESTION: Why? Because there are drug users7 there. 8910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: No parent -- no parent would -- would send the child to the first school that I suggested, other than perhaps your client wants to go there.(Laughter.)MR. BOYD: Well, she absolutely would not, Your Honor. I mean, Lindsay Earls is -- is a young woman, a freshman at Dartmouth now, who hasn't used drugs. She was drug tested and she passed, and no one has suspected her of using drugs. I'm sure my -- my opposing counsel would attest to that.QUESTION: Can -- can -- doesn't -- don't magnet schools have rules for uniforms and so forth that they're -- they're completely optional? A school district could have two schools, one with -- one with no testing, the other with testing. Then you have a choice.MR. BOYD: I think uniforms are a world apart.561111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MR. BOYD: Well, I -- I think -- no, I don't think that's the reason why. I think --￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9There's not an intrusive blanket search.QUESTION: Well, they're not covered by theFourth Amendment.MR. BOYD: Exactly.QUESTION: I mean, isn't that the problem? MR. BOYD: It is.QUESTION: What do you -- do you say justfrankly to the argument, forget individualized need, forget special need entirely, forget suspicion? We're standing in loco parentis and if we think it's reasonable to do it, we can do it. What's the answer to that101112    argument?13 MR. BOYD: I -- I think the answer to the14 argument is the Fourth Amendment turns on reasonableness.15 It's not a majority rules standard. And I think you have16 to look at the incremental intrusion here, and this is a17 point that I don't think has been made today. But with18 school athletes, they already submit a urine sample.19 QUESTION: That doesn't answer the question.20 The question -- yes, it turns on reasonableness, but what21 Justice Souter's question suggests is that the -- the22 issue is whether it would be reasonable for a parent who's23 concerned about drug use on the part -- on the part of his24 children, to be this intrusive. That is the question.25 MR.BOYD: Foraparenttodoit--I--well,I￼571111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 seethatmytimeisup. MayI--23    seconds.456789QUESTION: Yes.
