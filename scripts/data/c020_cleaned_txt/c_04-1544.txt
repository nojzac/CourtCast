E. PierceMarshall.          Mr. Richland.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. RICHLAND               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. RICHLAND:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          This is a bankruptcy case, but it is abankruptcy case in which the Ninth Circuit has made --come to the extraordinary conclusion that the Federalbankruptcy court has no jurisdiction over the chiefassets of the bankruptcy estate.  That asset, a -- atort cause of action, was to be the main source of thepayment to the creditors.  And the Ninth Circuit cameto this conclusion because it gave a very broadinterpretation of the so-called probate exception toFederal jurisdiction.          As I will explain, the Federal bankruptcyjurisdiction statutes are incompatible with the conceptof having adopted a probate exception to Federaljurisdiction, particularly to Federal bankruptcyjurisdiction.31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Any exception whatever.2 MR. RICHLAND: That's correct, Your Honor.3 There is no exception to that. The -- the statute4 itself is structured in such a way that its5 jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court depends on the6 relationship of the matter to the bankruptcy estate.78 in the --9 which has10 in fact, not the true will and that under the true11 will, the bankruptcy estate would get money, you think12 the bankruptcy court would -- would have jurisdiction13 to probate the will.14 MR. RICHLAND: Yes, Your Honor. Now, the15 question is, of course, that's an attack on a probated16 will, I believe, and I think that this Court's17 jurisprudence also supports the notion that --18 JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. Well, I'm19 willing to -- to move it back. I mean, that's --20 that's even harder for you. But let's assume that the21 will is in probate but has not yet been probated. Do22 you think the bankruptcy court has jurisdiction to23 decide which will is the true will?24 MR. RICHLAND: Well, the -- the bankruptcy25 jurisdiction statute states that --41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-JUSTICE SCALIA:  So if -- if the contentionin the bankruptcy proceeding is that the willbeen probated by the State probate court is,￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes or no.          MR. RICHLAND:  The answer is yes, it does--          JUSTICE SCALIA:  All right.          MR. RICHLAND:  -- and it must have that powerto be able to do so because the bankruptcy jurisdictionstatute states that the court has jurisdiction, in remjurisdiction, exclusive in rem jurisdiction --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What if the rem --          MR. RICHLAND:  -- over all assets of the --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- what if the rem is inanother court before the bankruptcy begins?  What ifthe res is within -- is in another court?          MR. RICHLAND:  Yes, yes, Justice Ginsburg.28 U.S.C., section 1334(e) states the bankruptcy courtshall have exclusive jurisdiction, in rem jurisdiction,over the bankruptcy estate, and that has beeninterpreted by the courts as meaning that it hasparamount jurisdiction in the sense that the normal incustodia legis doctrine does not apply where it is abankruptcy court case.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So even -- even ifproperty is in the custody of another court in theprobate proceeding and the bankruptcy proceeding comeslater, the bankruptcy proceeding would sweep whateverassets are before the probate court into the51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425bankruptcy.          MR. RICHLAND:  That -- that is correct, YourHonor, and there have been courts that have held thatwith respect --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you want to stand on thisposition, Mr. Richland, or do you have a lesserposition --          MR. RICHLAND:  Well, it's certainly not --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that -- that might causeyou to win?  Because --(Laughter.)          MR. RICHLAND:  Well, it certainly is notnecessary, of course, to -- to -- for us to prevail inthis case.  However, I think it is an importantprinciple to interpret the -- the bankruptcyjurisdiction statute, look at the language of thatstatute, and determine what Congress intended fromthat.  And -- and I think it also is a dangerous thingto get into, implying exceptions into that statute.          But -- but let me state this.  Obviously, inthis case we have an action, the -- the in remjurisdiction of the bankruptcy court over the chosenaction, that is -- is miles away from the probate of --of a will.  The particular cause of action involvedhere was an interference with an inter vivos gift.  And61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 I think it's important to realize that that was2 intended to be a gift that would be complete during the3 lifetime of the decedent. That fact means that this4 case really has almost nothing to do with probate or5 probate jurisdiction.6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you did file a7 challenge to the probate of the will, didn't you, in8 Texas?9 MR. RICHLAND: There was a challenge filed to10 the probate of the will originally by the -- the11 brother of the respondent in this case, and eventually12 yes, our client did join that some years later after it13 was first filed. So that would have been an14 alternative.15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And wasn't the ground16 for that that it would be inconsistent with the inter17 vivos trust that you are asserting in the bankruptcy18 court proceeding?19 MR. RICHLAND: No, that was not the case,20 Your Honor. The -- the grounds for that was the belief21 that there had been undue influence with respect to the22 will. But the inter vivos gift claim -- a tortious23 interference with inter vivos gift claim -- that was24 added only many years later in the year 2000. That was25 3 years, 3 and a half years after that same action was71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 pending in the bankruptcy court. And the only reason2 it was raised at that time was that respondent went to3 the Federal court and said -- and interposed the4 probate exception and argued at that time there is no5 jurisdiction here. Therefore, out of an excess of6 caution, our client went to the Texas probate court and7 said, well, I will -- I will make this -- this claim8 here.9 In fact, once there was success in the10 bankruptcy court and the bankruptcy court said, now I11 have made a determination on that claim, our client did12 dismiss that claim and dismissed all affirmative claims13 with respect to the probate estate.14 I think the important thing to realize here,15 with respect to both this particular claim and with16 respect to the bankruptcy jurisdiction statute in17 particular, is that the -- that the breadth of the --18 what that statute does is, it -- it announces that19 rather than having jurisdictional preclusions, there20 will be preclusions based on abstention. It has broad21 abstention provisions in section 1334(c), and indeed22 section 1334(c)(2), which is the mandatory abstention23 --24 JUSTICE BREYER: You like this -- apparently25 you like this argument, although you say you're miles81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 away from probate. Well, if you want to get into that2 argument, I guess the strongest argument against3 keeping it -- for keeping it is bankruptcy4 jurisdictional statutes shouldn't be interpreted5 differently than diversity jurisdiction or any other6 statute, and Markham at least recognizes that there is7 such a thing as the probate exception and that Congress8 implicitly adopted it, just as they did the domestic9 relations exception. Therefore, if we are going to10 find for you on this ground, we'd have to go back and11 overrule that case and a lot of other water that's12 flowed over -- under the bridge or wherever the water13 flows.14 (Laughter.)15 JUSTICE BREYER: And we ought to take what's16 given as given, whatever the true meaning of17 ecclesiastical courts having jurisdiction over certain18 probate matters or not in the 18th century.19 MR. RICHLAND: Well, of course, if one looks20 at 1334(c)(2), one sees that Congress itself21 contemplated that there would bankruptcy jurisdiction22 under circumstances where there was no diversity23 jurisdiction and when there was no Federal question24 jurisdiction. So it -- it certainly is true that25 rolled into the whole notion of mandatory abstention is91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 the possibility that the bankruptcy court will have2 before it3 diversity45 thing about diversity jurisdiction, that Congress6 contemplated that there would be diversity jurisdiction7 where there was no bankruptcy jurisdiction and nomatters over which there would be nojurisdiction.JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you could say the same8 Federal question jurisdiction. I mean, I don't see9 what that proves.10 MR. RICHLAND: Well, excuse me, Justice11 Scalia, but what I think it does prove is that when12 Congress enacted in 1978 the rather comprehensive13 change that it made to the bankruptcy statutes, that it14 intended to exercise as broad a jurisdiction as15 possible so that the bankruptcy courts would be able to16 control the bankruptcy estate and make determinations17 as to how the creditors could best be protected.18 Let me -- let -- yes. I'm sorry.19 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm just saying no more so20 than -- than when Congress enacted diversity21 jurisdiction. It intended it to apply, you know,22 uniformly.23 MR. RICHLAND: To -- to apply very broadly24 according to its terms.25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. RICHLAND: And, of course, this Court in2 -- first in Lear v. Armstrong said, yes, this applies3 very broadly. However, there is an exception and the4 exception is purely the probate of a will -- the5 probate of a will and that alone. And this Court has6 really hewn very closely to that very narrow limitation7 since that point in time.8 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's true.9 MR. RICHLAND: I do think that it's10 important, however, to realize that if one examines11 this Court's probate exception jurisdiction over the12 years, it has consistently determined that the -- the13 narrowness of that exception must be confirmed, and as14 late as the Markham case, this Court has held that --15 that Federal courts have jurisdiction to decide all16 kinds of issues with respect to wills, all kinds of17 issues with respect to trusts. Certainly this Court18 has said that it can determine questions such as how to19 interpret the provision of a will. It has even held20 that Federal courts can determine whether a will is21 invalid. It can make that determination if the --22 JUSTICE SOUTER: But none -- none of this has23 to be done for you to win this case, does it?24 MR. RICHLAND: You are absolutely correct.25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then I -- I wish we'd stick111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425to this case.          MR. RICHLAND:  Well, I'm happy to do that,Your Honor.  This case is an outlier.  I believe thatis true.  This case is so far from the potential of anyprobate exception that, although I felt that it wasimportant to be able to explicate the -- the principlesinvolved here, I --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You want to look moderate.          MR. RICHLAND:  Oh --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Does this case involveanything more than the enforcement of an in personamtort judgment if you are to win?          MR. RICHLAND:  It -- it would not.  That isall that's involved.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it did involve, atleast the bankruptcy court thought, the judgmentinvalidating the inter vivos trust.  Was that necessaryto the decision?  Or am I -- correct me if I'm --          MR. RICHLAND:  I -- I don't believe --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- correct me if I'm wrongabout that.          MR. RICHLAND:  That is -- that is incorrect,Justice Kennedy.  It did not invalidate the inter vivostrust.  What it held was that as part of the evidencethat it was considering, in terms of the intent, the121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425donative intent, that one portion of that inter vivostrust, an amendment to it, had been forged, but it didnot invalidate it.  In fact, it -- it expressly heldthat the -- the inter vivos trust is valid, and thatwas a basis for its conclusion that, indeed, thisparticular claim was also valid.  This claim was acause of action for interference with an inter vivosgift.          JUSTICE BREYER:  I guess what you're going tohear in 5-10 minutes --          MR. RICHLAND:  Yes.          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- you might as well dealwith it now --          MR. RICHLAND:  Yes.  Why not?          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- is that the inter vivos-- a -- a claim for a -- the Texas tort of interferencewith inter vivos gift, according to Texas law, must bebrought at the time of the probate proceeding.  And forthat reason, it is bound up with probate, and for thatreason, they didn't have jurisdiction.          MR. RICHLAND:  Well, A -- A, we do notinterpret Texas law as so providing.          JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now, let'ssuppose you're --MR. RICHLAND: But -- but assuming -- 131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- suppose they're rightabout their interpretation.          MR. RICHLAND:  Assuming that they're rightfor that -- by their interpretation, this Court hasrepeatedly said that it -- that a -- a State courtcannot -- by simply assigning matters that otherwisewould be heard by Federal courts to the probate court,that it can, in effect, shield those --          JUSTICE BREYER:  And the strongest case foryou on that is?          MR. RICHLAND:  Oh, I think Hess --          JUSTICE BREYER:  You said this Court hasrepeatedly said.  So what --          MR. RICHLAND:  Said it over and over, butHess v. Reynolds from 1885, which says that merely theconvenience of a -- a State court to, you know, assignmatters to -- to its probate court.  That was a case inwhich a debt --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But -- but this caseinvolves a lot more than convenience.  It involves asubstantial amount of assets that is either going topass to one person under probate or is not going to beavailable for passing to that person because of theinter vivos gift.  That seems to be more closelyrelated to the core probate matters.141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. RICHLAND: Well in fact, Chief Justice2 Roberts, I don't believe that's the case. Nothing3 passed by way of probate in this case. The -- there4 were no assets in the probate. What happened here was5 that all of the assets -- and the record shows this,6 and I don't believe it's -- that there is any dispute7 here. All of the assets had passed to the respondent8 in this case before the will and the trust were9 actually submitted to the probate court.10 Once again, this is a tort claim and it's a11 tort claim only for an interference. If those assets12 had never gone to respondent in this case, there would,13 nevertheless, still be a good tort claim. If, for14 example, those assets had been passed to respondent's15 child or to another brother, the interference itself --16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Richland --17 MR. RICHLAND: Excuse me, Justice --18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- what seems to me to be19 involved here is what is not uncommon in our Federal20 system, that is, two proceedings, both dealing with the21 same or closely related subject matter. It is not22 infrequent that you have parallel proceedings in23 Federal court and State court, and then the one that24 gets finished first -- that judgment is binding on the25 other. And as I understand it, the probate proceeding151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425concluded first before the district judge reviewed thebankruptcy judge's opinion.          MR. RICHLAND:  Justice Ginsburg, you're quitecorrect that issues -- that -- that the principles ofpreclusion ordinarily would deal with the kinds ofissues here, and -- and we think that that -- those --that should be what governs this case.          But I don't believe that it is correct to saythat the probate court judgment preceded that of thebankruptcy court.  The bankruptcy court judgment camefirst.  A year later the probate court judgment then --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, I'm -- I'm assuming-- and correct me if I'm wrong about this -- that thebankruptcy court makes a proposed opinion.  It doesn'tbecome a binding opinion until it's affirmed by thedistrict court.          MR. RICHLAND:  Unless it's a core matter.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.          MR. RICHLAND:  And here we claim that it is acore matter.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, if it isn't a corematter.  I think you lost on that in the districtcourt.          MR. RICHLAND:  If it isn't a core matter,then in any event the district court here held that161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 there was no preclusion, and it held it for a number of2 reasons.3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was not reviewed4 by the Ninth Circuit.5 MR. RICHLAND: That's correct. That was not6 reviewed by the Ninth Circuit. But that would be the7 -- the appropriate manner of review.8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That would -- that would9 be the -- if you -- if you're correct about the limits10 of the probate exception, that issue would be open for11 review by 1213 Ginsburg. 1415 rebuttal. 161718the Ninth Circuit.MR.

RICHLAND:  Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Ms. Maynard.  ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD   ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER1920212223 please 2425 of theAS   MS. MAYNARD:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itthe Court:   Two independent principles require reversalNinth Circuit's decision.171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 First, the probate exception to Federal2 jurisdiction is a will-specific rule and it does not3 apply beyond the context of wills to other types of4 will substitutes like inter vivos trusts.5 Second, even with respect to wills, it is a6 very narrow exception that is no bar to deciding the7 rights to a decedent's estate, construing a will, or8 determining the testator's intent.9 There are only three things under this10 Court's precedent that a Federal court cannot do. The11 first is to probate a will, that is, to determine the12 formal key requisites of the validity of a will;13 second, to annul an already probated will; and three,14 to take in rem jurisdiction over a res over which a15 State court has already taken in rem jurisdiction. But16 that is it, and none of those are applicable here.17 The justifications for the probate exception18 do not apply to will substitutes. The -- the probate19 exception is based on the peculiar nature of a will,20 that is, that unlike inter vivos trusts, unlike the21 current modern will substitutes, a will is not valid --22 it has no legal effect. This Court's opinions have23 said that on several occasions -- unless it is24 probated. Therefore, a will must be probated even if25 there is no dispute about its validity before any title181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 can pass. Not so with trusts. In fact, that is the2 whole point that people engage in the modern world3 substitutes is to avoid the necessity to go to the4 probate court in order to have their assets passed to5 their heirs.6 The second ground for this Court's probate7 exception is a historical one based on the Court's8 understanding of the limits of the equity courts in9 England. Whatever the merit of that historical10 analysis, it has no application to trusts, which have11 always been the problems of equity.12 The Federal Government has a strong interest13 in the Court not expanding the Federal exception -- the14 -- the probate exception to Federal jurisdiction,15 particularly in the sweeping manner that the Ninth16 Circuit has done. It is not uncommon for the tax17 consequences of an estate planning instrument, such as18 a trust, to turn on whether or not the trust is valid19 or invalid. And the Congress has provided Federal20 jurisdiction to the United States to bring its -- most21 of its disputes in the Federal court system.22 Secondly, more generally, Congress has23 determined what types of disputes should be in the24 Federal courts and has passed broad statutes providing25 the courts with Federal jurisdiction that the courts191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 have an obligation to exercise, if it exists.2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Except if it's a will3 -- will-specific. In other words, you -- it seems to4 me you're in for a penny and in for a pound. You5 recognize the existence of this exception in certain6 cases, and then you argue against it by saying, well,7 Congress wrote the statutes broadly. The latter8 argument disproves your first point.9 MS. MAYNARD: I don't believe it does, and10 perhaps I'm -- I'm -- I wasn't making clear what my11 argument is. The Court has adopted a very narrow12 probate exception with respect to the probating of the13 will and annulling a probated will, but that is it.14 And that analysis was based on a -- the historical --15 the Court's view of the historical limits of courts of16 equity and therefore was an interpretation of the17 Federal diversity statute. Under the logic of18 Ankenbrandt, one can assume -- one may -- the Court may19 assume that's carried forward.20 But certainly that -- for the reasons I've21 said, that rationale, those justifications, for that22 narrow will rule do not apply to trusts, which have23 always been the province of equity, and especially24 given the questionable historical underpinnings of the25 exception, even the narrow exception that does appear201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 to exist, there's no justification for expanding that2 beyond its current confines.3 As this Court recognized in Ankenbrandt, the4 lower courts had taken the -- the so-called domestic5 relations exception beyond this Court's very narrow6 limits, and this Court brought -- brought it back to7 its origins. And -- and the Federal Government8 believes that -- that the same would be appropriate9 here with respect to the probate exception.10 JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Maynard, it's my11 understanding that a lot of this law developed out of12 the dicta in the Markham case. Do you think the dicta13 in the Markham case was an accurate description of the14 prior history?15 MS. MAYNARD: It was probably not a very16 precise history, Justice Stevens. I do think one can17 read Markham, however, especially if one reads it in18 the context of the cases it cites for its principles,19 to hold what we are saying now, which is that Federal20 courts have no jurisdiction over pure probate matters,21 that is, no jurisdiction to probate a will. And its22 interference language, I believe, was its statement of23 the in rem v. in rem jurisdiction principle, which in24 fact isn't really a probate jurisdiction principle at25 all.211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: What do you mean by no2 jurisdiction to probate a will? Could -- could -- does3 that exclude the possibility of a bankruptcy court4 deciding for itself where there are contested wills5 that in its in view the -- the right -- the valid will6 is a certain one and that, therefore, the bankruptcy7 estate includes this fund or doesn't include this fund?8 Is that probating the will?9 MS. MAYNARD: The -- the United States hasn't10 taken a position on the broader argument about whether11 or not the --12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if that isn't13 probating a will, the exception for probating a will14 doesn't -- doesn't amount to a hill of beans, does it?15MS. MAYNARD:  If -- if the question you'reis what does it mean to probate a will --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.MS. MAYNARD:  -- the -- the probate of a will16 asking me 171819 requires determining that it has the appropriate formal20 prerequisites, which in most States is appropriate21 number of signatures that the testator was coherent,22 competent to make a will and that there was no undue23 influence.24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, and that this is --25 that this is the -- the last will and testament and221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that there is not some other one.          MS. MAYNARD:  That's true, yes, that there'sno competing will.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  Now, can -- can thebankruptcy court determine that, that the -- that theproper will and testament of this decedent is this one? We're not probating it.  No, no.          MS. MAYNARD:  The --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  We don't pretend to probateit.  We're just saying that this happens to be the truewill and testament.          MS. MAYNARD:  It's conceivable that if thatdetermination went to a -- an element of, for example,a tort claim and that the person were not -- were notseeking to take under the will, it is possible.  ThisCourt's precedent doesn't address that precisequestion.  The United States hasn't taken a position onwhether or not bankruptcy jurisdiction, ala the logicin Ankenbrandt, encompasses the narrow probateexception that we concede exists because it's notnecessary to decide this case.  The -- the petitioner'sclaim is far beyond anything that the probate exceptionhas ever applied to.          The respondent suggests that States have anoverriding interest in having one forum resolve all231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 probate-related disputes. This Court has repeatedly,2 for over 150 years, rejected that exact proposition --3 Justice Breyer, Payne v. Hook, Hess v. Reynolds,4 McClellan v. Carland, which this Court cited last term5 in Exxon Mobil -- and it was the basis of Markham's6 reversal of the Ninth Circuit decision that the Federal7 jurisdiction is not determined by the scope and extent8 of the State's decisions with respect to where to send9 its own citizens with respect to disputes that don't10 otherwise have a basis for Federal jurisdiction. The11 only place in this --1213 one point14 but there15 the extent of the probate exception. And so I take it16 that your -- what you began -- what you began with is17 -- I wrote them down. That's it?18 MS. MAYNARD: That's what the United States19 believes the limit of the exception is, and the -- let20 me be clear. The United States has a strong interest21 in having this Court clarify the exception. That is22 where the confusion lies in the court of appeals. That23 is where the United States feels like its interests are24 at risk. So although the petitioner's claim is well25 outside the exception, the United States' interests lie241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Maynard, you said atit's not necessary for you to decide this,is vast confusion in the lower courts about￼1 in having the Court clear up the confusion and reject2 the sweeping and expansive view of the probate3 exception that the Ninth Circuit has announced.4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And in addition to5 Markham, what other case of this Court do you think6 spells out the proper bounds?7 MS. MAYNARD: I -- I think the -- Waterman8 has a -- has a good summary of the -- of the limits. I9 think even the two cases on which the respondent10 principally rely, Sutton and O'Callaghan, lay out the11 proper scope of the rule. Those -- both of those cases12 involved a claim that depended on having a will that13 had been probated declared invalid, and that is within14 the narrow confines of the exception. But it is a15 will-specific rule.16 The -- and, Justice Stevens, back to your17 question. The one thing about Markham is that there's18 no general interference principle, and that's where the19 --20 JUSTICE STEVENS: You know there are a lot of21 scholars who think that Markham is the source of most22 of the confusion, and so that's why I was asking23 whether you think we should -- to clear up, which24 you're suggesting we should do, we should reexamine25 some of that dicta or we should just stick to the251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425holding.          MS.

I think the holding in Markham is CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  With -- with newour own?(Laughter.) MS. MAYNARD:  It will probably be necessary,rule on the case, to make some holding aboutscope of the exception is, Your Honor.  Andto -- towhat thethe -- the -- but, Justice Stevens, the --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  We could just say whateverits scope is it ain't this.  I mean, couldn't we dothat?          MS. MAYNARD:  The Court certainly couldresolve it that way, Your Honor.          But, Justice Stevens, the -- the -- Markham,I do think, makes clear what interference is and is notby its holding.  And on page 494 of Markham, it says,where the final judgment does not undertake tointerfere with the State court's possession, save tothe extent that the State court is bound by thejudgment to recognize the right adjudicated by theFederal court.  So that is not the type of interference261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that runs 23 Maynard. 4afoul of the rule.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Ms.     ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. BRUNSTAD:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itMr. Brunstad.ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. ERIC BRUNSTAD, JR.5 6 78 please the Court:9 The probate exception exists precisely to10 prevent what happened in this case, a Federal court11 enjoining ongoing probate proceedings in the middle of12 a probate trial, a Federal court determining that the13 decedent's estate plan was invalid, a Federal court's14 reallocation through a damage claim of the decedent's15 assets, contrary to the value of the estate plan, a16 Federal court's creation of a novel cause of action --17 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, is it -- is it18 correct -- I just want to be sure I follow you -- that19 they determined that the estate plan was invalid?20 MR. BRUNSTAD: Correct, Justice Stevens. At21 petition appendix 123 to 126, the district court22 determined that the -- that J. Howard's living trust23 was a forgery, that there were pages that were24 substituted --25 JUSTICE BREYER: But this is all -- this has271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 nothing -- I mean, I -- you have the total differently2 -- different understanding than I do of this case, and3 I did read Judge Carter's opinion. I thought that case4 simply held that because your clients had interfered5 with an effort by J. Howard to give quite a few6 millions of dollars to Vickie Marshall -- because of7 that interference, they had committed the tort of inter8 vivos interference with a gift, and they had to pay9 damages.10 Now, they said a lot of things by way of what11 the evidence was. Indeed, they did say, as you point12 out, that your clients forged three pages of the will.13 But that was simply evidence of their bad intent, and14 it did not invalidate anything in the probate15 proceeding, as I read it.16 Now, what have I said that's not right?17 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Breyer, the answer to18 your question, I think, depends upon the fact that19 opposing counsel has studiously avoided actually20 revealing what his claim is. I think we have to focus21 on the -- her exact claim. As a matter of fact and as22 a matter of law, she did not prevail --23 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not interested24 he said. I'm interested in what Judge Carter25 MR. BRUNSTAD: Correct, Your Honor.281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  1-in whatsaid --Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: -- because that, it2 me, is -- and what is it that Judge Carter did3 wrong in this respect?4 MR. BRUNSTAD: Judge -- Judge Carter5 understood quite clearly that in order for her6 proceed as a matter of fact and as a matter of7 had to invalidate her living trust. And let me explain8 why that was so.9 That was so because her claim is that J.10 Howard intended to give her a catchall trust. The11 argument is that Pierce blocked the catchall trust from12 being funded by rendering the living trust irrevocable13 in July of 1994. Judge Carter found that the catchall14 trust was drafted in December of 1994.15 She can only have a claim -- now, all of J.16 Howard's assets were in the living trust. She can only17 have a claim -- the catchall trust could only have been18 funded or prevented from being funded if the living19 trust was, in fact, validly rendered irrevocable. To20 prevent -- to -- to counter that, she says, no, the21 living trust was invalid. As a matter of fact, she can22 have no claim unless the living trust is rendered23 invalid. Judge Carter understood that and he expressly24 concluded that it was a forgery.25 Now rendering--291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-seems tothat wasclaim tolaw, he￼1 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't -- isn't it the case2 that she can have her claim and she can prove her3 claim, but she may not be able to collect the judgment4 unless the living trust is invalid? But that's not5 what we're litigating here, is it?6 MR. BRUNSTAD: Your Honor, as a matter of7 law, she cannot have her claim because the two cases we8 rely on, Neill v. Yett and Thompson v. Deloitte, the9 two Texas cases, establish as a predicate to any10 tortious interference claim, she must demonstrate that11 the estate plan, the living trust, was invalid as a12 matter of13 Texas law14 15Texas law.  And that is exclusively underfor the Texas probate court to decide.Now --JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why does she have to show16 that is invalid as distinct from showing that another17 trust, favorable to her, was not created and it was not18 created because of the tortious conduct of your client?19 MR. BRUNSTAD: Because, Justice Souter, under20 Texas law when the -- the probate court determines the21 validity of an estate plan, it forecloses, as a matter22 of law, all expectancies contrary to those that are23 part of the estate plan.24 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let me -- let me stop25 you there because this is something I didn't understand301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425in the brief.  You speak of the Texas probate courtdetermining the validity of an estate plan.          MR. BRUNSTAD:  Correct.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  I take it the Texas probatecourt determined the validity of a will here.          MR. BRUNSTAD:  Correct.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  It determined the validityof -- of a pourover trust.  Is that correct?          MR. BRUNSTAD:  Yes, Your Honor, it did.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  All right.          MR. BRUNSTAD:  The living trust.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  All right.          Isn't it the case that the two Texasdeterminations can be respected and still, in theFederal court, enter a judgment for tort liabilityagainst your client?          MR. BRUNSTAD:  No, Justice Souter, and thereason why is because her cause of action is a Statelaw cause of action, and under Texas law, putting asidethe fact that no Texas court has ever recognized acause of action for tortious interference --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  That's in -- you may beright on that, but that's not what -- what we're herefor.MR. BRUNSTAD: Correct. Putting that aside, 311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 under Texas law -- and the Deloitte case and the Neill2 v. Yett case conclusively established this, and there's3 no contrary decisions in Texas -- that once the probate4 court determines an estate plan is valid, it5 conclusively determines the universe of persons with6 legitimate expectancies.7 JUSTICE SOUTER: But when you speak of estate8 plan, you are -- you seem to be talking in global9 terms; i.e., that there could have been no other10 disposition of assets by the decedent or on behalf of11 the decedent except those which the Texas court is12 recognizing, the trust, the will. Is that what the13 Texas court does, or does the Texas court say, the will14 is good, the trust is good?15 MR. BRUNSTAD: The Texas courts have16 conveniently described for us Justice -- Justice Souter17 --18 JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, is it19 preclusive of everything else? That's what I'm getting20 at.21 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, exactly so, Justice22 Souter. And in the Thompson case itself, the -- the23 Texas court says, when the probate court admitted the24 1989 will to probate, it necessarily found that Mr.25 Thompson signed the will with testamentary capacity and321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that it reflected his intent, was not the result ofcoercion or under influence, and was valid.  And thecourt continued, as a matter of law, the final probatecourt judgment bars any claim that appellees tortiouslyinterfered with any inheritance--          JUSTICE BREYER:  That -- that sounds tome like a matter of preemption, but -- but -- or notpreemption but, you know, res judicata.          But just out of curiosity or -- because Ithink it is relevant, did the Texas probate court havein front of it the documents among the lawyers that thedistrict judge, Judge Carter, relied upon in showingthat there was an intent to create the catchall trust?--MR. BRUNSTAD:  Yes, Justice Breyer.  EverythingJUSTICE BREYER:  It had all those documents.          MR. BRUNSTAD:  Yes, Justice Breyer.Everything the district court had and more was examined,adjudicated in the 5-and-a-half-month jury trial in theTexas probate court exhaustively.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So why isn't that, asJustice Breyer prefaced his question, an issue ofpreclusion rather than, as you frame it, an issue ofjurisdiction?MR. BRUNSTAD: Chief Justice Roberts, the 331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 probate exception has always been jurisdictional, and2 the reason why it can't be subsumed by res judicata or3 collateral estoppel -- we believe we win on those4 grounds, but the reason why the probate exception can't5 be subsumed within those doctrines is because it6 applies even before you have a State court judgment.7 It prevents a Federal court from determining an estate8 plan from being invalidated --9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why should it? The10 probate exception is court-created. Congress passed no11 law that said it. Congress gave the Federal courts12 jurisdiction in certain categories of cases and13 expected them to exercise that jurisdiction. Since our14 jurisdiction is statutory and the probate exception was15 made up by the courts, shouldn't we interpret it as16 narrowly as possible, perhaps even do away with it17 because it lacks any statutory basis?18 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Ginsburg, the probate19 exception, like the domestic relations exception, is20 best conceived as a presumption that when Congress21 establishes a font of Federal jurisdiction, it does not22 intend that jurisdiction to be extended to interfere23 with probate proceedings. That is properly a24 jurisdictional doctrine in this case because it is25 never appropriate for a bankruptcy court to invalidate341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 or validate a will and -- or an estate plan. And that2 is a necessary element of Vickie's claim.3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you say -- you say an4 -- an estate plan. Most people would think insurance5 policies are part of their estate plan, and if it's6 alleged that there was a fraudulent alteration of the7 beneficiary designation in the insurance policies, is8 that within the Texas probate court jurisdiction?9 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Kennedy, no. Here we10 have -- when I say estate plan, I mean the living trust11 and the will operating together.12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there's -- there's a13 further irony here in that revocable trusts are always14 promoted on the grounds that it keeps us out of15 probate. And now you're -- you're insisting that it16 has to be in probate.17 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, Justice Kennedy, the18 living trust here did two things that a will does. It19 provided for the succession of J. Howard's property20 upon his death, and it provided for the payment of his21 last -- last illness expenses and his -- his debts. It22 is quintessentially a will substitute in the sense that23 it also provides for the succession of his property.24 In this case --25 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it isn't probated. 351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 That's -- it is, indeed, a will substitute. The whole2 purpose of doing it is to avoid probate.3 MR. BRUNSTAD: But in this case, Justice4 Scalia, the will and the -- the living trust acted5 together. The probate court had exclusive jurisdiction6 over both of them and the challenges to them. Vickie7 challenged the living trust, even before J. Howard8 died. Those proceedings continued on in the probate9 court, and --10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but as Justice Breyer11 indicated, can't you just, for purposes of12 understanding the cause of action as asserted by Vickie13 Marshall here, just say, we will assume the trust is14 valid, we will assume the will is valid? All we're15 saying was that there's a tort and he's going to be16 liable to us in tort.17 MR. BRUNSTAD: Because, Justice Kennedy,18 again, a critical element of her cause of action is19 the invalidity of the trust as a matter of fact and20 law.2122 say, what23 matter, a24 draw it up so I can give gifts to her, the increase in25 the value of my property during the 13 months we're361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-JUSTICE BREYER:  Why?  Why?  Why?  That is tothe finding is, is that there was a differentcatchall trust, and he told the lawyers, go￼1 married, do it, and they never did it. Now, that seems2 to have nothing whatsoever to do with the GRAT trust or3 with the will. It just happens that those are4 evidentiary, what went on there, of what likely5 happened with the catchall trust.6 So I don't see why those are necessary. I7 don't see why they're more than evidentiary, and I8 don't see whether or not those are barred, those9 particular facts have anything to do with this, as far10 as jurisdiction is concerned.11 Now, explain to me why I'm wrong.12 MR. BRUNSTAD: Certainly, Justice Breyer.13 First of all, Texas has the right to prescribe the14 elements of its own causes of action, and under Texas15 law, her cause of action depends upon two critical16 things, a legitimate expectancy J. Howard intended to17 do this for her, and the second, tortious conduct of18 some kind. Her claim -- she tries to meet those two19 critical elements by showing two things. One, that J.20 Howard intended to give me this -- this gift in the21 form of this -- this trust, and that it was tortiously22 interfered with because the living trust was rendered23 irrevocable.24 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's just one of the25 things.371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. BRUNSTAD: But it's --2 JUSTICE BREYER: Among other things that went3 on were they hired private detectives to go after4 her, to keep her from the bed. I mean, you've read that5 opinion and there are like about 30 things in there. And6 I grant you that one of those things is the fact that7 three pages of the living trust, according to the judge,8 were created after the event of that trust and slipped9 in without his knowledge. I mean, it's quite a story.10 MR. BRUNSTAD: Of course, Your Honor --11 JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and so I -- but as I12 read it, there were many, many, many things involved13 here, and this is just one of them. So how can Texas14 say that you have to prove this particular one as -- as15 opposed to proving a lot of others?16 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Breyer, of course, as17 an aside, we went to great pains in the Ninth Circuit18 to demonstrate why all those findings were clearly19 erroneous and not based on the evidence.20 But assuming them to be so, which we dispute,21 again, looking at her claim, that is the critical22 element of her claim. If, in fact, there -- if, in23 fact, the living trust was made revocable, then at any24 point in time, he could have funded, if -- if he had it25 as revocable until his death, he could have funded her381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 gift that she alleges and she would have no damage2 claim. It is because of the trust becoming irrevocable3 that he was prevented from doing it. That is her4 claim.56 it's been7 from this8 9JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes, but her claim is assumemade irrevocable.  I just want some moneyguy.MR. BRUNSTAD:  Correct.JUSTICE SOUTER: That's all she's saying, as 10 I understand it. She -- she can -- as I understand her11 cause of action, it can proceed on the assumption the12 will is valid, the -- the trust is valid. Just give me13 the money that I would have had.14 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Souter, as a matter of15 Texas law, she cannot establish a legitimate16 expectancy. Again, once the probate court -- and the17 probate court alone has the right to determine the18 validity of an estate plan. Once the probate court has19 determined that as a matter of Texas law, all claims20 about expectancies contrary to those provided in the --21 in the plan are foreclosed. That's the Thompson case22 and the Neill case.23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're arguing a24 preclusion question, and if the Ninth Circuit thought25 it had jurisdiction, it could have tested what you say391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 about Texas law. There's no finding in this record of2 what Texas law is other than what you have just told3 us, and perhaps you're right and perhaps you're not.4 But the Ninth Circuit said the Federal door is closed5 to this probate exception, and that's what we're here6 to decide.7 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Ginsburg, preclusion8 will also not work. Res judicata and collateral9 estoppel will also not work because the parties in the10 Federal proceeding are merely a subset of the parties11 in the probate court. The probate court's judgment is12 unique because it has a binding-against-the-world13 effect. Federal courts cannot pull chunks of the14 critical issues into the Federal court because doing15 so creates an inconsistency of judgments potentially.16 Where the Federal court only has part of the parties17 before it, the Federal court has all -- the probate18 court has all the parties before it. The probate19 court's judgment is binding against the world --20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think it -- it may be21 that there's another side to that story. For example,22 I think the bankruptcy court was heard from first.23 Arguably, that's binding on the Texas court. Whether24 the bankruptcy court was right or wrong, it would get25 full faith and credit. That's one argument.401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 Another is perhaps you can explain to me how2 this all started because I thought that it was a claim3 made against her in the bankruptcy court for4 defamation. Then the claim that she asserts is a5 compulsory counterclaim. She has to make it there or6 she'll lose it.7 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Ginsburg, the8 claim was not a compulsory counterclaim. The action9 which was -- that Pierce commenced in the -- in the10 bankruptcy court was merely to ask the bankruptcy court11 to decide that if he had a debt against -- if he had a12 claim against her she owed him money, it would be13 nondischargeable in bankruptcy. She then used that14 opportunity to pursue this tortious interference claim15 against Pierce that she was already pursuing in the16 probate court. So because there was a prior pending17 proceeding where she had made the claim --18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I -- I didn't understand19 the pleading to say if I have a claim, it would be20 nondischargeable. I thought he made a claim. He made21 -- filed a claim for defamation in the bankruptcy22 proceeding.23 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Ginsburg, Pierce did24 not ask the bankruptcy court to decide the claim. He25 only -- he only asked for the bankruptcy court to411111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425decide whether it was nondischargeable or not.          But even so -- even so, I think it'simportant to recognize --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  He would have to say Ihave a claim because the bankruptcy court is not goingto decide a hypothetical if he has a claim.  He has toat least assert I have a claim.          MR. BRUNSTAD:  But bankruptcy judges do that,Justice Ginsburg.  They decide only thenondischargeability aspect of claims rather than theclaims themselves.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It has to be a real claim. It can't be if I have a claim.          MR. BRUNSTAD:  No, Justice Ginsburg, becausethe nondischargeability jurisdiction in bankruptcy isunique.  You allow the claim to be determined in aproper court of competent jurisdiction, and then thebankruptcy court decides whether it's nondischargeableor not.  That's how it should proceed particularlywhere, as here, her claim requires, as -- in order forit to -- to be valid, to determine the validity ornonvalidity of J. Howard's estate plan.          Now, the United States --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, I don't -- Idon't see how the interference with the probate court421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that you're articulating is any greater than the2 interference in Markham. In Markham, it was a decision3 by a Federal court that these claimants were not4 going to claim under the will. Why is -- isn't that5 even greater than the interference you're complaining6 of?7 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Chief Justice Roberts.8 You can readily divide the Court's precedents into two9 categories, those where there was impermissible10 interference and therefore no jurisdiction, and those11 where there isn't. On the impermissible interference12 side, you13 determine14 Gaines v.15 determine1617 will? 181920 stretching the probate concept from determining whether21 the will is valid or invalid and who inherits under the22 will to also determining what goes into the probate23 estate, that is, the insurance policies, the trust, and24 so forth. That to me is -- is something quite25 different from probating a will.431111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-have a case like Federal court cannotthe validity of an estate plan, Armstrong,Chew.

BRUNSTAD: Justice Scalia, the probate2 exception protects the integrity of the succession3 process. If the documents you're looking at deal with4 the succession of the property, as the living trust and5 will do in this case, it is encompassed within the6 probate exception in the Sutton case --7 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I don't -- I don't see8 your -- your logic there. Of course, it protects the9 succession process, but it does not follow that10 everything that implicates a succession process falls11 within the probate exception.12 MR. BRUNSTAD: Correct. Correct, Justice13 Souter. But here the succession was determined under14 the living trust, and in Sutton v. English, that's15 exactly the same scenario. Moses Hubbard left a --16 JUSTICE SOUTER: If -- if there had been a17 joint bank account, the succession would have been18 determined based on the validity of the joint bank19 account, and that certainly wouldn't have fallen within20 the probate exception.21 MR. BRUNSTAD: Because the joint -- where you22 have the equivalent of tenancies in the entirety, I'd23 say that's a separate issue.24 Here, however, the living trust performed all25 the functions of a traditional will, unlike a joint441111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 bank account. In the Sutton case, you had both a will2 and a trust, just like in this case. There, Moses3 Hubbard left a will and a trust. Mary Jane Hubbard4 enjoyed the benefits of the trust for her life.5 JUSTICE SOUTER: Does -- does Texas law6 provide that a -- a living trust must be executed and7 administered with the formalities of a will?8 MR. BRUNSTAD: Not quite the same, Justice9 Souter. Not quite the same.10 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then -- then you have to get11 beyond our probate exception cases to cover the living12 trust.13 MR. BRUNSTAD: But in Sutton v. English,14 there was both a will and a trust, exactly the same as15 here. The plaintiffs were just going after the16 property. We just want the assets. We're saying we're17 not touching the trust and the will. This Court held18 -- this Court held, wait a minute. Only the Texas19 probate courts may determine whether these instruments20 are valid 2122 she's not23 She's asserting an in personam claim against the24 individual. Correct?or not.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, but she's not --even going after the assets in this case.25 MR. BRUNSTAD: She is, but that's exactly the 451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 same as Broderick's Will, Chief Justice Roberts, an in2 personam claim against the beneficiaries of the3 allegedly invalid estate plan to impose a constructive4 trust on them to get the money. No matter how you dice5 it or slice it in this case, she is doing an end run6 around the probate proceeding.7 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't think they're going8 to impose a constructive trust, are they? All -- all9 they're going to say is pay her the money.10 MR. BRUNSTAD: But why are they going to say11 pay her the money?12 JUSTICE BREYER: They're going to say it13 because they make a finding that through a whole14 variety of various devices, all of which were listed,15 that J. Howard, who wanted to give her money through16 something called the catchall trust was prevented in17 about 15 ways. And even if you're right that there's a18 Texas finding that those three pages weren't slipped19 in, well, how do we know? Maybe it was a valid GRAT20 trust, but if only they hadn't tried to isolate J.21 Howard from contact with her, J. Howard would have22 figured out what had happened before he died and he23 would have told his lawyers, hey, cut this out. Do24 what I want. Revoke it. But all that is just25 hypothetical. I'm just using that to show you why I 461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 think this is evidentiary not a matter of what the2 elements of the crime are -- or the elements of the3 tort are.4 MR. BRUNSTAD: What's not evidentiary,5 Justice Breyer, is the fact that in order to prove a6 legitimate expectancy, she must establish that the7 validated estate plan is in fact invalid. And under8 Texas law, that can only be done in the probate court.9 JUSTICE BREYER: What's the cite on that that10 I -- that I need for --11 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, in our brief we cite to12 many, many cases, Your Honor. I would -- I would13 specifically refer you to --14 JUSTICE BREYER: You're saying you can't15 bring an inter vivos trust -- an inter vivos --16 interference with an inter vivos gift action in Texas17 unless you show that a will, for example, is invalid.18 MR. BRUNSTAD: That's correct, Your Honor,19 and those are the Neill v. Yett and the Thompson --20 Thompson v. Deloitte cases, which I was reading to21 before. And the Court said as a matter of law, the22 final probate court judgment bars any claim that23 appellees tortiously interfered with any inheritance24 expectancy because, in light of the final invalid25 probate court judgment, appellant has --471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that -- but that's resjudicata.  I mean, that -- that isn't necessarily a --an application of -- of any probate exception.          MR. BRUNSTAD:  Justice Scalia, it is not resjudicata for the following reason.  Not only may aFederal court notafter the probateprobate court has          JUSTICEdoesn't say that.determine the validity or invaliditycourt, it may not do so before thehad a chance --SCALIA:  You say that, but that case          MR. BRUNSTAD:  That case doesn't say that.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  What -- what case do youhave that says that?          MR. BRUNSTAD:  The cases -- there is nospecific case where someone has tried to litigate atortious interference claim in Federal court before theprobate court has had -- has had its say.          Under Texas law, however, because of thepreclusive effect of that determination, Vickie wouldbe able to come to the probate court and say, look, J.Howard intended to give me this.  It's a finding ofintent.  That's preclusive on the probate court.  Theprobate court would be perhaps prohibited from saying,oh, I can't determine under -- that the valid estateplan gives the intent to somebody else.481111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: But the mere fact that you2 have jurisdiction to say something does not mean that3 if -- if some other court says the same thing first,4 you won't be bound by that.5 MR. BRUNSTAD: The problem, though, Justice6 Scalia, is that the probate court is supposed to make7 that finding in a judgment good against the world. But8 all of a sudden, part of the world who has done an end9 run around the probate proceeding has now gone to some10 other court for a critical determination of fact that11 the probate court must decide and always must decide in12 determining the validity of an estate plan --13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- you are suggesting14 an extraordinary setup with a State court being able to15 preclude other courts from dealing with related, not16 identical matters, and that's just not the way our17 system works. You can bring duplicative proceedings in18 different courts. One will finish first and that will19 bind the others. But I -- I never heard of a State20 court being able to say, because we are a probate21 court, that you -- you couldn't bring a tort case22 someplace else.23 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Ginsburg --24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The -- the only court25 I've heard of that can do that is the Federal491111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 bankruptcy court.2 MR. BRUNSTAD: Just as a Federal bankruptcy3 court is in rem and executes and enters some judgments4 good against the world with respect to some issues, a5 probate court does the same thing. You have exactly6 the same reason why the probate court does it as in the7 bankruptcy court.8 Now, this Court has recognized in Tilt v.9 Kelsey, for example, that the State has a sovereign10 interest in deciding the scope of its probate procedure11 that the State may, this Court said in Broderick's12 Will, provide for the probate court to enter a judgment13 good against the world, whether the person was a party14 to the proceeding or not. If a -- if a Federal court15 can predetermine --16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's the definition of17 an in rem judgment, but she's suing for an in personam18 judgment an individual, not an estate, just for a plain19 old money judgment.20 MR. BRUNSTAD: But in a race to judgment,21 Your Honor, if the Federal court gets to decide this22 critical issue of intent before the probate court, it23 preempts the probate court from doing its core probate24 function of validating or invalidating an estate plan.25 That would render our probate system unworkable. That501111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 is why --2 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Brunstad --3 MR. BRUNSTAD: -- this is a jurisdictional4 doctrine.5 Yes, Justice Stevens.6 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you two7 questions? First, if there were no such animal as the8 probate exception, would there have been bankruptcy9 court jurisdiction over your claim?10 MR. BRUNSTAD: We argue no, Justice Stevens,11 because as we argued in the Ninth Circuit, there was12 not even bankruptcy jurisdiction because the other side13 never responded to our argument that the outcome of14 this case15 creditors1617 prevail even if there were no probate exception in your18 view.would not result in any money going toof her estate.JUSTICE STEVENS:  So your -- you would19 MR. BRUNSTAD: That's our argument. The20 Ninth Circuit did not address that ground, Your Honor.21 JUSTICE STEVENS: And my -- my second22 question is I noticed you quoted from a Minnesota Law23 Review about 250 cases, and the -- your opponent24 pointed out that the -- the next sentence of the25 article said the holdings don't support the511111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 generalization. And I would just like to ask you,2 apart from the Markham case, what is the case -- what3 holding of a case lends the greatest support to your4 probate exception argument.5 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Stevens, I think that6 the Sutton case is the closest. The next closest is7 Broderick's Will. Sutton again involved both a trust8 and a will and was a construction of Texas law, which9 we say the Court has already decided in Sutton, and10 Texas law, which is undisputed, has the effects which11 we say it has in the brief. They did not contest,12 Justice Ginsburg, our construction or interpretation of13 Texas law.14 I think also that the Court's decisions in15 Tarver and Fouvergne and also Ellis and O'Callaghan --16 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not asking you to rank17 them. I don't want a list of cases that have a lot of18 dicta because some of these cases went off on laches,19 some went off a lot of different grounds than purely --20 than -- some of them don't even mention probate.21 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Stevens, I think that22 it's -- it would be helpful if I could give you a23 thumbnail sketch breaking down, what I was trying to do24 earlier, between those where there's impermissible25 interference and those where there's not impermissible521111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 interference. The United States' characterization I2 think is incorrect.3 For example, again, this Court has determined4 there's no jurisdiction for a Federal court to5 determine the validity of an instrument. That's the6 first case in Armstrong v. Lear and also Gaines v.7 Chew.8 Also, this Court has determined there's no9 Federal jurisdiction to determine the invalidity of an10 estate plan. That's Tarver, Fouvergne, and11 O'Callaghan, Broderick's Will, Sutton, and Ellis.12 This Court has determined that Federal courts13 do not have jurisdiction to administer the probate14 estate. That's Byers v. McAuley.15 This Court has determined that there is no16 Federal jurisdiction to take possession of the assets17 in the probate court. That is also Broderick's Will.18 I'm sorry. That is Byers v. McAuley.19 This Court has determined one may not impose20 a constructive trust on the beneficiaries as, in21 essence, a way to get property to them. That's22 Broderick's Will and Sutton.23 This Court has determined there's no24 jurisdiction to recover property from the beneficiary25 because of an alleged invalidity of a will. That's --531111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that's the Ellis case.2 This Court has determined there's no3 jurisdiction for the Federal court to direct an4 accounting from the administrator. That's the Waterman5 case.6 This Court has determined there's no7 jurisdiction to interfere with the State court's8 possession of the assets, again Waterman, Williams,9 Yonley, and Borer.10 Now, no jurisdiction. It's always been a11 jurisdictional doctrine.12 And for the same reasons this Court refused13 to recharacterize the -- the domestic relations14 exception as a abstention doctrine, the Court should15 also decline to do so here under the probate exception.16 Now, the other side of the schema is, when is17 it permissible for a Federal court to undertake a18 probate-related matter? Well, if the State allows the19 claim, particular claim, to be brought outside its20 exclusive probate system, then Federal courts may21 entertain jurisdiction as well.22 JUSTICE BREYER: By the way, in Texas if you23 have to go through all this probate stuff and24 everything, and they want to claim 15 years ago my25 mother gave a ring to my cousin who stole it, is that541111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425precluded to bring that tort action when the personwho, you know, was supposed to get it finds out aboutit?          MR. BRUNSTAD:  Justice Breyer, all claims ofincomplete gift, which Vickie's claim is here, competewith an estate plan.          JUSTICE BREYER:  So -- so, in other words, ifit -- when the guy is 2 years -- 15 years old, he givesa ring to somebody, and now he dies at age 93, and whenthey find out about that incomplete gift at age 15,nobody can bring a lawsuit anymore.  You have to go tothe probate court.          MR. BRUNSTAD:  If in fact the ring passedunder his valid estate plan, yes.  Because the ringpassed under the valid estate plan, you have tooverturn the estate plan before you say the propertygoes somewhere else.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.          MR. BRUNSTAD:  Thank you, Your Honor.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Richland, youhave 4 minutes remaining.          REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. RICHLAND               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. RICHLAND:  Thank you, Your Honor.          Justice Breyer, to answer your question about551111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 whether the Texas court had all of the material before2 it that was before the bankruptcy court, the answer to3 that can be seen at page 45 of the appendix where the4 district court judge says that there were 400 boxes of5 documents.6 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but did those documents7 -- did those boxes contain the key documents --8 MR. RICHLAND: They did.9 JUSTICE BREYER: -- about the catchall trust?10 MR. RICHLAND: They did. They contained the11 -- perhaps the most key documents, which were the12 billing records that showed that that trust was13 actually drafted. The trust, of course, never saw the14 light of day, but those billing records reflected that.15 And none of that was in front of the Texas probate16 court.17 In addition, Justice Breyer, you mentioned18 that there were a number of other instances of tortious19 misconduct that were found by Justice Carter, in20 addition to the forging of the -- of the irrevocability21 point. Indeed, Justice Carter found that there were22 massive transfers of J. Howard's assets to Pierce23 Marshall in his last days, and those asset transfers24 were made in exchange for notes that were payable years25 in the future. This was after J. Howard had been561111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 diagnosed with terminal cancer, after he had had a2 heart attack. Annuities were used to pay for those as3 well. So that he was essentially stripped of all of4 his assets by the time he was dead. There was -- there5 were no assets in the probate estate at that time.6 Justice Ginsburg, I would refer you to7 appendix page 42 where the -- the district court8 indicates that both a proof of claim and an adversary9 complaint were first filed by Pierce Marshall in the10 bankruptcy court, and that is, indeed, what caused,11 several months later, the compulsory counterclaim to be12 filed in a response.13 Mr. Brunstad indicated that what happened14 here was that while the claim was pending in Texas, it15 was then brought to the bankruptcy court presumably16 because there was some dissatisfaction on Ms.17 Marshall's part as to how the Texas probate court was18 going. In fact, page 1 of our reply brief details very19 specifically the fact that the first time that the20 tortious interference with gift claim was made was in21 the bankruptcy court as the compulsory counterclaim.22 And I would just conclude by stating that the23 cause of action that was at issue here was really a24 very common one. It's the -- not in and of itself, but25 it's common to make a claim against the estate in debt571111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425or that a gift was given, and that may, indeed,diminish the estate that is eventually passed.  Butthat doesn't invalidate any of the estate planningdocuments.  It simply means that something that mightotherwise have been within the estate was not includedin the estate.          That's really all that happened here.  Theclaim was for tortious interference with gift.  That,indeed, may have diminished the amount or may not havesince J. Howard was actually quite an active man at thetime that he made this -- this gift or intended to makethe gift, and was still doing business deals.  He mayhave increased his -- his assets enormously at thatpoint in time.          But in any event, what it certainly does notdo is, it doesnot invalidateinvalidate thenot invalidate an estate plan.  It doesa will, and it certainly didn'ttrust or the will in this case.          If there are any further questions, I'd behappy to answer them.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.          MR. RICHLAND:  Thank you.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The case issubmitted.          (Whereupon, at 12:14 p.m., the case in the581111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 above-entitled matter was submitted.) 2345 6 7 8 9101112131415161718192021222324251111 14th Street, NW Suite 40059 1-Washington, DC 20005
