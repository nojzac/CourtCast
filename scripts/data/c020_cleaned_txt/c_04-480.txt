VERRILLI, JR.,                 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS          MR. VERRILLI:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          Copyright infringement is the only commerciallysignificant use of the Grokster and StreamCast services,and that is no accident.  Respondents deliberately set outto capture a clientele of known infringers to stock theirservices with infringing content, they intentionally anddirectly promote the infringing use of the service, theysupport infringing use of the service, and they directly--          JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I just interrupt for theone -- you said "the onlyfootnote in the red briefbillion legitimate uses.          MR. VERRILLI:          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Is that correct, or incorrect?          MR. VERRILLI:  Well, I think it's an absolutely3significant use."  There's athat says the figure is some 2.6Yes.  Yes, Your Honor.  I --1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 incorrect assertion of reality, and perhaps I could delve2 into it and explain why.3 The evidence in this case, which was presented4 at summary judgment, showed that 90 percent of the5 material on the services was either definitely or very6 likely to be infringing.7 JUSTICE STEVENS: Now, was there a finding8 percent?9 MR. VERRILLI: Well, this was submitted onof 9010 summary judgment, Your Honor, and we lost summary11 judgment, so the evidence has got to be construed in12 light most favorable to us. And the Ninth Circuit decided13 the case on the assumption, we'd submit, of 90 percent.14 But with respect to that 10 percent, what15 happened, and we submit is completely wrong, is that the16 Ninth Circuit drew the inference, because it wasn't shown17 by our expert study, which, by the way, is the only18 empirical analysis in the case, to be infringing, that the19 Court could assume that it was noninfringing and then20 extrapolate from that to a number along the lines of the21 number that Your Honor suggested. And I think that that's22 completely illegitimate analysis, factually, and, besides,23 that number is big only because the overall activity is so24 big. The scale of the whole thing is mind-boggling. If25 there are that many noninfringing uses --41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-the￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE STEVENS:  It goes to the --          MR. VERRILLI:  -- imagine how many infringing --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- accuracy of your statementthat there is no other significant legitimate use.          MR. VERRILLI:  I don't think there -- I thinkit's quite accurate on the summary-judgment record, andcertainly drawing the inferences in our favor, as we musthere on summary -- on this summary-judgment record, thatthere is commercially significant noninfringing use.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there could be.  Therecould be, both with respect to material in the publicdomain and with respect to people who authorize thetransmission.          MR. VERRILLI:  I don't think, in the context ofthis record in this case and the business model of theseDefendants, Grokster and StreamCast, that that is true,Justice Ginsburg.  I don't think that's right.  I thinkwhat Grokster and StreamCast are arguing is that thisCourt's decision in Sony stands for the proposition thattheir massive actual infringement is -- gets a free pass,a perpetual free pass, so long as they can speculate thatthere are noninfringing uses out there, such as public-domain uses and authorized uses.  We don't think that that-- that Sony stands for any such proposition.We also want to point out that that doesn't help 51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 them -- that proposition doesn't help them with respect to2 one very significant part of this case, and that's the3 fact that they intentionally built a network of infringing4 users, and they actively encouraged and assisted5 infringement.6 Now, even if there are commercially significant7 noninfringing uses, and we submit there most definitely8 aren't under Sony, but even if there are, that's no9 defense to a contributory infringement claim based on10 intentional building up of an infringing business and11 active encouragement and assistance of infringement, and12 it can't be; because, otherwise, then the fact that they13 had commercially significant noninfringing uses, again,14 would be just a free pass to actively promote infringing15 uses; not merely to support them, but to promote them.16 And so --17 JUSTICE SOUTER: BUt, your argument, I take it,18 would be the same if the proportions were reversed. Your19 argument with respect to -- your current argument with20 respect to infringing use would be the same if only 1021 percent -- if it were assumed that only 10 percent of the22 use were illegitimate and infringing. Is that correct?23 MR. VERRILLI: The active-encouragement aspect24 of our argument would be the same, certainly.25 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's right.61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. VERRILLI: They don't get a -- they don't2 get a free pass to encourage any infringement.3 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is that the same as active4 inducement --5 MR. VERRILLI: Yes. I think there's --6 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- as that term --7 MR. VERRILLI: -- there's a lot of --8 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- is used?9 MR. VERRILLI: Yes, Justice O'Connor, there's a10 lot of lingo floating around in this case -- inducement,11 active encouragement, assistance.12 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: If we should think that the13 Respondents are not liable for the type of contributory14 infringement dealt with in Sony, could this Court reach15 the question of active inducement on this record?16 MR. VERRILLI: Yes, very definitely. I think --17 I think the Court, of course, should find that there's18 contributory liability under the Sony theory --19 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I know you do, but --20 MR. VERRILLI: -- but with respect to --21 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- I just said --22 MR. VERRILLI: -- that theory --23 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- could you --24 MR. VERRILLI: Yes.25 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- assume, for a moment, that71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 we didn't; could we, nonetheless, address the active2 inducement --3 MR.4 explain why.5 partial final6 Respondent's summary-judgment motions. Now, we argued for7 contributory liability on two theories in the DistrictVERRILLI: Yes, Justice O'Connor, and let me The District Court in this case issued a judgment, under rule 54(b), granting the8 Court and in the Ninth Circuit. We argued that there was a9 lack of commercially significant noninfringing use under10 Sony, and we've argued the inducement or active-11 encouragement theory. We argued that both theories entitle12 us to relief against the current operations of the service,13 to entitle us to damages, and entitle us to injunctive14 relief to eliminate the harmful ongoing infringing15 consequences of this intentionally built-up infringement16 machine.17 The District Court granted summary judgment18 against us and gave a clean bill of health, gave19 absolution, essentially, to the current versions of the20 services. The only thing that was left to us, as the21 Ninth Circuit and the District Court -- and the District22 Court, both, understood the law, is that we can go back23 and try to show that, with respect to specific past acts24 of infringement, if we can show that they occurred at a25 time when we had given them notice that they were about to81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 occur, and that we had the power to -- and they had the2 power to stop them at the moment we gave them the notice,3 that we can get damages for those specific things, and4 those specific things only. That's all that's left in5 this case. And I think it's quite clear, from the Rule6 54(b) certification order of the District Court that it7 was only damages with the past services and the past acts8 --9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not clear -- it's not10 clear to me from your brief, focusing on the contributory11 aspect of it, not -- and not the inducement part of it --12 it's not clear to me from your brief what your test is.13 What do we tell the trier of fact, that if there is a14 substantial part of the use which is noninfringement, if15 there's any part?16 MR. VERRILLI: Here's what I -- here's where I17 think the test --18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Leaving aside the inducement.19 MR. VERRILLI: Right. Here's what I -- here's20 what we think the test is on the -- what we'll call the21 Sony aspect of the case, that it's -- the question here is22 -- Sony poses23 question, not24 under Sony is25 substantially1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400to us -- is really a touchstone kind ofa numerical kind of question.  The questionwhether this is a business that isunrelated to infringement.  In other words,9 Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 are they building their business on supporting legitimate2 activity, or, instead, are they building their business3 supporting infringing activity?4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then we just throw this5 to the birds on the trier of fact in every case --6 MR. VERRILLI: No, I think --7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, how do we know --8 MR. VERRILLI: And that's where you start.9 That's the touchstone. Now, the numbers, the relative10 proportions of use, are relevant. In a case like Sony11 itself, certainly, where the majority use was12 noninfringing, that's a legitimate business; you don't13 need to go further. In a case like this one, where,14 taking the record at summary judgeent in our favor, as it15 must be, and the Ninth Circuit's assumption that you've16 got 90 percent infringing use, billions and billions of17 acts of infringing use, and minuscule actual noninfringing18 use, it seems to us it's just --19 JUSTICE BREYER: You're not saying -- now you're20 using different tests. Your test is "substantial." All21 right, on your test, are we sure, if you were the counsel22 to Mr. Carlson, that you recommend going ahead with the23 Xerox machine? Are you sure, if you were the counsel to24 the creator of the VCR, that you could recommend, given25 the use, copying movies, that we should ever have a VCR?101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Are you sure that you could recommend to the iPod inventorthat he could go ahead and have an iPod, or, for thatmatter, Gutenberg, the press?  I mean, you see theproblem.          MR. VERRILLI:  Yes, I think my answer to --          JUSTICE BREYER:  What's the answer?          MR. VERRILLI:  -- those questions are: yes, yes,yes, and yes.          [Laughter.]          JUSTICE BREYER:  Because in each case -- for allI know, the monks had a fit when Gutenberg made his press--[Laughter.]          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- but the problem, of course,is that it could well be, in each of those instances, thatthere will be vast numbers of infringing uses that areforeseeable.          MR. VERRILLI:  I disagree with that, Your Honor.Certainly not -- I don't think there's any empiricalevidence to suggest, with respect to any of the thingsthat Your Honor just identified -- and let me pick out theiPod as one, because it's the most current example, Iguess.  From the moment that device was introduced, it wasobvious that there were very significant lawful commercialuses for it.  And let me clarify something I think is111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 unclear from the amicus briefs. The record companies, my2 clients, have said, for some time now, and it's been on3 their Website for some time now, that it's perfectly4 lawful to take a CD that you've purchased, upload it onto5 your computer, put it onto your iPod. There is a very,6 very significant lawful commercial use for that device,7 going forward.8 And, remember, I -- what our test -- our test is9 not "substantial." Our test is that it's a -- it's a --10 when it's a vast-majority use, like here, it's a clear11 case of contribution --12 JUSTICE SCALIA: How do you -- how do you know,13 going in, Mr. Verrilli? I mean, I'm about to start the14 business. How much time do you give me to bring up the15 lawful use to the level where it will outweigh the16 unlawful use? I have to know, going in.17 MR. VERRILLI: Well, I --18 JUSTICE SCALIA: And it's one thing to sit back19 and, you know, calculate with this ongoing business, it's20 90 percent/10 percent. But I'm a new inventor, and I'm --21 you know --22 MR. VERRILLI: I think the weight --23 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- I'm going to get sued right24 away. I know25 have a chance1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400I'm going to get sued right away, before Ito build up a business.12 Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. VERRILLI: I don't think that's right, Your2 Honor, and here's why. To -- it's not just the absence of3 commercially significant noninfringing uses that4 demonstrates contributory infringement. I mean, you have5 to demonstrate that you're making a material contribution,6 with knowledge that you're doing so. The inventor, at the7 outset, is not in that position. They're not making a8 contribution with knowledge that they're doing so. Do9 they have absolute certainty? No, they don't have10 absolute certainty.11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I don't quite understand12 the -- I take it, inventors are profit-motive-driven, and13 if they know that something they're working on is going to14 have copyright experience, you -- have got copyright15 problems, you can't just say, "Oh, well, the inventor's16 going to invent anyway."17 MR. VERRILLI: Well, I -- but the problem --18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or did I misunderstand your --19 MR. VERRILLI: No, I -- I think that you have --20 to show contribution, you should have -- you have to be21 making a material contribution, with knowledge that you're22 doing so. And so --23 JUSTICE SCALIA: But the inventor of Xerox does24 that. I mean, he puts out the machine. He knows some --25 he knows a lot of people are going to use it to Xerox131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 books.2 MR. VERRILLI: I don't think that's right,3 Justice Scalia. I don't think there's anywhere close to a4 showing -- I don't think there could be anywhere close to5 a showing that you've got the vast majority of use from --6 for infringement from the time that the device comes out.7 I just don't think that's --8 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let's go --9 MR. VERRILLI: -- realistic.10 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- let's go from Xerox back to11 your iPod. How is that clear in the iPod case? I may not12 understand what people are doing out there, but it's13 certainly not clear to me. I know perfectly well I could14 go out and buy a CD and put it on my iPod, but I also know15 perfectly well that if I can get the music on the iPod16 without buying the CD, that's what I'm going to do. And I17 think it's reasonable to suppose that everybody else would18 guess that. So why, in the iPod, do you not have this19 Damoclean sword?20 MR. VERRILLI: Well, because I don't actually21 think that there is evidence that you've got overwhelming22 infringing use. I just think that's -- it's not a -- it's23 not a --24 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, there's never evidence at25 the time the guy is sitting in the garage figuring out141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 whether to invent the iPod or not. I mean, that's --2 MR. VERRILLI: I think when you get to the --3 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- the concern.4 MR. VERRILLI: -- I think when you have vast-5 majority infringing use, they should be on the hook. Now,6 I don't think --7 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but you're --8 MR. VERRILLI: -- you have that problem --9 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you're --10 MR. VERRILLI: -- with the iPod, and --11 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- you're not answering --12 you're not answering the question. The question is, How13 do we know in advance, on your test, anything that would14 give the inventor, or, more exactly, the developer, the15 confidence to go ahead? As was said a minute ago, he16 knows he's going to be sued immediately. There isn't a17 product performance out there, as there is in this case.18 So, on your substantiality theory, why isn't it a foregone19 conclusion in the iPod that the iPod loser -- or developer20 is going to lose his shirt?21 MR. VERRILLI: Well, first of all, I don't -- I22 think it's just counterfactual to think that there is23 going to be overwhelming infringing use of the iPod in the24 way that there indisputably is here. Second, to the25 extent you get the closer cases, it is our position, as I151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 gather it is the position of the United States, that you2 look at -- to see what kind of business model the3 Defendant is operating under. Is it a -- is it -- are4 they marketing it for legitimate purposes? Are they5 taking reasonable steps to prevent infringement? If they6 are, then 78 think. I9 with the first one. I mean, that's an inducementthey -- then they're not liable.  Third --JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's your second argument, Ithought you were going to just stick with the --10 argument.11 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, that's inducement.12 MR. VERRILLI: No, I don't think it is an13 inducement argument, because it doesn't go all the way to14 requiring us to show, as we can show here, that they've15 got intent. But I do think that the issue is, you know,16 really -- in the real world, you know, it isn't the case17 that these guys have gotten immediately sued. That's just18 not right. And the -- and the reality is that what19 happens is what happens here. There's perfectly valid20 uses --21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it is the case under the22 test you're submitting to us.23 MR. VERRILLI: No, I don't think that's right,24 Justice Kennedy. If there's vast-majority infringing use,25 and you continue to operate your business with the161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 knowledge that there's vast-majority infringing use, then2 you've got liability. Now, of course, we do have all the3 additional inducement facts here, but we've also got those4 facts. And in the real world --5 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, are you dealing6 active inducement as just a theoretical add-on, or7 a satisfactory way to resolve this case?89 -- 10with is thatthinkJUSTICE O'CONNOR:  I don't understand --MR. VERRILLI:  Neither, is the answer.JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  -- your pitch.MR. VERRILLI:  Neither, is the answer.  It is aresolving this case, but not to the exclusion ofMR. VERRILLI:  I think that it is a -- I11 12 1314 basis for15 getting the law right on Sony.16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you couldn't get summary17 judgment. Your reply brief said, "This case is so clear18 that we should get summary judgment." If inducement is19 the theory -- you have just said, you have to show intent20 --21 22 23 24 25MR. VERRILLI:  Yes.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- so you could not --MR. VERRILLI:  We --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- you'd have to go to trial.MR. VERRILLI:  We agree with that.  We think, in171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425a situation where the vast majority of the use isinfringing and there isn't any evidence of a legitimatebusiness plan, on the Sony part of the case we would beentitled to summary judgment.  We agree with you, YourHonor, that with respect to --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Sony itself had a trial --          MR. VERRILLI:  That's right.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- a full          MR. VERRILLI:  It came afterright.  But the -- a key point I thinktrial.the trial, that'sI want to make hereis that this is not about this technology.  What happensin the real world is that inventors come up withtechnology.  Some people use it for lawful purposes andvalid purposes, as some people use this technology for;some people abuse the technology to run business that --businesses that are devoted to expropriating the value ofcopyrights.  That's exactly what's going on in          If I could reserve the balance of myChief Justice.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Very well,Verrilli.          Mr. Clement, we'll hear from you.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT          FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,SUPPORTING PETITIONERS 18this case.time, Mr.Mr.1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  1-Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it2 please the Court:3 The decision below allows companies, like4 Respondents, to build a business model out of copyright5 infringement without fear of secondary liability. As long6 as they avoid obtaining actual knowledge that a particular7 customer is about to infringe a particular copyright, they8 are free to operate a system that involves massive9 copyright infringement with full knowledge that the draw10 of the entire system for customers and advertisers alike11 is the unlawful copying. No matter much how much of that12 system --13 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what do you think Sony14 allowed? It talked about -- if it's, what, capable of15 substantial noninfringing use, it's okay?16 MR. CLEMENT: That's right, Justice O'Connor.17 And then I think the Court explained and elaborated that18 the test is whether or not there are commercially19 significant noninfringing uses. And I would say what the20 Ninth Circuit did in this case is basically adopt the test21 of mere theoretical capability for noninfringing use, plus22 maybe some anecdotal evidence.23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what -- and your test is24 whether there's a substantial use that's lawful?25 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think the way we would try191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 to articulate it is that if the way that the business2 model of the particular Defendant is set up is that they3 are not involved in a business substantially unrelated4 from copyright infringement, that there should be5 liability in that situation. And I think in an extreme6 case like this, where over 90 percent of the business --7 and I think Mr. Verrilli correctly describes that it's not8 a minimum of 90 percent; it's over 90 percent -- because9 the only evidence on the other side is anecdotal evidence10 that there are such things as public-domain works.11 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Clement, where did12 the 90 percent figure come from? I know we have to accept13 it because it's summary judgment, but where did it come14 from?15 MR. CLEMENT: It came from a study by16 Petitioners' experts of the actual operation of the17 system. And what they did is, they identified about 7518 percent of the works as clearly infringing works, another19 15 percent of the works were identified as very likely20 infringing works, then there were 10 percent they just21 couldn't tell anything about.22 JUSTICE BREYER: I thought it was just limited23 to music.24 MR.25 the system is1111 14th Street, NW Suite 40020 Washington, DC 20005 1-CLEMENT:  Well, I think the -- it's not --not limited to music.￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE BREYER:  I know, but I thought the studywas about music.          MR. CLEMENT:  I'm not sure about that, but --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I thought -- I mean, youknow, we've had 90 briefs in this, and some briefs tear itapart, and others support it, but we also have briefs fromthe ACLU saying you could put whole libraries within thissystem.          MR. CLEMENT:  Well --          JUSTICE BREYER:  The question I wanted to askyou is, given that concern, that there are, conceptuallyanyway, really excellent uses of this thing, doesdeliberate -- what is the word?          MR. CLEMENT:  Actual inducement?          JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  Because what you areworried about, it seemed to me that the actual inducementwould take care of.  And if you sent it back and said,"Let's have a trial on actual inducement."  If this reallyis the extreme case you're talking about, why wouldn't thePetitioners here be bound to win that trial?          MR. CLEMENT:  Well, based on our review of therecord -- and we haven't been able to see the entirerecord -- I agree with you, the Petitioners ought to beable to win this case on an active-inducement ground, andthat's a narrow way to decide the case.  I do think,211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 though, this Court might have to say something about the2 Sony issue before it reached that issue. And if it did3 feel compelled to do that, I think it would be a mistake4 to sanction the Ninth Circuit's reading of Sony, because,5 you're right, there's a theoretical possibility that6 public-domain works can be exchanged on this system, but7 it's also true that this system doesn't have much of a8 comparative advantage for trading in public-domain works.9 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, you got interrupted a10 bit. Tell us, in the simplest way you can, what test you11 think Sony stands for and how the Ninth got it wrong, if12 you believe it.13 MR. CLEMENT: Justice O'Connor, it stands for --14 the test is whether or not there are commercially15 significant noninfringing uses. The Ninth Circuit got it16 wrong because it thought that test was satisfied by a17 combination of two things: being able to point out that18 there were such things as public-domain works or19 authorized sharing of the Wilco album, for example, and20 anecdotal evidence that you could actually do that.21 Now, if that were the right reading of Sony,22 with respect, I would suggest that footnote 23 of this23 Court's Sony decision would have been the sum total of the24 Court's analysis, because in that footnote the Court25 observed that there were broadcasts of public-domain 221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 works.2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the owner of the3 instrumentality, the program, thinks that there's going to4 be a vast area of lawful use, and he knows that there's5 going to be some abuse at the -- in the short term, but he6 does everything he can to discourage that. He says, "This7 is a two -- P2P is going to revolutionize the way we talk8 to each other, there's things in the public domain.9 Please don't use this for copyright." But he knows that10 there's going to be some infringement, let's say that11 it'll be 50 percent of the use, in the short term. Can he12 use the program?1314 the short 1516171819 suggest, if you're at a 50-50 -- I mean, if you're20 anywhere below 50 percent, we think that there should be21 no liability under the Sony standard. If you're above22 that level and there's sufficient evidence that you're23 really targeting infringing uses, then I think maybe there24 would be liability. But in the hypothetical you suggest,25 there would clearly not be liability in that situation.231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-MR. CLEMENT:  If it's 50 percent infringement inrun?  We think, absolutely, yes.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes, that he can --MR. CLEMENT:  He can --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- use the program.MR. CLEMENT:  -- use the program.  I mean, as we￼1 What we would like to suggest, though, is there2 ought to be enough room for -- under the Sony test, before3 you reach actual inducement, to capture somebody where4 they've clearly set out, as a business model, to deal with5 the infringing uses. And the only thing they point to are6 the theoretical possibility, anecdotal evidence, that it7 could be used for public-domain works.8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If there's more, they could9 bring it out at trial, could they not? The difference10 between your position and11 you think there should be12 Petitioners, but a trial.13 MR. CLEMENT: I14 Justice Ginsburg. We're operating in something of a15 disadvantage, because we haven't seen the entirety of the16 record. Based on the record that I've seen, I think17 there's a close case, unless perhaps once this Court18 clarifies the legal standard, Respondents put on19 additional evidence. I think this is a close case, where20 you actually could grant summary judgment in favor of the21 Petitioners. But certainly we have no objection to having22 a trial on the Sony issue in this case. What we object to23 is the Ninth Circuit rule, which, in every case, is going24 to obviate the need for a trial, based on a showing that25 there are such things as public-domain works.241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-Mr. Verrilli, I take it, is thatnot summary judgment for thethink that's a fair point,￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: The inducement -- the2 inducement point doesn't get you very far. Presumably a3 successor to Grokster, or whatever this outfit is called,4 could simply come in and not induce anybody but say, you5 know, "We're setting up the same system," know very well6 what people are going to use it for, but not induce them.7 And that would presumably be okay.89 --MR. CLEMENT:  I think that's potentially right10 11 12 1314 important15 again, this Court, in Sony, could have adopted a simple16 theoretical-capability test, but this Court, instead,17 adopted a test that required there to be shown some18 commercially significant use for the -- noninfringing use.19 And even in the patent context, where I think the test is,20 and should be, more demanding, even in that context, cases21 like Fromberg, which we cite at page 19 of our brief, show22 that there is an analysis to make sure that the suggested23 theoretical noninfringing use is, in fact, a practical use24 of the item.25 JUSTICE SCALIA: Will you give a company ten 251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which is why you need --MR. CLEMENT:  -- Justice ScaliaJUSTICE SCALIA:  -- the Sony --MR. CLEMENT:  -- and that's whyto preserve a role for the Sony--I think it'stest.  And,￼1 years to establish that?2 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I don't think --3 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, what I worry about is4 the suit that just comes right out of the box, as soon as5 the company starts up. Will you give the company a couple6 of years to show that it's developing a commercial use?7 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, we have8 concerns about that, as well. I don't know that we would9 give them ten years of, sort of, free space to do as --10 facilitate as much copyright infringement as possible. I11 think what we would say is that when you're -- when a suit12 targets a nascent technology at the very beginning, there13 ought to be a lot of leeway, not just for observed14 noninfringing uses, but for the capacity of noninfringing15 uses.16 I don't think, in fairness, that's what you have17 before you in this case, because this is a case where the18 peer-to-peer technology was out there, it was employed in19 a particular way, with a centralized server, in a way that20 was actually -- had a lot of users involved in it, and21 they were users of the old Napster system, that had a22 distinct character. They were using that system for23 infringing copyrighted musical works. And then these24 individuals come along and seek to capitalize on that25 market. That is their business plan from day one. And261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 it's not some newfangled idea. The only newfangled idea2 here is that if you give something of value away for free3 by ignoring the copyright laws, you're likely to draw4 consumers to your site, and you're likely to attract5 advertisers. But that cannot be the kind of innovation6 that we want to further through a development of secondary7 liability into the copyright laws.8 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Clement, in one way this9 presents an easy case for answering Justice Scalia's10 question, but what about a case in which there isn't the11 Napster example to start with? Should there be some kind12 of a flexible rightness doctrine in response to suits, as13 Justice Scalia put it, against the inventor or14 right out of the box?15 MR. CLEMENT: Well, whether you call16 flexible rightness doctrine or you develop the17 a way that is very forgiving --developerit adoctrine in18 JUSTICE SOUTER: Congress of laches.19 MR. CLEMENT: -- a brand-new technology.20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Congress of laches.21 MR. CLEMENT: Right. I mean, I think -- the way22 I would style it is to develop a substantive standard23 that's very forgiving of brand-new technologies and allows24 people to point to, in those situations, capabilities for25 future uses. I do think that --271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE SOUTER: How would you express the --2 how would you express that, that substantive standard that3 anticipates, just as you suggested we do?4 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I was just trying to5 articulate it, which is to say that this Court has talked6 about the capacity for noninfringing uses. I think, with7 a mature product like this, it's fair to point to how it's8 actually used in the marketplace.9CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.10 Clement. 111213 hear from 1415 1617 may it please the Court:18 Because Respondent's software products are tools19 of autonomous communications that have large and growing20 legitimate uses, their distribution is protected under the21 clear Sony rule.

TARANTO:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and￼1 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, but active inducement2 is a doctrine that's been employed to curb the intentional3 encouragement of noninfringing uses, isn't it?4 MR. TARANTO: Not in copyright law, it hasn't,5 but that's not my primary point. My primary point is that6 it is critical, it is jurisdictionally critical, to7 separate two separate acts, distributing the product and8 any of the past acts that the Petitioners allege9 constituted encouragement, their synonym for "inducement,"10 which were explicitly outside the District Court ruling11 that was certified for interlocutory appeal.12 Questions about past acts not inherent in the13 distribution of our product remain in --14 JUSTICE SCALIA: But they are inherent. They15 are inherent. I mean, the point is that those past acts16 are what have developed your client's current clientele.17 MR. TARANTO: No, I don't think so, Justice18 Scalia. The Petitioners -- this is what I think is here19 and usable about the past acts. They claim that there is20 an intent, as part of the current distribution of the21 product, to profit from increased use, including22 generically known infringing use, a point on which the23 District Court and the Court of Appeals assumed to be the24 case. Beyond that, the question whether there were25 encouraging acts, any kind of promotional activity that291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 says, "We ask you to, and urge you to, use this product2 for infringement," that is not here, because that was3 explicitly part of the past activities, removed from the4 District Court decision. And when the Petitioners sought5 interlocutory appeal, they said, expressly, these were6 "distinct and severable," in their terms -- that's a quote7 --8 JUSTICE SOUTER: But I don't --9 MR. TARANTO: -- from the past.10 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- understand how you can11 separate the past from the present in that fashion. One,12 I suppose, could say, "Well, I'm going to make inducing13 remarks Monday through Thursday, and I'm going to stop,14 Thursday night." The sales of the product on Friday are15 still going to be sales which are the result of the16 inducing remarks Monday through Wednesday. And you're17 asking, in effect -- you're asking us -- to ignore Monday18 through Thursday.19 MR. TARANTO: No, I'm not. Let me try to be20 clear. There is a theory, not present here, along exactly21 those lines, which Petitioners are entitled to argue, back22 in the District Court, without a remand, because that23 issue remains in the District Court. It is a theory that24 says, "You started your business with illegitimate acts,25 your current business is a causal consequence of that." I301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 will say, there is not one bit of evidence that the2 Petitioners introduced, in resisting summary judgment, in3 support of that theory. It is, in fact, a highly4 implausible theory, for reasons that the District Court5 can explain, because users of software like this switch6 readily. There is no plausible lock-in effect to this7 software. People go from Kazaa to Grokster to eDonkey to8 BitTorrent week by week. That was -- that is an available9 theory. You would --10 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then why was current -- why was11 inducement, as a current theory of recovery, even the12 subject of summary judgment? It seems to me that to make13 it a summary judgment is implausible to a nonworldly14 degree.15 MR. TARANTO: I'm not entirely --16 JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, I thought you were17 saying that, so far as the inducement theory of recovery18 is concerned --19 MR. TARANTO: Yes.20 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- the only summary judgment21 that was granted was with respect to current acts of22 inducement, the way the company is acting now, not the way23 the company was acting last year. And my question is --24 if that is correct, then I don't see how summary judgment25 could even intelligibly have been considered.311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. TARANTO: I think -- because as the2 Petitioners insisted when they pressed for interlocutory3 appeal, they said these were distinct and severable,4 because, as Justice Scalia referred to before, the5 important question, on a going-forward basis, is whether6 the current set of activities -- this software, given how7 it operates, being generally distributed -- is a vendor's8 -- the distributor of that software -- secondarily liable9 because somebody else, tomorrow, can do exactly the same10 thing, without the baggage of any past acts.11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I don't want to get us12 too far off the track on this question, but it just seems13 to me that what you've done before bears on what you know,14 or have reason to know, on an ongoing basis.15 MR. TARANTO: I agree with that, Justice16 Kennedy, but there's no dispute about that. This case was17 decided on the assumption, which we are not contesting18 here, that the Respondents here knew that there would be19 widespread infringing use of a product that they were20 putting out, and, what's more, that they intended to21 profit from maximum use of the product, which necessarily22 would include infringing use, which they had no ability to23 separate from noninfringing use.24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then why don't you tell25 us what's wrong with the Government's test and with the321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 Petitioner's test, the substantial-use part of it?2 MR. TARANTO: Well, I'm not entirely -- I think3 there are several tests, and I'm not sure I followed them4 all here. We think it is critical that the Court adhere,5 for innovation protection, to the very clear Sony rule.67 something8 one could9 noninfringing use." That would be very clear, I agree.10 But Sony goes on for 13 more pages. If the standard were11 all that clear, it would have stopped there. And usually12 when you're interpreting a document, one rule is, you read13 on, and if you read on, you find we need not give precise14 content to the question of how much use is commercially15 significant. That doesn't sound very clear to me. Or if16 you then read back, as a careful reader would, then you17 find this statement that the primary use of the Sony18 machine for most owners was time-shifting, a use that the19 Court found either authorized or fair, and, hence,20 noninfringing.21 So I don't think you can take from what is a22 rather long opinion, and isolate one sentence, and say,23 "Aha, we have a clear rule."24 MR. TARANTO: Well, that sentence, Justice25 Ginsburg, is expressly stated to be the rule of law that331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That, Mr. Taranto, isI find very puzzling.  There is a statement --take it as clear -- "capable of substantial￼1 is being applied. And then the Court went on to apply it2 to say, there are two things that satisfy the test. The3 primary thing, of course, is what takes up most of those4 13 pages, the question whether in-home time-shifting is5 fair use, a question that was of considerable interest to6 tens of millions of individuals throughout the United7 States. But the Court, in fact, didn't rely only on that;8 it said, "In addition, there was this roughly 7 to 99 percent use of authorized time-shifting." It wouldn't10 have had to even talk about that if the primary use, you11 know, was the entirety of --12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Verrilli, I hope you won't13 waste a lot of your time on this point. This Court is14 certainly not going to decide this case on the basis of15 stare decisis, you know, whatever else is true.16 MR. TARANTO: Well, I will -- let me urge that17 there is, in fact, considerable weight to stare decisis,18 because there are major technological industries that have19 relied on the rule that derives from patent law that there20 is no, kind of, predominant-use kind of meaning to the Sony21 rule. In the patent context from which this came, all22 there has to be, in Professor Chisum's words, is, uses23 that are not farfetched, illusory, uneconomical for the24 user. And the inquiry there is, is this a product whose25 -- where the same features that are alleged to cause the341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 infringement are also, in some nontrivial way, used for2 noninfringement?3 JUSTICE BREYER: What is -- what is the answer4 to Justice Kennedy's question? I took it, whether -- for5 the last 21 years, industry throughout America has taken6 the standard as being approximately whether it is capable7 of substantial -- commercially significant substantial8 noninfringing uses.9 MR. TARANTO: Yes.10 JUSTICE BREYER: I -- and the country seems to11 have survived that standard. There is innovation. There12 are problems in the music industry, but it thrives, and so13 forth. So there is an argument for just following it,14 because it's what it is. But suppose it's totally open.15 Why should that be the right test, instead of some other16 test, like substantial use, et cetera?17 MR. TARANTO: I -- because I --18 JUSTICE BREYER: That, I think,19 question, and I'm very interested in your20 MR. TARANTO: Right. Because I21 alternative is worse. A focus on intent to profit means22 that virtually every business which requires money and has23 the least bit of sensible forward-looking thinking about24 what the usage is going to be will be subject to25 litigation, arguing about their knowing that a substantial351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-was theanswer.think any￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425amount of the value of the product was going to be basedon infringement.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But --          MR. TARANTO:  Every --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- but what you have -- whatyou want to do is to say that unlawfully expropriatedproperty can be used by the owner of the instrumentalityas part of the startup capital for his product.          MR. TARANTO:  I -- well --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And I -- just from an economicstandpoint and a legal standpoint, that sounds wrong tome.          MR. TARANTO:  Well, I'm not entirely sure aboutthat formulation.  Sony clearly sold many more tapesbecause of the illicit activity of Library.  Sonypresumably sold more machines, maybe even priced themhigher, because there was a group of people who wanted themachine for the illicit activity.  The Apple iPod, in the60 gigabit version, holds 15,000 songs.  That's --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you think that --          MR. TARANTO:  -- a thousand CDs.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- unlawfully expropriatedproperty can be a legitimate part of the startup capital.          MR. TARANTO:  No, I -- what I think is that, asa matter of general judicially formulated secondary 361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 copyright liability law, there is no better policy balance2 that the Court can strike, and that only Congress can make3 the judgments about what the industry-wide facts are.4 And I -- let me pause there a minute -- there are no5 industry-wide facts in this record. Every citation in the6 Petitioner's brief about the magnitude of harm to the7 industry is extra-record citation. There are 26 billion8 --9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then perhaps there should be10 a trial so it would all come out.11 MR. TARANTO: Petitioners -- it's not just that12 they didn't have it in their brief, they did not submit13 any evidence in response to the summary-judgment motion14 that said the rule of Sony should be applied here because15 the magnitude of the injury to the recording industry or16 in -- someday in the future, to the movie industry is X.17 Zero evidence --18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, they weren't19 concentrating on the damage to them, they were20 concentrating on the facilitation of copying that was21 provided. And you don't question that this service does22 facilitate copying.2324 the modem25 MicrosoftMR. TARANTO:  As does the personal computer andand the Internet service provider and theoperating system.  There's -- everything in the371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 chain that makes this work is absolutely essential to2 facilitating the copying. The question is which pieces,3 if any, and under what standard, get singled out for a4 judicially fashioned secondary copyright liability5 doctrine.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you said -- I think you7 were saying -- this is something for Congress to solve;8 it's not for the Court. But the Court is now faced with9 two apparently conflicting decisions: Aimster, in the10 Seventh Circuit, the Ninth Circuit decision. And if11 you're just looking at this in the abstract, you might12 say, "Well, it's -- isn't it odd that Napster goes one way13 in the Ninth Circuit, and this case goes another way?"14 MR. TARANTO: Let me suggest why that's not odd15 and why the cases are not just different, but critically16 different. Napster rests -- never mind the exact words of17 the opinion -- Napster involves something more than18 distribution of a product. Napster, the company, was19 sending out, in response to requests, "Where is this20 filed," an answer, the information, "The file is here."21 Every time it sent out that information, if it had been22 told by Mr. Verrilli's client, "That file may not be23 shared," it was, with specific knowledge to that file,24 giving assistance. That is a classic contributory25 infringement case based on specific knowledge of381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 infringement. And the reason --2 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why isn't this a classic3 willful-ignorance case?4 MR. TARANTO: Because willful ignorance is about5 having possession of information and refusing to look at6 it. This -- that does not occur here. This tool of7 autonomous communication is one in which there is no8 mother-may-I system, no chaperone, no information provided9 to us at the time that there is any request. When I ask10 for a file from you, there is no information that goes11 back to StreamCast or to Grokster --12 JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure, but I thought willful13 ignorance was basically a certainty of what was going on14 without empirically verifying it, so as to, sort of,15 maintain the guise of one's hands over one's eyes. And it16 seems to me, if that's what it is, that's what we've got.17 MR. TARANTO: No, I don't think so, I think, on18 either account. My understanding of where in the law19 willful ignorance has bite is when you do have the20 information right in front of you, and you refuse to look21 at it. And, what's more, the change of system to an22 autonomous communication tool, where there is no23 intermediary, which is what all of their filtering systems24 would require, getting permission in advance, the change25 of tool is not just some way of blinding oneself to the391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 information.2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I think it would also3 include disabling yourself from looking at it. And so, I4 think it's an important part of your case, that you didn't5 adopt this new system of decentralizing the file so that6 it's in the computers, out there, solely in order to get7 around Napster.8 MR. TARANTO: Right. And I think that the9 summary-judgment record on this is -- it, I mean, doesn't10 leave any real room for dispute. Seeking --11 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, wait. In respect to that12 -- I mean, is it open? If you win on the question of the13 standard, is it open, or would we have to remand it for14 them to argue, in light of the history, in light of what15 they do now, they, your client, with knowledge of16 infringement, actively encouraged users to infringe17 copyright using their -- using the Grokster technology,18 and, indeed, knowingly would include willful blindness?19 MR. TARANTO: I think --20 JUSTICE BREYER: Because -- as I had gotten that21 from one of these amicus briefs, you know, that's their22 standard -- they say a willful -- of willful, deliberate23 inducement. And that, it seems to me, important that they24 be able to argue that. Now, can they argue it, in your25 opinion, if we do nothing but affirm the Ninth Circuit?401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. TARANTO: I think that they can certainly2 argue, with an affirmance by this Court, that all of the3 past acts, to use the District Court's term, constitute a4 basis for a -- inducement liability. There would be some5 legal questions about whether there is such a thing as6 inducement liability, but they get to argue that. No7 remand is required for that.8 The record in this case establishes that one9 reason for going to the decentralized system, without a10 central index and a third-party intermediary, was to --11 was a reaction to the Ninth Circuit's Napster decision12 that said, "That's a legal problem." But it is also, I13 think, beyond genuine dispute, for summary-judgment14 proposes, that there were other reasons. You don't have15 to have the servers to maintain. When StreamCast, in16 particular, was running a Napster-like system, the so-17 called openNap system, it had ten servers, and quickly18 maxed out and started crashing, and immediately concluded19 -- I think this is at page 789 or -- and 798 of the joint20 appendix -- we would have had to start doubling, tripling,21 quadrupling the number of services, and we didn't have --22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Taranto --23 MR. TARANTO: -- the money to do it.24 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- can I ask -- I'm still a25 little puzzled about the posture of the case.411111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. TARANTO: Yes.2 JUSTICE STEVENS: Because I read the District3 Court opinion. I think he said -- the judge said that4 both parties agreed that there were no disputed issues of5 fact that would preclude the entry of summary judgment in6 either way, no disputed issues relative to whether to7 grant relief. And I -- it's on page 24a of the cert8 petition. And I understand you to be saying that leaving9 everything alone, affirming would allow the case to go10 forward with your adversaries seeking damages on an11 active-inducement theory. Am I correct?12 MR. TARANTO: Yes. I think -- all I read this,13 page 24a, to say is that both sides filed for summary14 judgment, so each one, of course, thought that there was15 -- that it was entitled to summary judgment. Each --16 JUSTICE STEVENS: But it says, "Both parties17 believe there are no disputed issues of fact material to18 Defendant's liability."19 MR. TARANTO: I think that's just because each20 side filed summary judgment. Each side filed extensive21 --22 JUSTICE STEVENS: So then your answer to my23 question is that, yes, if we affirm, as a possibility,24 they could continue to seek damages on an active-25 inducement theory.421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. TARANTO:  Yes, absolutely.  And there are --there are affirmative defenses that are not even part ofthis motion that, of course, would, by themselves,preclude summary judgment in their favor.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  And then one other --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- question I had.  Does therecord contain their proposed form of injunction that theyrequested?          MR. TARANTO:  I don't think it does, beyond thestatement at the end of their summary-judgment pleadingthat asked for a very general injunction, "Stop theDefendants from infringing."  I'm not aware of anythingmore specific.          Let me comment a bit on what the record saysabout the substantial legitimate uses.  This is not aquestion of simply saying --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Taranto, before you goback to that, I wanted to be clear on what you were sayingwould be left over for trial.          MR. TARANTO:  Yes.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Because, as I read yourbriefing, it was, "Well, they can argue about some badthings that Grokster was doing in thedecision says: henceforth, what we're43past, but thisdoing is okay.  TheWashington, DC 200051111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  1-￼1 case zeroed in on now and the future, and the only thing2 that was left open was something that is over and gone3 could get damages for it." But I thought that this4 judgment gave you an okay, a green light, from now on.5 MR. TARANTO: I -- my view that -- I mean, this6 was not talked about in these terms. I believe it ought7 to be open to the Petitioners, not only to prove that past8 acts were, themselves, illegal, but that the causal9 consequence of those past acts should somehow reach10 forward into the current acts.11 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then what is the point of the12 current summary judgment?13 MR. TARANTO: The point of the current summary14 judgment is that there is -- the forward-looking15 character of the activities taking place, starting in16 September 2002 on forward, has been held, by itself, not17 to be a basis for --18 JUSTICE SOUTER: So you're saying the summary19 judgment simply, in effect, says, "They're not doing20 anything wrong now, but we have left open the question,21 not merely of what they have done wrong in the past, but22 whether what they did wrong in the past can carry forward23 into the future"?24 MR. TARANTO: As I say, it wasn't stated in25 those terms, but, yes, I think that --441111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SOUTER:  That's bizarre.          MR. TARANTO:  Well, I don't think so, because --          [Laughter.]          MR. TARANTO:  -- because the important questionis, to the Petitioners, the entire recording and movieindustry,tomorrow,There arebrief --Is this set of activities, which you and I,can start engaging in, one that they can stop?literally a handful -- on page 7 and 8 of their          JUSTICE SOUTER:  So you're saying -- what itreally says is, "There's nothing to enjoin, but there mayvery well be something to recover for," --          MR. TARANTO:  Yes.          JUSTICE SOUTER:   -- "even as to futureactivity."          MR. TARANTO:  Yes, exactly right.  And theywould, of course, have had to make the very implausibleassertion, in a business in which there is no plausiblelock-in, that somehow a set of isolated events -- e-mails-- a handful of e-mails out of literally, between the twocompanies, 1700 a day, that might have said, "Why don'tyou load some music up"? -- are somehow the causal -- thecause of what is going on today.          Let me say a few words about what the recordsays about legitimate activities.  Altnet is a company --451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 this is at 1169 and -70 of the joint appendix -- they say2 that they have distributed, on peer-to-peer systems,3 hundreds of thousands of authorized songs, and, they say,4 millions of pieces of -- of video games, leading to sales.5 This is not a trivial number. JIVE, at page 67 to 68,6 speaks about 250,000 peer-to-peer downloads of a music7 video. The Internet archive, which is talked about in the8 record, and if you now look at what they are on their9 Website, now lists some several hundred musical artists10 with 20,000 recordings which are being put out there for11 peer-to-peer distribution. The Creative Commons is12 licensing all kinds of things for authorized public13 distribution. There are musical bands --14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Because, I gather, that some15 artists don't make money from the records, but make money16 from the popularity that draws fans to their concerts.17 MR. TARANTO: My18 JUSTICE SCALIA:19 the records for free.20 MR. TARANTO: --21 great understatement, yes.22 The bands talked23 the joint appendix, which have authorized their live24 concert recordings to be traded among -- on -- to be25 traded.

The world of music distribution4 and video distribution and movie-trailer distribution and,5 in small instances now, text distribution, but growing, is6 changing and making use of this extremely innovative, low-7 cost tool. The great innovation of this tool of8 communication --9 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Taranto?10 MR. TARANTO: Yes.11 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: In your motion for12 summary judgment, did you ask that the Plaintiff's claim13 be dismissed?14 MR. TARANTO: Well, we asked for judgment, in15 our favor on their claim, that our current activities16 constituted a basis for secondary liability. I'm not sure17 if word "dismiss" was --18 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Were there other19 claims? You said "on their claim." Were -- did they make20 other claims?2122 secondary23 actually,24 this piece out and talk just about whether the set of25 current activities supports secondary liability." The471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-MR. TARANTO:  They had a generic claim aboutcopyright liability.  We made the motion -- or,StreamCast made a motion that said, "Let's carve￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425other side eventually agreed that that was distinct andseverable from their claim of secondary liability as topast acts and as to past versions of the software, whichhas -- which has changed.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Where does one find that?          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: (Inaudible)          MR. TARANTO:  Yes, the motion -- well, it -- thesimplest place, I guess, is in the June 2003 DistrictCourt ruling, which is in the Joint Appendix and attachedto the brief in opposition, ruled on the Petitioner'smotion for an interlocutory appeal under 1292.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the motion itself is notthere to take it through the opinion of the Court?          MR. TARANTO:  No, the motion is not -- is not inthe joint appendix.  The -- most of the motions -- infact, both of our summary-judgment motions and theirsummary-judgment motion, are in the joint excerpts ofrecord in the Ninth Circuit, can be found in --          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  The text on --          MR.

Later, the48 1-1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400￼1 it's ruling only on the current versions of the software.2 And then in the June 2003 order, the Court was explicit in3 saying, "If I haven't been clear enough, let me amend my4 June -- my April order," which is what you were just5 reading from, "to make explicit the limitation." And we6 quote that in our brief.7 The great virtue of peer-to-peer decentralized8 software is that it doesn't require anybody to put stuff9 onto a server and then bear the cost of bandwidth, of10 being charged by the Internet service provider when a11 million people suddenly want it. It automatically scales.12 It -- the more people who want it, the more people will13 have it, because it will be out there on a million14 computers. That is an inherent distributional economy,15 together with the autonomy of the user, rather than having16 a kind of Mother-may-I system, with having to check every17 communication through some third party to say, "Am I18 authorized to make this communication," that are the19 virtues of this system and that make it clearly capable of20 growing the already large hundreds of thousands, even21 millions, of uses that this -- that these pieces of22 software already enable people to do.23 One final -- final word. We're not disputing24 that there are, in an industry-wide way, a set of25 important policy issues here, though there's nothing in491111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the record about what self-help measures -- digital-rightsmanagement, encryption, other things -- there's nothing inthe record what -- about that.  There's nothing in therecord about what kinds of real industry harm is beingdone by this.  Right?  This is all citations to Websitesin their brief.  These are classic questions of predictivejudgment, industry-wide judgments that Congress shouldmake to decide whether there is a problem in need ofsolution, and what solutions ought to be considered,whether changing the rule would have a overriding badeffect on other industries.  And --          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.Taranto.          Mr. Verrilli, you have four minutes remaining.      REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,                 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS          MR. VERRILLI:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.          I'd like to start by clarifying the inducementissue, and then explain why inducement is not enough, andthen have a word, if I might, about the reality of thiscase.          The reason, Justice Souter, you find it bizarreis because a shell game is going on here.  What theRespondent's position -- excuse me -- the Respondent'sposition here is that we can sue for specific501111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 infringements that we can show were induced by these2 specific acts, such as e-mail support. Our position on3 inducement is that we are entitled to injunctive relief4 against the continued operation of this gigantic5 infringement machine, which was built by the inducement.6 Now, I think that the Respondents have quite7 clearly said that they're -- they don't think any8 injunctive relief is available, going forward. But we're9 entitled, under Section 502 of the Copyright Act, to10 effective relief, not merely a -- relief, judgment11 relief, that says, "Go and sin no more," but relief that12 undoes the consequences of this inducement, of this13 massive effort to build a gigantic engine of infringement.14 And that is why they're just wrong about that.15 And you certainly can't affirm the Ninth Circuit16 and allow us to go forward with anything like that theory,17 because the Ninth Circuit said the only thing we can sue18 for -- the only thing we can sue for -- is a situation in19 which we can show that we had knowledge of specific acts20 of infringement at a time when we could stop those21 specific acts of infringement. So there's just no way to22 affirm and let that go forward.23 Now, why is infringement -- why is inducement24 not enough? It's not enough because, as Justice Scalia25 suggested, these companies already operate in the shadows,511111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 and a ruling here, which would be, I submit, a significant2 cutback of the Sony rule, that inducement is the only3 available ground of liability, would just leave them to4 paper over -- you know, we do have some paper evidence5 here, a paper trail here, but that'll just -- they just6 won't exist next time. And it's just -- it's just not7 enough.8 And I submit that Sony was quite clear on this.9 Sony said that the staple article-of-commerce doctrine,10 not copyright law, generally, and not secondary liability,11 generally, but the staple article-of-commerce doctrine,12 the noninducement part of the analysis, has got to strike13 an effective balance -- a real balance that provides14 effective protection of copyright, as well as protecting15 unrelated lines of commerce.16 Now, their rule is a rule of immunity. It's a17 free pass. It says, all you've got to do is speculate18 about noninfringing use, and you can continue with19 infringement, ad infinitum. And that's not a rule that20 protects innovation; that's a rule that destroys21 innovation. It certainly destroys the innovation that the22 creators of the copyright law is supposed to protect, and23 that's supposed to be the effective protection part of the24 balance that Sony said this law is supposed to strike.25 It also -- it also deters legitimate 521111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 technological innovation moving towards legitimate means2 of distributing this -- of distributing, in a digital3 format, music and movies through the kinds of companies4 that filed amicus briefs and that are trying to do this5 legitimately. They are inevitably and invariably undercut6 by the kinds of businesses that Respondents and the others7 run, so it deters innovation; it doesn't move it forward.8 And, beyond that, Justice Kennedy, as you9 suggested, it isn't just that they get to use our10 copyrighted -- the value of our copyrighted materials as11 the seed capital, that's the whole business. That is the12 whole business. And that's the reality here, and that's13 the problem. They can talk about the hundreds of14 thousands, or maybe even millions, of uses, but the15 reality is that there are 2.6 billion downloads,16 unlawfully, every month. So what they're talking about as17 lawful is a tiny, teeny little fraction of what's really18 going on here.19 And the problem with the rule which they say is20 a clear rule, but it obviously isn't in Sony, because Sony21 said, "strike a balance." And the problem with that rule,22 Your Honor, is that it gives them a perpetual license to23 keep going forward with billions and billions of unlawful24 downloads a month. They never have to do anything to try25 to bring their conduct into conformity with law. They're531111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 not in the position of that inventor that you identified,2 Justice Scalia, who has to, sort of, think through, "What3 am I doing?" They're just in a position where they have4 every economic incentive in the world to maximize the5 number of infringing uses, because they make more money6 when they do so.7 Now, and with respect to the reality of this8 situation, let me just say -- and I must beg to differ,9 Justice Breyer, with the suggestion that this industry is10 thriving. What the -- the facts are that we have lost --11 the recording industry has lost 25 percent of its revenue12 since the onslaught of these services. And that's13 particularly critical, because, remember, this is really14 -- the recording business, in particular, is really a15 venture-capital business. Most of the records we put out16 don't make money. A few make a lot of money. Well, what17 do you think's getting traded on Grokster and StreamCast18 and the rest of them? It's the few that make all the19 money. So they're draining all of the money out of the20 system that we use to find new artists and --21 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you --22 MR.
