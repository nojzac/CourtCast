FEINERMAN:  Thank you,101112131415   district.16 - Subject to Final ReviewMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:            The 1997 amendments to IDEA prohibit tuitionreimbursement awards for students who are unilaterallyplaced in private school without first having receivedspecial education services from the public school            This is so under ordinary principles ofstatutory construction and particularly so under theSpending Clause clear notice rule.1718192021   students.  In 1997, Congress added section22   1412(a)(10)(C).  In subsection (i), Congress provided23   that when the school district makes a free appropriate24   public education available, a FAPE, no reimbursement is25   allowed.  And then in subsections (ii) through (iv),            Prior to 1997, IDEA did not expresslyaddress tuition reimbursement for unilaterally placed3￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   Congress addressed situations where courts and hearing 2   officers may award tuition reimbursement and said that 3   reimbursement may be allowed where the school district 4   does not make a FAPE available to a student who 5   previously received special education services from the 6   public district.  Congress said nothing -- 7               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Feinerman, but the -- 8   the first provision that you read, sub (i), says that 9   there will be no reimbursement if the agency has made a10   free appropriate public education available to the child11   and the parents elected to place the child in private12   school.  But that "if" -- if the agency made a free1314151617181920212223   education.  Subsections (ii) through (iv) address the24   other category of students --25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, that's your --4appropriate public education -- and here, as Iunderstand it, the school district said that this childwas ineligible for special education.MR. FEINERMAN:  That's correct.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So if the child wasentitled to a free appropriate public education anddidn't get it, then under this sub (i), wouldn't theparents be entitled to tuition reimbursement?            MR. FEINERMAN:  No.  Subsection (i) coversstudents who are provided a free appropriate public￼ - Subject to Final Review 1               MR. FEINERMAN:  -- those who are not -- 2               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's your construction. 3   But couldn't this be read to say no reimbursement if -- 4   the word is "if" -- the agency, not -- so the 5   implication is if the agency did not make a free 6   appropriate public education available, then -- 7               MR. FEINERMAN:  That -- that might be the 8   implication if there weren't subsection (C)(ii) through 9   (C)(iv).  So it's -- it's T.A.'s argument and the10   government's argument that (C)(i) sets forth the general11   rule, but if that were the way that -- that Congress12   meant the statute to operate, it wouldn't have had any13   reason to put in (C)(ii) through (C)(iv) because we14   would already know from (C)(i) that tuition15   reimbursement was a possibility for students who did not16   receive -- previously receive special education services17   from the public district.18               Congress instead went on in (C)(ii) through19   (C)(iv) to address very specifically, in the context of20   a comprehensive statutory scheme, when tuition21   reimbursement would be available to students who did not22   previously receive.  And Congress specified, after23   essentially being invited to do so in Burlington, which24   of those students could get tuition reimbursement.  And25   the --5￼ - Subject to Final Review123456789   saying.  And -- and they deal with different sets of            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, (ii) through(iv) don't -- don't limit or contradict any explicitrequirement of (i).MR. FEINERMAN:  Oh, no.  It --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  (i) is only at most anegative implication, which -- which one would not drawin light of (ii) through (iv), is what you're saying.MR. FEINERMAN:  Yes, that's exactly what I'm10   students.  In (i), the school district has made a FAPE11   available; in (ii) through (iv), the school district has12   not made a FAPE available.  And no mention is made of13   when a FAPE is not made available to a student who had14   not previously received.15               And under this Court's decision in16   Arlington, because those students like T.A. who had not17   previously received, are not mentioned, yet Congress --18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then -- then what happens19   in a case which I think is like this one, where the20   child doesn't receive special education because the21   school has determined that the child is not eligible?22   So the child isn't getting public education, and in the23   parents' view, confirmed by experts, the child is in24   need of special education, can't get it from the public25   schools, because they declared the child ineligible.6￼5 6 7 8 9frames in IDEA --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, the parents heredidn't -- didn't run off to a private school only afterthe school district had found that their child didn'trequire any special education, did they? - Subject to Final ReviewWhat is such a parent to do?            MR. FEINERMAN:  If -- if it's an incorrect1234   remedied rather quickly.  There are very tight timedetermination by the school district, the problem is10111213141516   get some money.  How much -- how much money are youMR. FEINERMAN:  That's correct.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  They -- they put him in aprivate school without even consulting the schools.            MR. FEINERMAN:  Right.  And then only afterthe fact went to the school district and asked for --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Saying by the way, we can171819202122   $5,200 alumni services fee, a $1,500 interview fee.  But23   let's --talking about imposing on the school district here?            MR. FEINERMAN:  Well, it's -- the tuition is$5,200 a month.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  A month?MR. FEINERMAN:  Yes, and then there's a2425   back to the time frame again?  I've just got a question7JUSTICE SOUTER:  Mr. Feinerman, can we go￼23 24 25actually went through the process appropriately, unlikeT.A.'s parents --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But if you can explain8 - Subject to Final Review1   of fact.  I should know this, but I don't.  You said2   that if the -- if the parents and the school district3   disagree, it can be remedied fairly quickly because4   there's a fairly tight schedule set for the5   administrative procedure.  What I don't remember, and my6   question is this:  When the administrative steps have7 8 9101112   that the kicker here?  In other words, I -- I fully13   understand your -- your textual argument.  I -- I can14   see its soundness as a possibility that is open to us15   and, perhaps on the face of it, the most likely16   possibility, but there is a cost, and the cost, it seems17   to me, is that once you get into the -- once you get18   into appeals, this thing can go on for years, and you19   can't wait years when -- when a kid is in this kind of20   condition.21               MR. FEINERMAN:  That's correct, but there's22   no need to wait years.  Let's assume that parentsbeen exhausted, if there is still disagreement, is thereany limit on the time in which the -- the judicialappeal has to be resolved?MR. FEINERMAN:  No, there isn't.  So --JUSTICE SOUTER:  Isn't that the -- isn't￼7 8 9            MR. FEINERMAN:  That's correct.  That was in2001, and the district judge, at --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes. - Subject to Final Review1234   said the parents just went away.  The school at an5   earlier point said this child was ineligible for special6   education, isn't that so?  I think --what the process is --            MR. FEINERMAN:  Yes.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- because Justice Scalia            MR. FEINERMAN:  -- at page 39 of thepetition to the -- of the appendix to the petition, page39 note 3, the district judge noted that the 200110111213   evaluation is an appropriate part of this case.  But for14   this -- for the parents who try and get their student --15   get their student evaluated, the school district says,16   "No.  The child is ineligible"; and then the parents --17   at that point, the timing kicks in.  The parents can ask18   for a due process hearing the next day.  Under the time19   periods that were in place when T.A.'s case was going20 through --21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is that hearing --22               MR. FEINERMAN:  -- the hearing officer --23               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is that hearing on24   eligible or not, or is it on what the IEP should be?25               MR. FEINERMAN:  Well, it's --9￼ - Subject to Final Review12345678   hearing officer.  And there was a 45-day time period at9   the time T.A.'s case went through for the hearing            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  When the school said noteligible, is there -- is that question resolved firstbefore we ever get to the IEP?            MR. FEINERMAN:  I think, in a situationwhere the school district finds the child ineligible andthere is an appeal, both the eligibility and theappropriate placement are decided in front of the10   officer to make a decision.  And then after that, it's11   --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, wouldn't the schoolsay, we -- we have no obligation to get up an IEP untilthe question of eligibility is determined?121314151617   decision pending appeal to the district court.  But18   that's not what happened here.  What happened here is19   that the hearing officer decided on June -- January 26,20   2004, that T.A. was eligible.  On February 19th, quicker21   than the 30 days allowed, Forest Grove School District22   proposed an IEP that could have started as soon as23   possible thereafter, as the regulations require.24               So you are talking about a very tight -- I25   understand the situation that you are hypothesizing,10            MR. FEINERMAN:  I suppose if the schooldistrict were to get a stay of the hearing officer's￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   Justice Ginsburg, but we are talking about a very tight 2   turnaround in T.A.'s case, 75 days, which is a matter of 3   weeks, not a matter of years as was the case in 4   Burlington. 5               JUSTICE SOUTER:  What happens when we get to 6   court? 7               MR. FEINERMAN:  Excuse me? 8               JUSTICE SOUTER:  What happens when we get to 9   court?  Isn't that when it turns into a matter of years?10               MR. FEINERMAN:  It turns into a matter of11   years, but in the interim this school district, Forest12   Grove School District, while it was litigating in the13   district court, Forest Grove School District offered an14   IEP, and at that point T.A.'s parents could have tried15   the IEP out, sent the child to receive services in the16   public school district --17               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The IEP -- they did the18   IEP after the hearing officer was finished?19               MR. FEINERMAN:  Yes.  Less than 4 weeks20   after the hearing officer was finished, Forest Grove21   offered an IEP, and that's in the addendum to our reply22 brief.23 24 25            JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.  But I think we'vegot to assume that Congress has some concern for theparents who correctly say, this IEP is no good, it just11￼ - Subject to Final Review1   can't be done in the school system, and the kid needs a2   special school.  In that case, maybe -- your answer may3   be that's the exceptional case and it shouldn't drive4   the -- the inferences to be drawn about congressional5   intent.  But in that case, if the district and the6 7 8 9parents are at good faith loggerheads it can go on for along, long time, can't it?            MR. FEINERMAN:  It can go on for a long,long time if the parents file for a due process hearing,and that it can --101112   process hearing.  The ultimate result is that the school13   proposes an IEP; the parents, based on what their14   experts tell them, say that isn't going to work, and the15   parents say the only way we can educate this kid without16   his falling behind more is to put him in a private17   school.  At that point, with assuming good faith here,18   it seems to me you get into court and it can go on for a19   long time, if we accept your -- your analysis of the20   text.2122232425   to the point of something pretty formalistic?  I mean,12JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but they get the due            MR. FEINERMAN:  But all the parents have todo in that situation is to give the IEP a try and sendtheir child to public school.JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes, but doesn't that get￼89 10 11 12doesn't say how long it has to be.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Maybe -- I'm sorry.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I remember, perhapsincorrectly, from the prior argument here that theperiod that they had to try out the school plan was ten13 days? 1415161718   rule.19CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Not a hard and fast - Subject to Final Review1   somebody in the brief said, given one day under the IEP2   and the -- if you win, ultimately the check can be3   written.  That can't be right.4               MR. FEINERMAN:  I don't think one day could5   be right.  The statute says -- it -- it expressly says6   "who previously received special" -- "special education7   service under the authority of a public agency."  It            MR. FEINERMAN:  That -- that's adiscretionary factor that courts and hearing officerscan -- it's not a hard and fast rule.            MR. FEINERMAN:  But I think it's probablygood as a general benchmark.202122232425   we have that textual indication.  And it will provide13            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So is that -- isthat a period that your client's prepared to accept?            MR. FEINERMAN:  Yes, so long as -- in theordinary case, ten days would -- it's in the statute, so￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   the school district a chance to provide services under2 the IEP. 3               And as this Court mentioned in a prior case, 4   IEP's -- it's not an exact science and when you look at 5   it on a piece of paper it's hard to know whether it's 6   going to work or not.  The way you find out whether it 7   works is where the rubber hits the road and it could be 8   that the parents look at IEP and say, you know what, I 9   don't think this is going to work.  But until you10   actually give it a chance to work -- maybe the child11   goes in and -- and works with the special education12   teacher or the instructional assistant and they really13 hit it off.1415   realistic?  If the parents are convinced going in that16   this is an inappropriate IEP and they send the child to17   school for ten days under the IEP, at the end of the ten18   days they are going to say, oh, well, we've completely19   changed our mind, now we think this is a good plan?20               MR. FEINERMAN:  It's certainly plausible21   under certain circumstances.  It -- it may not happen22   every time.  And it may not happen half the time.23 24 25            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Isn't it also plausiblethat the district will say, ten days is not a fair trialfor this system, this is a child with severe learning14JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think that's￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   disabilities and to give this IEP a fair chance we need2 ten months? 3               MR. FEINERMAN:  At that point those 4   arguments can be made under (C)(iii) and (C)(iv) because 5   at that point the child would no -- the parents would no 6   longer be categorically barred from seeking tuition 7   reimbursement and those are arguments that you can make 8   to the hearing officer. 9               JUSTICE SOUTER:  But you are basically10   saying that the -- that the only necessary delay in11   order to satisfy a condition for eligibility, if the12   parents otherwise prevail, is a ten-day delay.  That's13   basically your answer?14               MR. FEINERMAN:  I -- I don't think I'm15   saying that.  I'm saying --16               JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.17               JUSTICE SCALIA:  This school does not have18   to come up with an IEP.  It could tough it out and say,19   we're going to rest on our belief that this child does20   not need any special education, right?  And unless the21   school proposes an IEP, the parent cannot come within22   subsection (2) by sending the kid to get the special23   services.24               MR. FEINERMAN:  I think that assumes that25   the school district is not going to abide by the order15￼7 8 9saying, well, that assumes they won't obey the hearingofficer, what about before the hearing even takes place?            MR. FEINERMAN:  Right.  Before the hearingtakes place, there is 45 days, and then well, thehearing -- there's a request for a due process hearing,the hearing officer has 45 days, and then if the hearingofficer says this child is eligible, district, you mustpropose an IEP, the district has 30 days after that.2021   appeal.22232425MR. FEINERMAN:  Absolutely, the district can - Subject to Final Review1   of the independent hearing officer.  And in this -- in2 our case.3               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What about before?  The4   whole point is that under the words of the statute as5   you interpret it, there is a condition predicate that6   has to be satisfied.  So, to say that -- to answer by101112131415161718   That's the end of the road?  Can't the district say the19   hearing officer is wrong?            JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what happens in thecase where --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Could the district appeal?            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And if it does, does ithave to take any action in the interim.            MR. FEINERMAN:  I suppose it, yes, unless itgets a stay of the hearing officer's ruling.16￼ - Subject to Final Review1               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which is --2               MR. FEINERMAN:  But that didn't happen here3   and I am not aware of any cases which it did happen.  In4   this case there are two tracks.  The hearing officer5   said:  T.A. is eligible; prepare an IEP.  The district6   said:  I disagree; I'm going to appeal to the district7   court.89            But in t mean time, within less than 28days, t district prepared an IEP and offered it to T.A.And at that point T.A. could have accepted the services,thus rendering him eligible for tuition reimbursement.10111213   your answer to Justice Scalia.  What if the school board14   just was adamant that he is not entitled to any special15   education?  It just maintained that position throughout16   the litigation?JUSTICE STEVENS:  I still don't understand17               MR. FEINERMAN:  I think the assumption is18   that the school district would not abide by a lawful19   order of a hearing officer.20               JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, they got a stay and21   they wanted to appeal it.  And if they did what happens?22               MR. FEINERMAN:  In that situation there23   would be no -- and I'm not aware of that situation ever24   happening --25               JUSTICE STEVENS:  But they don't have a risk17￼ - Subject to Final Review1   under your view of the law as I understand it.  They2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9could take that position and they would never beliable -- never be liable.            MR. FEINERMAN:  There would be a delay inthat situation, but I'm not aware of any case where thatsituation -- where a school district.            JUSTICE STEVENS:  But that's the consequenceof your position as I understand it, that they could dothat and they would not have any risk of liability.1011121314   hypothetical when -- there are two prongs.  Number one,15   the school has to agree first with the diagnosis, which16   in this case they didn't even do that.  They had a good17   faith disagreement.  Second, they have to have an            MR. FEINERMAN:  I think that's ahypothetical risk, because again I haven't seen anysituations where that actually has occurred.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but it's not that18   adequate IEP.  So there are two conditions.19               MR. FEINERMAN:  That's true, and I think --20   I think the answer to the question -- it's really, this21   is really a legislative question.  Perhaps Congress22   ought to further amend the statute to say in those23   situations where a school district is being obstreperous24   in refusing to comply with the hearing officer's order,25   in those situations there is going to be an exception to18￼89 10if they do that, if I understand you correctly.            MR. FEINERMAN:  I -- I suppose - Subject to Final Review1   the exception.  But it's not -- it's not the statute2   that Congress wrote.  Congress wrote --3               JUSTICE STEVENS:  Doesn't your4   interpretation of the statute create an incentive for5   the school board to just say, we'll never provide any6   kind of education, special education, we will just tough7   it out?  Because they can't lose, they can't be liable     hypothetically it does, but my understanding is that11   that just doesn't happen.  In Schaffer v. Weast andother cases, the assumption --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Would you be surprised to12131415161718192021222324   subsection (ii).  Perhaps if there were a parallel25   Rehabilitation Act claim under 504, that might be a19find a court decision which says that when the reasonthat the plaintiff cannot comply with the requirementthat he first be in a plan, when the reason is -- is thedistrict's refusal to abide by an order to prepare aplan, that subsection (2) does not apply?MR. FEINERMAN:  Your --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  You can't profit by yourown malfeasance.            MR. FEINERMAN:  That's correct.  And I -- Idon't think there could be reimbursement under￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   vehicle to get relief in a situation where the school 2   district is acting as horribly as being hypothesized, 3   but not under -- 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you -- you don't think 5   -- you don't think a court could say the only reason 6   these people could not comply with (ii) is that the 7   school district made it impossible by not complying with 8   the order to provide an IEP; and, therefore, they -- 9   they can recover for the private placement?10               MR. FEINERMAN:  It's conceivable that --11   that a court could hold that.  A court could also --12               JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think it's more than13   conceivable.  I know a lot of courts that would hold14   that.15               JUSTICE SOUTER:  But your position is that16   there are basically two situations:  One, the situation17   in which there is an administrative order to do an IEP18   and the school district says, no, we won't do it.19   Millions for defense; we are going right into appeal,20   and we are not going to prepare the IEP.  In that21   situation, as I understand it, you are saying, the22   parents have no way of getting relief under the statute.23               In the case in which there is an order for24   the IEP and the school district prepares the IEP, even25   though the parents think it will be inadequate, there in20￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   fact is a ready remedy subject to two delays:  One, the 2   time to prepare the IEP; and, two, ten days to give it a 3   try before the parents take the kid out of school. 4   That's basically the scheme that you are proposing that 5   the statute provides; is -- is that correct? 6               MR. FEINERMAN:  That's the scheme that 7   Congress wrote in the statute, yes, under -- under 8   (C)(ii).  And it has to work that way, because -- I want 9   to come back to a -- to a point that was aired in the10   briefs, which is T.A.'s argument and the government's11   argument rests upon the notion that section12   1415(i)(2)(B)(iii) gives hearing officers the authority13   to award tuition reimbursement.  That provision doesn't14   give hearing officers any authority to do anything, let15   alone to award tuition reimbursement.16               The only provision in IDEA that gives17   hearing officers the authority to award tuition18   reimbursement is 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii).  So if the statute19   doesn't work -- the statute doesn't work, and the20   Secretary's interpretation of 1415(i)(2)(B)(iii) is21   implausible because it accords to hearing officers the22   authority that it doesn't have.23               There is another textual clue why the24   statute works in the way that I am suggesting, and that25   is in the '97 amendments in subsections (iii) and (iv)21￼23 24 25already has adopted that presumption in Schaffer v.good faith.be a clear and convincing evidence presumption that the22 - Subject to Final Review1   Congress gave very explicit guidance to courts and2   hearing officers as to the factors the court and hearing3   officer should consider when deciding whether to award4   tuition reimbursement to a student who previously5   received special education services.6               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The -- the problem that7   the government and the parents have is they have to give8   some work to (ii).  Under -- under their view (ii)9 10 11doesn't seem to do much work.            And the problem with your position is that     it seems in a way formalistic and in some cases to12   encourage intransigence.  If we adopted a presumption13   that the school district's diagnosis was correct and a14   presumption that it's -- if -- if there was a diagnosis15   of disability, that its individual education program was16   adequate, that would, it seems to me, not be all you17   wanted, but would ameliorate the position of the school18   district.  Would we have authority, do you think, toadopt such a presumption?            MR. FEINERMAN:  I think the -- the Court19202122   Weast.  School districts are presumed to be acting inJUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, this -- this would￼ - Subject to Final Review1   -- that the IEP is -- that the school district designs2   is right, that its diagnosis is right.  That's not all3 4 5 6 7 8 9you -- that's not all you would be asking for.            MR. FEINERMAN:  Well --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But would we haveauthority to do that if we were to reject yourinterpretation of the statute?            MR. FEINERMAN:  I suppose you would have theauthority to do that.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How have -- how have1011   hearing officers been proceeding?  I mean, here we had a12   case that went to a hearing officer.  There is no IEP13   when the hearing officer begins the process.  In the --14   on the eligibility or not, do hearing officers give15   deference to the school district and then -- so that's16   eligibility.  At the IEP stage, do they give deference17   to the student?18               MR. FEINERMAN:  There is some deference19   given to -- are you talking about the deference that the20   district court gives to the hearing officer?21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  No, the hearing officer.22   The hearing officer is the first-level decisionmaker.23   And the school board gives its reasons why it thinks the24   child is ineligible; the parent, the reasons that the25   child is eligible.  That's the threshold determination.23￼ - Subject to Final Review1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 911               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- why isn't it the12   case that the school's diagnosis is a related service13   under the statutory provision?  It seems to me to be            On that threshold determination ofeligibility, do hearing officers presume in favor of theschool district?            MR. FEINERMAN:  Not -- not in this case.  Inthis case under Oregon law at the time -- and this was apre-Schaffer decision -- the hearing officer put theburden of proof on the school --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel --                 MR. FEINERMAN:  -- on the question of10   eligibility.14151617   diagnosis is more in terms of eligibility.  It's18   under -- under (b)(6), the hearing officer can decide --19   can consider issues of identification, eligibility, and20   placement.21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, I'm talking22   about what the parents received.  And they receive a23   diagnosis, and the statute covers -- asks whether they24   previously received special education and related25   services.  Diagnosis would seem to me to be a service24very important service to the parents to know what theschool's diagnosis is.MR. FEINERMAN:  I -- I think that the￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   related to special education. 2               MR. FEINERMAN:  I -- I don't think that's 3   the way it works.  A diagnosis -- a finding of 4   eligibility or not is not a diagnosis.  It is just an 5   eligibility finding, and that's something that the 6   parents can take to a -- a due process hearing under7 1415(f). 8               If there are no further questions, I will 9   reserve the remainder of my time.10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.11               Mr. Salmons.12               ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS13                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT14               MR. SALMONS:  That you, Mr. Chief Justice,15   and may it please the Court:16               The school district in this case improperly17   denied T.A., a child with a disability who had always18   been enrolled in public schools, access to all public19   special education services.  It asserts that because its20   wrong eligibility determinations prevented T.A. from21   receiving special education services, it is immune from22   reimbursing T.A.'s parents the cost of obtaining those23   services from another source.24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What is wrong with25   ten days?  I mean it's -- it's a big expense you are25￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   asking the school district to incur, that will take away 2   funds from other programs.  And all -- all they are 3   saying is give it a try for ten days, and if it doesn't 4   work out, then you can go? 5               MR. SALMONS:  I think there are several 6   problems with that reading of the statute, Your Honor. 7   First of all, the ten-day period that is referenced in 8   subsection (C)(iii) refers to the amount of notice that 9   a district needs to receive before a child is removed10   from the public school system.11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, yes, the first12   day -- the first day they say, look, we don't think this13   is going to work out, so we are notifying you what we14   are going to do.  And they say, well, you've got to do15   that in ten days, and they said, okay, ten days.16               MR. SALMONS:  But that's -- that's simply17   not the way these things work as a general matter, and18   let me just point out a few things about the normal19   process of developing IEP's.  And, again, here the child20   never even got that far.  But, typically, IEP's are21   developed at the end of the -- of a school year for the22   following year.  And the parents at that point have a23   period of time in which to decide to go along with that24   plan or to give notice and then make alternative25   arrangements.26￼ - Subject to Final Review1234   they decide that's what they want to do.  And if you5   wait until the school year has already started, those6   may not be available.  And the ten-day notice            And it's simply the -- I mean -- and that'sthe way it works, because it's important for parents tobe able to get their child in an alternative program if 7   requirement -- 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I suppose 9   that's right, but once the law is clarified, schools10   that specialize in -- in treating these kids would be11   able -- they would understand as well, and they would12   understand you've got to -- the people who are going to13   be sending -- most of the people who will be sending14   their children to the school have to wait ten days.  And15   it seems to me that the actual practice on the ground16   would work out pretty easily.17               MR. SALMONS:  But, again, Your Honor, if you18   focus on the terms of the statute, the -- even under19   Petitioner's reading, the requirement would be to have20   previously received special education services, not to21   have tried out a particular plan.22               It may be the case that the plan for the23   upcoming year is -- is very different than the plan for24   the prior year.  Perhaps they have had another25   assessment, and they had substantially changed --27￼ - Subject to Final Review 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, which way does 2   that cut?  It seems to me that cuts the other way. 3               MR. SALMONS:  Well, I -- 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Here's a -- here's a 5   new plan.  We've worked on it.  Here it is.  At least 6   give it ten days -- two school week tries. 7               MR. SALMONS:  I think the way that cuts, 8   Your Honor, is -- is that that reading of what you are 9   positing, I guess, in this exchange what Congress might10   have had in mind, is not what they said in the statute.11   They did not require parents to try out a particular12   plan; just that at some point in time they had13   previously received special education services.14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  With respect,15   counsel, what Congress provided is that the child must16   have previously received special education and related17   services.181920212223   that is the subject of the IEP, Your Honor.  That --24   that connection does not exist in the statute.  And --25   and we think it's counter to what Congress intended.28MR. SALMONS:  That's right.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So I think they didprovide that you've got to try it out at least for aminimal period.MR. SALMONS:  But not the particular plan￼ - Subject to Final Review 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  So what type 2   of special education services do you think do count as 3   having been previously received? 4               MR. SALMONS:  Well -- well, if I -- if I 5   may, the way we read this provision, and it's set forth 6   on pages 3 and 4 on the addendum to the blue brief, and 7   we think it's important that we read this as a whole and 8   in context, is that subsection (C)(i) provides the 9   general rule to govern the payment of private school10   tuition based on a unilateral placement by the parents.11   And subsection (C)(i) creates the only expressed12   limitation on the right to reimbursement, and it does so13   only in instances where the school district has provided14   a free and appropriate public education.15               We think subsection (C)(ii), (C)(iii), and16   (C)(iv) work together to govern the subset of cases that17   is Congress was most concerned about and that, in fact,18   are the most common scenario in which these disputes19   have arised.20               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Except that you are reading21   (C)(i) to say something that it doesn't say.  It just22 23 24 25says you don't have to pay if the agency has made a freeappropriate public education available.            MR. SALMONS:  That is what --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you read it to say you29￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   must pay whenever it hasn't made, and it just doesn't 2   say that.  It -- it's a safe harbor for the school 3   district.  It says, so long as you've made an 4   appropriate public education available, you can't be 5   liable for any -- any private school tuition. 6               Now, you want to expand that to say, and 7   whenever that condition doesn't exist, you are liable. 8   But it really doesn't say that.  And -- and the later 9   sections suggest that it meant not to say that.10               MR. SALMONS:  Well, that's where we part11   company, Your Honor, because, in fact, that negative12   inference that you refer to is precisely what13   Petitioners attempt to read into subsection (C)(ii).14   There is nothing in subsection (C)(ii) that provides any15   restriction on the ability to obtain reimbursement.  It16   was written in permissive language.17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In reading -- in18   reading it that way, you are reading the phrase "who19   previously received special education services" to mean20   also who previously did not receive special education21 services.22 23 24 25            MR. SALMONS:  No, Your Honor.  We are simplynot reading that language "who previously received" tobe a condition precedent.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah, so it doesn't30￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   matter whether they previously received or not. 2               MR. SALMONS:  It does matter, Your Honor, 3   because the provisions that follow in (C)(iii) and 4   (C)(iv) that guide the exercise of discretion, in that 5   category of cases that were of concern to Congress, only 6   apply to the cases that are defined in subsection 7   (C)(ii).  So in our reading the language "who previously 8   received" still serves an important purpose, but it 9   serves an identifying purpose for the limiting factors10   provided in (C)(iii) and (C)(iv).  It does not serve --11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you are saying12   Congress went to the trouble of spelling out this13   elaborate provision in (C)(iii) and (ii) and all the14   other things, but that was not the universe of the15   situations in which there could be reimbursement?  They16   went to that trouble, but then -- at the end you want to17   say or some other provisions or some other18   circumstances?19               MR. SALMONS:  Well, that's right.  We think20   that Congress was focused on a particular set of cases21   where problems had arisen, and that's where you already22   had a child in the process of receiving special23   education and you had parents who removed the child out24   of that process without giving adequate notice, and25   thereby short -- excuse me -- short-circuiting an31￼ - Subject to Final Review1   ongoing collaborative relationship that Congress wanted2   to preserve.3               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but if -- if you avoid4   that collaborative relationship entirely and just run5   off to a prior -- to a private school right away, you6   get reimbursement.  Why?7 8 91011   automatically get reimbursement, Your Honor.  There is12   just no categorical bar to seeking reimbursement.  You            MR. SALMONS:  Well you don't automaticallyget reimbursement.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why would Congress -- huh?MR. SALMONS:  You don't -- you don't1314151617181920212223   help.  It seems to me that (a)(10) large (A) and then24   (F) have something to do with the parent who never goes25   to public school, the child just goes to private schoolsstill have to show it's an appropriate remedy, whichalways has been understood to require a showing that theparents acted reasonably and in good faith, and thatthey were sincere in their efforts to obtain servicesfrom the school.JUSTICE BREYER:  What about more than that?MR. SALMONS:  The alternative --JUSTICE BREYER:  Why not -- I mean,suppose -- the part I don't understand in this statute,which may not be relevant -- I would appreciate the32￼ - Subject to Final Review1   to begin with, and they get something.  If they have --2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9if they have a disability, this program pays themsomething, right.            MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm not following this.  Idon't know what section.            JUSTICE BREYER:  It's at the very beginning,at the end of addendum page 1.            JUSTICE BREYER:  What is that?            MR. SALMONS:  This is what's -- Your Honor,this is what's known as the child find provision.101112131415161718192021222324   for those children.  And for those children who are not25   enrolled in public school, you have to use a percentage33            MR. SALMONS:  What it provides is thatfor -- let me just step back for a moment and remind theCourt that the obligation on the State is to ensure thatchildren, all children with disabilities, regardless ofwhether they are in public or private school, have theopportunity for a free appropriate public education.            With respect to children in private schoolwho are not seeking a free appropriate public schooleducation from the public school district, the onlyrequirement under the Act is that you seek them out, youfind them, you identify them, and that you report thatto the Department of Education, and that you get money￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9of the funds you receive from the Federal Government --            JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So in otherwords --            MR. SALMONS: -- to provide benefits that areavailable to all children.            JUSTICE BREYER:  -- a parent who has adisabled child who never thinks about the public schoolsystem still gets some money, but not as much, for thedisabled child? - Subject to Final ReviewMR.

SALMONS:  It goes to the public schools,25   that they provide services that they may make available34Your Honor.            JUSTICE BREYER:  To the school.JUSTICE BREYER:  It's money to the school.            MR. SALMONS:  It funds programs, for examplespeech therapy or something like that.            MR. SALMONS:  That they would then allowchildren in private school to -- to benefit from.            JUSTICE BREYER:  And so, it's money thatgoes to the school for a program?            MR. SALMONS:  It's not even necessarilymoney that goes to the private school.JUSTICE BREYER:  Money that the children can￼ - Subject to Final Review1234   statute?  You say, parents, if you are going to a5   disabled child, you simply go to a private school, you6   get the services you just mentioned.to children regardless of their placement.            JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now, would itthen work, what is -- would this system work under the 7               Now, if you put in -- put the child in a 8   public school, and they find a free appropriate public 9   education, fine, that's the end of that, you have to do10   it.  Now, if they don't give you a decent one, you can,11   you can send the child to a private school, but it12   has -- you have to give it a shot to the public school13 system.14               Now, that's what you don't want the15   interpretation to be?  You don't -- you are against16   that.  But -- but let's amend it a little.17               MR. SALMONS:  That's not -- I would not18   describe it that way, Your Honor, if I -- I don't mean19   to --2021222324   mind the facts of this case.  This is a child who was in25   the public school system --35            JUSTICE BREYER:  I am reading the language.You may require the district to pay for someone who hasbeen enrolled in special services --MR. SALMONS:  I mean, again, just keep in￼ - Subject to Final Review1               JUSTICE BREYER:  You haven't heard my2   amendment. 3 4 5 6 7 8   is need to put that child in a public school now.  In 9   other words, special equitable circumstances that make10   it reasonable for the parent not to give the school a11   shot, though that's the norm.  And in those unusual12   circumstances, there would remain grounds for equitable13   relief.Go ahead.MR. SALMONS:  Okay.  I'm sorry, Your Honor.            JUSTICE BREYER:  My amendment is the normwill be give the public school a shot, but there couldbe circumstances, you're getting the run-around, there1415161718   that.  Because, the school district -- just again, take19   this --            What about that as an overall interpretationof the statute which has several parts to it?            MR. SALMONS:  I would submit that the way weread the statute, Your Honor, in fact, does precisely20               JUSTICE BREYER:  But you have to be willing21   to accept that it's an unusual situation, though it may22   well exist, that the judge is going to reimburse the23   parent where that parent didn't give the public school a24   shot.  They will have to show there is a good reason for25   not doing that.36￼ - Subject to Final Review1234567   district always has a shot under the Act.  In this case,8   the school district assessed the child in 2001 and again9   in 2003, and both times it erroneously concludedMR. SALMONS:  The -- the difficulty IJUSTICE BREYER:  Is that all right with youMR. SALMONS:  Well, the difficulty I havehave --or not?with your question, Your Honor, is that the school10   that the child --11               JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, you are simply saying12   that it was reasonable for the parent here.  I'm not13   asking that question.14               MR. SALMONS:  No, not just that it's15   reasonable, but in the process of assessing the child,16   in developing an individual education plan that is17   appropriate for that child, that is precisely the shot18   that the statute gives the public school system to get19   it right.  What the statute does --20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Salmons, I thought21   that the -- the courts, the district court, will not22   provide for tuition reimbursement, unless at least two23   things are shown.  One is that the school district did24   not provide an adequate education for this child.  And25   two, that the private school did, and then there are37￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   That is what this Court held in Carter.  That's what the 9   regulations say.  I would note that there is nothing in10   the text of the statute and the provisions that11   Petitioner relies on, (C)(ii) for example, that makes it12   a statutory requirement to show that the private13   placement is reasonable as a -- as a condition precedent14   to obtain tuition reimbursement.  But both sides concede15   that that's required, even though it's not in the16   statute.17               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But procedurally we -- we18   know that there is a provision addressed to a court for19   equitable relief.  The question was put before:  Where20   does the hearing officer get the authority to order21   tuition reimbursement?  Because the statute on which you22   rely for the court speaks only to the court's authority.23               MR. SALMONS:  Thank you, Your Honor.  I am24   happy to answer that question.  But Petitioner makes25   this a centerpiece of their reply brief and I think they38equitable considerations.            MR. SALMONS:  That is absolutely correct.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So you must find both,not just that the private school was a good place, butthat the school district did not offer an adequateeducation for the child.MR. SALMONS:  That is -- that is correct.￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   just misread the statute.  And again, keep in mind that 2   these amendments in 1997 were written against a backdrop 3   of this longstanding statute and this Court's 4   interpretations of it.  The most direct place where the 5   statute provides hearing officers the authority to hear 6   address reimbursement claims and to award 7   reimbursement -- and this is on page 9 of the addendum 8   in the blue brief -- is 1415(b)(6).  This has always 9   been in the statute and it states that the parents must10   be provided an opportunity to present complaints with11   respect to "any matter relating to the identification,12   evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or13   the provision of a free appropriate public education to14   such child."15               That is -- again, that has always been16   understood to include the right to seek reimbursement17   before the hearing officer.  And this Court in18   Burlington cited legislative history from the 1975 Act19   that noted that hearing officers could award20   reimbursement and address such claims in concluding that21   it was part of the appropriate relief that courts ought22   to be able to have under 1415.23               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Are any of these other24   procedures -- I took these to be procedures that have to25   be provided by the school district, not -- not by the39￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   hearing officer. 2               MR. SALMONS:  These are -- these are 3   required -- this whole section, Your Honor, 1412, is 4   entitled "State Eligibility," and these are all 5   requirements that States have to provide for process in 6   order to obtain funds under the Act, and so it is a 7   requirement that States provide hearing officers that 8   have the ability to award reimbursement -- 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it doesn't say hearing10   officers.  "An opportunity to present complaints with11121314151617   referenced elsewhere in the statute.  I believe18   Petitioner would agree with me that that's what this19   references.20               JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but the reference is to21   a right to be heard on certain subjects.  It doesn't say22   anything about authorizing a particular individual or23   officer within a school system to award relief.  The24   problem is, it says you can be heard.  It doesn't say25   who will tell you or who will tell the school district40respect to any matter relating to the identification" --            MR. SALMONS:  Those complaints --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- to present the complaintto the principal.            MR. SALMONS:  No, Your Honor.  This is areference to the due process complaint notice that is￼ - Subject to Final Review 1 2 3 4   and this is at page 17 of the addendum.  The right to 5   file a Federal action is limited to those matters that 6   are raised in the due process complaint notice filed 7   before the hearing officer.  This is an exhaustion 8   requirement. 9               JUSTICE SOUTER:  But can you raise the --10   you can raise the claim to eligibility to a -- a private11   education here without the hearing officer having the12   authority to order the school district to provide it.13               MR. SALMONS:  That has not been the14   interpretation of this Act, Your Honor, and I would15   refer the Court to 34 CFR 300.148(b), which is a16   regulation that states that hearing officers can award17   reimbursement and that has been around since the mid-18   1980s.  My point is that is -- the Congress enacted19   these amendments in 1997 against a subtle understanding20   of how this Act works.  And it's always been understood21   that hearing officers can award reimbursement.  There22   was no need to provide in the '97 amendments that23   hearing officers can also award relief.24               And again because it's an -- it's an25   exhaustion requirement and the judicial review provision41to write a check.            MR. SALMONS:  Right.  But keep in mind thatthe judicial review process that the statute provides --￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   only relates to the things that you have raised before 2   the hearing officer, it makes no sense to say a court 3   can award reimbursement but you can't get reimbursement 4   from the hearing officer.  That's the subject of the 5   review of the Federal court action. 6               JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but it might make 7   senses to say that the hearing officer can determine 8   eligibility; it is then up to the school to pay it; and 9   if the school does not pay it, then you have got to go10   into court and get an award.11               MR. SALMONS:  In fact, Your Honor, the12   hearing officers have always been permitted to award13   reimbursement, as occurred in this case, and then the14   school district can decide either to pay that or to seek15   review if they -- if they so choose.16               JUSTICE SCALIA:  And it might make also17   sense to say that if the hearing officer has no18   authority to award a certain type of relief, neither19   does a court, under that general provision that --20               MR. SALMONS:  But of course this Court in21   Burlington held the court did have that authority and it22   relied on the fact that it has always been understood23   that hearing officers have that authority in reaching24   that conclusion in Burlington.25               JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's right, but -- but42￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9with these new provisions, if the hearing officerdoesn't have the authority to award the kind of reliefthat was awarded here, then the court wouldn't either.            MR. SALMONS:  Well, I -- with respect, Ithink there is nothing in the '97 amendments --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you agree they go, aswe say, in pari passu --            MR. SALMONS:  Well, I do think that itdoesn't make sense to say -- - Subject to Final Review10111213141516   together, yes, Your Honor.  But I think they ought to be17   read to provide for the authority to provide tuition18   reimbursement.19               One statutory point I would like to make,20   Your Honor, is that under Petitioner's reading of the21   Act, if you read (C)(ii) to be -- that reference to "who22   previously received" to be an absolute precondition,23   then I think it's the case that (C)(i) has no meaning24   whatsoever.  It does not work under the Act at all.25   Whereas on our reading of the statute, (C)(ii) still43            JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that -- that whateverthe hearing officer can do, the court can do.MR. SALMONS:  I think generally --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- and whatever he can'tdo, the court can't do.MR. SALMONS:  I think they ought to be read￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   does work.  It's not a precondition; it doesn't do the 2   work that Petitioner suggests; it does a more limited -- 3   serve a more limited function, but it still serves that 4   identifying role for the factors Congress wanted applied 5   when it was focused on how to preserve relationships, 6   ongoing collaborative relationships through the IEP 7   process that warrant preservation. 8               One other point I make, Your Honor, and 9   Justice Scalia, you make reference to this principle of10   equity, that you ought not be allowed to prevent11   something from happening and then come into court and12   claim, "Ha, ha, they didn't satisfy a condition."  And13   that was a point that was made by Justice Cardozo in the14   R.H. Stearns case that we rely on, where he said he who15   prevents a thing from being done may not avail himself16   of the nonperformance which he himself has occasioned.17               That's precisely what happened here.  As18   this case to this Court, it is established that is a19   child who was entitled to receive special education20   services back in 2001.  The only reason he did not21   receive those services is because the district violated22   its statutory duties --23               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought in 2001 even24   the parents agreed that he didn't -- that they didn't25   want to put him in special education?44￼ - Subject to Final Review 1               MR. SALMONS:  The parents agreed, Your 2   Honor, that he did not qualify for the learning 3   disabilities they tested him for, but they had an 4   obligation under the Act -- and this was found by the 5   hearing officer and the complaint that was filed was 6   filed within the two-year limitation to challenge that 7   2001 determination, and that that was there, they had an 8   obligation to test him for those other health 9   impairments at that time.10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.11               MR. SALMONS:  Thank you.12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Miller.13                ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER14                ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,15                       AS AMICUS CURIAE,16                   SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT17               MR. MILLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it18   please the Court:19               Had Petitioner provided T.A. a special20   education that was later determined to be inadequate,21   there would be no question that the district court would22   have authority and discretion to determine whether an23   award of private school tuition reimbursement was24   appropriate.  Petitioner's view is that because it25   offered no special education at all, it was therefore45￼1011121314151617   Or --1819202122232425            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  "Stonewall" soundsto me like bad faith. - Subject to Final Review1   categorically immune from such an award.  That position2   is not supported by the statute and it's inconsistent3   with the reasonable interpretation of the Secretary of4 Education.56789   right?  Even assuming the bad faith that you are            There is no basis for reading the statute tocreate what effectively would be an incentive fordistricts to stonewall and to say that if they don't --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, for 10 days,ascribing to the school district, it would only work for10 days, right?            MR. MILLER:  Well --            MR. MILLER:  We were not assuming bad faith.            MR. MILLER:  Well there --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That was the wordyou used.            MR. MILLER:  I -- Congress -- there is noreason to suppose that Congress wanted to create anincentive or to reward districts that do do that.46            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And then they wouldhave -- then they would have previously received specialeducation services, and they could proceed.￼ - Subject to Final Review 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But we are talking about 2   two different things.  I think the Chief was talking 3   about putting the child in special education, and 4   keeping the child there for 10 days.  You are talking 5   about the school district that says "no special 6   education; this child is not eligible." 7               MR. MILLER:  That's absolutely right.  So in 8   a case like this, there is -- there is nothing to try 9   for 10 days because the district has found him not10   eligible, they haven't offered any special education or11   related services.  Now to the extent --1213141516171819202122232425            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, let's move tothe situation where they have a plan that the parentsregard as inadequate.            MR. MILLER:  In the case --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In that situationall they would have to do is to have the child try theplan for 10 days.            MR. MILLER:  Well if the -- to the extentthat there is an interest in having parents try out theplan, Petitioner's reading of the statute is poorlytailored to that objective, because it doesn't requirethat they try the specific plan that's being proposedfor 10 days.            Even under Petitioner's reading the statute47￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   simply would require that the child at some point have 2   received some special education and related services. 3   It wouldn't have to be under the plan that was being 4   tried.  And -- 5               JUSTICE SOUTER:  But the odds are that it 6   would be under the plan.  I mean, what you say is 7   theoretically possible, but in the real world it's 8   probably going to be under the plan, isn't it? 9               MR. MILLER:  Well, not necessarily because10   there's a new plan at least once a year under the11   statute, and they are typically proposed at the end of a12   school year for the start of the new school year.  So13   there wouldn't be, on Petitioner's reading, a14   requirement that you show up for the first 10 days of15   the new year; you would just have to give notice after16   the IEP is proposed in May or June.  You give your 1017   days' notice.  You receive special education services18   under the old plan, under the previous year.  And under19   -- on Petitioner's reading, the statute would be no20   barrier to reimbursement there.21               Now, of course, the district courts do have22   considerable equitable discretion, and we're not23   suggesting that reimbursement would be mandatory in that24   case or in any case.  And --25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And the parents -- I48￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   think you agree that the parents would have the burden 2   of showing both that the school did not provide an 3   adequate education, an appropriate education, and that 4   the private school does? 5               MR. MILLER:  That's -- that's absolutely 6   right.  And they would also, in our view, have to show 7   the district court that they had genuinely cooperated 8   with the public school in making their child available 9   for evaluation --10               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose we thought it were11   sensible to add to that burden the further rule that the12   school district is presumed to have made the correct13   diagnosis and, if there is a plan in that kind of case,14   that the plan was adequate, and that the parent would15   have to show by clear and convincing evidence that this16   is not so, rather than just inventing it and pulling it17   out of the sky.18               Is -- is there some authority in the statute19   that would give us warrant to do that?  Or is there20   some -- any cases that would give us warrant to -- to21   establish a presumption of that kind in order to22   recognize the long-standing expertise of the States in23   this matter and in order to allow section (ii) to do24 some work?2549MR. MILLER:  Well, a clear and convincing￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   evidence presumption would be difficult to reconcile, I 2   think, with 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii), which says that the 3   district court decision should be based on the 4   preponderance of the evidence, but it is certainly 5   within the district court's discretion and it would be 6   within this Court's discretion, I think, to prescribe 7   principles to guide the exercise of the district courts' 8   equitable discretion -- 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The district court10   doesn't get into the act until the hearing officer is11 done.12               MR. MILLER:  Right.13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And so it would be odd to14   have a presumption applicable in court that isn't also15   applicable to the hearing officer, because the court is16   reviewing a decision by the hearing officer.17               MR. MILLER:  Right.  Well, the -- the18   standard in both stages of the proceeding is by a19   preponderance of the evidence, and the parents, as the20   party challenging what the school has done, have the21   burden.  But at both stages, it would be appropriate to22   consider whether they were genuinely seeking a free23   appropriate public education, and I think it would be24   entirely appropriate and consistent with the25   preponderance standard for the hearing officer or the50￼ - Subject to Final Reviewcourt to take due account of the fact that the schooldistrict has some expertise and to give some deferenceto what it has proposed.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  (i)(2)(B)(iii) --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is the department --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  (i)(2)(B)(iii)?            MR. MILLER:  Oh, it's (i)(2)(B) -- it's been12345678   amended in 2004.  There's no change in the language, 9101112131415but it's now --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's now (C)?            MR. MILLER:  (C).            JUSTICE SCALIA:  (C)(iii).            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Does the -- does thedepartment have a regulation that says the hearing     officer may order the private school -- the parents to16   be reimbursed for private school tuition?  Because it's17   not in the statute.18               MR. MILLER:  34 C.F.R. 300.148(b) says that19   disagreements between the parents and a public agency20   regarding the availability of a program appropriate for21   the child and the question of financial reimbursement22   are subject to the due process hearing procedures.  So23   yes, that regulation gives hearing officers the24   authority to award reimbursement, as indeed the hearing25   officer had done Burlington.  Burlington was the case51￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   where the reimbursement award was made in the first 2   instance by a hearing officer, and, of course, the Court 3   held that that was appropriate.  And -- 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, this is 5   Spending Clause legislation.  Do you have any rough idea 6   of how much of the obligation incurred by the States is 7   reimbursed by the Federal Government?  What percentage? 8               MR. MILLER:  I think of the additional costs 9   of treating special education children, above those of10   educating other children, I think approximately11   10 percent, 10 to 12 percent, is reimbursed by the12   Federal Government.13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if this14   interpretation vastly expands the liability of school15   districts in that particular area, isn't that a16   consideration we should consider?  Since they accept --17   the States accept 10 percent of the funds to incur these18   obligations and then you are expanding the obligation in19   a way that we may at least find is ambiguous, isn't that20   a pertinent factor?21               MR. MILLER:  There's no basis for supposing22   that there would be a vast expansion of liability, and23   there are some statistics on this in the National24   Disability Rights Network's amicus brief at pages 13 and25   14.  Of about 6 million children in the United States52￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   who are receiving special education, barely 1 percent of 2   those are in private placements, and the vast majority 3   of those are agreed-upon placements between school 4   districts and the parents.  So this sort of unilateral 5   private placement is quite rare, because, first, the 6   parents do it at their own financial risk, and so 7   there's a real barrier to parents doing it, because they 8   have to be pretty sure that they are right and that they 9   are going to be able to meet the demanding standards of10   -- satisfying the district court that an award of11   tuition reimbursement is appropriate, and if they don't12 do that --13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If the --14               MR. MILLER:  -- they're going to be --15               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If the parents are16   entitled and the child is entitled to the special17   education and the school doesn't give it, and there are18   two schools -- private schools in the community, A and19   B.  A charges, what is it, $5,200 a month tuition; the20   other is considerably less.  And they both have adequate21   programs for the child.  Is the hearing examiner22   entitled to reimburse only for the lower amount, or is23   the parent entitled to send the child to the -- to the24   more expensive school?25               MR. MILLER:  No.  What this Court said in53￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   Carter is that it's appropriate for the hearing officer 2   to take into account whether the cost of the private 3   education was unreasonable.  So in a situation where you 4   had two basically equivalent schools, that would 5   certainly be an appropriate thing for the hearing 6   officer to take into account in limiting or denying 7   reimbursement. 8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Or there could be, I 9   suppose, an order that any tuition in excess of a10   certain amount would be the parents' responsibility.11               MR. MILLER:  That's -- that's right.  That12   would be within the discretion of the hearing officer.13               In a case like this, where you have a14   residential placement and the residential component of15   it -- there has been no suggestion that that was -- had16   some educational purpose or was a part of providing an17   appropriate education, it would also be appropriate for18   the court to decide to disaggregate that and say we are19   only paying -- the school district only has to pay for20   the educational component.21               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let me be clear.  Am I22   correct that under -- under the theory of the statute23   that you are supporting, it would be possible for a24   parent, without first consulting with the school at all,25   to put the child in a private school and then later to54￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9request public school services, and when it is -- whenthey are denied or they are inadequate, all that publicschool -- private school tuition would be reimbursable?            MR. MILLER:  There would be no categoricalbar in the statute in that situation, but a districtcourt confronted with those facts would most likelyconclude that the parents had not genuinely sought afree appropriate public education and hadn'tappropriately cooperated with the school district. - Subject to Final ReviewCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.MR. MILLER:  Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Feinerman, you10111213141516171819   we have heard today for the first time.  T.A. and the20   government are resting their argument that tuition21   reimbursement is permitted in the unilateral placement22   context to students who had not previous received.  The23   regulation 300.148 -- counsel referenced subsection (b),24   Disagreements about FAPE, and it does say that the25   hearing officer can consider the question of financial55have 4 minutes remaining.         REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GARY S. FEINERMAN   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. FEINERMAN:  Thank you,Mr. Chief Justice.            I'd like to address the two provisions that￼ - Subject to Final Review1   reimbursement.  And the very next subsection, (c), is2   entitled Reimbursement for Private School Placement, and3   that provision speaks only to students who previously4   received special education and related services under5   the authority of a public agency. 6 7   this? 8               MR. FEINERMAN:  This isn't -- this 9   regulation was brought up at argument.  It's not in any10   of the addendums, but I -- I would direct the Court's11   attention to subsection (c) of 300.148.12               In terms of the -- the provision that T.A.'s13   lawyer addressed, 1415(b)(6), no argument -- there's no14   argument in the briefs that 1415(b)(6) gives hearing15   officers the authority to grant tuition reimbursement in16   these circumstances.  The Department of Education did17   not rely on this provision when articulating its18   commentary that tuition reimbursement is still permitted19   under these circumstances.  The Secretary of Education20   relied upon the 1415(i)(2)(B)(iii) provision.  That of21   course, refers only to courts.22               And even if the argument were properly23   presented, which it isn't, it would be subject to the24   same dynamic that's in play with respect to25   1412(a)(10)(C)(ii).  You have a very general provision56JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Where are you reading￼ - Subject to Final Review 1   giving hearing officers authority.  Congress got 2   specific in 1997.  There's a heading -- enacted a 3   provision under the heading Reimbursement for Private 4   School Placement.  I think that clearly indicates that's 5   where Congress intended to repose the authority of 6   hearing officers to order tuition reimbursement to 7   unilaterally placed children. 8               We also have the -- and -- and it just 9   doesn't work to say that 1415(i)(2)(B)(iii) somehow10   gives hearing officers authority.  Even if it were11   interpreted that way prior to 1997, in 1997 Congress12   enacted the statute that expressly referenced hearing13   officers and courts, and allowed both of them to give14   tuition reimbursement.  So even if 1415 were interpreted15   prior to '97 -- incorrectly, we would submit -- to give16   hearing officers that authority, after 1997 where17   Congress actually went to the trouble of saying hearing18   officers and courts can give tuition reimbursement in19   certain circumstances, that -- that prior20   interpretation, whatever its merits back then, no longer21 is valid --22               JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, what happens -- what23   happens if the hearing officer can't, but why couldn't24   the court?  I mean, they see an unusual situation.  The25   parents were justified, and it doesn't say there are no57￼ - Subject to Final Review1   circumstances other than -- where you couldn't -- where2   they may not pay.  So the judge says, I think this is a3 4 5 6 7 8 9situation where it is -- it is equitable to pay the --the reimbursement.            MR. FEINERMAN:  That's correct, but --            JUSTICE BREYER:  Why not?  What says youcan't do that, other than your basic point about the"may require"?            MR. FEINERMAN:  The Spending Clause, theheadings that Congress used --10111213141516171819202122   to get tuition reimbursement.  Is it conceivable that23 24 25that that could be the system --            JUSTICE BREYER:  You're saying the statutesays the hearing officer can't do that no matter what.58            JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  But anyway, theregs don't say anything about that.            MR. FEINERMAN:  At any rate -- and it's asystem that doesn't make any sense, because for childrenwho did previously receive and go to the hearing officerto challenge either an eligibility determination or animproper IEP, the hearing officer could award tuitionreimbursement, but for children who didn't previouslyreceive and then they went in front of the hearingofficer, they would have to -- I don't know what theword would be -- appeal to the district court in order￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425That's a separate argument.            MR. FEINERMAN:  That's correct, but I'msaying if --            JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.            MR. FEINERMAN:  If T.A. is right, that wouldbe the system.            Thank you very much.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.            The case is submitted.            (Whereupon, at 11:16 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.) -
