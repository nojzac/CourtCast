Secret Catalogue, Inc.Mr. Higgins.ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. HIGGINS, JR.ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. HIGGINS: Mr. Chief Justice and may itplease the Court, counsel:We are here today to obtain a construction ofthe Federal Trademark Dilution Act, FTDA, that will keep Federal trademark law in its proper bounds. We submit that can be accomplished by choosing objective proof over supposition and inference to guide future FTDA cases. This case from the Sixth Circuit involves a non-identical, non-confusing trademark operating in the remote reaches of the economy that was nevertheless enjoined under the FTDA, and demonstrates the dangers of an unchecked FTDA.QUESTION: You mean Tennessee is remote, or this particular business is?(Laughter.)QUESTION: Kentucky.MR. HIGGINS: Your Honor, this case actually￼31 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425came from Kentucky, and --QUESTION: Oh, well, Kentucky --MR. HIGGINS: -- I suppose that's even more remote than Tennessee in some cases.(Laughter.)QUESTION: Was there a Victoria's Secret in thistown?MR. HIGGINS: There was not at the beginning of this case. The closest one was 60 miles away.We say that the result --QUESTION: In Tennessee?(Laughter.)MR. HIGGINS: We say that the result below iscontrary to the actual words that Congress used in the FTDA, namely the plain words, causes dilution. If this result stands, the FTDA threatens to usher in an anti-competitive expansion of trademark law into patent- like realm.Perhaps the best example of that is the Second Circuit's Nabisco decision, urged in part here by respondents, which involved a goldfish-shaped cracker, and it -- the court there applied the FTDA to grant exclusionary rights in an unpatented, uncopyrighted design of a product to enjoin a product that they said diluted. That is contrary to this Court's two most recent decisions￼41 involving Federal trademark law, the Wal-Mart decision and2 the TrafFix Devices decision.3 QUESTION: Before you -- just would you spend4 one minute -- it would help me a lot if you explained to5 me what dilution is, and I'll be specific. It seems to me6 what you have here is a case of what's called tarnishment,7 and what tarnishment -- what I think of is this, is it8 like this, that -- that -- imagine some small shop wants9 to start a bug spray business. It's a funny example, but10 it comes from an actual case, and they decide to call11 themselves Bugwiser Bug Spray, and their slogan is, Where12 there's life, there's bugs, all right.13 (Laughter.)14 QUESTION: Now, Budweiser is not going to enter15 the bug spray business. Nobody thinks Budweiser, in fact,16 is the source of the bug spray, but Budweiser has an17 interest because the people who see this ad are going to18 think Budweiser, yuck, and they don't want people to think19 that. Now, is dilution encompassed? Does dilution20 encompass that, and my reason for thinking maybe it21 doesn't is, the words of the statute refer to22 distinctiveness of mark. They don't refer to tarnishment.23 But -- is it -- so I want some explanation of what24 dilution here refers to.25 MR. HIGGINS: There's a lot of people who want￼51 explanation of what dilution is, and their tarnishment2 aspect of dilution is part of the legislative history. It3 is not expressed in the words that Congress used to define4 dilution. Congress defined dilution as the lessening of5 the capacity of a famous mark to identify and distinguish6 the goods or services to which the famous mark --7 QUESTION: But you believe --8 QUESTION: Which wouldn't include tarnishment.9 Which wouldn't include tarnishment. I mean, it can still10 identify Budweiser beer very, very well.11 MR. HIGGINS: Well, it could identify Budweiser12 beer, but the -- the -- our point about this case is that13 there needs to be objective evidence that consumers, in14 fact, identify the accused mark with the famous mark. In15 other words, we say that section 43(c)(1) of the FTDA in16 its words causes dilution, imposes a causal connection17 between the accused mark and the beneficiary.18 QUESTION: All right, excuse me, before you go19 back to cause, which is your main point which I want to20 hear, I do -- I'm assuming now that for purposes of this21 case anyway, you concede that tarnishment is part. If you22 don't concede that, or even if you do, will you please23 explain as well what this -- what it is, what the injury24 is where you're talking about a lessening of capacity to25 identify and distinguish, what injury is that, if it is￼61 not tarnishment?2 MR. HIGGINS: Okay. The injury in a dilution3 case is focused, the courts agree, on the selling power of4 the famous mark and the way that the cases go is that5 everyone agrees that that selling power is the hook that6 the famous mark --7 QUESTION: Okay, then please explain, putting8 tarnishment to the side -- there is no tarnishment,9 assume -- how does the fact that you have a tiny, totally10 separate product with the same name ever, ever hurt the11 selling power of the big famous name?12 MR. HIGGINS: The question becomes, again, one13 of consumer perception. All of that is tied up into the14 gist of the FTDA. What is being protected is the selling15 power of the famous mark -- which the Fourth Circuit in16 Ringling Brothers referred to as the economic value of a17 trademark -- and I would agree with you, Justice Breyer,18 that if there is no injury there should be --19 QUESTION: No, I don't understand conceptually20 how there ever could be an injury. I've got to understand21 that first, and the reason is, I can imagine an injury22 through tarnishment. I can imagine an injury where the23 big product, Kodak, intends to enter the small area, the24 Kodak -- whatever, monkey wrench -- and it is intending to25 enter and draw on the selling power of, everyone thinks￼71 Kodak is good, so I can think of those two things, but2 where they don't intend to enter, where there's no3 tarnishment, what, in principle, is the harm that you say4 we have to show really exists? Unless I know what that is5 in principle, I can't tell if you're right.MR. HIGGINS: It -- it would show whether or not would now identify a single mark with two sources, and -- and that is the essence of what dilution by the circuit court --67 consumers8 different9 trademark1011 because? 1213 don't totally agree -- the theory is that consumers are14 used to seeing only one Kodak, and now they see two, andQUESTION: All right, and that is harmedMR. HIGGINS: The theory is -- with which we15 the theory is that16 metaphors, that is17 lead to harm.18 Now, our19 even identical use20 to the dilution --21 QUESTION: Well, do you say that actual22 confusion is relevant to the dilution analysis?23 MR. HIGGINS: Actual confusion is primarily a --24 a Lanham Act infringement concept.25 QUESTION: So it's not, in your view, relevantthat is the -- among a number of￼the first of a thousand cuts that willdifficulty with that is that not every, of the same trademark ultimately leads81 to the dilution?2 MR. HIGGINS: If there were actual confusion, it3 might be relevant, but this case --4 QUESTION: In this case, the other -- the Lanham5 Act was thrown out, in effect.6 MR. HIGGINS: That's the main point of this7 case, is that the Court has ruled as a matter of law that8 these accused marks by our clients are not going to lead9 to confusion. It is --10 QUESTION: And you say that actual confusion11 doesn't matter, then, for purposes of this statute, the12 dilution statute, or it could?13 MR. HIGGINS: I say that it could in some14 circumstances. It's not involved in this case at all.15161718 Is that a 19QUESTION: All right, now --QUESTION: You -- you -- go ahead.QUESTION: Then what about actual economic harm? requirement, in your view, under this statute -- MR. HIGGINS: We think that --QUESTION: -- for the plaintiff?MR. HIGGINS: We think that the plaintiff in a￼20 2122 dilution case needs to show objective proof of dilution,23 and that necessarily has an economic component with it.24 QUESTION: Well, but the statute does not, in25 defining dilution, speak in terms of economic harm, does91 it?2 MR. HIGGINS: The statute does not mention3 economic harm per se, but it does say, the lessening of4 the capacity of the famous mark to identify and5 distinguish and, focusing on the selling power of the6 mark, we say the best evidence that would be adduced in a7 case of dilution is surveys of consumer perceptions of the8 impact of --9 QUESTION: That's the best evidence. That's the10 best evidence, but let's go back to what is -- causes11 dilution? One can distinguish what the Patent and12 Trademark Office does. That is, it considers marks before13 they're in use, so one might say, oh, the distinction14 between causes dilution and likely to cause is, likely,15 you're looking at the thing before it's ever used. Once16 it's used, you're into the causes territory. That would17 be a nice clean line to say that all that it means, all18 that the difference in phraseology, causes dilution as19 opposed to likely to cause, is, did it have -- a causation20 case, you have to have a junior mark that's in use, so why21 isn't that a satisfactory line between what's -- what22 causes dilution as opposed to what is likely to cause23 dilution?24 MR. HIGGINS: We think that is not a completely25 satisfactory distinction because of the language of the￼101 statute that authorizes the Patent and Trademark Office to2 look at a mark before it begins.3 QUESTION: Yes, well, that's likely to. They4 can't judge it, because it's not -- it's not in use.5 MR. HIGGINS: And the statute actually says6 that. Section --7 QUESTION: But I'm asking you, getting out of8 that territory, it can look at things before they're in9 use, and now that -- now the junior mark is in use, why10 isn't that enough to satisfy the dilution act?11 MR. HIGGINS: Well, we would agree that the12 mark, the junior mark has to be in use, but we would not13 agree that just by merely using a mark that is14 semantically similar to the famous mark, that dilution15 will inevitably result, which is the position of the16 respondents here.17 QUESTION: But the one thing I think you're18 asking for beyond Justice Ginsburg's example is, to take19 the Kodak wrench and the Kodak camera, you're asking for20 some proof that somebody heard the word Kodak and said,21 was it the camera or the wrench? -- and if that proof22 exists you've got your objective proof, and why do you23 have to go to the point of saying that -- proving that24 Kodak lost a sale as a result?25 MR. HIGGINS: We don't suggest that we have to￼111 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425prove that Kodak lost sales.QUESTION: But you're -- you're asking for proofof some kind of --QUESTION: That's the point of this, forheaven's sake.QUESTION: -- of economic consequence, and -- MR. HIGGINS: We think --QUESTION: -- I -- that's the point that I don'tsee. If I understand it, the dilution occurs when -- or that dilution is the process of lessening the capacity of Kodak to identify the camera rather than to identify the wrench. If -- if it is shown that that process hasbegun -- that it is occurring -- why do you -- what is the point of your argument that it has got to be carried forward to the point of an economic loss of some sort?MR. HIGGINS: Well, first of all we believe that consumer surveys do have evidence of economic impact, and we don't say that economic damage is required. That takes our position too far. The actual question that is certified is whether the plaintiff must show objective evidence of harm to the economic value of the famous mark, not that it must show economic harm per se.I realize that's subtle distinction --QUESTION: Well, isn't there -- under the terms of the statute, isn't that shown simply by the fact that￼121 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the consumer stops for a second and says, is it the camera, or is it the wrench when the consumer hears the word, Kodak?MR. HIGGINS: I don't --QUESTION: What further proof of loss of -- what further economic proof is required to come within the statute?MR. HIGGINS: That is not a complete economic proof. What we say is that not every, even identical use leads to dilution in the minds of consumers. Think of -- as we put in our brief -- Delta Airlines, Delta Faucets. Think of Apple Records, Apple Computers.QUESTION: Maybe because those are are generic, like apple.names that MR. HIGGINS: Well then, how about ￼ Ford MotorCompany and Ford Modeling Agency? You know, same result.QUESTION: How about Kodak Pianos?that's theMR. HIGGINS: Kodak Pianos is in the legislative history as --QUESTION: Or Dupont Shoes, or Buick Aspirin?MR. HIGGINS: All of those are identical marks, and we say that this case presents a non-identical mark. There are semantic differences and there are gender differences.131 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Well, there is evidence -- or, at least, how did this all get started? Someone sees Victor's Secret and writes to Victoria's Secret and says, you want to stop these people, so we know that one consumer, although he wasn't confused, said, they're diluting your mark. Now, suppose you had 12 of those who said, yeah, I passed this shop, Victor's Secret, and I thought immediately of Victoria's Secret. Would that proof be sufficient and if not, why not?MR. HIGGINS: We say it is not sufficient, because the -- but that is essentially the analysis that the Sixth Circuit put in there. The Sixth Circuit said at page 27a of the petition, the appendix to the petition, that they are focusing on what a consumer is, quote, "likely automatically to think," unquote, and then link that to the famous mark.QUESTION: And what's your answer? What'syour --MR. HIGGINS: What our position is, that that requires a court to guess whether the association that the consumer thinks of is --QUESTION: What do you want? What do you want in place of that?MR. HIGGINS: What we would like -- QUESTION: What do you want the plaintiff to￼141 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425show?MR. HIGGINS: We want the plaintiff to show that there is objective proof of consumer perceptions that it causes dilution, exactly what the statute says.QUESTION: I don't know -- what does that mean, of consumer perceptions that causes dilution? Objective proof that a particular consumer, when he saw Victoria's Little Secret -- or Victor's Little Secret -- had in mind, gee, you know, that's like Victoria's Secret. Is that enough?MR. HIGGINS: No, that's not enough. That's --QUESTION: What is enough? What is enough? What does dilution consist of?MR. HIGGINS: Dilution consists of a consumer's -- the -- general consumers, not a single consumer, but general consumer perception that there to be one Victoria's Secret and now, in their minds, are at least two.used there￼QUESTION: Well, how many consumers do you You say one isn't enough , and you say general consumer perception. I mean, if you had 20 people would that be enough?MR. HIGGINS: Well, the -- the record and the briefs reveal some articles by trademark scholars who discussed --15need?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Yes, but I was asking you a particular question. Would 20 be enough?MR. HIGGINS: I don't think so, Your Honor. You know, this -- we live in an age when consumer surveys, voter surveys, public opinion surveys are done over a weekend, and in this situation that is the kind of survey that we would suggest.QUESTION: And what do you ask these consumers? How many Kodaks are there? Is that what you want to ask them?MR. HIGGINS: No, Your Honor.QUESTION: What?MR. HIGGINS: You ask them the scientificallydesigned question.QUESTION: Which is?MR. HIGGINS: Which is, you know, do you think of another famous mark, and do you believe -- as the law review article suggests -- do you believe such things as whether or not the new entrant had to get permission from the famous mark in order to market this product.QUESTION: Well, that -- most consumers wouldn't even understand that question.(Laughter.)MR. HIGGINS: And that's -- that's part of our point, Your Honor. If --￼161 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: This sounds like a lawyer's dream. (Laughter.)QUESTION: But it seems to me that the owner ofthe senior mark is entitled to more protection than that. I -- I just want to make clear, you do not contest that tarnishment is a -- a basis for the respondent to prevail in this case?MR. HIGGINS: We do not.QUESTION: All right.MR. HIGGINS: As -- per se. What we say is thatthere is --QUESTION: I -- I don't know why you needsophisticated, so-called sophisticated polls to determine whether there's tarnishment.MR. HIGGINS: Because, remember, this case is a statute that is wholly different than the common law. It has no common law antecedent. It is granting property rights through Congress' action under the alleged use of the Commerce Clause, and we say those property rights that are being granted by this statute create rights that go well beyond any trade area --QUESTION: It's not just beyond, I would have thought that -- you don't make a point of it, so I might be wrong -- there's a pretty significant speechinterest on -- on your side of the case. That is, if this￼171 statute gets out of hand, advertising is part of --2 whether we like it or not -- our children's, anyway, daily3 communications, and all of a sudden, if there's no real4 harm you're going to cut off what people can say in5 commercial contexts.6 Now, you don't make much a point of that, so7 don't let me put words in your mouth. Explain it to me.8 (Laughter.)9 MR. HIGGINS: We did mention that in our briefs,10 but the primary people who are positing that position here11 are the amici, who represent the public interest, and the12 main point about this FTDA is that, other than bumping up13 against the First Amendment, there really isn't a public14 interest that is being expressed or applied here.15 QUESTION: Well, why -- why isn't there a public16 interest in not having some organization like yours simply17 copy another person's name?18 MR. HIGGINS: Well, we -- if there is that19 situation, then that would be a case of trademark20 infringement or copyright infringement. This case does21 not involve -- this case does not involve --22 QUESTION: No, Congress has gone further here23 and said you can't simply copy someone else's name. Now,24 you say there's no -- maybe Congress shouldn't have done25 it, maybe it hasn't done it, but to say there's no public￼181 interest at all on that side doesn't make much sense to2 me. I mean, you -- you don't come -- your client doesn't3 come off well in this case.4 MR. HIGGINS: Well, there is a public interest,5 but that is addressed primarily on the free speech aspect6 of things. We would agree with that. The problem with7 this case is that it requires courts to speculate whether8 the beginning of a semantically similar mark is going to9 inevitably lead to dilution, and that's contrary to the10 words that Congress used.11 QUESTION: You started off saying dilution,12 you -- to show dilution, you had to show economic harm.13 That I can understand. You produce evidence that -- of14 some economic harm. That is now not your position. I15 don't understand what your position is. If it is not a16 showing of economic harm, you know, the -- the mark is17 worth so much less than it was, what precisely do you want18 to show? I truly don't understand.19 MR. HIGGINS: We do say there is an economic20 component, through the proof that we suggest be required21 under the causal relationship that is necessary, and22 the -- we don't abandon the economic --23 QUESTION: Okay, fine, what else do you demand?24 What is it that you do demand. This --25 MR. HIGGINS: We --￼191 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: I don't understand what it is that you do demand. What?MR. HIGGINS: We do demand that the plaintiffs show that our mark is harming theirs in a dilution way, that it does lessen the capacity of that mark to identify and distinguish its goods or services, and that's best done by consumer surveys.time.Your Honor, if I may reserve the balance of myQUESTION: Very well. Very well, Mr. Higgins. Mr. Wallace, we'll hear from you.Mr. Wallace, our records reflect that this isyour 157th argument before the Court in the 34 years you have been an attorney in the Office of the Solicitor General. Some years ago, you eclipsed the 20th Century record of 140 arguments. I understand that you will soon retire from Government service, so on behalf of the Court I extend to you our appreciation for your many years of quality advocacy and dedicated service in the Solicitor's Office -- Solicitor General's Office -- on behalf of the United States. That doesn't mean we're going to rule in your favor.(Laughter.)ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACEON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,￼201 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER2 MR. WALLACE: Thank you very much, Mr. Chief3 Justice, and may it please the Court:4 What constitutes dilution, other than the5 abstraction of the statutory definition perhaps is6 reflected a bit in the examples we've given of consumer7 surveys that might be used to produce evidence in a case8 of this nature. If consumers were asked what products do9 you associate with the name Victoria's Secret, and those10 who were aware of Victor's Little Secret answered it11 substantially differently and included items found only in12 that store and not in Victoria's Secret stores, or what13 attributes do you associate with Victoria's Secret, and14 those aware of Victor's Secret were more apt to say15 tasteless rather than tasteful, which would -- might be16 the response from those familiar with Victoria's Secret.17 QUESTION: What if the answer was simply, I'm18 not sure any more? Would that show that dilution had19 occurred?20 MR. WALLACE: It -- it might. All of these -- I21 mean, we don't take the position that a consumer survey is22 necessary in order to prove a case in the first place, but23 I think the way a survey would be designed and what the24 answers would show is illustrative of what constitutes25 dilution.￼211 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: But you -- you would get that answer from a consumer if you asked them about the word, Delta, what products do you associate with the word, Delta, and the consumer would say, airplanes, or air -- you know, air travel and faucets, and there wouldn't be any dilution there, would there?MR. WALLACE: Not unless their -- a conclusion could be drawn based on other factors that --QUESTION: Right.MR. WALLACE: -- a mark had established a certain distinctiveness that is associated only with the particular mark, and now that is being blurred.QUESTION: Well, I believe -- are you saying that the Delta example is only good now, and that when the person who made Delta Faucets first came out with a faucet that he called Delta, or Delta Airline -- I don't know who came first -- the chicken or the egg, the airline or the faucet. Whoever had the name first, are you saying that when somebody used the name Delta that the senior user of Delta could have excluded the faucet-maker from -- from Delta?MR. WALLACE: Only under the Federal dilution statute of '95 if the mark is a famous mark, and in the Toro case that we cite, the --QUESTION: So I can't even have Delta Peanuts?￼221 Once Delta is famous, just for air travel, I can't use2 Delta for anything else? That would automatically violate3 the Federal statute?4 56 who knows7 associate8 peanuts?9MR. WALLACE: Well, not automatically, but if -- QUESTION: All you have to do is find a consumer of Delta Peanuts and says, you know, what do you the name Delta with, and he says, airlines andMR. WALLACE: Well, that would involve an exact10 replication of the mark, which are the only examples given11 in the House report or in the legislative history, such as12 Kodak Pianos. Most of the cases, however, are about13 similar marks rather than exact replications, and those14 are much more problematical to ascertain whether there is15 the kind of effect we're -- the act is concerned with.￼QUESTION: Mr. Wallace, at least in some of the I'm not sure in the cases of this Court, correct wrong, I thought that in trademark infringement1617 circuits,18 me if I'm19 cases, that the circuit court said that they have certain20 de novo authority. Historical facts are clearly21 erroneous, but the conclusions that you draw from the22 historical facts give them certain powers of de novo23 review. That's the prevailing rule in many of the24 circuits, is it not --25 MR. WALLACE: Yes.231 QUESTION: -- in infringement cases, and2 shouldn't that same rule be applied here? I mean, judges3 have the capacity in the trademark area, I should think,4 to know what dilution is or is not if we have certain5 historical facts. I don't know why you need to survey.6 The Bugwiser-Budweiser example. I mean, you don't have to7 be too tricky a judge to figure out that this is very8 harmful.9 MR. WALLACE: It is very difficult. We don't10 say that a survey is needed. There are other factors that11 are looked to, including --12 QUESTION: Mr. Wallace, may I ask you something13 to clarify the Government's position on this? As I've14 been listening to the argument, Mr. Higgins says you look15 to see, he said, if before you thought there was one16 Victoria's Secret, now you thought there were two. He's17 suggesting that the association -- it's not what you think18 of when you see Victor's Secret. When you see Victor's19 Secret, of course you're going to think of Victoria's, but20 what counts is, when you think of Victoria's Secret, do21 you think of Victor's. That's -- that's what dilution is,22 and if it's the latter, then it's -- those are two very23 different things, aren't they?24 MR. WALLACE: Yes. Dilution is about dilution25 of the famous mark and its capacity to distinguish the￼241 particular goods or services, but we think the court of2 appeals was wrong in saying that mere mental association3 of the two marks by consumers automatically results in4 dilution.5 QUESTION: But the court of appeals was going6 on, when you think of Victor's you think of Victoria's.7 I'm asking you, is the right question -- is the necessary8 question of the customers -- when you think of Victoria's,9 do you think of Victor?10 MR. WALLACE: I think the -- the question is not11 do you think of Victor's, but when you think of12 Victoria's, do you think of more than what Victoria's13 Secret --14 QUESTION: Right.15 MR. WALLACE: -- itself has as its merchandise16 and image. Is their name now associated with a different17 type of product that may change their renown or cachet18 with customers.19 QUESTION: Is there -- what is the extra -- I'm20 not -- if you're finished with that question, I'd like21 to -- which I think there's a lot to. Is -- what is22 particularly the harm? Is it just that the customer23 thinks -- either customer -- thinks of the other even if24 there's no specific tarnishment, and there's no general25 tarnishment? That is, people associate Buick with a good￼251 car, and we can measure whether that's identical before2 and identical after, and it is, so there's no general3 tarnishment, there's no bug example tarnishment, there's4 nothing but the fact that on Justice Ginsburg's question,5 both sides say yes.6 Now, is that harm under this statute? Is that7 dilution, or isn't it?8 MR. WALLACE: We don't believe that in itself9 constitutes dilution if there is none of the damage to the10 ability of the mark. The --11 QUESTION: All right, so -- so the ability of12 the mark consists either of my bug example, or some13 general weakening of the goodness that inheres in the14 name. Anything else?15 MR. WALLACE: Well, yes -- no, I think --16 QUESTION: No, okay --17 MR. WALLACE: I think the Fourth --18 QUESTION: The answer's no.19 MR. WALLACE: The Fourth Circuit case of20 Ringling Brothers was very illustrative. People might21 associate Utah's use of Greatest Snow on Earth with22 Ringling Brothers' use of Greatest Show on Earth, but if23 they keep the two distinct in their minds, even though24 they recognize that it's a play on the same words, but25 they think the two trademarks refer to different products￼261 and services, then there -- no harm is done to Ringling2 Brothers as the Fourth Circuit held, and the Fourth3 Circuit even suggested that perhaps they even benefit from4 having people think additionally of their mark. That's a5 question on which the Patent and Trademark Office has not6 taken a view, but the harm has to be that consumers are --7 are diminished in their capacity to recognize the mark8 that is the famous mark that's being protected.9 QUESTION: That's -- but that's confusion. I10 mean, if -- if there's confusion, you don't need this new11 law. I thought that it was the case that if you come out12 with a Kodak Piano, even if nobody in the world thinks13 that Kodak, the photography company has anything to do14 with Kodak Piano, the mark has nonetheless been15 diminished. Isn't that right?16 MR. WALLACE: That's true, at least when it's an17 identical mark, or one that's so confusingly similar --18 QUESTION: But that goes to the very point19 you've just been talking about, and contradicts what20 you've said. It doesn't matter whether there's any21 confusion or not, you can't use Kodak.22 MR. WALLACE: There -- there has to be confusion23 as to the mark, rather than as to the source of the24 product.25￼QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Wallace.271 We'll hear argument from you now, Mr. Dellinger.2 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER E. DELLINGER, JR.3 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS4 MR. DELLINGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it5 please the Court:6 The question on which the Court granted7 certiorari was whether the plaintiff must demonstrate that8 it has already suffered economic injury as a precondition9 to any and all relief under the 1996 act. The text of the10 act answers that question, and answers it no. There's11 simply no such requirement included in the statute.12 QUESTION: Well, it -- I mean, that's to some13 extent a play on words. It depends on what you mean, has14 actually suffered economic injury. What your opposing15 counsel says now is that all he means by, has actually16 suffered economic injury, is, has suffered dilution, has17 actually suffered dilution of the mark, which, of course,18 entails economic injury. If the mark is diluted, the mark19 was worth a lot, and it's now diluted, there's economic20 injury. Now --21 MR. DELLINGER: Justice Scalia, we agree that22 the act requires a showing of actual, present dilution,23 and that such a showing was, in fact, made below. What is24 dilution? A number of you have asked that question. It's25 best understood in light of the fact that this is a very￼281 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425narrow statute that only protects a few very famous marks. I do not think, for example, Justice Scalia, that Delta would qualify as a famous mark because it has been used so often in other third party uses. The --QUESTION: But what about the first time it was used either for -- what is it, the airline, and what's -- faucets? Whichever came first. What about the first time it was used for the second product?MR. DELLINGER: Then it would not suffer the disqualification that would come as to what is present --QUESTION: Yes.MR. DELLINGER: -- about proliferating uses. Whether it would otherwise satisfy that would remain to be seen. I think that the Court can, and the courts can narrow the application of this statute by taking very seriously the requirement that it has to be a truly famous mark that has.Take the example that was given to the House --QUESTION: Well, let's -- and keep it so I can understand it. Let's assume the first use was Delta Airlines. Everybody recognizes Delta Airlines. Somebody starts advertising Delta Faucets. Was Delta Airlines famous enough --MR. DELLINGER: I don't know -- QUESTION: -- on your criterion?￼291 MR. DELLINGER: -- on those facts. I'd have to2 know whether, if -- as it is today, yes, I would think if3 it--4 QUESTION: All right. Let's assume it's famous5 enough. The ads start going out in the magazines for6 Delta Faucets. There is no proof that Delta Airlines has7 suffered any tangible damage at this point, but there is8 proof, let's assume from a survey of magazine readers,9 that when they see the word, Delta, standing by itself,10 they're not sure who the source of the product is. Is11 that dilution?12 MR. DELLINGER: If they're not sure who's the13 source of the product, it may be infringement, and the14 reason I resist the use of Delta is that a lot goes into a15 determination of whether -- as it did in this case -- as16 to whether a mark has those special qualities that mean17 that the second or junior user and the third, fourth, and18 fifth are lessening its capacity to communicate these very19 distinctive ideas.20 The example used in the House report was21 Tiffany's, for example. We all know that if another22 jewelry store starts as Tiffany's you've got an23 infringement claim, because consumers would be confused,24 but as the House was told, what about a Tiffany's25 Restaurant, and that means that Tiffany's used to stand￼301 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425for one thing, it now stands for two, but here's the absolute heart of the matter, where the FDA comes into play.QUESTION: That was bad? I mean, you see, I am so far behind understanding you that I don't know whether you have just asserted that that's obviously bad. I think you have. Tiffany's Restaurant is bad.MR. DELLINGER: Yes.QUESTION: Okay.MR. DELLINGER: I have, and --(Laughter.)QUESTION: And the difference between Tiffany'sRestaurants and Delta Faucets is what?MR. DELLINGER: There may be no difference. I'massuming that both -- if you assume that both Delta andTiffany's are famous marks. QUESTION: Okay.MR. DELLINGER: But here's why Delta Faucets and-- bothname?￼Tiffany's -- if the original marks are famous constitute the harm of dilution. Dilution -- QUESTION: You mean, just using the MR. DELLINGER: Just using the name-- QUESTION: Is likelihood of dilution enough?MR. DELLINGER: No, not under the act, and -- and nor is just using the name enough, nor is just311 semantic similarity. You have to make out the statutory2 proof that it actually --3 QUESTION: That it causes dilution for4 everybody --5 MR. DELLINGER: It causes dilution, and6 dilution --7 QUESTION: Is expressed --8 MR. DELLINGER: It's creating a mental9 association. Similarity is not enough. But take an10 example that shows how critically important stopping the11 first use is. If you can have a Tiffany's Restaurant,12 then you can also have a Tiffany Shoe Store, a Tiffany Pet13 Store. Very soon Tiffany's no longer --QUESTION: Where will it all end?MR. DELLINGER: Where will it all end? (Laughter.)MR. DELLINGER: That is exactly --QUESTION: Well, so what? So what? I mean, I so what facetiously. I say so what to get you14 15 16 17 1819 don't say20 to identify the harm specifically that that's likely to21 bring about to the first owner.￼22 MR. DELLINGER: Exactly. The -- what Congress23 saw as the harm, Justice Breyer, for truly famous marks,24 to quote from the House report itself, is that dilution25 applies when the unauthorized use of the famous mark321 reduces the public's perception that the mark signifies2 something unique, singular, or particular, so that3 Rolls-Royce, which once stood for one thing, once it's on4 100 products or 1,000 products no longer identifies and5 distinguishes --6 QUESTION: No longer identifies one thing. It7 now identifies a thousand things, and that, of course, is8 true by definition, and what I'm trying to get at is, why9 is that bad?10 MR. DELLINGER: Congress determined that that11 was bad because --12 QUESTION: Just automatically? Oh, no, go13 ahead. Why?14 MR. DELLINGER: Congress determined that that15 was bad to the extent that the mark no longer stood for16 something singular or particular, no longer conveyed --17 QUESTION: Then again, that's just another way18 of repeating the same thing, and the reason that I think19 it's important is, perhaps we can survive with only having20 one Tiffany's, but let's think of some slogans out of my21 youth, you know. It floats. 99 and 44/100th percent22 pure. The beforehand lotion, whatever that meant. I'm23 just repeating slogans from old radio programs, and the24 reason that I'm doing it is because I want you to see25 immediately, as soon as you depart from a word like￼331 Tiffany's, which is totally arbitrary or fanciful, and you2 get into actual advertising slogans, you will tie up free3 speech in4 me.56 the case.7 to extend89 10lawsuits like mad, and that's what's worryingMR. DELLINGER: No, I do not -- it is not at all Congress made it clear that safe harbors werea wide --QUESTION: Yes, the safe harbor is fair use. MR. DELLINGER: And it --QUESTION: Fair use, and that's what's again11 worrying me, because those two words, fair use to me spell12 lawyers, lawsuits, uncertainty and confusion.13 MR. DELLINGER: If you lose distinctiveness,14 what you lose is the selling power of the mark.15 Rolls-Royce stands for something important. It conveys16 something that consumers -- it signals to consumers.17 Rolls-Royce is very careful about what products it18 allows to --19 QUESTION: Chevrolet doesn't matter. You can20 use Chevrolet, because that's --￼212223 easier -- 2425(Laughter.)QUESTION: Is that right? Or Edsel, even yes.(Laughter.)MR. DELLINGER: Justice Scalia, it is -- when341 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425you look at whether a mark is famous -- and in this case, it's simply not contested. This is a mark that comes in behind Levi's and ahead of Rolex on the -- on the list, but when you contest that, you do look at a number of factors, so you can't stand here and pick out any one, and that's a -- that's an important gatekeeping function to narrow this statute.Now --QUESTION: When you say it signifies something distinctive, you don't mean that Buick signifies cars, you don't mean that Tiffany's signifies jewelry, you don't mean that Rolls-Royce signifies sedans, right?MR. DELLINGER: Not just that, but a certain mark and quality and kind of product is exemplified, and that's what makes a mark famous. It gives it this.Now, if -- we know that these marks have value. When -- when companies are acquired, often as much as four-fifths of the value may go to use that name. That is something quite valuable, Justice Breyer, and its value is going to be lost --QUESTION: Fine. Why not --MR. DELLINGER: -- if there are a thousand different ones.QUESTION: Why not require some proof of that? That is, some proof that this mark -- which not only￼351 identifies a wonderful car, but now has come to stand for2 wonderfulness in general -- some proof that because3 somebody's using it on a tricycle, that people think it's4 a little less wonderful.5 Now, that's not -- that's hard to prove one way6 or the other, but not -- I mean, requires some reason for7 thinking that.8 QUESTION: So Pepsodent would lose, or, you9 know, just some -- some product --10 MR. DELLINGER: Yes. Yes.11 QUESTION: That's just a -- you know, it's an12 ordinary product. How can you have an absolutely13 wonderful 141516 right? 1718 1920 Tiffany's, Rolls-Royce, a couple of other really, really21 quality names. Is that what the statute was directed at?22 MR. DELLINGER: I believe that is the case,23 Justice Scalia, that --24 QUESTION: But you don't differentiate between25 Cadillac and Chevrolet, do you? Chevrolet would have justtoothpaste?QUESTION: Oh, no, you can. You can. QUESTION: There's no Tiffany of toothpastes,￼(Laughter.)MR. DELLINGER: There is no -- QUESTION: So we're only talking about361 much cachet --2 MR. DELLINGER: No, I think they would be on3 similar footing, and Chevrolet has its own kind of appeal.4 It appeals to -- for those of us who live in NASCAR5 country, there is sometimes a more appealing image to6 Chevrolet than to Cadillac. I don't mean to make value7 judgments.8 QUESTION: Well, Mr. Dellinger, why isn't it9 useful to think in terms of whether there's proof of some10 diminution of value of the mark?11 MR. DELLINGER: That is a very good question,12 and that is Justice Breyer's question for --QUESTION: Yes.MR. DELLINGER: We believe that obviously the suffer in value if you make out the finding of13 1415 mark does16 dilution.17 actual --1819 should just presume a diminution in value, would you,20 because the mark is similar?21 MR. DELLINGER: No, but what you -- what you22 presume is that the economic injury that you're talking of23 may not be identifiable -- often would not be24 identifiable -- until it's too late to rectify the harm25 that has been done. If you think of -- we usually use as￼The Fourth Circuit would require you show QUESTION: Well, you -- you wouldn't think we371 examples where there is one other competing user.2 What faces the sort of in-house intellectual3 property counsel for a company with a famous mark is that4 there are users popping up all over the country all of the5 time, so that if the first user, say Victor's Little6 Secret, exists in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, and if you7 can't show that that alone produces the kind of harm8 you're looking -- or that your question would imply one9 might be looking for -- how can you stop the second, the10 third, the 500th use?11 At what point -- there's no privilege for the12 first user, so that by the -- here's what would happen.13 By the time you could show economic damage to the harm,14 first of all as a matter of law you might have lost the15 status as a famous mark because there are all those users16 out there.17 Secondly, the -- it is not clear why you would18 prohibit the 500th user of the mark, the 500th different19 kind of store when you allowed the first 499 to go on, so20 that -- you ask the question of whether, at present, this21 use lessens the capacity of that mark to identify and22 distinguish.23 QUESTION: Focusing on the present, suppose I'm24 a trial judge, and this case comes to me in the pretrial25 conference stage, and I say, you know, it does seem to me￼381 that this second -- this junior user is going to tarnish2 the image of -- of the senior user. Is that all I need to3 say,andthenI--whatdoIputdownwhenIwritean4 opinion so that the circuit court can review my thinking?5 I mean, what -- what do I put down?6 MR. DELLINGER: Well, I think this case is a7 very good example, because you have a court which goes8 through a list of factors to reach a conclusion. The9 opinion is rather short, but that's because the conclusion10 in this case is so close to being a core example of the11 statute. They -- they mention the fact that it's a very12 distinctive mark, the degree of similarity, the proximity13 of the product lines helping to create that association,14 the shared customers -- 39,000 catalogues distributed in15 Elizabethtown. The suggestion is there are some --16 QUESTION: 39,000 in Elizabethtown?17 MR. DELLINGER: Yes. There are 39,00018 Victoria's Secret catalogues distributed in Elizabethtown,19 Kentucky in 1998.20 QUESTION: What's the population of21 Elizabethtown?22 (Laughter.)23 MR. DELLINGER: That is a good question, but24 I -- four, he says, but I think that's his guess. We25 don't know. I --￼391 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425(Laughter.)MR. DELLINGER: I -- I -- think it is substantial. Now, once you have these other uses out there, particularly if it's a --QUESTION: So what do I -- would this beappropriate for a summary this on summary judgment?MR. DELLINGER: could, Justice Kennedy ---- would you urge me to take I --Absolutely, just as I think youQUESTION: All I need to know is the number of catalogues, how well-known the mark is, and that's it?MR. DELLINGER: What you have to --QUESTION: And then my own judgment as to what tarnishment is?MR. DELLINGER: No, because here you have -- here you have an actual association. What you have in this case, for example, that the judge relies upon, is not a survey. It's proved by actual consumers.QUESTION: Well, but suppose right here, to take this case, that the people who go to Victor's who have ever heard of it honestly do not believe the less in any respect whatsoever of Victoria's Little Secret, and the people who use Victoria's Little -- I mean, why should they? -- and the people who use -- go to Victoria's Little Secret have never heard of Victor's, so you -- why -- why￼401 suppose they come in and show that?2 QUESTION: You're confusing the marks.3 QUESTION: Now, why -- I understand you're4 confusing the marks. No, you're not confusing the marks.5 No. I'm -- he's saying I'm confusing the marks.6 7 8 910 who go --11 Victor's with Victoria, but they think nonetheless of12 Victoria. They might even think more of Victoria. I13 don't know what they think, but it's not negative in any14 respect, and the people who go to Victoria's, to use15 Justice Ginsburg's example, don't care, or don't know, or16 they've never heard of Victor's, so although there is --17 in a subset of people -- an association of the name, there18 is no harm of any sort whatsoever, and they will prove19 that. Should they not have the opportunity to prove it?20 MR. DELLINGER: Justice Breyer, Congress simply21 did not agree that no harm has been done when the famous22 mark loses its singularity, and remember, if there can be23 one store under Victoria's -- under Victor's Little Secret24 in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, there can be a thousand25 opening the Monday after Superbowl Sunday.(Laughter.)QUESTION: But I -- did I have it backwards? QUESTION: Yes, you did.QUESTION: Not Little -- all right. The people no, the customers of Victor's do associate￼411 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: So then in your view, anyone who starts going around for a commercial reason and using the two words, it floats -- it floats -- where they want people to think of Ivory Soap, they are open to a lawsuit, and they have to rely on a fair use defense, or are there other defenses?MR. DELLINGER: The --QUESTION: Is my example wrong?MR. DELLINGER: Well, it's -- your example isthat there is a -- you're suggesting a mere mental association. I'm not sure your --QUESTION: Well, in a commercial context -- in a commercial context where people are polled --MR. DELLINGER: Secondly, I am not -- by no means -- it would take a lot to persuade me that it floats is a truly famous mark deserving of this protection, but Congress believed that the harm is that if you have a mark, and Congress identified marks like Buick Aspirin, but if you -- the very harm Congress sought to prevent is, when a mark stands for one thing -- this narrow set of truly famous marks -- and you have replicating uses, it is no longer going to stand for anything in your mind, and Congress believed, and the market reflects, that that is a true loss.Now, if you wait to try to -- to where you could￼421 show, as the Fourth Circuit would require, an actual2 revenue loss, you can't unring the bell, particularly with3 tarnishment. If someone opened up --4 QUESTION: Mr. Dellinger, can I just clarify,5 then, it doesn't make any difference that this particular6 shop happens to sell sex toys. It could just as well --7 Victor's Secret could sell men's underwear and your8 argument would still be the same, am I right? So we get9 out the tawdriness or the disparagement or the10 tarnishment. It's just -- it's a store, it sells11 underwear, men's underwear, and it's got the label,12 Victor's Secret.13 MR. DELLINGER: Justice Ginsburg, I don't14 entirely agree with that. We do believe that the dilution15 of the Victoria's Secret name through blurring would be16 sufficient, but in this case, you don't have to rely upon17 that, because the court below did find that there was18 tarnishment when a name not only ceases to stand for one19 thing, but is associated --20 QUESTION: But how does tarnishment fit the21 language of the statute? That's what --22 QUESTION: Yes, I'd like to know that, too. I23 don't see how tarnishment -- you know --24 QUESTION: Does that lessen the capacity of the25 mark to identify --￼431 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. DELLINGER: Yes, it does, and the --QUESTION: I thought it just changed the reaction to the mark, rather than lessening -- I mean, you know, you have an unfavorable reaction, rather than not knowing what you're talking about.MR. DELLINGER: Let me just quote you from the treatise, one sentence from the McCarthy treatise. One of the classic functions of a trademark is to signify that all goods and services sold under the mark are of equal quality, or of a special quality. That is part of identifying and distinguishing a mark. It -- the capacity is lessened. It lessens the capacity to identify and distinguish a particular mark when that mark is tarnished by what the trial court found some customers would find to be an unsavory association.QUESTION: I don't understand -- you can say it, but I don't understand it. I can still identify and distinguish Victoria's Secret, but I just think less of it.MR. DELLINGER: Well, --QUESTION: It -- it doesn't -- any -- it isn't any less identifiable.MR. DELLINGER: Justice Scalia, I think you're misstating the statute.QUESTION: Okay.￼441 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. DELLINGER: It's not whether you can identify and distinguish. It's whether the mark's --QUESTION: Yes.MR. DELLINGER: -- capacity to identify and distinguish is lessened, and if it no longer stands in one's mind --QUESTION: I'll take that.MR. DELLINGER: If it no longer stands in one's mind, or in the mind and the public perception for the same connotation of quality as it did before the association with the unsavory image, its capacity to identify and distinguish that quality has lessened, but moreover --QUESTION: But you have to add the word quality to the statute.￼QUESTION: Yes.QUESTION: The statute doesn't contain thatword.MR. DELLINGER: The statute uses dilution, Justice Stevens, as a term of art, and nothing could clearer than that Congress thought that term of art, dilution, encompassed both blurring and tarnishment, think --QUESTION: Well --MR. DELLINGER: I may not persuade Justicebe as I451 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Scalia --QUESTION: Nothing could be clearer than thatCongress adopted a definition of what -- of what dilution consists of and, to my mind, that definition does not at all cover disparaging the other product.MR. DELLINGER: Well, it -- Congress thought otherwise. The House report says that the definition --QUESTION: The House committee thought otherwise.MR. DELLINGER: Yes.QUESTION: What Congress thought was the definition that Congress adopted.MR. DELLINGER: And the definition of lessening the capacity encompasses that, but in any event, since blurring is still present, this is thought to be an easy case by the courts below, for -- for good reason. If you imagine hundreds of different users of the Victor's Little Secret mark, the uniqueness, the quality, the public's perception is going to be lessened.Congress further -- to go back to a question asked by Justice Breyer -- made it absolutely clear that it wanted the safe harbors read as broadly as possible to ensure that there was no restriction on First Amendment rights, so the courts are warmly invited to create as large a safe harbor for parody. This is a case in which￼461 we have blurring, we have tarnishment, which is a near2 subset of blurring, but the courts below looked at the3 direct customer testimony.4 Colonel Baker, the Judge Advocate -- Staff Judge5 Advocate at Fort Knox -- looks at a Victor's Little Secret6 ad in the base newspaper and writes off to Victoria's7 Secret and says, they're using your name in an unfavorable8 way. His -- his deposition testimony remarks --9 QUESTION: Well, he was concerned about the10 tarnishment aspect, and I still have to -- I would like11 you to comment on the -- on Justice Ginsburg's example,12 too, would it diminish the capacity of the Victoria's13 Secret mark to identify its line of goods if some --14 somebody thought they also sold men's pajamas?15 MR. DELLINGER: Yes. Someone else, I think you16 well -- you begin to have the elements of the proof of17 dilution when you show that someone is using the same --18 or a name which reaches mental association because of a19 number of factors. You have the elements of dilution.20 You might not yet have, as you have proof in this case, of21 a really lessened capacity to identify and distinguish.22 Now, another -- the -- nobody sought to23 introduce a survey in this case. I would trust Federal24 judges more than sociology graduate students to make this25 kind of determination, and nobody sought to bring before￼471 this Court a fact-bound determination of whether all of2 the judges below were correct when they found that there3 was a strong association, and beyond that, that the use of4 the Victor's Little Secret mark to sell the kinds of goods5 it sells, which some customers find unsavory, and which6 Mr. Moseley himself testified some members of the public7 find -- at least -- extremely offensive, that that has the8 effect of lessening the capacity of a Victoria's Secret9 mark to identify and distinguish those famous goods and --10 and products, and that's --11 QUESTION: But the blurring, then, that you're12 describing now has no quality component to it? That only13 comes when you get to the subset?14 MR. DELLINGER: That is correct.15 QUESTION: Okay.16 MR. DELLINGER: It -- it only affects the fact17 that it doesn't -- no longer singularly stands for￼18 anything,19 products,20 anything,21 their car22that if Rolls-Royce were on 100 differentit would no longer -- it would no longer mean and would no longer -- they might as well call a Yugo if it's used on products hither and yon. Tarnishment is a particular good example of why23 the lessening itself needs to be remedied, because once24 you've tarnished a product, it's hard to unring that bell25 in the public's mind, if someone had a national program.481 QUESTION: Of course, if you're dealing with2 Rolls-Royce, I suppose virtually any blurring is also3 going to be tarnishment, which you don't necessarily have4 even in other famous marks.5 MR. DELLINGER: Tarnishment has generally been6 restricted so far in the case law to more unsavory7 associations, sex, drugs, and matters of that kind. This8 is an act which is more limited than its critics suggest.9 They -- of course, whether it was a bad policy was a10 matter that should have been addressed to Congress, but it11 can be limited to a few very famous marks.12 A safe harbor is read broadly. People can use13 the term, Victoria's Secret, for any purpose they want in14 parody and commentary, on the steps of the courthouse.15 They just can't make this one use of it, that is a16 commercial use in commerce that lessens the capacity of17 that mark to carry out its function that Congress so18 clearly had in mind when it passed the Federal Trademark19 Dilution Act.20 That's why I think the courts below saw this,21 like Buick Aspirin and Kodak Shoes, as a core paradigm22 example of precisely what the statute was designed to23 prohibit, and why none of the --24 QUESTION: So, Mr. Dellinger --25 MR.

Ifyou've got a very famous, distinctive mark, and you've got a -- a very similar use. You have those two things, and then you get a few colonels to say yes, when they think of the junior mark they think of the senior, is that enough proof?MR. DELLINGER: It is in this case, Justice Ginsburg, where the sufficiency of that I think was really not challenged.QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Dellinger.Mr. Higgins, you have 2 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. HIGGINS, JR.￼Court:ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. HIGGINS: Mr. Justice, and may it please theThere's no evidence in this case that Colonel ever in petitioner's store, and his particular was challenged and disregarded by the trialBaker wasaffidavitcourt. What we have here is a choice between two standards to interpret the FTDA. Our choice is grounded in the actual use, words that Congress used, and the respondent's position is grounded in the academic theory of dilution which we say is way ahead of the law.Our standard is objective and predictable.501 Theirs is subjective, unpredictable, invites the courts to2 substitute its own judgment for consumer perceptions.3 It's consistent with almost nothing. Our standard focuses4 on measurable consumer perception. Theirs focuses at the5 beginning on semantic similarity, and a presumption that6 dilution follows from that. Our standard merely puts the7 famous mark owner to their proof to show that Congress'8 words, the lessening of the capacity, has been established9 as a matter of proof. They should not get a national10 injunction without that.11 Our standard keeps trademark law in its proper12 bounds. Their standard merely rewards the achievement of13 fame. Our standard, if applied in this case, should14 result in this Court reversing the injunction and15 directing that the petitioners be allowed to use Victor's16 given name in their business.17 Thank you.18 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you,19 Mr. Higgins.20 The case is submitted.21 (Whereupon, at 12:06 p.m., the case in the22 above-entitled matter was submitted.)23 24 25￼51
