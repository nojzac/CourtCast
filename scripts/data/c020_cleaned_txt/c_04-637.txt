John David Stumpf.          Mr. Cole.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS R. COLE                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. COLE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleasethe Court:          John Stumpf pleaded guilty to the aggravatedmurder of Mary Jane Stout.  The evidence shows he is, infact, guilty of that crime.  The court below, nonetheless,vacated his conviction on habeas review citing twogrounds.  Its reasoning on each directly conflicts withthis Court's opinions and significantly undermines thefinality of the hundreds of thousands of State courtcriminal convictions based on pleas.given theJUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Counsel, I -- I think he wasdeath sentence.  Is that right?MR. COLE:  That is correct, Your Honor.JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  At the end of the day.And there was a separate sentencing hearing?          MR. COLE:  There was a separate mitigationhearing under Ohio law, yes, Your Honor.JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And was it argued at that 31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425hearing by the State that Stumpf was the triggerman?          MR. COLE:  Your Honor, the State said that they-- they thought there was evidence to support that.  Theysaid, I don't believe it's necessary for this court toconclude he was the actual shooter, and that's in thejoint appendix at 186.  So the death penalty isappropriate --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  But it was argued.          MR. COLE:  The court -- or I'm sorry.  Theprosecutor argued that there was sufficient evidence toshow it.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  And was there evidence at therecent habeas hearing that at least one of the sentencersrelied on the fact that the judge thought Stumpf was thetriggerman and the murderer?          MR. COLE:  Your Honor, after -- at the time ofthe original sentencing hearing there was no otherevidence,this new evidence of which he complaining --JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Right.MR. COLE:  -- didn't exist.JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Right.          MR. COLE:  When it came into being, he thenmoved to vacate his sentence at the State --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Right.          MR. COLE:  -- court.  And the judge there from41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the original panel --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Yes.          MR. COLE:  -- one of the judges said, it mayhave made a difference.  Of course, they had before them amotion to vacate the -- the sentence at that time, andthey denied that motion.  So apparently it didn't make adifference to that judge.          Two other Ohio courts have independentlyreweighed all of the evidence and found that the deathsentence was appropriate.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, I guess my concernactually is more with the sentencing proceeding here, inlight of what's happened, than with the guilty plea.  AndI suppose it's possible that that stands, but conceivablyhe's entitled to a hearing on the sentencing aspect.          MR. COLE:  I -- I guess that would beconceivable, Your Honor, although I note that there's onlyone due process claim he's making.  He's making one formof constitutional error claim predicated on the DueProcess Clause, and if there was no due process violationwith respect to his conviction, which is the claim that hewas pressing before the Sixth Circuit, there's similarlyno due process violation with respect to his sentence.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Do you think he has waived51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 any due process claim insofar as it applies to the2 sentencing? Do you think that's waived? Is that clear?3 MR. COLE: No, Your Honor, I wouldn't say that.4 In his Sixth Circuit briefs, he does -- in a section5 that's entitled I hereby challenge my conviction, he does6 also note in that section that he's got some concerns7 about his sentencing hearing. So I don't know that he's8 waived that. But I don't believe that there's a valid due9 process claim that he has with regard to either his10 conviction or his sentence.11 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why do you argue that if there12 is no due process violation with respect to the actual13 plea, there is, therefore, no due process violation with14 respect to the sentence?15 MR. COLE: Well, because his theory, Justice16 Souter, is the same with regard to both. He says this --17 the use of this --18 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but we -- we may say the19 theory really is -- is not sufficiently relevant with20 respect to the plea but that it is with respect to the21 sentence.22 MR. COLE: That's conceivable, Your Honor. We23 understand that the -- we understood the Sixth Circuit24 opinion to be directed toward his conviction. So the --25 JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I -- no question about61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that.2 MR. COLE: -- the thrust of our arguments before3 this Court were directed towards the conviction. The4 other side then raised, oh, the State has waived their5 claim about the sentencing, and -- and we were just6 making --7 JUSTICE SOUTER: No.8 MR. COLE: -- clear that, A, we haven't, but B,9 in any event, the due process theory sounds the same in10 both. And so if there's not a due process problem, with11 respect to these arguably inconsistent theories, then12 there's not a due process problem with respect to his13 sentence either. He hasn't brought any other set of14 facts --15 JUSTICE SOUTER: No. I -- I understand that.16 May I go back just to one factual issue before17 we go on and forget it? You -- you stated, in response to18 Justice O'Connor, that the State argued in -- in the19 Stumpf case that there was sufficient evidence to find20 that he was the triggerman. Did the State stop there and21 say, in effect, we don't care whether you find him the22 triggerman or not? We're just telling you there's enough23 evidence. I -- I assumed the State went on to say there24 is enough and25 MR.1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400you ought to find that he is the triggerman.COLE:  Well, Your Honor, referring to page7 Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 187 and 188 of the joint appendix, he says, given those2 circumstances, although we believe the evidence does prove3 he was the shooter of Mary Jane Stout, legally,4 technically, I don't believe it makes any difference when5 you have two people acting in concert for the joint and6 unlawful purpose of committing an aggravated robbery and7 -- and murder results.8 JUSTICE SOUTER: Did -- did the prosecutor ever9 say he was the triggerman? The evidence supports it and10 -- and that's the conclusion that ought to be drawn: he11 was the triggerman.12 MR. COLE: He said there's ample evidence from13 which the court could conclude --14 JUSTICE SOUTER: But did he take the second step15 and say there's ample evidence and he was, in fact, the16 triggerman and you should so find, or in so many words?17 MR. COLE: In so many words, Your Honor, in18 connection with the mitigation phase, in -- in connection19 with the factual basis hearing even, he put on the20 evidence saying, you know, Mr. Stumpf says he wasn't the21 shooter and gives a lot of reasons to discount that22 evidence. So he's arguing that in fact Mr. Stumpf was the23 shooter. I think it's a fair implication if he doesn't24 say the express words, but it's a fair implication.25 Of course, at that time, there was absolutely no81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 evidence to the contrary. Mr. Wesley had not yet been2 extradited from Texas. He hadn't even made this alleged3 statement 45 Stumpf --6 triggerman with respect to Mrs. Stout.7 But I wanted to ask you a question about -- that8 -- it relates to the sentencing part and it follows upto Mr. Eastman.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, the -- the evidence wasStumpf himself who said Wesley was the9 Justice O'Connor's question. The -- the -- you -- as --10 if I understood you right, you said, well, there was a11 motion that came before two of the three judges that were12 part of the guilty plea and the sentencing. This was a13 plea, so no jury trial. It was three judges. One of them14 had died. The -- the two who remained -- one of them15 said, but if we had not been satisfied that Stumpf was, in16 fact, the triggerman, and we were satisfied that he was,17 in fact, an aider or abetter, that may very well have had18 an effect on the court's determination whether the death19 penalty should follow. I'm not saying it would, but it's20 possible. And then you said, but then he went ahead and21 voted to deny the motion.22 MR. COLE: To vacate the sentence, yes, Your23 Honor.24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. But there's no25 explanation at all. The only expression that we have from91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that judge is -- he said, well, it's conceivable, although2 it wouldn't affect guilt, we would have come out with a3 different sentence, and then going from that statement to4 nothing, just a denial without explanation. You -- you5 want us to infer from that silent denial that the judge6 must have resolved his own difficulty and decided it7 wouldn't make any difference on the sentence.8 MR. COLE: Well, A, I think that's an inference9 that's supported by the fact that he voted to deny the10 motion, but B, in any event, there's been an independent11 reweighing of all of the evidence in the Ohio intermediate12 appellate court and that court said that -- very13 specifically said, even if we didn't believe he was the14 principal -- or principal offender, the actual shooter --15 we do believe that. But even if we didn't, the death16 sentence here would be appropriate. And this Court noted17 in Clemons that an independent reweighing by an appellate18 court of the evidentiary record can be sufficient to19 secure -- or to --20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it would be appropriate21 because the statute permits it. But the decision-maker22 has three choices. And if the evidence had come in that23 Wesley was the triggerman, maybe the -- this panel of24 judges would have done what the jury did in Wesley's case,25 that is, it's the same crime, but not give the death101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 penalty for it.2 MR. COLE: Well, Justice -- Justice Ginsburg,3 the -- the evidence wasn't available at the time of the4 original sentence. So the failure to have that part of5 the record at the time of the original sentencing hearing,6 of course, can't violate due process.7 And then the question would be, did something8 that happened later violate due process? But I just don't9 think it can be the case that anytime new evidence comes10 up that might cause a judge to say, boy, if we'd have had11 that evidence before when we -- when we reached the12 sentencing decision, we might have reached a different13 result --14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what -- what is the rule15 if there are two successive -- there are successive trials16 with different defendants and there can only be one17 shooter and in each trial it's found that the defendant is18 the shooter? What should be the rule, or does the -- does19 the second person get the advantage? Does the State have20 to begin all over again with both? Or -- or does the21 State have no obligation to correct either?22 MR. COLE: Well, Justice Kennedy, I -- I think23 it depends, at least in part, on what role that finding24 played. If those two verdicts each had as an essential25 component this fact, this person is the shooter and this111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 person is the shooter, so that the verdicts are2 necessarily inconsistent so that we know the State has3 actually got someone in jail they're punishing that's4 innocent, we would concede there may be a substantive due5 process right of the -- against the State because the6 State at that point --7 JUSTICE SCALIA: By whom? By whom? By which8 one of the two?9 MR. COLE: Your Honor, I -- I think that's a10 great question.11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do we flip a coin?12 MR. COLE: Well, I -- I think the point is13 probably both would have some kind of claim in that I14 don't think the State can pursue and convict two people on15 necessarily inconsistent theories because at that --16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why is that? I mean, it17 seems to me due process requires that there be enough18 evidence to -- for a jury to find beyond a reasonable19 doubt that -- that the person was the shooter. And if in20 -- if there is, indeed, in both cases enough such21 evidence, it seems to me there is no denial of due22 process, and that the usual manner of accommodating for23 that apparent injustice is -- is for the Governor to grant24 clemency to one of the two, have him figure out which one25 of the two wasn't the shooter, or to apply for -- for121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 reopening of the -- of the -- of one of cases. But I2 don't know that there is automatically a due process3 violation which allows one or the other of the cases --4 proper convictions. Each one is fully proper. I don't5 know that there's a due process violation that allows one6 of them to be set aside.7 MR. COLE: And I don't know that there is8 either, Your Honor. We'd be willing to concede that for9 purposes of this argument because even if there is, it10 doesn't apply here --11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Due -- due process doesn't mean12 perfection. It doesn't mean that each jury has to always13 reach the right result.14 MR. COLE: I -- I agree with that, Your Honor,15 and I hate to argue against my position, so I -- I do this16 gently. But at the same time, the court has noted and --17 and one of the old saws of American law is -- is it's18 better one guilty person should go free than that one19 innocent person should be punished. And if the State20 knows, as a matter of fact, that it secured two21 convictions for a crime that only one committed, the State22 knows at that point that it's punishing at least one23 innocent person and that might violate --24 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: When -- when did this25 new evidence come to light?131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. COLE: The new evidence came to light some 62 months after his plea was entered and after the sentence3 was announced.4 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Did the other guy5 confess to a -- kind of a jailhouse snitch?6 MR. COLE: To -- to a jailhouse informant, yes,7 Your Honor. And the prosecutor put that evidence on at8 trial, at Wesley's trial, but it's interesting to note9 what he did with that evidence at Wesley's trial. He put10 it on but then in closing very expressly noted that while11 there's been this evidence, even if you don't believe he's12 the principal offender, you can still find him guilty of13 aggravated murder.14 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it is the case that he15 argued that -- that you should find him guilty because he16 was the triggerman. I mean, that was an alternative17 argument. So the -- I mean, I think what's the -- the18 concern following Justice Kennedy's question, the concern19 that I have is not with the -- the guilt or innocence as20 such here. It's with the sentencing. And as -- it seems21 to me fair to say that as the record stands now, the State22 has made two arguments: one that Stumpf was the23 triggerman, one that Wesley was the triggerman. It has to24 be the case that one of those arguments, if accepted,25 would lead to a false result.141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 And the question -- I think the due process2 question is whether the State can pursue those3 inconsistent arguments, even if it starts out innocently4 doing it, but can it pursue two inconsistent arguments5 knowing that in one case the argument must be for a false6 result, without there being any kind of -- of process to7 correct the State's inconsistent positions? What -- I8 mean, what's your response to that?9 MR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, first, I -- I don't10 think they're -- he was without process. Mr. Stumpf had11 abundant process within the State system. He got all the12 evidence --13 JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, he could -- he could get14 into court, but as I understand it, there was no15 recognition here that there is -- that there is in fact16 something wrong with the two inconsistent -- or the two17 arguments of the State, each of which, if accepted, will18 necessarily result in one false conclusion.19 MR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, the -- again, the20 intermediate appellate court independently reweighed this21 evidence and concluded that even if we conclude that Mr.22 Stumpf is not the shooter, even if that's our -- our23 conclusion -- it isn't, but even were we to conclude that,24 the death penalty would still be appropriate here. So25 there's been an independent reweighing of the evidence151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 minus the mitigating evidence or minus the --2 JUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe -- maybe that's enough.3 Let me, with respect to that, just ask you one final4 question. And I'm assuming the -- the answer, but I want5 to be sure.6 I assume that at the point of this intermediate7 court's reweighing, the intermediate court was aware of8 the -- the evidence of -- of -- the hearsay evidence of9 Wesley's confession and was aware that the State argued in10 the second case that Wesley was the triggerman. Am I11 correct?12 MR. COLE: Yes, Your Honor. He -- the13 prosecutor, in fact, stipulated to the admissibility of14 the Eastman and the Wesley evidence from Wesley's trial15 back into the Stumpf proceeding in the original trial16 court before the two judges -- the two of the three judges17 that were 181920 appeal. 2122 admitted,23 the second case that Wesley was the triggerman.24 MR.25 indictment in1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400COLE:  I believe so, Your Honor.  TheWesley's case included a specification that16 Washington, DC 20005 1-remaining at that point, and then --JUSTICE SOUTER:  And -- and I take it also --MR. COLE:  That was part of the record onJUSTICE SOUTER:  -- stipulated or represented orwhatever, that in fact the State had argued in￼1 he was the principal offender, so at the very least, the2 indictment would --3 JUSTICE SOUTER: Because of being -- because of4 being the triggerman.5 MR. COLE: The only way to be the principal6 offender under that specification is to be the triggerman.7 So that -- that's clear from the face of the indictment in8 -- in Wesley's case that the State had argued that.9 Now, the jury, importantly in Wesley's case,10 found that he should be acquitted on that aggravating11 circumstance. It's not an element of the crime, but it's12 one of the aggravating circumstances that the State could13 rely on in seeking the death penalty in Wesley's case, and14 the jury specifically rejected that aggravating15 circumstance and -- and found that the State had not16 proved it beyond a reasonable doubt.17 Throughout the -- throughout the appellate18 process, with regard to the sentence, the State's attorney19 argued that, yes, there's evidence in the record from20 which you could conclude that he's the actual shooter, but21 in any event, it doesn't matter. And the -- the State's22 attorney was correct in that, as a matter of Ohio law,23 aiders and abetters can both be found24 murder under Ohio law and are subject25 penalty.171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  1-guilty of aggravatedto the deathWashington, DC 20005￼1 The two -- the two aggravating circumstances --2 I'm sorry. The one aggravating circumstance that remained3 after the plea deal turned merely on the reason why Mrs.4 Stout had been put to death. It did not turn at all on5 who was the person who put her to death. So as an6 accomplice, aider, and abetter, with liability for the7 aggravated murder, he was also subject to the death8 penalty under that --9 JUSTICE STEVENS: But, General Cole, isn't there10 a distinction between eligibility for the death penalty11 and actually making the decision to impose the death12 penalty? And it's perfectly clear -- you're dead right,13 of course. He's eligible under either theory. But is it14 not likely that the sentencer would be more likely to15 sentence the defendant to death if the sentencer thought16 he had been the actual shooter?17 MR. COLE: I -- I think it's definitely a fact18 that the court weighs, although here we have evidence that19 at least one Ohio court took that possibility into account20 and said even in light of that fact --21 JUSTICE STEVENS: Right.22 MR. COLE: -- we still conclude that the death23 sentence is appropriate. So I don't know that we can say24 that in this case it in any way would change the outcome.25 In fact, the record --181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, and the originalsentencer might -- might not have done the same thing.  Wedon't really know that.          MR. COLE:  Well, this did go back in front ofthe two -- two of the three original sentencers and theydeclined to allow him to vacate his sentence.  Theintermediate appellate court then independently reweighedand expressly said, whether he's the shooter or not, he'seligible for the death sentence.  So there have been anumber of Ohio judges that have --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  As I understand the facts, evenif he hadn't shot the wife to death, which was what theprosecution was for, he had tried to kill the husband,shooting him twice in the head?          MR. COLE:  Twice at the head from essentiallypoint-blank range, Your Honor.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  From point-blank range.          MR. COLE:  Right.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And then there was somediscussion that the -- that the lying, seriously woundedhusband heard between the two perpetrators, and then therewas shooting of the wife.  Whether he pulled the triggeror not, could that possibly make a difference?  He didpull the trigger trying to kill the husband.  Is itdifficult to -- to think that -- that he willingly allowed191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 his -- his cohort to do the same to the wife? I -- I2 can't imagine it would make any difference.3 MR. COLE: Your Honor, we agree and that4 certainly falls well within the -- the range of5 culpability that this Court set out in Tyson as --6 JUSTICE BREYER: There's no doubt that they7 could have -- the trier of fact could have reached the8 same conclusion. But I guess the problem is that when you9 go back to reopen the evidence the second time and the10 judges are sitting there, someone might have thought,11 well, the husband didn't die, and we don't know if he12 actually pulled the trigger on the wife. And we're trying13 to guess what those judges would have done if they thought14 that. I don't know. It could be that people don't want15 to impose capital punishment without thinking I know that16 this person has killed somebody, and if that's so, they17 wouldn't have reached the same conclusion.18 Now, I guess that's the problem because at that19 time on reopening, the State told that panel of judges20 pretty clearly by implication that the State thought that21 the evidence did support Stumpf having pulled the trigger,22 even though at that point the State knew and indeed23 referred to the statement to -- you know, the confession24 and all the things in the second trial.25 Now, what do you think about that problem?201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. COLE:  Well, first, Your Honor, I don'tthink we have to guess what the judges would do becausethe judges did what they did.  They denied the motion tovacate and then --          JUSTICE BREYER:  They denied it, but as I readwhat the Ohio court said after the denial, I thought itdid probably rest upon their determination that Stumpf hadpulled the trigger.          MR. COLE:  And certainly the intermediate --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Did you think that?          MR. COLE:  Well, the intermediate appellatecourt expressly said that its determination did not turnon who had pulled the trigger, that they would havereached the same conclusion independent of who pulled thetrigger.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the panel -- the panelthat didn't reopen -- there was no reopening because theydenied the motion.  But they didn't say one way oranother.          JUSTICE BREYER:  It's the Supreme Court of Ohiothat then I think I got my impression from, and of course,they don't know either.          MR. COLE:  Well --          JUSTICE BREYER:  The fact is we don't know whatthat original panel thought.211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. COLE:  That's --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it isn't that -- isn'tone of the answers to Justice Breyer's questions that you-- you never know exactly what a fact finder would do.What you have to deal with are reasonable likelihoods andreasonable possibilities.          MR. COLE:  That's --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And when -- and when you havesomeone who shoots the first person and is obviouslyattempting to kill him, and then there's an apparentdiscussion -- not -- not 100 percent clear that those werethe two voices.  It's pretty clear because there were onlytwo other people there.  So we talk about reasonablelikelihoods, don't we?          MR. COLE:  I would think that's --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Absolutely right.  Of course,that's right.  But we can't be sure what they would havedone, and because we can't be sure what they would havedone, I guess it might well have made a difference thatthe State told that panel we think Stumpf pulled the trigger.          MR. COLE:  But --          JUSTICE BREYER:  And that's what gives rise tothe problem in the case.          MR. COLE:  But, Justice Breyer, I think it --it's always going to be the case that after a sentence is221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 announced, there's the possibility that new evidence might2 come up that would cause us to say we can't know for sure3 what this panel would have done with that new evidence.4 And so there needs to be --5 JUSTICE BREYER: -- the State say when it comes6 to the panel, the reopening panel, we'll tell you7 something. We think, indeed, that's what we argued, that8 the State -- in the last case we argued that Stumpf didn't9 pull the trigger, that the balance of evidence is against10 that, but nonetheless, he should be sentenced to death.11 That would make your position absolutely consistent with12 what you argued in that second trial with Mr. --13 MR. COLE: Mr. Wesley.14 JUSTICE BREYER: Mr. Wesley.15 MR. COLE: But, Your Honor, I'm not sure that16 that would have been the State's position. I don't17 believe after the Wesley trial, that the balance of the18 evidence necessarily showed that Wesley was the shooter19 versus Stumpf. That was one person's testimony.20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. Now, the -- the jury in21 the Wesley trial rejected that position.22 MR. COLE: They did, Your Honor, and Mr. Wesley23 -- it isn't as though all the new evidence is in Mr.24 Stumpf's favor. Mr. Wesley, the only other eyewitness25 who's testified, came and sat on the witness stand and231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 said, yes, Mr. Stumpf pulled the trigger. At the end of2 the day, the only two people who know exactly who pulled3 the trigger are Mr. Wesley and Mr. Stumpf, and they have4 every reason to point their finger at the other person.5 So if that's --6 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but wait. Who did the --7 who was the last person the State pointed its finger at?8 You -- you told me in -- in response to earlier questions9 that when the case back before the two remaining members10 of the panel, that in fact the State brought the -- called11 to their attention the fact that Wesley had confessed and12 -- and it was -- it was clear one way or another that --13 that they had argued in Wesley's trial that he was the14 triggerman.15 When they -- at that point when they are back16 before the two remaining members of the panel in Stumpf's17 case, did the State say we now go back to our original18 position that Stumpf was the triggerman and Wesley wasn't,19 or did they say we think -- we think Wesley is the20 triggerman and Stumpf wasn't? Or did the State simply21 stand there agnostic?22 MR. COLE: The State -- and I would encourage23 the Court to look at the State's response to that motion,24 which is in joint appendix at 126. But what the State25 says on 126 is -- essentially there's a lot of agnosticism241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425in the response.  It says, look, there's this newevidence.  We don't know.  It seems like from this recordyou could conclude that Stumpf was the shooter, but thenthe State says even deleting that finding, even if youdon't agree with us, or even if you don't agree that's thecase, because the State isn't really saying this is ourposition anymore, even if you delete that finding, there'sstill sufficient evidence here to support a death penaltyagainst Mr. Stumpf.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Could -- could I get one fact?Wesley didn't confess or we don't know that he confessed.He -- he said he wasn't the shooter at trial, didn't he?          MR. COLE:  That's correct, Your Honor.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  But what was introduced was --was the testimony of one of his jailhouse companions whosaid that Wesley had told him that he was the shooter.  Sowho was the shooter was -- was as much an issue inWesley's trial as it was in Stumpf's trial, wasn't it?          MR. COLE:  As the court expressly -- or as -- asthe State expressly noted in its closing in that case --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes, but the State's positionwas that the jailhouse informant had told the truth,wasn't it?          MR. COLE:  In closing --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  At the trial.251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. COLE: In -- in closing at that trial, Your2 Honor, the -- the prosecutor was relatively agnostic,3 frankly. He said, look, you could conclude --4 JUSTICE STEVENS: He at least put in the5 evidence.6 MR. COLE: He -- he put in the evidence, and7 then he said, look, from this evidence you could conclude8 that Wesley was the shooter. You could also --9 JUSTICE STEVENS: Normally you don't put in10 evidence unless you think it will support a proposition11 that you -- that you're in favor of.12 MR. COLE: Well, and Your Honor, I -- I think if13 he could show Wesley was the shooter, that would, of14 course, support a conviction against Wesley, but he15 recognized that the jury didn't necessarily need to16 believe that, and in fact, he wasn't relying on that in17 order to secure the conviction.18 JUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you one final19 question? As a matter of due process, why shouldn't the20 State -- after learning of the supposed admission in21 Wesley, after taking Wesley's position, why shouldn't the22 State, when it gets back to the Stumpf case before the23 remaining two members of the panel, have to fish or cut24 bait on a position and say we think he's the triggerman25 and we want you to affirm on that basis, or we don't think261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425he was the triggerman because we've taken this otherposition?  Why can the State, as a matter of due process,stand there agnostic?          MR. COLE:  Because, Your Honor, the State is notthe fact finder.  The judge is the fact finder.  The Stateneeds to put the evidence in and allow counsel for thedefendant, counsel for the State to argue positions, andlet the fact finder make the ultimate determination.          With the Court's permission, I'd like to reservethe rest of my time.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Very well, Mr. Cole.          Mr. Freedman, we'll hear from you.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN M. FREEDMAN                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MR. FREEDMAN:  In light of the questioning, I'dlike to indicate what exactly was argued below and whatwas the rulings.  In -- in the first Stumpf trial, they --they argued that there was, quote/unquote, ample evidenceto point --          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Who is they?          MR. FREEDMAN:  The prosecutors.  I'm sorry.  Mr.Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:          The prosecutors argued that there was ampleevidence, quote/unquote, pointed --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Freedman, it wasn't a 271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425trial.  It was a -- it was a plea hearing.          MR. FREEDMAN:  That's correct, but there was --but -- but in Ohio there's a requirement to have an actualprove-up of the aggravating factor itself.  And theyargued that there was ample evidence, quote/unquote,pointed to Stumpf as the killer, and that's in jointappendix 186 to 187.  Ultimately they -- and they urgedthat he was the shooter.          Then when the Wesley trial took place, at thetrial they did the same thing.  They used the same terms,quote/unquote, ample evidence that Wesley was the shooter.They urged a finding that Wesley was -- was the shooter.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I -- I thought the prosecutorin closing in the Wesley trial said, it could have beenStumpf, but it doesn't make any difference.          MR. FREEDMAN:  They --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought they argued both?          MR. FREEDMAN:  That -- they really didn't argueboth.  They -- they -- effect -- that was the throwawayargument.  They came in there -- what -- what I think iscritical in both trials and later on in the proceedings iswhat they were urging, what they were recommending the --to the jury.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but it's at the bottomof page 187.  We're on this same point.  Given these281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 circumstances --2 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what page is that?3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 187 like the -- of the joint4 appendix. Given these circumstances, although we believe5 the evidence does prove he was the shooter, I don't6 believe it makes any difference when you have two people7 acting in concert for the joint and unlawful purpose of8 committing an aggravating robbery. That's at the top of9 188.10 MR. FREEDMAN: But the -- but they urged. They11 recommended. They didn't come in and say -- and12 throughout this proceeding -- we don't know who the13 shooter is. We don't care who the shooter is. They both14 deserve the death penalty. They -- they were -- the15 prosecutors were aware that the -- the death penalty is16 what stirs the pot here, and so they were urging somebody17 to be the shooter to get the death penalty. If this18 wasn't a death penalty case, I don't think they -- it19 would have mattered who killed who. And so they were20 urging --21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think there's quite a22 difference in -- in case A where you say our position is23 that Stumpf was the shooter, pure and simple. That's it.24 In case B, they say we think Stumpf was the shooter.25 We're not 100 percent sure, but he should get the death291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425penalty.  The alternative is before the sentencer and thesentencer can make that determination.          MR. FREEDMAN:  But -- but they took the positionof actually urging, making a recommendation.  I -- I don'tthink there would be a due process violation if they said,we don't know.  They didn't take that.  They -- they urgeda position, and I think that's the key factor when the --in this case.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  What -- what was the dueprocess violation here?  You're talking about due processin the second trial, in --          MR. FREEDMAN:  The due process violation, YourHonor, would be --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Was in the first trial?          MR. FREEDMAN:  No, of course, it wasn't inthe first trial.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that's the trial thatyou're trying to get set aside here.          MR. FREEDMAN:  We submit that the due processerror is at the motion to vacate.  At that time, again,after taking the position that Wesley was the shooter,they came back and urged that -- that Stumpf was theshooter, that the record was ample enough to supportStumpf being the shooter --JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it was. They're -- 301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 they're just -- they're just arguing that the evidence we2 introduced supported the jury verdict. What -- what is3 wrong with arguing that? There's --4 MR. FREEDMAN: Because they've taken5 inconsistent positions. The -- the violation here is in6 the positions itself, not in necessarily the results.7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not if they said in the8 second trial it doesn't matter whether he's the shooter.9 MR. FREEDMAN: I think they did more than it10 didn't -- it just didn't matter. I think they urged the11 position. It would -- I mean, a lot of the cases in the12 lower courts have made that distinction when the -- when13 the State comes in and says, we don't know what happens.14 We can't tell you who the shooter is or not, and we don't15 care who the shooter is.16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the State had said on17 motion for resentencing in Stumpf's trial, Your Honor, we18 took the position that Wesley was the shooter in Wesley's19 trial. The jury disbelieved that. We accept the jury's20 verdict. Our position now is that -- that Stumpf was the21 shooter. We've learned from the jury verdict in the22 Wesley trial. We've had 12 people. They heard the23 evidence. We'll accept that. Any difference in that case24 and what we have here?25 MR. FREEDMAN: It's different, but that's not311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 what happened. It's different if they've taken -- if2 they've taken the position --3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It -- it would -- in the case4 I put, would your argument be the same, and if so, why?5 MR. FREEDMAN: I -- I put it that it's not the6 same because they -- first of all, in reality,7 what they did. But let's talk in terms of the8 hypothetical that -- that you've asked me. It9 have to also look at what actually happened inthat's notis that youthe Wesley10 trial to determine due process for Stumpf because Wesley11 -- what happened in this case through the whole circular12 reasoning, Wesley didn't get the death penalty here13 because they were informed that Stumpf pled guilty, was14 found to be the principal offender, and was sentenced to15 death. Now --16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That was introduced by17 Wesley, not by the prosecution.18 MR. FREEDMAN: That's correct. The prosecution19 in the Wesley trial originally did not want the -- the20 jury to hear at all what happened in Stumpf's trial. They21 wanted to argue the complete -- that -- that Stumpf's22 verdict was not even -- should be informed. The sentence23 of death shouldn't be informed or the sentence of death.24 And in fact, that's when they started to throw in a little25 bit of the alternative theory after that evidence did321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 subsequently get in. The record shows that they2 originally did not get it in and they allowed the defense3 counsel -- prevented defense from getting -- in the Wesley4 trial from getting in the evidence of the Stumpf trial.5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Freedman, you're trying6 to read back now into what apparently you recognize is --7 is not a flawed initial sentencing hearing.8 MR. FREEDMAN: That's correct.9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it might be more10 persuasive if the trier were a jury when the motion to11 vacate is made, but these are judges whose business it is12 to preside over these kinds of cases. They presided over13 that first hearing and now the same prosecutor -- was the14 same prosecutor in both?15 MR. FREEDMAN: That's correct, Your Honor.16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Comes back to them and says,17 judges, don't vacate the sentence that you yourself18 entered. It's -- given that we're dealing with19 sophisticated20 it's a little21 violation is.22 MR.23 at the minimum, assuming that -- that a weighing is even24 appropriate here, they never weighed it, and clearly any25 indication that there was a waiver -- a -- a weighing of331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-judges, the same panel in both episodes,hard to -- to see where the due processFREEDMAN:  The due process violation is that￼1 whether Mr. Stumpf would be put to death as an aider and2 abetter. They never took Eastman's testimony as true and3 -- and the prosecution's position as true, and then4 ultimately said it would make no difference.5 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, they didn't have to take6 it as true. As I understand it, when they went back7 before the -- the two original judges on the motion to8 vacate, they didn't have to take the -- the testimony9 about the jailhouse admission as true, and they didn't10 have to take the State's position at the Wesley trial as11 true. It was evidence. It was before them. They were in12 -- they were required to consider it.13 But as I understand it, the State at that point14 essentially was -- was agnostic. The State said, you15 know, this is what happened, this is what we said, this is16 what the jury did in17 how you determine --18 triggerman, this man19 vacate the sentence.20 And -- and21 one, there doesn't seem to be at that point a -- a problem22 with the State taking inconsistent positions, i.e., with23 its position in -- in the -- in the Wesley case, and there24 doesn't seem to be any -- any lack of candor. There may25 be a -- a lack of initiative on the State's part to fish341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-the second trial, but regardless ofof -- of any determination aboutStumpf still deserves death, so don'tthere was nothing I guess -- number￼1 or cut bait, but there's no lack of candor. So where does2 the due process violation come at that point?3 MR. FREEDMAN: We submit the due process4 violation comes at the time of the motion to vacate. We5 urge -- we're urging that they've not take an agnostic6 position as prosecutors. They're -- they're urging again7 saying the -- the evidence is ample to support that --8 that Stumpf was -- was the shooter.9 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it -- I mean, that -- that10 statement is true, I take it.11 MR. FREEDMAN: But -- but they're also urging a12 position. The State at some point should take a position13 on what the evidence is. At that position -- at that14 point, after urging that Mr. Wesley is the shooter, they15 -- were they untrue? Were they -- I mean, the prosecutors16 at that point maybe then -- if they were believing that --17 that Eastman was testifying truthfully, why wouldn't they18 now believe that he was testifying truthfully now in the19 motion to vacate?20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, because it seems to me21 they -- they would have two arguments. One is even if he22 wasn't the shooter, you -- you should23 imposed the death penalty anyway, but24 is, wait a minute. You know, yes, we25 the shooter is but there's a -- there351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  1--- you would haveargument number two-- we don't know whowas no violation ofWashington, DC 20005￼1 due process here. There was plenty of evidence for you to2 find that he was the shooter. That evidence is still3 there. Do you expect them to throw away that argument? I4 mean, it's -- it's very true and it goes to whether this5 conviction and sentence deserve to be set aside.6 MR. FREEDMAN: We -- we proffer to the Court7 that they shouldn't be taking inconsistent positions as to8 -- in a death penalty case in the sentencing --9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What should -- what -- was10 Wesley then denied due process? Because at the time of11 Stumpf's initial plea hearing, Eastman hadn't appeared and12 there was only Stumpf's testimony that he was not the13 triggerman and the prosecutor's evidence that he was.14 Then we get to Wesley, and Eastman shows up.15 The prosecutors have already taken the position that16 Stumpf was the triggerman. Is Wesley denied due process17 because they're taking inconsistent positions at his18 trial?19 MR. FREEDMAN: I -- I don't believe that Wesley20 was denied due process. They discovered the evidence21 afterwards and ultimately at that trial they had -- the22 Wesley jury had the opportunity to hear what happened in23 the Stumpf trial, and they were able to weigh that case24 along with the evidence of the Stumpf finding and sentence25 of death and the finding that he was the principal361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425offender.  That's something we submit has not happened inthis death penalty case.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, do you concede that theevidence presented in the Stumpf proceeding was sufficientto support a finding of guilt as an aider and abetter?Was there enough evidence that the fact finder could sofind?          MR. FREEDMAN:  Without the Wesley evidence, I --I -- at the initial trial, I certainly would concede that.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Right, right.          MR. FREEDMAN:  As -- as to -- as to whether theevidence that you learn from the Wesley trial -- that's amuch closer question because the -- the aggravating factorin this case --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  She asked as aider or abetter,not as shooter.          MR. FREEDMAN:  Okay, all right.  I'm just --that's correct.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  And as to that, it seems tome the guilty plea can stand and the only question that,it seems to me, I would have would be with the sentencing,and I'm not sure that has to be overturned.that.MR. FREEDMAN:  Well --JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  So it would help to focus on371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. FREEDMAN: I --2 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Did you address, on behalf of3 Stumpf, some allegation that he has to be resentenced?45 the Sixth 6789 somehow?MR. FREEDMAN:  That's correct, and that's whatCircuit --JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Is that still before us?MR. FREEDMAN:  That -- that is correct.JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Or has that been subsumed1011 there's a12 challenge13 Sixth -- the sentence was challenged by the Sixth Circuit14 and found to be defective and a violation of due -- of due15 process, and that's in the cert --16 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought a State appellate17 court had effectively reweighed and effectively18 resentenced, saying that this additional evidence would,19 in our view, have made no difference. And we -- we allow20 that to happen all the time. We speculate as to what the21 -- what the sentencer would have done had an invalid22 factor not been there. I mean, when -- when a -- an23 aggravating factor is -- is invalidated, the State supreme24 court can determine, you know, whether the same sentence25 of death would have been imposed even without that381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-MR. FREEDMAN:  No.  That's before you.  In fact,-- there's a question of whether they eventhat.  But clearly, that the sentence by the￼1 aggravating factor. Why is this any different?2 MR. FREEDMAN: Well -- well, I'd like to ask --3 answer that in two ways. First, the -- we would submit4 that a reweighing isn't necessary. This is not like5 vacating an aggravating factor. This is determining a6 constitutional error of due process.7 But let's assume for the moment that reweighing8 is -- is adequate. There was no reweighing, proper9 reweighing, in either the appellate court or the Ohio10 Supreme Court.11 The -- the appellate court, which is the12 intermediate court in Ohio, came out and said both Wesley13 and Stumpf were principal slayers as if they were both14 shooters. And the whole opinion is hinged on the15 assumption that Mr. Stumpf pled guilty to being the16 shooter. If you -- I mean, that's -- we submit that's17 just a fair reading of the opinion.18 And also, if you go to their main opinion, which19 is the final opinion, which this Court reviews, the Ohio20 Supreme Court -- they did the same circular reasoning.21 Ultimately they said he pled guilty. He was the shooter,22 and therefore, Eastman's testimony will have little weight23 as hearsay to -- to vacate the death sentence.

FREEDMAN:  The best case we cite in ourbrief is Green v. Georgia.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which one?          MR. FREEDMAN:  Green v. Georgia where they camein with inconsistent positions.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Mr. Freedman, you've -- you'veargued just a second ago that both of the appellate courtsdecided the case or went through so-called reweighing on afalse premise that he had pleaded guilty to being theshooter.  Let me go back to the -- to the two remainingmembers of the original trial panel.  I take it they didnot make that -- in your judgment that error.          MR. FREEDMAN:  In all candor, I don't know.There's no finding.  They simply said denied.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes.          Let me -- let me ask you what your positionwould be if a hypothetical Justice Kennedy suggestedearlier in the argument were true.  What if the State hadgone back at the -- at the hearing before the original twoin response to the motion to vacate and had said, we did401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 argue in the Wesley case that he was the triggerman? The2 jury rejected that argument. They found that -- that he3 was not. We've -- we've learned from -- from our own4 experience and -- and we now no longer think that -- that5 the evidence from the jailhouse informant should be6 accepted. We're back to the position that we took in the7 -- at the Stumpf sentencing hearing originally, that --8 that he was the triggerman. If the State had taken that9 position, would you have a due process claim?10 MR. FREEDMAN: On -- on this -- on this record,11 we would have a due process claim for twofold. We submit12 that the -- that the error is in the attempt not13 necessarily the success, and particularly in the --14 JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm -- I'm not getting it.15 What do you mean?16 MR. FREEDMAN: I mean -- I mean, it's -- it's17 that they honestly believed that Wesley -- that in the18 Wesley trial, that Eastman testified truthfully. They19 believed that.20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, can't they -- can't they21 profit from the jury's verdict?22 MR. FREEDMAN: Perhaps, but not in this23 particular case because what the jury weighed in Wesley24 was not only Eastman's testimony, they weighed the fact25 that Stumpf pled guilty, was found to be the principal411111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 offender, and was sentenced to death. That's a -- I mean,2 that's going to lead to -- I -- I -- maybe I'm off base3 here, but that's going to lead a jury to come out in a4 conclusion to find Wesley the aider and abetter and not --5 JUSTICE STEVENS: The jury simply decided they6 didn't want to sentence two people to death for the same7 offense.8 MR. FREEDMAN: Right. I mean, they already had9 the principal offender. They already had somebody10 sentenced to death for it.11 JUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask you a procedural12 question here? When I read the -- the Ohio Supreme Court13 opinion, my impression of their due process part of it is14 that they found a violation because of the inconsistency15 between the Wesley trial and the Stumpf sentencing16 proceeding. When you started to talk to Justice Scalia,17 you agreed that couldn't be right. Rather, you said there18 is an inconsistency between what the prosecutor said at19 the Wesley trial and what the prosecutor said when Stumpf20 made his motion to vacate.21 Now, if that's so, I'm not sure that the Ohio22 Supreme Court or the lower courts have addressed that23 question to determine whether24 inconsistent, and if so, what25 made. But I haven't read the421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-they really wereor why or what difference itrecord thoroughly, and my￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425impression might be wrong.  So I'd appreciate your tellingme what are the facts there.          MR. FREEDMAN:  They -- they argued generally in-- in the record, and it was -- it was somewhat cryptic.They argued that it was unfair --          JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Who is they?          MR. FREEDMAN:  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  The --the defense counsel.          JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not interested in whatdefense counsel did or did not say.  I'm interested inwhat the Ohio courts did or did not say.          MR. FREEDMAN:  Thank you.          JUSTICE BREYER:  And my point there is myI repeat it or do you have it?          MR. FREEDMAN:  I have it now, yes.-- do          The -- the Ohio -- the Ohio Supreme Court simply-- simply used -- simply used some sort of circularreasoning.  They -- they hung to the position that Stumpfwas the shooter, and then after that --          JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Let's go to thecircuit court of appeals.  When I read the decision of thecircuit court of appeals in the due -- what -- what am Ireading, which is -- this is in the Sixth Circuit Court ofAppeals.MR. FREEDMAN: Okay. 431111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE BREYER:  They went on both grounds,first the confession -- sorry -- the guilty plea, andsecond, the inconsistency.  Now, there I thought that theSixth Circuit Court of Appeals was -- now, I think Imisspoke because I think that's where I see the problem.          MR. FREEDMAN:  Okay.          JUSTICE BREYER:  You understand what the problemis or shall I --          MR. FREEDMAN:  Yes, I see it.  You want to knowsomewhere in the Sixth Circuit opinion?          JUSTICE BREYER:  The Sixth Circuit seemed to beaddressing the inconsistency between the sentencingproceeding of Stumpf and the Wesley trial.  Well, you saythe inconsistency we should focus upon is between theWesley trial and the motion to vacate.  And I think you'reright about that because I can't imagine the other being aproblem.          MR. FREEDMAN:  I -- I -- maybe I should clarify.I -- I think that you have to compare the Wesley trialwith the Stumpf trial.          JUSTICE BREYER:  It's relevant in terms ofevidence, but I think you're asking us to say that thereis a due process violation because of the inconsistencybetween what the prosecutor said at the Wesley trial andwhat the prosecutor said when Stumpf made his motion to441111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 vacate. Am I right?2 34 the Sixth5 question.67 did it in89 point to anything in which they have addressed thatMR. FREEDMAN:  That's correct.JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  I'm asking you ifCircuit or the Ohio courts has addressed thatMR. FREEDMAN:  I'm uncertain.  I -- I think theya generic fashion.JUSTICE BREYER:  So I read this.  You can't10 question. My quick reading of it -- I couldn't find11 anything in which they addressed that question. And if12 that's so, what should we do?13 MR. FREEDMAN: Well, as an -- as an alternative,14 the Court could remand back to have the Sixth Circuit --15 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Did you raise that16 argument before the Sixth Circuit, the one that you're17 making now?18 MR. FREEDMAN: With absolute certainty, Mr.19 Chief Justice, yes, because they asked the same questions.20 They asked where did the error occur, and that the line of21 the questionings were almost -- on that point was22 identical. They asked questions where did the error come,23 and of course, it wasn't in the first trial. The error24 occurred at the motion to vacate.25 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if Wesley comes451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425in with a -- with a motion to vacate now and -- and hepoints to the inconsistency with the -- with the Stumpftrial?  Would he also be entitled to get his sentencevacated because of the same inconsistency that you'repointing out?          MR. FREEDMAN:  Well, he certainly wouldn't havethe death sentence.  That was -- is solely as to the guiltpart of the case, Justice Scalia?          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.          MR. FREEDMAN:  He might.  He might because the-- the -- I mean --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  So a jury, having found both ofthem guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and possibly on abasis that -- or not a jury but the judges and possibly ona basis that has nothing to do with whether they were theshooter, you think both of them are entitled to have thedeath sentence vacated.  I think that's extraordinary.          MR. FREEDMAN:  Well, in all due respect, onlyone has the sentence --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which one?  I mean, doesn'tWesley have just as much of a complaint as your clientdoes?          MR. FREEDMAN:  Not -- not as to the death -- notas to -- not as to the death sentence, no.JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? 461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. FREEDMAN: Why? One, he didn't -- let's2 assume arguendo that he received the death sentence. He3 had an opportunity --4 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I thought Wesley didn't5 receive a death sentence.6 MR. FREEDMAN: No, he did not. That's what --7 but you --8 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. That's -- that's my9 mistake.10 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. He didn't receive11 the death penalty. What would his argument be with12 respect to guilt or innocence? It seems to me that13 issue only goes to penalty.the --the14 MR. FREEDMAN: There's still an issue out15 because this is killing a witness. As -- he would have a16 tougher role. I don't think Wesley would -- would have17 much of a chance. The -- the version of Mr. Stumpf's18 facts, whether it's a difficult row to hoe is that he --19 he drops the gun. That was one of the -- and -- and20 shortly leaves the scene after that. So that he --21 there's no intent, notwithstanding Justice Scalia's22 position that you -- attempt to shoot Mr. Stout, that he's23 automatically -- the specific intent is inferred. But24 it's not absolutely clear, leaving the scene, that the25 intent could be inferred to kill another witness.471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-there￼1 JUSTICE SOUTER: But that's Stumpf's case.2 MR. FREEDMAN: Yes, that's correct.3 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. So I mean --4 MR. FREEDMAN: So I'm saying that he would5 not --6 JUSTICE SOUTER: I don't see where Wesley --7 MR. FREEDMAN: No, Wesley would not have --8 Wesley would not have that9 JUSTICE SOUTER:10 neither a -- a due process11 nor with respect to guilt.12 MR. FREEDMAN: That's correct. That's correct.13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But now your -- your part14 about the guilt, the Sixth Circuit agreed with you because15 it vacated not only the sentence, but the conviction. And16 what is your argument that the conviction is infirm?17 MR. FREEDMAN: And -- and what they -- they18 deduced from that is that the -- the evidence of the19 Wesley trial -- their position is that -- and the position20 that -- that the prosecutor took and the evidence that21 Eastman took, that there would be no specific intent as to22 the killing of -- of Mary Jane Stout inferred from the23 shooting of Norman Stout because he dropped the gun. I24 mean, you don't -- but there's no -- in -- in Ohio a plan25 is required. There's no foreseeability or reckless481111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-scenario under --So -- so Wesley would haveclaim with respect to sentence￼1 disregard for the death -- for the eligibility for the2 death penalty. It's one of the few States.3 JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I thought the -- the4 specific intent element would be satisfied if -- if they,5 by plan, went to the scene with -- with deadly weapons.6 MR. FREEDMAN: I believe under Ohio law that7 that's not correct. I mean, it's one of the few States.8 And I believe even the cases that are cited by the State9 would infer that.10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the State argued11 that knowledge -- that there's this plan, and they had a12 common design to rob. Is that right? And then the State13 said that common design plus knowledge that an inherently14 dangerous instrument would be employed to perpetuate the15 felony or that the felony and its manner of accomplishment16 would be reasonably likely to produce death. That's what17 the State argued was the law of Ohio.18 MR. FREEDMAN: But I -- I believe that they19 needed a plan for -- for the killing of a witness. They20 needed that plan at the time for killing the witness.21 It's not enough just to plan the robbery for the specific22 intent.23 And -- and they -- in the Wesley trial, I want24 to refer you to page --25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did -- did any judge say491111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that, any judge on the Sixth Circuit say that that was the2 Ohio law?3 MR. FREEDMAN: I believe so. That's my reading4 of the Sixth Circuit opinion. They5 element of -- of intent that was --6 -- the way I interpret the holding.7 I would like to refer you8 the joint appendix, even the last sentence or so in the9 first paragraph. They imply that in the Wesley trial,10 talking about the same scenario, that there's not11 necessarily a plan coming in to kill the witnesses. There12 would have to be a plan while they're in the house. And13 -- and the scenario of Mr. Stumpf dropping the gun I14 believe is arguably that there's no specific intent.15 I -- I would just like to sum up and indicate16 that -- that the State argued in both cases urging the17 death of two individuals based on killing the same person,18 and ultimately there was not adequate review in Mr.19 Stumpf's case indicating that he would have gotten the20 death penalty notwithstanding Eastman's testimony,21 notwithstanding their position that he would have gotten22 the death penalty as an aider and abetter, which is a23 rather rare circumstance not only in Ohio but also in this24 country.251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. 50said that there was anI believe that's thejust to page 295 of￼1 Freedman.2 Mr. Cole, you have 3 minutes remaining.3 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS R. COLE4 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER5 MR. COLE: Justice Ginsburg, to respond to your6 question, under Ohio law you do not need to -- to plan to7 kill the witness in order to have specific intent for8 aggravated murder. I would refer the Court to the In re9 Washington and State v. Scott cases that we cite in our10 brief that say that participation in an aggravated robbery11 where that's going to be done through force or violence or12 in a manner reasonably likely to result in death is13 sufficient to support a -- an intent -- a -- an inference14 of specific intent. So there's -- there's no need to find15 that they planned to kill the witnesses.16 If -- if I heard Mr. Freedman correctly, he17 admitted that Wesley would not have a due process argument18 here because he said the fact finders were apprised of Mr.19 Stumpf's proceedings. Well, exactly the same is true in20 Mr. Stumpf's case. As soon as that testimony became21 available, as soon as Mr. -- as the prosecutor had22 knowledge of Mr. Eastman's testimony, that testimony was23 then placed back in the record for further proceedings in24 the Stumpf matter. The prosecutor made arguments, but I25 don't think that the Due Process Clause requires --511111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE SOUTER: You -- you mean at the hearing2 on the motion to vacate.3 MR. COLE: Hearing on the motion to vacate and4 further appellate review.5 I don't think the Due Process Clause requires6 the State to admit the ultimate truth of everything that7 Mr. Eastman testified to at that other trial. The8 question was did they have a good faith basis for putting9 him on, and they did. And did they have a good faith10 basis then for arguing that notwithstanding what he said,11 that the conviction and the sentence in Mr. Stumpf's case12 were appropriate? And I believe the record supports that13 they did have a good faith basis for making that argument.14 If we look at the arguments they made, they were15 arguments in the nature of, look, there's this evidence in16 the record. You may believe it, you may not. Either way,17 Mr. Stumpf is correctly eligible for the death sentence18 under Ohio law and that sentence is appropriate. And the19 courts found, based on that argument, that Mr. Stumpf had20 appropriately been sentenced to death.21 This Court has noted that the principal function22 of habeas is to assure that no man has been incarcerated23 under a procedure which creates an impermissibly large24 risk that an innocent person will be convicted. Well, we25 don't have that risk here. Stumpf has knowingly and521111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425voluntarily pled guilty, removing any risk about that.And if we look to this sentencing hearing, there's no riskthat he received an impermissibly large sentence becausethe prosecutor made the evidence available, and Stumpf'scounsel used that evidence and argued it, and the courtsimply rejected it.          If the Court has no further questions, I'llstop.  Thank you.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Cole.          The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)1111 14th Street, NW Suite 40053 1-Washington, DC 20005
