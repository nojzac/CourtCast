United States.          Mr. Tanaka.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. MICHAEL TANAKA                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. TANAKA:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          Mr. Daniels was convicted of being an ex-felonin possession of a firearm.  Normally, that charge carriesa maximum term of 10 years.  Where, however, the personhas suffered three qualifying felonies, that term, maximumterm goes up to life, and there's a mandatory minimum termof 15 years, which Mr. Daniels was sentenced to.          Where those convictions are bothunconstitutional and unreliable, the resulting sentence islikewise unconstitutional, and the issue before this caseis whether section 2255 provides a forum and remedy toaddress that unconstitutionality of the sentence.          QUESTION:  May I ask whether the record showswhether the petitioner challenged those '78 and '81convictions in a timely manner on direct appeal at theState and/or Federal level?          MR. TANAKA:  I don't believe that's in the                             3 1    record.  There is no indication that he has challenged 2    those at the State level. 3              QUESTION:  You know, it seems to me that the 4    opportunity to make those challenges very likely occurred 5    when the convictions became final. 6              MR. TANAKA:  That's true, Your Honor, and I'm 7    sure that there was, in California, a procedure for direct 8    appeal and, lacking that, also collateral review of those 9    convictions, but that's not what's at issue today.  At10    issue today is its use in the Federal sentencing11    procedure, so --12              QUESTION:  Well, why shouldn't there be a13    measure of finality here?  I mean, you know, you can go14    back and argue was it constitutional, was it accurate, but15    also there's an interest in getting things done within a16    certain time frame.17              MR. TANAKA:  I agree, Your Honor, and there --18    but there is finality with respect to those State19    convictions.  The State of California, he served those20    convictions, he served the prior terms, he served his21    imprisonment.  Those convictions are final as to the22    California judgment.23              QUESTION:  Well, are there statutes of24    limitations for habeas actions as well?25              MR. TANAKA:  Certainly there are.4 1              QUESTION:  And that being the case, this is an 2    end run around those, it seems to me. 3              MR. TANAKA:  No, I don't believe so, Justice 4    O'Connor.  The statute of limitation goes to the 5    underlying conviction, and certainly he had his chance to 6    challenge those, and that time has long since passed, and 7    we're not challenging that judgment, that conviction, but 8    when that conviction is used, again, to increase his 9    Federal sentence, then necessarily the Federal court must10    look at its reliability, otherwise it's a violation of due11 process.12              QUESTION:  Mr. Tanaka, even if you're right that13    there's no bar from challenging the Federal, the abuse in14    the Federal proceeding, shouldn't the Federal court at15    least take into account, in determining whether 225516    really is warranted, that these matters could have been17    raised earlier in the State proceedings on direct appeal18    or on collateral attack?19              MR. TANAKA:  No, I don't believe so, Your Honor.20    Again, the Federal interest is totally different than the21    State interest.  The State has no --22              QUESTION:  Why shouldn't the Federal interest23    include did this person have a reason for not bringing24    this up earlier?  I mean, one can imagine cases where you25    might try to knock out for Federal sentencing purposes an5 1    earlier State conviction and say, there was a procedural 2    impediment, or there was a reason I didn't know about this 3    until much later, like Brady material that wasn't turned 4    over?  Shouldn't there be at least that requirement, that 5    for the 2255 purpose you would have to show a good reason 6    for not raising it earlier in the State courts? 7              MR. TANAKA:  I agree that that would explain, 8    and there certainly would be cases where that would 9    explain why it wasn't raised, and that perhaps presents a10    more compelling case, but I don't think it's a11    prerequisite, and the reason for that is --12              QUESTION:  But you're -- but I wanted just to be13    clear on one thing.  You're not saying in this case that14    there was any special reason why these matters could not15    have been raised earlier?16              MR. TANAKA:  That's correct, I'm not making any17    claim that he was prevented by something external to18    himself that prevented him from raising this in State19    court, but I don't think the argument depends on that.20 Again --21              QUESTION:  You said a few times that the -- this22    is just a Federal matter, it's final as far as the law of23    the State is concerned.  Does the State of California have24    an interest in the integrity that's accorded to its25    judgments in this proceeding?6 1              MR. TANAKA:  The State of California has an 2    interest in the integrity of its judgments.  Where -- and 3    I guess the State of California has some perhaps minimal 4    interest in whether its judgment is used conclusively as a 5    Federal sentencing predicate. 6              QUESTION:  Well, I think it would have a very 7    strong interest.  It has its own three-strikes rule, as I 8    understand, and is this man a resident of the State of 9    California?  I assume he is.  It seems to me it has a very10    strong interest in having its judgments of criminal11    convictions respected.12              MR. TANAKA:  Well, we --13              QUESTION:  And to say that, oh, this is just a14    Federal matter, it's final so far as the law of the State15    is concerned, I'm not sure is a complete answer.16              MR. TANAKA:  Well, it is respected in the sense17    that it has a presumptive validity, and certainly this18    Court's case in Custis established that fact, and no one's19    suggesting that we go behind that validity once it's20    presented, but there's -- I don't know that it has an21    interest in a conclusive-type validity, especially where22    it's being used as a Federal sentencing predicate.  Now --23              QUESTION:  Well, supposing that there's a24    thought, you win on your ability to challenge, and it's25    thought there's necessary to be a evidentiary hearing.1    What incentive does the State have at that point to come2    in and try to show that the conviction was properly3 obtained? 45 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. TANAKA:  I don't know that the State wouldnecessarily be a party.  I don't believe they have verymuch incentive --          QUESTION:  Then it's a very strange proceeding.You're challenging the judgment of a State, and yet theState isn't a party?          MR. TANAKA:  But it's the Federal Governmentthat's seeking to use that judgment as a Federalsentencing predicate to increase the Federal sentence inFederal court.          QUESTION:  And if you prevail and you go aheadand have the judgment declared invalid, I -- what wouldhappen if the State in a subsequent proceeding tried touse those convictions for its own three-strikes rule?          MR. TANAKA:  I would assume that the State couldvalidly use those convictions in its own three-strikerule, because the Federal sentence, the Federal procedurewould just invalidate the State conviction, or the use ofthe State conviction, not the State conviction itself, asa means to lengthen the Federal sentence.  The --          QUESTION:  Well, if the State uses theconviction, it's -- the conviction is just as unreliable81 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425when the State uses it as when the Feds use it, and I takeit the reason that you concede that the State could use itis that there was an understanding, or we have to assumethat there was an understanding on the part of theprisoner that this kind of collateral use and enhancementof later sentences might be a consequence of thatconviction, and yet he did nothing about it.          Is that essentially your theory?  In otherwords, he knew what the risks were, and he did not takeany steps to alleviate those risks by bringing a Statecollateral attack or by going on with his appeal orwhatnot.  Is that essentially your theory?          MR. TANAKA:  Certainly that's part of it, butthe -- now the --          QUESTION:  Why doesn't -- I'm sorry.  Go ahead.You -- That was part of it.          MR. TANAKA:  Yes, I agree --          QUESTION:  What's the other part?          MR. TANAKA:  Well, the other part would be thatthe State would obviously not be bound by anything thathappened in the Federal proceeding.          QUESTION:  Well, no, but let's forget Federalproceedings for a moment.  If we just have a Stateproceeding and the State is going to use that supposedlyunreliable conviction as a basis for enhancement following91    a subsequent conviction, nothing unfair about that, I take2    it, on your view, because the prisoner knew that such use3    could be made of it, and the prisoner let the time for4    attacking the conviction pass.  That's essentially your5 theory? 67 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. TANAKA:  That could well be.  There couldwell be due process problems associated with itssubsequent use in the State, but it might be that thoseproblems are --          QUESTION:  Well, what are they?  I mean, I -- ifit's not unfair for the State to use it, despite theassumption of its unreliability, what would a -- whatother due process problem might arise at the State level?          MR. TANAKA:  That would be the problem.          QUESTION:  That would be the problem, and --          MR. TANAKA:  But it might be that the problemdoesn't rise to a large enough level that the Statenecessarily violates due process by refusing to litigatethat anew.  In other words --          QUESTION:  Well, the State -- but I -- thetheory of my question was, he in effect was on notice thatthere might be a subsequent use of the conviction forenhancement purposes.  He had an opportunity to litigate.He didn't litigate.  Therefore, it is not unfair, in thedue process sense, for the State to use it, and I thought10 1    that was probably what underlay your suggestion that the 2    State could use it for enhancement purposes. 3              MR. TANAKA:  I agree with that. 4              QUESTION:  All right.  Now, why can't the Fed -- 5    why can't a Federal court use it for enhancement purposes? 6    He was on notice that there might be a later enhancement. 7    He did nothing about it.  The same reasoning applies at 8    the Federal level, doesn't it? 9              MR. TANAKA:  The -- there is a -- there is no10    problem with notice, and -- but that again suggests the11    concept of waiver, or maybe even sandbagging.12              QUESTION:  Well, not waiver.  Not -- we're not13    talking about waiver.  We talking about, I think, the fact14    that he had an opportunity to litigate it.  As you so --15    as you conceded a moment ago, there are statutes of16    limitations that govern these things in most instances.17    You've got to litigate within that time or it's too late,18    so he let, in effect, his opportunity to litigate pass.19              Now, if that -- and therefore it's not unfair,20    in a due process sense, to use it against him even if he21    does claim later that it was unreliable.22              Now, if that is a sound argument with respect to23    its use for enhancement purposes at the State level, why24    isn't it an equally good argument with respect to its use25    in this case at the Federal level?111 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. TANAKA:  I'm sorry, perhaps I didn'tunderstand the predicate of your question when I firstanswered.  I believe I answered that there is a dueprocess problem with using the unreliable convictionwhether you're using it to enhance a State sentence or aFederal sentence.          QUESTION:  Then what's left of the statute oflimitations that you concede can be applied?          I thought you conceded that the statute oflimitations on this kind of litigation could, consistentlywith due process, be applied at the State level.  If youdid not concede that, then I will withdraw my question.          MR. TANAKA:  Okay.  It could be applied at theState level to the initial State conviction.  Okay, again,if, analogous to this case, that conviction was used in aState proceeding to enhance a subsequent State sentence,then there might -- there would be a due process right toexamine that conviction anew --          QUESTION:  Let me ask you --          MR. TANAKA:  -- with respect to the enhancementprovision --          QUESTION:  With respect to, at the State level,let me ask you one more question.  Let's assume that theState had a statute and the statute were made -- wasexplained to the defendant at the time of his State12 1    sentence, and the statute read as follows: 2              This conviction can be used to enhance sentences 3    following later convictions.  If you wish to challenge the 4    validity of this conviction, you must challenge it within 5    1 year, or it's too late. 6              Let's assume that the State had such a statute, 7    that was explained to the prisoner at the time of the 8    first sentence, and he didn't litigate within 1 year.  The 9    State then wants to use it to enhance following a10    subsequent conviction.  Is there a due process problem in11    the State's use of it without an opportunity to challenge?12              MR. TANAKA:  There well could be, if there's13    some unreliability of the conviction.14              QUESTION:  So there can -- I take it your15    theory, then, is that no amount of warning in the world16    will ever be enough to allow the State or the Federal17    Government to treat the first conviction with finality?18              MR. TANAKA:  No.  There -- as long as there's a19    procedure, a substantive due process procedure for20    litigating that, it could be that, consistent with due21    process, there could be some limitations and in that case22    that might well be one of them.23              QUESTION:  Well, what about my limitation?24    You've got a year to challenge this if you want to25    challenge it, and if you don't challenge it within the13 1    year it's too late and it can used for enhancement 2    purposes, and the year expires, it's going to be used for 3    enhancement purposes, he wants to challenge it, and the 4    State says no, it's too late, the year is over.  Is that 5    consistent with due process? 6              MR. TANAKA:  I think it well could be. 7              QUESTION:  Okay. 8              QUESTION:  I assume that your theory would apply 9    not just to enhancement questions but also to any other10    disabilities attaching to the prior criminal conviction.11    Specifically, I believe that California, like many States,12    disqualifies convicted felons from voting.  Now, could13    your client have presented himself at the registration14    booth for voting and, when told that he could not vote15    because he was a felon, could he say, oh, but that16    conviction was invalid and I want an opportunity to17    challenge it?18              MR. TANAKA:  No, I don't believe so, Your Honor.19              QUESTION:  Why not?20              MR. TANAKA:  The difference is this.  In this21    case -- due process is obviously a flexible concept, and22    what's at stake here is 1) an automatic increase in the23    sentence and 2) a dramatic increase in the sentence.  The24    sentence went from presumptively 7 years to more than25    double, to a min -- to a minimum of 15 years.14 1              QUESTION:  The right to vote is worth something, 2    too.  We protect that with many due process and other 3    restrictions upon what the State can do.  Why shouldn't he 4    have the right to -- you're saying you cannot use the 5    conviction for anything except sending him to jail upon 6    the first conviction.  If you say you can't use it to 7    increase his sentence on the later conviction, I don't see 8    why you also don't have to say you can't use it to disable 9    him from voting.10              MR. TANAKA:  Oh, I think there's certainly a11    greater liberty interest with respect to imprisonment,12 but --13              QUESTION:  Mr. Tanaka, in your last series of14    answers you seem to be departing from what I thought was15    the clear line you took in your brief.16              That is, for all State purposes you are17    accepting that this sentence is good, and you are18    distinguishing the Federal enhancement from any other --19    from any State law consequence, but now in your answer to20    the questions that Justice Souter and Justice Scalia just21    asked you seem to be saying it's not just the Federal22    enhancement purpose that you're questioning where this can23    be brought up but also in the State proceeding as well.24              MR. TANAKA:  No, I don't believe so.  Obviously25    the only fact at issue here is the -- is its use in the15 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8    conviction. 9              QUESTION:  But we're trying to understand why10    that should be.  I -- my understanding of your submission11    is that there is a Federal constitutional right under the12    Due Process Clause not to have this conviction used in13    Federal court.  Why is -- why don't you make the same14    argument if it's a State three-strike conviction case?15              MR. TANAKA:  One might --16              QUESTION:  It's a Federal due process right not17    to have what you call an unreliable or a false conviction18    used -- again, it's the same analysis, same Constitution.19    What's the difference?20              MR. TANAKA:  And one might, if one were arguing21    that case, argue that, and I think there -- but there are22    certainly different considerations there, because if the23    Federal court is reviewing the State court's use of its24    own recidivist provisions, then there are more comity and25    finality questions that aren't at issue here.16Federal proceeding, and --          QUESTION:  You kept saying in your brief thatyou're not touching the State consequences of this, thatthose are a given, and you accept those, but your answershere depart from that view, so which is it?          MR. TANAKA:  I'll stick with what I said in thebrief.  We're not challenging any State use of this 1              That's what distinguishes this case, is that all 2    we're doing in this case is looking at the Federal court 3    examining a Federal sentence under 2255, which explicitly 4    provides for that review.  There's no intrusion in the 5    State court judgment, and that's the position I took in 6    the brief and that's the position I take here, that the 7    State judgment, we're leaving that alone. 8              Nothing that the Federal district court's going 9    to do in granting that 2255 motion and finding this10    conviction too unreliable to automatically sentence this11    man to an additional 8 years in prison is going to affect12    that State court judgment.13              QUESTION:  What I'm trying to have -- my problem14    is -- I agree with you basically.  You realize that these15    things should be challengeable in a sentencing proceeding.16    I wrote an opinion to that effect in Palleo, and it was17    reversed by this Court, so now what do I do?18              (Laughter.)19              MR. TANAKA:  Well, you use your --20              QUESTION:  I mean, my problem is, quite21    honestly, that I don't see any way, if you're not -- I22    think these things -- I think a prior should be23    challengeable in the sentencing hearing, all right?24    That's clear, simple, done all the time, no problem, fair.25 All right.171              No, but there's an opinion that says no.  Now,2    given that opinion, I think I'm stuck, unless I were to3    accept this argument that the -- I see you make an4    argument about the constitutionality, which I think is5    interesting, but I'm not sure about that one.  Is there6    anything else?  If I don't accept that constitutional7    point, if I would have been with the dissenters in8    Custis -- but I believe in stare decisis.  I'm stuck,9 right?10111213141516171819202122232425          MR. TANAKA:  Well, if you don't accept thatconstitutional point that the use of an unreliable priorconviction that doesn't implicate the person -- doesn'timplicate the person's guilt can be automatically used todramatically increase the sentence conclusively, thenwe're both stuck, unless you can use your powers ofpersuasion to change the Court's decision, but --(Laughter.)          MR. TANAKA:  That's certainly the genesis ofthis argument.          QUESTION:  May I just ask one question?  Are youreally making a constitutional argument, or are youarguing for a construction of section 2255, or is it both?          MR. TANAKA:  It's both.  Certainly the casedepends on a construction of 2255 to remedy what is anobvious constitutional violation.  By its plain language,18 1    2255 allows someone sentenced in Federal court to 2    challenge that sentence as being unconstitutional, and it 3    gives the sentencing court the power to correct that 4    sentence as, in fact, a constitutional -- 5              QUESTION:  But does your position have to rest 6    on the premise that the sentence would be unconstitutional 7    if the State conviction were -- that the Federal sentence 8    would be unconstitutional if the State sentence were9 invalid?10              MR. TANAKA:  Not just invalid --11              QUESTION:  You see, it seems to me it would be12    theoretically possible to say, for a legislature to say,13    we wanted to enhance a sentence if there's a State14    conviction out there, and we don't care whether it's15    obtained fairly or not.  The fellow was at least indicted16    and he went to jail for a while, and that's enough for us.17    Is it your view that they could not do that?18              MR. TANAKA:  Yes.  Where it can be shown that19    that conviction doesn't reliably indicate the man's guilt20    I believe -- well, it's my position that that violates the21    Constitution and the Due Process Clause.22              QUESTION:  Mr. Tanaka, I have a question23    concerning a point you made in your brief.  You said that24    the 2255 forum is accustomed to dealing with questions of25    this nature, and you distinguished that from the19 1    sentencing forum in Custis, but it seems to me it's the 2    same forum.  It's the same district judge, just a 3    different proceeding but in the same court, so I did not 4    follow what you were getting at when you were saying that 5    the 2255 forum is accustomed to dealing with these kinds 6    of questions but the sentencing judge is not, when it's 7    one and the same judge. 8              MR. TANAKA:  Well, the point was that normally a 9    sentencing procedure is rather quick and summary, whereas10    a proceeding on a 2255 case, there might be an evidentiary11    hearing and the scheduling and so forth would be12    different, and also there are rules that govern 2255 cases13    that don't govern sentencing, and so it's more14    appropriately placed there.15              But the major point is that 2255 expressly16    provides for this type of procedure, whereas you know,17    obviously there's nothing in the sentencing statute that18    likely, likewise provides for it.19              QUESTION:  Mr. Tanaka, you say that what you20    want to challenge is State court convictions that,21    judgments that do not reliably indicate guilt.  Well, I22    take it you would allow a challenge on the basis that a23    Miranda warning wasn't given, and that there was some --24    it was not harmless error, and yet a Miranda warning25    really has nothing to do with guilt.201 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          I mean, there are certainly differentconstitutional claims which can be vindicated in theproper forum but don't really bear on guilt or innocence,so are you limiting your challenges to those which clearlyaffect guilt, or to any constitutional claim that would besustained if timely brought?          MR. TANAKA:  No, Mr. Chief Justice.  I believethat the due process analysis leads to the conclusion thatyou can only challenge convictions that don't reliablyindicate guilt.  There's not an identity between a dueprocess violation and a constitutional violation.          If the Court has no further questions, I'd liketo reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.          QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Tanaka.          Mr. Dreeben, we'll hear from you.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MR. DREEBEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          In Custis v. United States this Court made clearthat at a Federal sentencing proceeding a defendant whofaces recidivist sentencing may not bring a constitutionalchallenge to the validity of the underlying enhancementconviction.  We submit that the same principle applieswhere it --21          QUESTION:  With certain exceptions.          MR. DREEBEN:  With the exception of a convictionthat was entered in violation of Gideon v. Wainwright,that's correct, Justice Stevens.          QUESTION:  You think that's the only such          MR. DREEBEN:  I think that that is the line thatthe Court drew in Custis, Justice O'Connor.  It restedthat on a variety of considerations.  The first was thatthe Court's jurisprudence had recognized Gideon violationsas a unique constitutional defect that rose even to thelevel of a jurisdictional defect.123456    exception?7 8 9101112131415161718    crime?19              MR. DREEBEN:  Well, there are two distinctions20    between that kind of a situation and the Gideon situation.21    The one that I think is most applicable to the majority of22    cases that are going to come up in this context is that a23    Brady violation is a very fact-intensive inquiry.  It          The second two reasons I think are the ones thatmost clearly explain the rule that we're espousing here.          QUESTION:  Well, how about a so-called Bradyviolation, where the facts aren't known until maybeimmediately before the sentencing proceeding in the new24    can't be resolved, as the Court noted in Custis with25    respect to a Gideon claim, simply by looking at the22 1    judgment or the judgment role and determining whether the 2    defendant had counsel. 3              It requires instead a fairly intricate analysis 4    of whether the Government suppressed and withheld 5    information that the defendant couldn't with due diligence 6    have gained access to, and whether there was resulting 7    prejudice to the defendant as a consequence, and the 8    administrative costs of adjudicating that are far more 9    substantial and very intrusive into the sentencing process10    as compared to Gideon.11              QUESTION:  Well, what about a DNA claim in a12    death case coming up later?13              MR. DREEBEN:  Well, the second -- I think,14    Justice O'Connor, that is the second distinction in your15    hypothetical, that the hypothetical posits that this was16    information about a constitutional claim that could not17    with due diligence have been obtained, I'm assuming within18    any time for bringing an appropriate appeal or collateral19    challenge.202122232425          The capital context is unique in that area, Ithink, and I'm going to set it aside, because questions ofactual innocence in the capital context would be dealtwith under the Eighth Amendment and would implicateconstitutional principles that aren't broadly applicable.          But as to the generality of sentencing cases, I                            23 1    think that the basic rule is that there is a system in 2    place to challenge convictions that balances two 3    fundamental interests.  One is in finality, the other is 4    in fundamental fairness. 5              Those two interests have always been 6    accommodated not by giving one total sway over the other, 7    but by saying that in certain contexts there are claims 8    that are available and they may be brought, and if they 9    are brought in a manner that's compatible with the10    procedural limitations such as statute of limitations,11    procedural default, exhaustion, Teague v. Lane, if they12    surmount those hurdles, then the interests of vindicating13    the Constitution take precedence over the interests of14 finality.15              But if those procedural hurdles have not been16    met, and the defendant did not bring his claim in17    accordance with the procedures that are set out, then18    society is entitled to take that conviction as19    conclusively final, and any further remedy that would be20    available would have to come from the executive branch --21              QUESTION:  Do you make that argument even if22    it's a Gideon violation?  In other words, say that it's a23    final sentencing, the defendant had either no counsel or24    inadequate counsel, and didn't learn that there was a25    Gideon violation before and he'd already served his241 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9sentence for the crime where there was the Gideonviolation, could he raise that or not?          MR. DREEBEN:  Under this Court's decision inCustis he may at the Federal sentencing raise it, and I --          QUESTION:  No, no, not at the Federalsentencing.  Say he gets sentence, and then by mistake thesentencing judge relies on a prior State conviction whichwas invalid because there was a Gideon violation, butnobody called that to the attention of the court.          MR. DREEBEN:  That would be a proceduraldefault, Justice Stevens, and I think it would bar thedefendant from coming back even if there were otherwise aright to come back under applicable procedure.          QUESTION:  Would that be true even if thesentence had not been served where there was a Gideon10111213141516    violation?171819202122232425          MR. DREEBEN:  The sentence of the -- theunderlying conviction --          QUESTION:  This would always have to have beenserved, wouldn't it?          MR. DREEBEN:  Well, if the underlying convictionsentence had not been served, then the defendant's remedywould be to go back into the jurisdiction that entered itand see if he can comply with --          QUESTION:  He couldn't then go in on a 2255 and                            251    call that to the court's attention and get relief, in your2    view?3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think so, Justice Stevens,because he has the right to do that under Custis at theFederal sentencing proceeding itself, and the failure tobring that claim at a timely point in the proceeding, whenit is available, would constitute a default, and then hewould be left with the argument --          MR. DREEBEN:  Well, inadequate assistance ofcounsel isn't even permitted to be brought under thisCourt's decision in Custis with respect to the underlying          QUESTION:  Even if he had -- even if it wasinadequate assistance of counsel?1011121314    conviction.15              With respect to the conviction that -- the16    Federal conviction that was entered, ineffective17    assistance of counsel claims typically are not brought in18    the original sentencing court that imposed the conviction19    because the defendant typically has the same counsel and20    because the facts haven't been developed, and therefore21    there is no procedural default typically in bringing an22    ineffective assistance claim directed to the Federal23    conviction in a section 2255 proceeding.24              But as to the underlying enhancement conviction,25    which is what we are talking about here, petitioner is26 1    saying that I suffered from ineffective assistance of 2    counsel with respect to a 1978 robbery conviction that is 3    now being used to enhance my 1992 Federal sentence, and I 4    should have the right, on 2255, to litigate that 16-year- 5    old, or 19-year-old claim, and we submit that the Court's 6    decision in Custis says you can't do that at the Federal 7    sentencing and you therefore cannot do that on the 2255 8    proceeding. 9              QUESTION:  Yes, but it's the therefore part that10    I guess is giving us all the trouble, and the reason it's11    giving me trouble is, number 1 -- of course, I was a12    dissenter in Custis, so maybe I'm looking for trouble --13              (Laughter.)14              QUESTION:  -- but the Court in -- the majority15    in Custis left the question open whether there could be16    another means of challenge other than the challenge at the17    Federal sentencing proceeding as such.18              And number 2, textually, what the petitioner19    wants to do can be fitted within the terms of 2255, and20    the issue I guess boils -- so I think it's -- I don't21    think Custis is controlling, and what the issue boils down22    to for me is this.  I will -- I accept your argument that23    the balance struck on the issues of finality and fairness24    require a point at which so far as the service of the25    original sentence, the '78 sentence in your example is                                  27 1    concerned, the litigation has got to stop. 2              But it seems to me that that balance is entirely 3    different when you get into the subsequent proceeding in 4    which, for example,  what is at stake in the finality 5    fairness argument is not, say, a sentence of 5 years or 10 6    years as under the first conviction, whatever it was, but 7    a sentence potentially of life, and when suddenly the 8    stakes change that radically in the Federal proceeding, 9    then the old finality-fairness balance simply doesn't10    apply any more because the terms have changed, and when11    the terms change radically, as they have here, why isn't12    it possible to reassess that balance and say, okay, now,13    even though you couldn't litigate for State purposes, you14    can litigate for Federal purposes?15              MR. DREEBEN:  The fundamental problem with that,16    Justice Souter, is that those same interests are fully at17    stake in the Custis situation itself.  When this Court18 said --19              QUESTION:  Yeah, but Custis -- that may be true,20    but number 1, Custis depended in part on a statutory21    construction reason.  They looked at the text of the22    sentencing enhancement statute and, number 2, Custis left23    this question open.  The Court said --24              MR. DREEBEN:  If I could address that --25              QUESTION:  -- we're not telling you what we'll28 1    do in this subsequent situation, but they left it open. 2              MR. DREEBEN:  That actually is not the question 3    that the Court left open in Custis, Justice Souter.  What 4    the Court left open in Custis is the following scenario. 5              Take Custis himself.  After Custis is sentenced, 6    the question that was raised in Custis was, could he then 7    go back to the State court that had entered the 8    enhancement conviction and obtain a judgment that that 9    conviction was constitutionally invalid, and then come10    back to the Federal sentencing court and apply for11    reopening of his Federal sentence, and the crucial12    difference between that scenario and the scenario that's13    presented here is that the litigation over the validity of14    that sentence would take place in the State court.15              QUESTION:  Oh, you're entirely right, but16    didn't -- I don't have it in front of me.  Didn't the17    Court also refer to the possibility of litigation on18    Federal habeas?19              MR. DREEBEN:  Litigation on Federal habeas20    corpus that attacked the State sentence.21              QUESTION:  Right, but the only basis on which22    there could be Federal habeas litigation would be Federal23    habeas litigation in connection with the later Federal24    sentence, even though the subject of that litigation might25    be, or would be the validity of the earlier State291 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425sentence --          MR. DREEBEN:  No, I don't think that that is --          QUESTION:  -- and therefore it seems to me thiswas left open.          MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I don't think that that'swhat the opinion says, because it talks about Custishaving been in custody still on his State sentences.          QUESTION:  The last sentence of the opinionsays, may attack his State sentence in Maryland or througha Federal habeas review.          MR. DREEBEN:  Correct.          QUESTION:  Okay.          MR. DREEBEN:  And Federal habeas review isFederal review under 2254 --          QUESTION:  Four, right.          MR. DREEBEN:  -- that attacks the Statesentence.  This is a case under section 2255, attackingthe constitutionality of the Federal sentence.          QUESTION:  Well, did --          MR. DREEBEN:  The necessary --          QUESTION:  Didn't we confine it to 2254?          MR. DREEBEN:  The language says, I thinkaccurately, just what Justice Stevens read, and I wouldinterpret Federal habeas review in that context to meanFederal review under 2254 attacking the prior State301 sentence. 2              QUESTION:  It certainly does include that.  I 3    don't know that it was limited. 4              MR. DREEBEN:  If it were not limited to that, it 5    would be odd to say that the defendant could then come and 6    apply for reopening of this Federal sentence, because 7    that's exactly what section 2255 is all about.  It is 8    saying there's something wrong with the Federal sentence 9    that was imposed, and we know from Custis --10              QUESTION:  But the reason may be the textual11    reason in Custis, going to the text of the enhancement12    statute itself.  It may be that we wanted sentencing,13    Congress wanted sentencing to be clean and simple and14    leaving any later attack to be worked out afterwards.  In15    other words, get him shut away and then let him litigate16    as long as he wants to.17              MR. DREEBEN:  But the theory behind section 225518    litigation in this case is that there was a constitutional19    violation at the Federal sentencing.20              QUESTION:  Right.21              MR. DREEBEN:  Because sentence was imposed based22    on a conviction that, although facially valid and never23    set aside by any court, might be unreliable if one took24    the time to unpack the claim that petitioner is now making25    and get the records and litigate it and determine whether31 1    it's valid or not, and the Custis court held there is no 2    constitutional violation in imposing sentence without 3    adjudicating that claim and, further, by leaving open the 4    question that we've been discussing, the Court made clear 5    that it's not inherently indispensable that there be any 6    place left to litigate a claim that is based on a 7    conviction that is 16 years old in this case, 19 years 8    old, that the two convictions the petitioner is raising. 9              QUESTION:  Let's assume, though -- and I realize10    you don't concede this, of course, but assume that Custis11    did leave open the possibility of this litigation.  Would12    you go back to the, we'll say the balance argument?13              My point is that the balance between finality14    and fairness changes radically when you go from the15    limited jeopardy of imprisonment under the State16    conviction to the potentiality here of life imprisonment,17    and if the balance is that radically affected, why18    shouldn't there be, for due process purposes, an19    opportunity to litigate at the Federal level, even though20    the State proceeding is past and final for State purposes?21              MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Souter, I think the22    fundamental answer to that question goes back to the23    interests in finality that have been struck in this24    Court's post-conviction jurisprudence generally.  There is25    a recognition that there are fundamental interests in32 1    having an unconstitutional conviction overturned, but they 2    are counterbalanced by other interests such as the 3    fairness and reliability of the adjudication of that4 claim. 5              Now, here we are talking about a claim by 6    petitioner that when he entered his guilty plea 16 years 7    ago and 19 years ago he wasn't adequately informed about 8    one of the elements of the offense and therefore, he says, 9    he didn't enter a knowing and voluntary guilty plea.10              Now, that's the kind of claim that can routinely11    be made on direct appeal or upon an immediate12    post-conviction attack, and it's made with the State that13    entered the judgment as a party, and the State can come14    back and say we have access to these records, they're very15    easy to determine, you can see that the judge went over16    him, the various elements, or his lawyer counseled him17    about the various elements of the crime and the court can18    reach a reliable adjudication promptly on whether that19    conviction is valid.20              A defendant who doesn't challenge his guilty21    plea in that fashion at the time that it's available to do22    so is essentially saying, I struck a deal with the23    Government, the deal allows me perhaps to reduce my time24    of imprisonment compared to what it would have been if I25    had gone to trial and lost, as I probably would have been,33 1    would have lost, therefore I'm going to enter a guilty 2    plea and establish finality, and I'm not going to take an 3    appeal, because if I appeal and win at this juncture I'll 4    probably be back right in the position that I started in, 5    namely, facing a trial and a potentially longer sentence. 6              QUESTION:  And it's perfectly fair for due 7    process purposes or any others, on any other fairness 8    standard, to hold the prisoner to that bargain.  He knew 9    what the terms were.  The trouble is now, the terms have10    changed, and it's not only very difficult to litigate this11    later, but it's also very difficult to stay in prison for12    life, and when the terms have changed, the calculus that13    says, or that said in the first instance it's fair to hold14    you to your bargain, doesn't apply any more, because the15    terms have changed.16              MR. DREEBEN:  But the risk that he faced,17    Justice Souter, was one that he either knew actually or18    should have known at the time that he entered that plea.19              QUESTION:  All right, let's -- I understand that20    argument, too, and I just don't see how it is sound.  The21    truth is, in the real world, prisoners, when they enter22    these guilty pleas, are not thinking of the possibility of23    life in prison 25 years later for a crime that hasn't been24    committed yet.  I mean, I just don't think that that is25    realistic, to say that he knew or should have known that341 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425this could happen.          MR. DREEBEN:  Well, apart from the fact that theCourt in Nichols v. United States said that it's the kindof thing that prisoners do know when they're sentenced,that if they're seen back again they're going to face moreserious consequences from it --          QUESTION:  They -- more serious consequences,yes, but this is a serious consequence of a differentorder of magnitude.          MR. DREEBEN:  I think that recidivism statutesare among the most common kind of statutes in the criminaljustice world.  All 50 States have them.  The FederalGovernment has one.  There's a great deal --          QUESTION:  Well, recidivism, yes, but we're --at least at this point in history we're living at a timewhen a great many prior convictions are being consideredunder three-strikes laws --          MR. DREEBEN:  Correct.          QUESTION:  -- let alone a Federal three-strikeslaw which couldn't possibly have been in the contemplationof the people who entered the guilty pleas or suffered theconvictions 25 years ago.          MR. DREEBEN:  No, but there has long been atradition in this country of recidivism laws that fairlysignificantly escalated the potential sentence from some35 1    of the cases that I've seen from 5 years to 35 years, and 2    these are convictions based on statutes that were enacted 3    long before the current wave of three-strikes statutes. 4              QUESTION:  Yes, but I thought what we're 5    concerned about are people who in 1972 -- something that 6    appeared fairly minor to the individual who is convicted, 7    he's told by somebody, go in and plead guilty, it's not 8    going to be a big deal. 9              He has no idea what he's doing.  He doesn't get10    correct advice, and he goes in and he pleads guilty, and11    he was totally confused at the State proceeding.  Now,12    that person is going to be in jail for life because of a13    later crime, although if you look at what happened it14    would be obviously unconstitutional, his earlier15    conviction.16              Now, that's the case we're worried about, and we17    get rid of the other cases through strict burden of proof18    rules, so all we have in front of us are those cases, and19    the question is, why shouldn't a person like that be able20    to demonstrate the obvious fact that that earlier21    conviction was obviously unconstitutional, and you give me22    the answer that Custis says no, but then we could just23    reply, well, that was because of the language of the24    statute.25              MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think --36 1              QUESTION:  Here, although we're running around 2    Robin's barn or something in some weird procedural way, 3    better let him do it later than not at all. 4              MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think the constitutional 5    holding in Custis had anything to do with the language of 6    the statutes.  The Court concluded that the statute in 7    Custis, which is the same statute at issue here, didn't 8    authorize these kinds of challenges at the sentencing 9    proceeding and it then went on to hold that neither did10    the Constitution.  Now, petitioner's --11              QUESTION:  At the sentencing proceeding.12              MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, but there's nothing --13              QUESTION:  But you could say, I guess -- and I14    don't know how much of a stretch this would be.  You could15    say, but this person who is obviously convicted16    unconstitutionally, and I'll underscore obviously, because17    I can get rid of the nonobvious cases through strict18    burdens of proof, all right, so he was obviously convicted19    unconstitutionally, that that person should have some20    forum somewhere in which to point that out before he's in21    prison for life.22              MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Breyer, I accept that23    you've attempted to carve out the category of obvious24    unconstitutionality from what we're dealing with in this25    realm, but I submit that as a matter of real-life37 1    litigation it doesn't exist.  What you in fact get in the 2    vast majority of cases are records just like this one. 3    The prisoner comes in -- 4              QUESTION:  The vast majority, fine, but we also 5    have a few cases where it was like somebody had robbed a 6    chicken coop, you know, when he was 18 years old, and now 7    12 years later this chicken coop has come back to put him 8    in prison for life, so there are also at least a few cases 9    where you think maybe he didn't get very good advice the10    first time.11              MR. DREEBEN:  Any constitutional rule that says12    you can do this but only when it's really obvious is going13    to lead to the same sorts of burdens of litigation of14    whether it falls into that category or not, and it's going15    to require the Government, when confronted with one of16    these things, to do exactly what the Court recognized in17    Custis was an extremely burdensome and usually18    unproductive exercise of running round and trying to find19    the prosecutor, the judge, the defense lawyer, the20    probation officer who were part of the original sentencing21    proceeding, which could go back decades, and attempting to22    reconstruct --23              QUESTION:  But that's the prisoner's problem.24    The Government doesn't have to do that.25              MR. DREEBEN:  No, it is the Government's38 1    problem, because the prisoner comes in with an affidavit 2    that says, I was there, and I'm going to swear out as a 3    factual matter no one ever told me that aiding and 4    abetting liability required that I join in this venture as 5    if it were something that I intended to succeed.  All I 6    thought is that if I was present and I knew about the bank 7    robbery, that was enough for the conviction. 8              That is petitioner's claim right here.  He's 9    filed an affidavit, he's sworn it out under oath, and for10    the Government to sit back and say to the sentencing11    court, well, judge, he has a strong interest in this and12    this was 20 years ago, you shouldn't believe him, is13    really more than can be expected from us.  We need to14    respond factually.15              QUESTION:  Of course, you've got a case that has16    facts that are very favorable to the Government generally,17    but some of these cases are much closer, like the Seventh18    Circuit case where the evidence was really quite19    disturbing about whether the person actually received a20    fair proceeding, but you would apply the same rule21    regardless of how strong the proof is.22              MR. DREEBEN:  That's right, Justice Stevens.23              QUESTION:  And regardless of how serious the24    violation is, unless it's a Gideon violation.25              MR. DREEBEN:  That's right, and I think that391 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9that is the line that the Court drew in Custis, and itessentially says --          QUESTION:  Well, but Custis really was a holdingon the meaning of 924(e) on the sentencing proceedings.          MR. DREEBEN:  Custis was a holding first on themeaning of 924(e) and then on what the Constitutionrequired of a sentencing judge, and it held a sentencingjudge may accept a facially valid --          QUESTION:  That's right.101112131415161718192021222324    Yes.25              MR. DREEBEN:  Correct.          MR. DREEBEN:  -- conviction that has never beenset aside, other than --          QUESTION:  And of course, one reason that'spermissible is that normally there's a second chance toprove what really happened.  That's part of the answer --          MR. DREEBEN:  Well --          MR. DREEBEN:  There are normally other chancesfor a defendant to attack his prior conviction, the directappeal from the conviction, post-conviction review in theState, and post-conviction review federally.          QUESTION:  -- given in that very case, thatthey -- there is this other open question.          QUESTION:  That was true in Custis itself,wasn't it?  He could have gone back to the State court?40 1              QUESTION:  It said he could have gone to 2    Maryland or on 2254 review -- 3              MR. DREEBEN:  Correct. 4              QUESTION:  -- of the Maryland conviction. 5              MR. DREEBEN:  That's correct, and the Court 6    didn't say that this is an indispensable prerequisite of a 7    valid Federal sentence.  What it said was, the Federal 8    sentencing court can look at the State judgment and say, 9    on its face there's no Gideon problem here, we're not10    required to entertain other constitutional challenges.11              QUESTION:  Mr. --12              MR. DREEBEN:  If some other court wants to13    entertain them, that's to be presented to that court.  The14    rendering court --15              QUESTION:  Mr. Dreeben, I don't know why we16    focus upon what the expectation of the defendant was at17    the time he pleaded guilty, as opposed to what his18    expectation was at the time he committed the later crime.19    Do you think it would be unconstitutional for a State to20    say that anyone who has a prior conviction on the record,21    all right, that has been obtained in any manner so long as22    Gideon has been complied with, anyone who has that on his23    record who commits a later crime gets a longer sentence?24              MR. DREEBEN:  No, I don't think that's25    unconstitutional.41 1              QUESTION:  He knows what the rules are when he 2    commits the later crime.  He knows he pleaded guilty of 3    the former crime.  He knows that anyone who has pleaded 4    guilty to a former crime will get a longer sentence. 5    Isn't that the expectation that we should be concerned6 about? 7              MR. DREEBEN:  That is a, an expectation that the 8    prisoner can have that the laws give him notice that 9    that's what the laws are intended to do.10              QUESTION:  But then it's your view, I take it,11    that even if the prior conviction were set aside in State12    proceedings or Federal proceedings, that that would not13    justify a reduction in the Federal sentence?14              MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Stevens --15              QUESTION:  Is that your view?16              MR. DREEBEN:  It is a view that the Government17    has taken in the lower courts.  We have lost it in the six18    circuits that have considered it.  We're currently19    rethinking what our position is on that issue.  That issue20    is a quite distinct issue from this one.21              QUESTION:  Correct.22              MR. DREEBEN:  Because in that situation the23    Federal court, instead of saying, I have a facially valid24    conviction in front of me and I have a defendant who says25    there's something wrong with it but he's never done42 1    anything about it, the Federal court in this latter class 2    of cases has a conviction that it previously relied on and 3    said, this is a reliable indication that you are a more 4    serious offender, and it turns out that a later State 5    court judgment may have set it aside on constitutional 6    grounds that fundamentally call into question reliability. 7    That's a distinguishable scenario from this situation, and 8    the outcome there does not control the outcome here. 9              QUESTION:  I agree, but apparently Justice10    Scalia would not, is my point.11              MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I think Justice Scalia is12    referring to a statute that was premised on the following13    theory.  If you know you have a conviction on the books14    and you are not deterred from the -- by committing another15    crime, notwithstanding the fact that you know that your16    sentenced will be enhanced, the question is, is that17    constitutional apart from Gideon violations.18              My answer to that is yes, but I don't actually19    think that's the sentencing theory that was adopted in20    section 924(e).21              QUESTION:  This is a statutory question, though,22    and not a constitutional question, whether the statute was23    of the sort that I --24              MR. DREEBEN:  Correct.  Correct.25              QUESTION:  That I described or not.43123456 not. 7          MR. DREEBEN:  Correct, and if it were of thesort, I would submit that it's constitutional, but thequestion is, is it of that sort.                QUESTION:  Right.                MR. DREEBEN:  And I think the answer to it is 9    a fortiori true that what the defendant is complaining10    about here is likewise constitutional?11              MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think it's a fortiori,12    Justice Scalia, although I do think our position is13    a fortiori from Custis, and the reason I think they're14    distinct is, the theory of the sentencing statute that you15    have posited is deterrence, and the theory of the16    recidivist sentencing statute, that is 924(e), and of most17    recidivist statutes, is reliability of a prior conviction18    which shows that this defendant is a more serious offender19    because he has committed crimes in the past which20    aggravate the current offense, and therefore this21    individual warrants greater incapacitation as a matter of22    protecting the public because he's clearly not learning23    but is going on to commit offense after offense after24    offense.25              QUESTION:  I recognize what we said in Custis,44               QUESTION:  But if you say that it would be8    constitutional if it were of that sort, then isn't it 1    but is there any other structural or fundamental area, 2    other than Gideon, that we should recognize -- the judge 3    was bribed -- 4              MR. DREEBEN:  Well, the United States took the 5    position in Custis that Gideon error belonged to a very 6    small class of fundamental errors, and the other error 7    that we identified in Custis was the error that you 8    identified, Justice Kennedy, of an error that really 9    deprives the sentencing court of the character of a court10    that could render a fair judgment.11              QUESTION:  But that's not subsumed in the12    category of facially valid, is it?13              MR. DREEBEN:  No, because this Court in Custis14    didn't agree with the position of the Government and held15    that Gideon violations are unique.16              They are unique not only because they have such17    a pervasive impact on the fairness of the proceeding, but18    they are also unique in that they are fairly easy to19    discern from the judgment role or from a motion20    accompanying the judgment role, and the Court relied on21    the consideration of administrative ease as well as of the22    character of the error in defining what you could do when23    confronted with a recidivist enhancement and a prior24    conviction that is challenged on constitutional grounds,25    and so long as the Court adheres to that line, I think45 1    that the interest of the State in ensuring that its 2    judgment carries usual force and effect are just as strong 3    at the Federal sentencing proceeding as they are on 2255.4 The State -- 5              QUESTION:  But you're -- but you are leaving 6    open the possibility, say somebody in this position, 7    there's a quorum nobis proceeding in the State, gets it 8    knocked out under State law, you're saying that that's the 9    situation the Government is rethinking whether then, if10    you succeed, even way out of time, to get it knocked out11    at the State court, could you then come back to Federal12    court on a 2255 and say, now the State has knocked this13 out?14              MR. DREEBEN:  That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.15    That's the question that we're revisiting after our16    litigation track record in the lower courts, and it's not17    presented in this case because petitioner did not do that,18    and almost undoubtedly would be out of time to do that19    today, and quorum nobis is not apparently available in20    California, and our fundamental submission is, that was21    the chance that he had.22              Whatever procedures the rendering court provides23    and post-conviction review provides of the underlying24    conviction are sufficient for constitutional purposes25    absent a Gideon error when the Federal sentencing court is46imposing a recidivist sentence.          If the Court has no further questions --          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Dreeben.          MR. DREEBEN:  Thank you.          QUESTION:  Mr. Tanaka, you have 7 minutes          REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF G. MICHAEL TANAKA               ON  BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. TANAKA:  I'd first like to address thequestion of what Custis left open.  We've been talkingabout the sentence at issue, and it ends, if -- werecognize -- and this is at page 497 of the Custisdecision.  We recognize, however, that Custis, who isstill in custody for purposes of State convictions, at thetime of this Federal sentencing under 924(e) may attack aState sentence in Maryland or through a Federal habeasreview, and then, importantly, after that the citation isjust see Maleng v. Cook.          Now, there are two things that suggest that whatthat left open was the possibility of reviewing the priorconviction as it enhanced the later sentence.  First isthat it says, or through a Federal habeas review, andsecond it says, it cites Maleng v. Cook.          Now, what Maleng decided was that there wassubject-matter jurisdiction in a Federal habeas case where47123456    remaining.7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425 1    there was an expired conviction, and the petitioner in 2    that case had attacked an expired conviction directly and 3    what this Court said was, no, you couldn't attack that 4    directly, but there was subject-matter jurisdiction on 5    habeas where that prior conviction was used to enhance a 6    subsequent sentence. 7              So that strongly suggests that the remedy that 8    this Court left open in Custis is akin to what exactly is 9    at issue here and that is, a 2255 remedy, by its very10    terms, allows the petitioner to attack the11    constitutionality of that prior State conviction, as it12    was used to enhance his Federal sentence.13              QUESTION:  Maleng, though, was directed just to14    whether or not he was in custody.15              MR. TANAKA:  Right, whether he was in custody on16    the subsequent sentence, but it suggests that they would17    entertain attack on the prior conviction through the18    custody of the subsequent sentence and conviction.19              The other point I wanted to make is, the20    Solicitor General mentioned that there was a fairness-21    finality balance here, and that this changes where the22    conviction, as in this case, is so old, but that fails to23    recognize that the finality interests where the conviction24    is used in a subsequent proceeding are not the same.  In25    fact, they're not even close to the same, where we're48 1    challenging the challenges to that State conviction 2    directly, and that is because this Court's jurisprudence 3    in many of those 2254 cases regarding finality posits the 4    rationale that the State judgment is a final one, and we 5    don't want to intrude in the State process.  That is, we 6    don't want to release this person from custody.  We don't 7    want to make the State retry this man.  We don't want to 8    intrude in the State process. 9              In this case, again, that interest is almost10    nonexistent.  If a Federal sentencing court granted a11    2255, there is no impact on that State court judgment.12              So it really boils down to a question of, is13    there a remedy for someone who is going to face a14    potential life term --15              QUESTION:  May I just question your last16    conclusion?  Supposing he had not -- he was still in State17    custody on parole or something of that kind, would not18    then the Federal 2255 have an impact on the State's19    interest in finality?20              MR. TANAKA:  I'm not sure it would --21              QUESTION:  It seems hard to imagine the Federal22    judge would conclude the State's conviction was invalid,23    and therefore nothing would happen in the State24    proceedings after that.25              MR. TANAKA:  Well, certainly the Federal court49 1    would have no conclusive effect on any subsequent State 2    court proceeding, and whatever persuasive value I imagine 3    that the State court could take it for what it was worth, 4    but I don't know that it would necessarily intrude on the 5    State court proceeding. 6              So basically what's at issue, then, is do we 7    allow 2255, which by its fine language provides a remedy 8    where the sentence is unconstitutional, do we close that 9    door on the basis of considerations that aren't at issue10    in this case, or do we allow someone who's facing a life11    sentence to litigate the validity, and in some cases it's12    going to be obvious, of prior convictions that don't13    reliably indicate his guilt and, as the Solicitor General14    said, the whole purpose between the armed career criminal15    act is incapacitation, or --16              QUESTION:  Of course, in this case, Mr. Tanaka,17    it's a guilty plea, so you don't have any real question of18    whether there's a record to show that he did it or didn't19    do it, because you don't get that sort of a record with a20    guilty plea.21              MR. TANAKA:  That's correct, Your Honor, and so22    the issue then would be, does this record reliably reflect23    his guilt, reviewing the record that's presented on the24    guilty plea, and that would be an issue for the Federal25    district court to decide on remand.50 1              If it decided that indeed there's enough 2    evidence here that we have no question that he was guilty 3    and there's a reliable indication of that, then I suppose 4    he's out of court, but the point is, he needs to have that 5    opportunity. 6              QUESTION:  But it's very difficult, as pointed 7    out in the briefs, when you're dealing with convictions 8    that are 16 and 19 years old, to go back and show exactly 9    what happened at a guilty plea.10              MR. TANAKA:  I'll grant that, but again I think11    that that concern is addressed by placing the burden of12    proof on the petitioner, which -- where it lies, and if13    the sentencing court doesn't find that persuasive, then --14              QUESTION:  Well, but as Mr. Dreeben pointed out,15    your client can simply file an affidavit saying that, you16    know, I wasn't fully advised of what was going on, and17    then it's up to the Government to come back.  It's very18    difficult for someone who is facing that kind of an19    affidavit to simply say, well, disbelieve this guy.  You20    want to collect information showing that he should be21    disbelieved.22232425    burden.          MR. TANAKA:  And to the extent that's possibleI'm sure the Government will do that.QUESTION:  Yes, with great administrative511 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. TANAKA:  Well, the fact is there just aren'tthat many of these cases, but that's a price that we needto pay in order to make sure that people aren'tunjustly --          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Well, but there comesa point when the Government should be entitled to say,this is the way the cookie crumbles.  You bought intothis, and you're stuck with it.          Thank you.  That's not a question.          Well, the case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)52
