Quinn.      Mr. Messenger.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM L. MESSENGERON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. MESSENGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and mayit please the Court:      Illinois is forcing Susan Watts andthousands of other home care providers to pay compulsoryfees to the SEIU to petition the State about itsMedicaid program that pays for their services to personswith disabilities, in Mrs. Watts' case, her daughterLibby.      This violates the First Amendment becausethe purpose of this mandatory association is inherentlyexpressive, petition the government for a redress ofgrievances, otherwise, lobby.  And also because thisprogram ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought it was to negotiate what's typically negotiated in collective bargaining; that is, wages, is that not so? Wages and benefits?3￼1 here are the reimbursement rates given to the providers,2 and the State now offers or pays money to the SEIU for a3 health benefit, but that is petitioning the government4 with regard to those negotiations.5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But how does it differ6 from the typical bargaining that a union does? It asks7 for a wage rate, and it asks for various benefits. So8 are you saying that when it's a public ­­ in the public9 sector, it gets converted into something else?10 MR. MESSENGER: Yes. When ­­ in the public11 sector, when a group is petitioning the government for12 money, that is, petitioning the government over a public13 program, here from a Medicaid program, it would be very14 little different than if the American Medical15 Association was asking for higher Medicaid rates for16 doctors or for nurses.17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is your argument18 dependent on this being sort of a dual employee19 situation, that it's reimbursement, as opposed to20 policemen, fire ­­ police people, fire people, teachers,21 other public ­­ other public employees who are directly22 employed by the State?23 MR. MESSENGER:24 Abood is distinguishable on25 the State is not the common4That is our position for whythat point, is that, here,law employer or the sole￼1 employer of these providers. It simply pays them for2 their services, much like a health insurer pays for the3 services of medical professionals.4 JUSTICE KAGAN: But your argument, of5 course, isn't limited to that. It goes beyond that6 situation?7 MR. MESSENGER: Yes.8 actual bargaining, even on behalf9 also petitioning and political in10 reason Abood should be overruled.11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there any likelihood12 that the union that represents these ­­ what do I call13 them ­­ healthcare workers, health providers ­­ care14 providers, is there any likelihood that they would try15 to bargain for benefits for these ­­ these workers?16 MR. MESSENGER: Would the union attempt to?17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, yes. Is there any18 likelihood? Do we know anything about what the19 likelihood would be for certain subjects to be brought20 up in the bargaining with the State?21 MR. MESSENGER: Well, one thing that has22 happened, this is in the collective bargaining23 agreement, is the State has agreed to give certain24 amounts of money to an SEIU healthcare fund to offer25 access to health benefits for those providers. So the5And that the ­­ theof true employees, isnature, and for that1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425State is funding the SEIU's health benefit program tothat extent.      JUSTICE SCALIA:for a redress of grievances?He has prevented a petition￼      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:before the union?      MR. MESSENGER:      JUSTICE SCALIA:policeman who ­­ who is dissatisfied with his wages.  Sohe makes an appointment with the commissioner ­­ policecommissioner, and he goes in and grouses about hiswages.  He does this ­­ you know, 10 or 11 times.      And the commissioner finally is fed up, andhe tells his secretary, I don't ­­ I don't want to seethis man again.  Has he violated the Constitution?MR. MESSENGER: No.MR. MESSENGER: No, because in that ­­ with an individual speaking, it's, sir, a matter of private or internal proprietary matter that, under this Court's precedence, don't rise to a matter of public concern.      However, if you had an organizationpetitioning a ­­ a police district for wages across theboard for police officers, then that is a matter ofpublic concern and would violate the First ­­JUSTICE SCALIA:I really don't understand6Did they have thatNo. Suppose you have aMR. MESSENGER:But in that case, under our￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that.  When ­­ when you ­­ so what if it's 10 policemenwho do this?  It's still not a matter of public concern?Or does it have to be the whole police force?MR. MESSENGER: The line would be, once you have the collective, it would be start to become a matter of public concern. It'd be the publicconcern test.JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me it's always a matter of public concern, whether you're going to raise the salaries of policemen, whether it's an individual policeman asking for that or ­­ or a ­­ a combination of policemen or a union. It's always a matter of public concern, isn't it?MR. MESSENGER: Then if it is, then I submit that it's unconstitutional for ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. To not ­­ not give this guy an appointment the 12th time.MR. MESSENGER: No. The police just ­­ chief can certainly shut his door, but what would be unconstitutional is to force ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, how can he shut his door if ­­ he has a right to petition, a constitutional right to petition for the redress of grievances? His grievance is he's not being paid enough.7￼1 public concern test, which goes within the Pickering2 line, that that individual grievance would not rise to a3 First Amendment petition.4 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it's the same grievance5 if the union had presented it. The ­­ the grievance is6 the salaries for policemen are not high enough.7 MR. MESSENGER: But the ­­8 JUSTICE SCALIA: He's not asking for just9 his salary to be raised. He wants salaries of all ­­10 all the cops to be raised.11 MR. MESSENGER: Well, two points. The first12 is the scale is what differentiates. So here, you have13 a union petitioning a State for Medicaid rates that are14 paid for 20,000­some care providers, and so the scale of15 it is what makes it a matter of public concern or a16 matter of lobbying, as opposed to ­­17 JUSTICE KAGAN: But what ­­ what you're18 objecting to, to the extent that you're not objecting to19 the entire system of collective bargaining, you're20 objecting ­­ you're saying an individual employee can21 say, I don't feel like supporting a union that makes a22 certain kind of argument about wages or about benefits.23 So, just to carry on with Justice Scalia's24 example, the subject matter is the exact same in the two25 contexts, whether it's an individual employee or whether81 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425it's a union, and in both contexts, the ­­ the ultimatesanction is the same, right?  Somebody grouses about hispay too much, he could get fired.  Somebody refuses tosupport a union that is negotiating about pay, he canlose his job.      So it's ­­ it's really identical across thetwo situations.MR. MESSENGER: Well, I'd say ­­JUSTICE KAGAN: Same subject matter, same sanction. What's the difference?MR. MESSENGER: There's two ­­ two differences. One, again, is the scale. When you're talking about a union collectively petitioning a school district or in the States ­­JUSTICE KAGAN: But you're not objecting, I think, to the union as a whole. What you're objecting to is an individual employee having to support that activity. The scale is no different. It's an individual employee.MR. MESSENGER: Yes, the ­­ it's an individual employee being forced to support that expressive activity. So the question becomes: What expressive activity are they being forced to support?      And when you're speaking of changing anentire government program, for example, Medicaid rates9￼￼1 across the board, that is a matter of public concern.2 That is a matter of lobbying or political concerns.3 JUSTICE KAGAN: But that's exactly what the4 individual employee in Justice Scalia's hypothetical is5 arguing for. He wants wage rates to be changed across6 the board. He knows they're not going to be changed7 just for him. He wants higher wage rates.8 MR. MESSENGER: But, again, under this9 Court's private ­­ under the public concern test, an10 individual simply speaking to that usually does not rise11 to a matter of public concern.12 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, Mr. Messenger, I'm13 confused by this whole line of argumentation. I didn't14 think there was any issue in this case about the right15 of the plaintiffs or any of the other affected workers16 to say whatever they want on their own. That ­­ they're17 not prohibited from doing that, are they?18 MR. MESSENGER: No, they're not.19 JUSTICE ALITO: So there isn't any issue20 about that in the case. I thought the issue ­­ and they21 can try to ­­ to meet with anybody they want as many22 times as they want. I suppose that ­­ that person has a23 perfect right to say: Enough is enough; I don't want to24 meet with you for the fifth time or for the first time.25 I thought the issue was whether they could109 with a union qua union. Is10 the State saying, we're not11 employee who's not a member12 MR. MESSENGER:there anything wrong withgoing to negotiate with anyof the union?Yes, under ­­ I'm sorry.￼1 be required to pay for somebody else to go and speak and2 possibly say things that they disagree with.3 MR. MESSENGER: Yes, exactly, that they are4 being forced to support an organization, here, the SEIU,5 to speak or petition the State over its Medicaid rates.6 So the distinction is ­­7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So let's break this8 down. You're not arguing that there's something wrong13 There is ­­ Your Honor, there is not a problem with that14 because my whole ­­15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Is there a16 problem for the State to say ­­ the union, to organize,17 has a certain amount of costs. So putting aside fair18 representation laws, could the State say, this is what19 we're going to pay police officers, $100, but we're20 going to pay union members $110 to reimburse them for the21 cost of negotiation. Would that be okay?22 MR. MESSENGER: Yes. Under Knight, the23 State can choose who it bargains with, and if it chooses24 to set different rates for union and ­­ union and25 non­union, it could, as you said, notwithstanding111 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425fair ­­ or duty of fair representation ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So there's no problemhere with the representation.  Your problem is with thefair share?MR. MESSENGER: Yes, forcing the individuals to support the union for the purpose of petitioning the State over here the Medicaid rates for homecare.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are there any ­­ you suggest, in response to my colleague's question, that they could ­­ the State could pay healthcare providers different rates. Is there ­­ are there any limitations? We're talking about Medicaid reimbursement.MR. MESSENGER: Yes.      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:limitations that would prevent differential rates ofpay, reimbursement, under Medicaid for the sameservices?MR. MESSENGER: There may be statutory. I know that most Medicaid programs are ­­ across the board set rates. But also, constitutionally, if there was a differential act or degree, it could be considered a penalty for the individual exercising their rights.      But as far as I know, most Medicaidprograms, in particular the one here, it's always been afixed rate established across the board.12￼Are there any1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      JUSTICE SCALIA:clarify what was the purpose of my earlier line ofquestioning, it was simply to show that, if you have acase, it doesn't rest on the right to petition thegovernment for redress of grievances.      It ­­ it rests on the First Amendment.You ­­ you say that there is being ­­ your ­­ yourpeople are being required to support speech that theydon't agree with.MR. MESSENGER: Yes, Your Honor.JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, that is ­­ you know, that is an arguable position, but I don't ­­ I don't think it's even arguable that the right to petition the government for redress of grievances is ­­ is involved here.MR. MESSENGER: It's the expression they're being forced to support, Your Honor. So the violation,as you say, is they're beingexpressive activity and thatforced to supportexpressive activity ­­That's a First Amendment￼      JUSTICE SCALIA:violation, not a violation ­­ not a denial of the rightto petition the government.MR. MESSENGER: Yes, Your Honor. They're not being denied the right to petition, in the sense that the State is saying they cannot petition. Instead,13Mr. Messenger, just to1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425they're being forced to support petitioning.JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Messenger, I'm not surethat Justice Scalia's answer satisfies his own question.      (Laughter.)JUSTICE SCALIA: What ­­ what was the question?(Laughter.)JUSTICE KAGAN: Because here's the thing: That, in the workplace, we've given the government a very wide degree of latitude, and there's much that the government can do. It can fire people, it can demote people for things that they say in the workplace, not for things that they say as a citizen, but for things that they say in the workplace. That's the fundamental lesson of Garcetti and of many, many others of our cases.      So you're saying, well, the government canpunish somebody for saying something, but the governmentin the exact same position cannot compel somebody to saysomething they disagree with.  And I want to know what'sthe basis for that distinction, which it seems to me isjust as hard as ­­ as if you were answering under thePetition Clause.JUSTICE SCALIA: I want to hear the answer, too, because, contrary to what Justice Kagan suggests,14￼￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425I ­­ I didn't say your First Amendment argument wasvalid.      (Laughter.)      JUSTICE KAGAN:      JUSTICE SCALIA:comprehensible argument.      (Laughter.)      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:you'd like.(Laughter.)      MR. MESSENGER:providers petition the State, I submit, is not aninternal proprietary matter that the government has freerein to manage.  And so the distinction betweengovernment acting as proprietor, as you say, thegovernment can tell an employee on work time that youcan't engage in certain speech if it interferes with theworkplace.      But the way in which an individualassociates with to lobby or petition the State is not aninternal proprietary matter.  So for example, here, theway in which Susan Watts and other homecare providerspetition the State is not internal workplace speech.JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't it? I mean, it is for private employers. There are some private15Good, okay. I said at least it was a        Jump in wheneverThe way in which homecare￼1 employers who think they're better off with a closed2 shop, and they just want to deal with one union, and ­­3 and they require all the people that they hire to become4 a member of this union and to pay union dues for5 representational purposes.6 They do this as private employers because7 they think it is in their interest as an employer. Why8 can't the government have the same interest?9 MR. MESSENGER: Because when the government10 is involved, the First Amendment interests are much11 heightened because you're dealing with attempting to12 influence government policy.13 JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. But ­­ but14 don't tell me that there's no employer interest. There15 is an employer interest. You're just saying it is16 not ­­ it is not considerable enough, right?17 MR. MESSENGER: Yes, it's not considerable18 enough. Here, the State lacks ­­19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what stops the ­­20 the non ­­ the people who oppose a union policy from21 sending a letter, asking a meeting, expressing their22 disapproval in any forum they want and in any way they23 want, to whatever policy a union is advocating?24 Is there anything that stops them from doing25 that?16However, I submit that it's not      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. MESSENGER: No, there isn't, Your Honor.­­                                So where's the FirstAmendment abridgement?  They can do whatever they want.They can speak however they want in support of or inopposition to absolutely anything the union is doing.MR. MESSENGER: It's ­­ Your Honor, it's the compelled speech, and the fact that the individuals have other First Amendment rights is not exculpatory. So it's the ­­ it's the compulsion to support the SEIU'spositions in petitioning theAmendment violation.      And the fact that ­­      JUSTICE SCALIA:fact that you're entitled towould not justify the government in requiring you togive money to Planned Parenthood?      MR. MESSENGER:      JUSTICE SCALIA:making.      MR.

MESSENGER: No, I submit that the labor peace interest isn't valid here because, in dealing with the Medicaid program, the State doesn't have an interest in avoiding competing demands from rival groups regarding its policies on that; That is, democratic ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why doesn't it?It ­­ it gets the demand from the union, it recognizes18￼￼1 it's reasonable; that's the policy, and then it can move2 forward with the policy.3 MR. MESSENGER: Well, the State could4 unilaterally do that, without bargaining with the union.5 JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Messenger, do you think6 the issue of exclusive representation is inextricably7 tied to the issue of the assessment of an agency fee?8 Can't you have the former without the latter?9 MR. MESSENGER: Yes, you can, in At least10 two ways. The first of which is that Knox, of course,11 lays out a two­part test. The second part test ­­ even12 if the first is satisfied, that the mandatory13 association, here, exclusive representation, is14 justified by compelling interest, you still go to the15 second test of whether or not fees are a necessary16 incident to that representation, and I submit that17 Illinois does not satisfy that test.18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're not ­­ you're19 not challenging ­­ or it's confusing whether you are or20 not ­­ the very idea of exclusive representation by a21 union. Are you saying that, in the public sector, there22 cannot be exclusive ­­ an exclusive bargaining agent?23 MR. MESSENGER: It's not directly challenged24 in this case, but it becomes relevant under the first25 Knox test, which asks whether the mandatory association19￼1 being supported by the compulsory fees is justified by a2 compelling State interest.3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is the mandatory ­­ let's4 take out, as Justice Alito suggested, take out the5 agency fee or fair­share fee or whatever it is, but6 there is an exclusive bargaining agent. Workers, your7 clients, say, we don't want to be represented by that8 union.9 The union is authorized to represent10 everybody in the workplace and has to represent even11 nonmembers, as well, without any discrimination. And ­­12 and are you taking the position that there cannot be an13 exclusive bargaining agent if there are any dissenters14 who don't want to be represented by a union?15 MR. MESSENGER: Not in this case, Your16 Honor. This case does not present the question of17 whether exclusive representation alone would constitute18 a First Amendment injury because the complaint here is19 focused towards the compulsory fees, so that particular20 issue is not here.21 JUSTICE KAGAN: So, Mr. Messenger, even on22 the compulsory fees ­­ I mean, what strikes me is that23 this is ­­ I'm just going to use the word here ­­ it is24 a radical argument. It would radically restructure the25 way workplaces across this country are ­­ are run.20￼1 And let me just put it to you this way and2 ask if you agree with this ­­ with this statement.3 Since 1948, since the Taft­Hartley Act, there has been a4 debate in every State across this country about whether5 to be a right­to­work State, and people have disagreed.6 Some States say yes, some States say no. It7 raises considerable heat and passion and tension, as we8 recently saw in Wisconsin. And ­­ but ­­ you know,9 these are public policy choices that States make.10 And is it fair to say that what you're11 suggesting here ­­ your argument is essentially to say12 that, for 65 years, people have been debating the wrong13 question when they've been debating that because, in14 fact, a right­to­work law is constitutionally compelled?15 MR. MESSENGER: In the public sector, yes,16 that it is in fact ­­ well, the first public sector17 labor law was actually 1959 in Wisconsin, so it's18 relatively recent when you're involving with government.19 Yes, our position is ­­ is that, in the public sector,20 when government is involved, compulsory fees are illegal21 under the First Amendment.22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the Court were to23 say that on the issue of salaries there is no First24 Amendment violation, that ­­ that Abood should remain25 applicable to public employee unions.211 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      Are there other issues that public employeeunions necessarily raise in collective bargaining thatraise other concerns about governmental policies thatunion members might disagree with?MR. MESSENGER: Yes, Your Honor. Speaking of true employees ­­ we're not speaking of Medicaid providers, but speaking of true employees, this was discussed in Abood with respect to public school teachers and all the different aspects that the union petitions over that has to do with class sizes, hours worked.      Benefits are a huge issue, of course, interms of financially for many school districts, healthbenefits.  So there are many issues of the way theschool district actually operates.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How about here for your employees? They negotiate health insurance. Do they ­­ they don't negotiate termination because that's up to the individual ­­MR. MESSENGER: Yes.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ parties. So there's no grievance committee. Do they negotiate the tasks that will be reimbursed?MR. MESSENGER: No. The tasks that the State will reimburse are set in a service plan. That's22￼￼1 not a mandatory ­­2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:3 being asked to have a fair share of how much you're4 getting from the State for your services and health5 insurance. What else is negotiated that you're being6 asked to pay for?7 MR. MESSENGER: Well, what ­­ as far as what8 they're being forced to support is the reimbursement9 rate. The State is giving money to an SEIU healthcare10 fund, which many providers may or may not use. The11 State is giving money to an SEIU member training fund to12 provide voluntary training to providers and also to13 conduct an orientation that new providers will be forced14 to support.15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Those things, you can16 argue, are not part of the representation for which they17 should be charged, and they should get their money back18 for those things, if they're actually not ­­ not getting19 any benefit from them.20 MR. MESSENGER: Well, I would submit that21 they shouldn't be forced to pay for any of this22 petitioning regarding how the State chooses to run this23 Medicaid program.24 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but they're ­­ I mean,25 what our cases say is you ­­ you can be compelled not to23All right.  So you're￼1 be a free rider, to ­­ to pay for those items of2 bargaining that benefit you, as well as everybody else.3 But you don't ­­ you don't have to pay for4 stuff that ­­ that is not within that description, stuff5 that doesn't benefit you at all.6 MR. MESSENGER: That's true for true7 employees, under this Court's previous cases, but the8 question, of course, here is do those same principles9 apply to Medicaid providers or anyone else who receives10 money from government. And that's ­­11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: They receive a salary ­­12 I mean, they receive ­­ it's not a government grant to13 the ­­ to the healthcare worker. They receive a14 paycheck, and the government withholds from that. The15 government makes a FICA contribution for them and16 withholds the part that's their responsibility.17 So it looks just like they are an employee18 of the government, being paid by the government, and the19 government doing things that an employer does, withhold20 income tax, pay in part the FICA tax, withhold the other21 part. And they are ­­ they're also covered by workers'22 compensation, aren't they?23 MR. MESSENGER:24 law, they have ­­25 JUSTICE GINSBURG:24Oh, yes.  Under Illinois   As ­­ as employees of the￼1 State?2 MR. MESSENGER: Yes, Your Honor. But the3 wage ­­ in fact, defining whether it's wages or a flat4 reimbursement rate or a grant I don't ­­ I submit is not5 constitutionally relevant. So, for example, the Act was6 recently extended to independent nurses and therapists7 who provide in­home care.8 They're paid a flat rate, as opposed to an9 hourly ­­ what do you call it, wage. Constitutionally,10 there's no difference. The bottom line is it's money11 from government, from, here, a Medicaid program, to12 provide care to other individuals.13 And I submit that doesn't create an14 employment relationship any more than a doctor is15 privately employed by a health insurer ­­ insurance16 company, merely because they pay for it.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: They're not getting a18 paycheck and the insurance ­­ insurer is not deducting19 withholding tax ­­ isn't paying FICA tax?20 MR. MESSENGER: Well ­­ that is paid, but21 the State is doing it as pay agent. And so while the22 money is coming from the State, the State is doing it as23 pay agent for the person with disabilities, who is truly24 the employer.25 JUSTICE ALITO:25I thought the State took the1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425position that these individuals are State employees forone purpose only, collective bargaining.  Isn't thattheir position?MR. MESSENGER: Yes, that's right in the statute, Your Honor, that's it's solely for purposes of collective bargaining.JUSTICE ALITO: So if one of these individuals commits gross misconduct, causes the death of a patient, the State has no liability?MR. MESSENGER: It's right in the statute. The State said it's not ­­ does not extend vicarious liability to independent providers.JUSTICE BREYER: When you come back, I'd appreciate your thinking about this, but obviously, you're asking us to overturn a case that's been the law for 35 years.      I count hundreds of citations in theopinion, and I guess there are millions of instances inwhich employees and employers and others have relied onit in collective bargaining, so I'd appreciate yoursaying sentence a or two of why we should upsetreasonable expectations over so long a period of time.MR.

Mr. Smith.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH      ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSMR. SMITH: Thank you, Your Honor.      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please theCourt:      10 years ago, the State of Illinois made adecision about the best way to deliver homecare servicesto thousands of persons with physical disabilities inthe State who, without those services, would need tolive in institutional settings.      It made the judgment that working with theunion to negotiate and implement a collective bargainingagreement for these workers that it was paying wouldhelp meet its service delivery goals for thispopulation, this group of workers, which was ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why? If ­­ your ­­ your adversary says that the reimbursement rate is set by the Medicaid program, so why do you need a union to tell you how much to pay, if it's already set?MR. SMITH: There is no reimbursement rate for these workers set by the Medicaid program, Your Honor. The amount of money they are paid is an hourly wage set in the collectively bargaining agreement. When27￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the union was first recognized, it was $7 an hour andthere were no benefits.      Because the State has chosen to work withthis union, it has produced a package of benefitsdesigned to create a solution to the morale problems,the recruitment problems, the retention problems ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand what you're saying. If there were no union, there would be no wages?MR. SMITH: Your Honor, the ­­ the State's judgment is that it can better make these determinations in partnership with the union and that the process of negotiation gives it both tangible and intangible benefits. The tangible benefit is it figures out what the priority needs of the workers are.JUSTICE SCALIA: So from ­­ from the outset, it set up the union, right, and the union said, We want 7 bucks an hour, was that it?MR.

My understanding ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you can negotiate whatever rates you want with the homecare providers, regardless of what Medicaid says about those services?MR. SMITH: "You," the State of Illinois, you mean?CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, yes.MR. SMITH: The State of Illinois, Your Honor, as far as I know ­­ I'm not aware of any limitation. I expect that there may be some at some point, but in terms of the ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Smith, I think that there's ­­ I must say that I might have labored under it. From your adversary's statement, it appears as if there's a belief that the Federal Government sets a fixed amount, and that's what the State has to pay.      Whether the Federal Government pays you acertain amount, however, you seem to be saying the Statecan go above that amount if it chooses.  That's thecooperative nature of this.MR. SMITH: Your Honor, the exact nature of the fund transfer from the Federal government to the State may well be based on an individual's annual costs with a particular diagnosis. I'm in the realm of31￼￼1 speculation here, but it's very clear from this record2 that these decisions about how these individuals will be3 paid are made by the State, and that they have the4 discretion under the program to do that, and that they5 decided that they would deal with the problems of6 recruitment and retention and morale in this workforce,7 which is, of course, scattered to tens of thousands of8 work sites across the country.9 JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Smith, what I don't10 understand is why the union's participation in this is11 essential. The State can say, this is how much these12 people are being paid ­­ it's not enough, we want to13 increase it, we want to increase it by 10 percent, 2014 percent, 30 percent, whatever it is. They need some ­­15 they should have extra benefits. Well, we'll give them16 these benefits and these benefits and these benefits.17 Why do they need to have the union intervene18 here?19 MR. SMITH: The State of Illinois, like many20 employers, decided that, A, they would get that right21 more likely if they were dealing with a representative22 of the workers who told them what they care about,23 whether it's paid vacation versus higher wages versus24 less hours during the week or more hours during the week25 or whatever it might be.32￼1 It also said that, because these decisions2 are going to be made in the process of negotiation,3 which the workers know they have a place at the table,4 somebody who was there looking out for their interests,5 the workers will have a different sense of commitment6 to ­­7 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that ­­ that's fine8 for the workers who want the union to represent them in9 making these demands on the State.10 Let me give you this example, which I think11 gets to what the ­­ the plaintiffs in this case find12 disturbing. Let's say this is ­­ this involves a13 teachers union. So the teachers union is negotiating14 about the issue of tenure and merit pay, and the union15 is opposed to any change in the tenure system, it's16 opposed to merit pay.17 Okay. Now, there's a teacher who's not a18 member of the union who disagrees completely with the19 union on these issues, but this teacher ­­ and the20 teacher is not a member of the union, but still has to21 pay a pretty hefty agency fee, maybe $700 a year. So22 the teacher is paying this money to the union to make an23 argument to the employer with which the teacher24 completely disagrees.25 Now, if this teacher just wants to get back336 that, to7 right to8 on these9 teacher?that teacher?  That ­­ you know, You have abe ­­ you have a right to say whatever you wantissues, but you don't have a right to be a￼1 to a neutral position, the teacher is going to have to2 spend $700 or maybe $500 of his or her own money, pay3 that to another organization that will present that4 teacher's point of view to the employer.5 How can that be ­­ what would you say to10 MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, I would say11 that the Court has correctly held, over a period of more12 than 30 years, that that requirement is an appropriate13 thing which a public employer is allowed to impose14 because of the duty of fair representation and because15 of the benefits of allowing collective bargaining to16 proceed with the duty of fair representation imposed on17 the union.18 As Justice Scalia put it in his Lehnert19 opinion, this is not a normal sort of free rider20 argument. This is a free ­­ free rider argument where21 the law requires the union to look after that teacher22 and make sure that they get treated equally ­­23 JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Smith, are you saying24 that this ­­ that the unions reluctantly accept the duty25 of being the exclusive representative for all the34￼1 employees? They don't really want to do this, but the2 law requires them to do this, but because the law3 requires them to do this, then they have to get this4 agency fee?5 Is that really ­­ is that realistically what6 happens?7 MR. SMITH: Well, that is ­­ that is the8 system we have, Your Honor. And imagine what the world9 would look like if there weren't ­­10 JUSTICE ALITO: Seriously, the unions do not11 want to have the ­­ they don't want to be given the12 status of the exclusive bargaining agent for the13 employees?14 MR. SMITH: I ­­ I think there may be15 variation on that. I imagine there might be some union16 out there that would love to be able to favor their17 members over other. But the law doesn't require that,18 and for a very good reason, including the First19 Amendment reason.20 Imagine a world in which that teacher is ­­21 would be paid 10 percent less as we were discussing22 before, because that teacher has chosen not to be a full23 member of the union, and imagine the pressure on24 associational rights that would be created for that25 teacher faced with that choice.351 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      You could be paid 10 percent less doing thesame work, or you can be paid the same as everybodyelse, but you have to fully join the union and pay fortheir political speech and pay for everything on thenonchargeable side of the line.      And ­­ you know, what this Court has doneover the last 30 years is use that distinction betweenchargeable and nonchargeable items to balance the FirstAmendment interests of the ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in talking about First Amendment interests, let me ask you this: Is it not a standard issue in collective bargaining for the employees' union to talk about the size of the workforce?MR.

SMITH: Look at what the union is ­­11 what the ­­ what the money is being spent on in this12 case. It's being spent on negotiating the contract, which13 has produced a package of benefits and wage increases14 that have been extremely important to everybody in ­­ in15 this workforce.16 It's being spent on a call center that17 allows people to call to their union and get answers to18 questions about problems, a grievance system that makes19 sure their paychecks don't go missing and helps them20 address that problem, training, gloves that they need21 for their personal safety in the workplace, and22 healthcare benefits.23 Now, there are ­­ may be people who think24 it's politically controversial to have to contribute to25 a union that does those things and nothing else. But I39￼1 submit to you that balance that against the interests of2 the State as employer in saying we want to have this3 partnership with this union, this will help us do a4 better job delivering services to this vulnerable5 population and save us a lot of money keeping the6 matter ­­7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One thing,8 Mr. Smith, the first word in your brief is "Medicaid."9 I don't understand because the argument can be made that10 Medicaid reimbursement rates is an important public11 policy issue, not simply a labor issue.12 Now, let's say you have a teachers' union,13 okay? They think it's a very important public issue.14 They have a platform. They engage in activities to get15 higher Medicaid reimbursement rates. Is that something16 that a nonunion member would have to pay for, or would17 they ­­ would that expense be segregated out of what18 they must pay?19 MR. SMITH: I'm sorry, Your Honor. Could I20 just hear the question one more time?21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Teacher ­­ teacher22 union, okay?23 MR.

If you're a teacher, butyou're not a member of the union, do you have to pay forthat expenditure?MR.

SMITH: In the ­­ in the limited sense that they're hourly wages going to these individuals, yes.JUSTICE BREYER: The question you're being asked, I think, is a broader question. Collective bargaining with any employer, meat packers, hours, safety depends on hours, always can involve public interest questions.MR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor.JUSTICE BREYER: But I think the question you're being asked is where you have SEIU or AFSCME, and they're government unions, does it have a bigger mix of public policy issues; and therefore, should this Court get into the business ­­ I'm putting it in a little loaded way because I don't want to suggest the answer.      Should this Court make that distinction andget into the business of saying, when the union is too43￼1 much of a ­­ wages, hours, and working conditions are2 too likely to affect public issues, and the other ones3 less likely, et cetera, you see the distinction that the4 question that was added suggests?5 Now, I would like you to think about ­­6 that's a philosophical question ­­ or a very broad First7 Amendment question. And I'd like to hear what your8 answer is and the government's.9 MR. SMITH: My answer, Your Honor, would be10 that the fact that it is a public employee union,11 representing public employees, means that, in one sense,12 everything that is being negotiated could be viewed as a13 greater matter of public concern.14 On the other hand, that is not a reason, as15 Abood held, to up the ante in terms of constitutional16 scrutiny. To the contrary, this is the government as17 employer dealing with its employees about the basic18 terms and conditions of their employment. And ­­19 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me ask you a20 question about pensions. Now, that's a very big public21 policy issue. I think, in Illinois, the legislature22 recently cut pensions of ­­ of public employees. That23 would be a subject ­­ that could be a subject of ­­ of24 collective bargaining, right? So that would be ­­25 bargaining on that would be chargeable?44￼1 MR. SMITH: It would be a subject if the2 State chose to let ­­ let it become a subject. The3 State completely controls what ­­ what can be a subject4 of collective bargaining and what can't.5 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if the ­­ if the union6 spends a lot of money trying to bargain on that issue,7 that's ­­ that's a chargeable expense, is it not?8 MR. SMITH: If the State has chosen to make9 it part of the contract that can be negotiated, yes.10 JUSTICE ALITO: All right. Now, what do you11 say to the young employee who is not very much concerned12 at this point about pensions, but realizes there's a13 certain pot of money, and it's either going to go for14 pensions, or it's going to go for salary at the present15 time.16 So that employee who's not a member of the17 union has to pay for the union to bargain with the ­­18 the State to achieve something that's contrary to that19 person's interest. But you say that person is a free20 rider.21 MR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor. That ­­ that22 person, if it's not paying their share of that, then you23 have two things that happened. The other members ­­ the24 other people in the workforce have to pay more to25 support the process, or the union doesn't have the45￼1 resources needed to be a ­­ an adequate partner with the2 State in producing the outcome that the State has chosen3 to try to seek, which is an outcome where the mutually4 beneficial arrangements are made that satisfy the5 priorities of everybody here, the workers and the State6 and, indeed, the clients that they serve.7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the young person8 thinks that the State is squandering his heritage on9 unnecessary and excessive payments for benefits and10 wages. Is that not a political belief of the highest11 order? And ­­ you know, we talk about free riders,12 which is an epithetical phrase.13 Maybe the objecting employee would say that14 the union is a speech distorter; it is taking views that15 are not his and making them mandatory subject to16 bargaining and charging him for it.17 MR. SMITH: What's missing, I think, in this18 conversation, Your Honor, is that all of these burdens19 on people's associational rights or free speech rights20 or whatever you want to call them arises only because21 somebody has chosen to come take this job working for22 the State on the terms the State offers.23 And as you've said many times ­­24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So your position is that25 the public employees must surrender a substantial amount461 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425of First Amendment rights to work for the government? MR. SMITH: When there are substantialinterests of the government as employer that are servedby the sacrifice.  What you've said over and over inDuryea, in Garcetti, and in a whole line of cases is thegovernment gets to have leeway as an employer when thereare real interests at stake, and that, in thatsituation, the employee could be put to the choice.Thank you, Your Honor.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

I think thekey point ­­ the key takeaway in this case is that thecontext we are dealing with here is the government as47￼￼1 proprietor and manager of its own operations. And this2 Court's case law has said, over and over again, that in3 that context, two things follow.4 First, the government's interest in the5 effective and efficient carrying out of its own6 operations is entitled to very substantial weight, more7 substantial weight than it would get if you were looking8 at the government as a sovereign regulating the9 citizenry.10 And second, yes, Justice Kennedy, indeed, as11 Your Honors' opinion in Garcetti and Your Honors'12 opinion in Borough of Duryea recognized both times, the13 employees' First Amendment interests are diminished to14 the extent that the government has more latitude when15 the government can show that the obligation it is16 imposing is in furtherance of the government's17 legitimate interests as manager of its own operations.18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: General Verrilli,19 does Medicaid have anything to do with this case?20 GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. Let me do my best21 to try to clear that up, Mr. Chief Justice. I'm going22 to give you the best answer I can to your question.23 Remember, Medicaid, of course, is a joint Federal/State24 program. The Federal government provides funds; the25 State provides funds.48￼1 Here, we're operating within a waiver2 program in which the State is given considerable3 latitude to set wages and set rates, so long as it is4 saving money as compared to the institutionalization of5 this population.6 My understanding is that HHS will review7 wage rates set to make sure that they meet very general8 parameters. They were of the kind described in the9 Douglas case that was before the Court a couple of years10 ago.11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, right.12 GENERAL VERRILLI: That ­­ are they high13 enough to make sure the services providing ­­ they're14 provided effectively and are they ­­ and are they15 constrained enough that you’re not wasting money­­16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. Your17 statement of interest ­­ your statement of interest18 explaining why you are here today discusses the effect19 of the Medicaid program.20 GENERAL VERRILLI: Right, but it's not that21 the ­­ but the Federal government isn't approving the22 specific hourly wage rate as Medicaid reimbursement23 within this program. That's a judgment that the24 Medicaid program leaves to the considerable discretion25 of the State.49￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If the ­­ if the2 union wants to talk about Medicaid rates with the State3 because they would get a higher wage or could get a4 higher wage if Medicaid reimbursement was higher, is5 that within the ­­ their functioning as a union rather6 than a political group?7 GENERAL VERRILLI: Not as I understand it.8 I think applying the line of Lehnert, that that would be9 on the impermissible side of the line. That would be10 effectively seeking to change public policy by changing11 what the legislature or the ­­12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, so if the union13 wants to say, Look, the only way our people are going to14 get higher wages is if there's a higher Medicaid15 reimbursement rate for this service, that is not within16 the scope of collective bargaining?17 GENERAL VERRILLI: I think ­­ my18 understanding is that that would be ­­ the question19 there was at which side of the line that the Court drew20 in Lehnert is that on.21 I think that's probably on the ­­ on the22 impermissible side of the line. But that's where the23 fight would be. It would be over where that line should24 be drawn, not over whether the ­­ whether the State, as25 manager of its own operations, can use collective5025 GENERAL VERRILLI:It hasn't, but the key￼1 bargaining with a fair share, as Justice Scalia2 mentioned earlier, in a way that private employers3 routinely do.4 I mean, I do think that's the fundamental5 point of Abood, that private ­­ that the government as6 employer, as manager of its own operations, ought to be7 able to make the same kind of choice that private8 employers make when they think it advances their9 interests in efficiency and sound operations.10 JUSTICE ALITO: If the plaintiffs in this11 case worked in a unionized ­­ excuse me ­­ in a unionized12 Federal workplace, would they be assessed a mandatory13 agency fee?14 GENERAL VERRILLI: No, they would not,15 Justice Alito, and we're not ­­ we're not here making an16 argument that, as a matter of policy, States ought to17 adopt fair share or not. The thing that matters to us18 is the principle of First Amendment law that's at stake.19 JUSTICE ALITO:20 doesn't think that it needs21 fee from, let's say, the ­­22 Patrol, in order to make sure that the Border Patrol has23 high morale, sufficient salary, sufficient benefits, it24 can do without the agency fee in that situation?51So the Federal governmentto assess a mandatory agencythe employees in the Border￼1 point for us, the point of vital importance for the2 United States here, is that the Court continue to3 recognize the context ­­ the First Amendment context of4 the government as manager of its own operations. And5 whatever choice the United States has made, many States6 have made different choices in their role as manager of7 their own operations.8 And under the Court's established case law,9 which Abood, I think, is a quite good example of, the10 principle that, when the government is acting to further11 its operations as manager, they get substantial12 latitude. Now, there's a limit on that, of course.13 They can't use that authority to ­­ they can't leverage14 that authority to affect the way citizens interact as15 citizens ­­16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, one can be17 skeptical about whether ­­ when States do this, they are18 doing it because it's more ­­ more efficient as an19 employer because some States have tried to force private20 employers to have a closed shop, haven't they?21 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I think ­­22 JUSTICE SCALIA: And there's no ­­ you know,23 no State government interest in it. There's just State24 interest in unions.25 GENERAL VERRILLI:52Yes, but, here, we5 going6 a lot78 about9 abouton, that the State really thinks it's going to beeasier if it has a closed shop.GENERAL VERRILLI: I guess what I would saythat, Justice Scalia, is that one could speculate￼1 argue ­­2 JUSTICE SCALIA:3 money from people who don't belong in the unions. So4 one can be skeptical about whether this is really what's           motives of States like Illinois, one could10 speculate about motives of the right­to­work States, but11 I would suggest that, under our Federal system, that12 States get to make those kinds of policy choices.13 And Illinois has made a policy choice, as14 many private employers have, that using collective15 bargaining ­­ and it is, I want to stress here, very16 narrowly tailored collective bargaining. By law, it can17 only be over wages, hours, and conditions of employment,18 by law.19 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that the20 specific factual background of what occurred here21 provides a basis for skepticism about Illinois' reason22 for adopting this?23 GENERAL VERRILLI: I don't think so. When24 the legislation was enacted, it was enacted with a very25 large bipartisan margin, and I just don't think it would53And unions getting a lot of1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425be appropriate, in the context of the government asmanager of its own operations, to look behind and try toconsider motive.      This is a choice that many ­­JUSTICE ALITO: I thought the situation was that Governor Blagojevich got a huge campaign contribution from the union and virtually, as soon as he got into office, he took out his pen and signed an executive order that had the effect of putting ­­ what was it, $3.6 million into the union coffers?JUSTICE SCALIA:They may do so because of￼      GENERAL VERRILLI:      JUSTICE ALITO:that correct?      GENERAL VERRILLI:before the Court is the constitutionality of the statutethat was enacted subsequent to that by a largebipartisan majority, and I don't think it would beappropriate to look behind the legislature's action toconsider and try to evaluate its motives.  And I think,under our Federal system, States get to make choices.      It's true, not every State does it this way,but many do.  They do so for reasons of efficientmanagement of their internal operations, and that's theprinciple that we think is of critical importance here.54   Whatever happened ­­That's the sequence; isn'tWell, I think the issue￼1 that reason. You don't know what their reason is any2 more than I do. All you can say is that that might be3 their reason.4 GENERAL VERRILLI: And they ought to have5 the discretion to make that choice under this Court's6 case law. That's our position with respect to that.7 If I could make a point that I think is an8 important point about the free rider rationale under9 Abood. There's been some suggestion that the point of10 the free rider rationale is to ­­ is to force the11 dissenters ­­ the nonunion members to pay up.12 I don't think that's the right way to13 understand the free rider point. That, once the State14 has imposed a duty of fair representation, then15 everybody's got an incentive to free ride, whether16 you're a union supporter or not, because, by operation17 of law, you're going to get the benefits.18 It's just a classic logic of collective19 action problem, and so the ­­ the fair share requirement20 really is content neutral, in that it's ­­ it's designed21 to ensure that the union has the funds it needs to carry22 out the responsibilities that the State wants it to23 carry out and that that could be jeopardized by24 supporters, as well as dissidents, deciding that they ­­25 that they don't want to pay because they don't have to55￼1 because the law would get them the benefit of the duty2 of fair representation even if they didn't.3 Now, with respect to the question of ­­ of4 whether Abood should be overruled, I would suggest to5 the Court that it's got a very powerful stare decisis6 effect behind it. Abood's not exactly an outlier. It7 was reaffirmed in Lehnert, in Ellis. It was reaffirmed8 just in 2009, unanimously, in the Locke case.9 As Justice Breyer indicated, there is very10 substantial reliance and contractual reliance throughout11 the country on the constitutionality of Abood.12 And as I ­­ I said, I think the most13 important point here is that the line the Court drew in14 Abood and the line that has stood for 40 years is15 entirely consistent with the Court's First Amendment16 jurisprudence in the context of government as employer,17 not as regulator of sovereign.18 Of course, if the government was acting as19 sovereign regulating the citizenry, an obligation of20 this kind would trigger the most exacting scrutiny.21 JUSTICE ALITO: Is it true that, from ­­22 from the beginning, there have been members of this23 Court who have questioned whether there is any principle24 basis for distinguishing between the chargeable and the25 nonchargeable expenses and also have questioned whether561 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425as a practical matter that can be done?      Justice Marshall made that argument, did henot.GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, certainly, thatquestion has been raised.  But those questions wereactually all raised before ­­ may I please ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Please finish your thought.GENERAL VERRILLI: ­­ before it was reaffirmed in Lehnert, before it was reaffirmed in Ellis and before it was reaffirmed unanimously in Locke.Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General. Mr. Messenger, you have four minutesremaining.    REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM L. MESSENGERON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSJUSTICE BREYER: I suspect you're going toanswer my question, so I want to focus it ­­ and I'msorry to do this, but I think it's important.All right. I suspect you cannot answer my question about reliance without accepting one of the following three propositions: First, unlike every other employee, government employees have no right to organize.57￼￼1 Or, second, they have a right to organize,2 but they cannot bargain about wages, working conditions3 and hours, unlike any other, that's the same as the4 first.5 Or, third, the courts of the United States6 are going to fashion, using the First Amendment as their7 weapon, a new special labor law for government8 employees. And I'd remind you we have some experience9 on that in the 1930s, where courts tried to do something10 analogous.11 All right. Now, answer my question about12 reliance.13 MR. MESSENGER: I believe there ­­ the14 reliance interests here are insignificant if Abood is15 overruled because the result will simply be that16 employees cannot be forced to support union17 representation. The State ­­18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why would anybody join19 a union under those circumstances or pay enough to20 support the union efforts?21 MR. MESSENGER: Because the union, first,22 would control their terms of their economic conditions23 of employment and have control of their relations with24 their employer, which creates a strong incentive for an25 employee to want to be on good terms with that union.58MR. MESSENGER:Well, two points.  First,￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      And also, usually, the union gains employerassistance with becoming an exclusive ­­ or withretaining membership, such as access to facilities ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: But ­­ but it's only people who ­­ who disagree with the ­­ what the union's doing who could refuse to pay, you say? Right?MR. MESSENGER: Yes. I mean, anyone who voluntarily ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Why can't people who ­­ who agree with the union just say, hey, I don't ­­ I don't have to pay, the union is going to do this stuff anyway, I'm going to ride for free, these other people are riding for free?MR. MESSENGER: People could have different motives, but I submit that the union has ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there any ­­ is there any way to decide who's doing it just to save money and who's doing it on principle?MR. MESSENGER: Not that I'm aware of.JUSTICE SCALIA: So ­­ so you're essentially destroying not just the ­­ not just the ­­ the ­­ closed shop, but you're destroying the ability of the unionto ­­ to get money even from the people who don't agree with what it's doing.59￼1 exclusive representation, I submit, is not an impediment2 to gaining membership. It helps the union gain3 voluntary support for it. It's much easier for a union4 to ask people to support it, if it has power over their5 terms of employment.6 So the free rider problem with an exclusive7 representative is actually less than it would be if the8 union was a voluntary organization, not as ­­ it doesn't9 make it worse. I mean, there's a reason that unions10 seek exclusive representation in the Federal government,11 in the Postal Service, and the nation's 24 right­to­work12 States because it's ­­13 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Messenger, do you doubt14 that these ­­ you said that there were no reliance15 interests, and ­­ and that's curious to me. There must16 be thousands and thousands of contracts across the17 United States with fair share provisions.18 Do you doubt that these were core central19 provisions in the making of these contracts; that if20 these kinds of provisions were prohibited, the ­­ the21 agreements would look fundamentally different in many22 ways?23 MR. MESSENGER: The main difference is just24 the compulsory unionism clause in the agreement would be25 gone. But otherwise, the agreements would be the same.601 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE KAGAN: You think that the union would ­­ would not ask for anything, would not have different ­­ you know, would not ask for different mechanisms in order to support its own activity?      The unions go into these contracts with theunderstanding that this is what's going to enable themto at once satisfy their universal obligation toemployees to fairly represent them and, also, get thefunds they need for administrative and other expenses.MR. MESSENGER: I would submit that, with compelled fees off the table, the union would actually have more leverage to get things for employees because the compelled fees clause is leveraged for the employer because that's something the employer ­­ or the union wants and that the employer doesn't care if it gives it away because, ultimately, that's money out of somebody else's pocket.JUSTICE KAGAN: So you think that if we just strike these provisions, in other words, the ­­ the contracts would have been negotiated in exactly the same way, nothing else would have changed?      MR. MESSENGER:Justice.      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:      MR. MESSENGER:61If I may finish, Chief        Please.I believe that they probably￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425would be very much the same.  To the extent they'd bedifferent, they'd be more in the favor of employees,because the employer wouldn't have that leverage overthe union with respect to its demand for compulsoryfees.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
