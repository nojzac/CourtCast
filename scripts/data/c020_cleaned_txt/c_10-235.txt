McBride. Mr. Rothfeld.ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:In this case we find ourselves in the happy situation of having to try to convince the Court that its prior decisions were correct. Just 5 years after the enactment of FELA, the Court declared that it was obvious that the statute contained a proximate cause requirement. The Court went on to repeat that conclusion over and over again in almost two dozen decisions over the next 40 years. Our submission this morning is that the Court when it made these statements got it right.JUSTICE KENNEDY: How did it happen that in FELA we have proximate cause light? It's just adifferent proximate cause than we see in other -- in other torts cases. How -- how did that come about?MR. ROTHFELD: Well, we -- we -- our3 - Subject to Final Review￼ - Subject to Final Review1 submission is that that is not correct, that that is not2 what FELA provides for at all. And in the Court's3 initial decisions, the ones that I referred to, it4 stated very clearly that the ordinary proximate cause5 rule applies. The -- the proximate cause test that the6 Court stated in cases like Brady was the traditional7 proximate cause standard.8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you read the cases as9 indicating that more deference is given to juries in10 FELA cases than in other cases?11 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, that -- that's -- is a12 separate one from the one we have here. I mean, we are13 talking here about the nature of the -- the elements of14 the cause of action that have to be demonstrated by -­15 by the plaintiff; and so there -- the question of how16 much of that evidence there has to be to get to the jury17 is a separate question that's not presented here.18 Our submission, since you posed the19 question, is that there is no different standard; that20 FELA was not intended to depart from the ordinary common21 law procedural approaches in that respect, either.22 But on the question that's presented -­23 JUSTICE SCALIA: But juries usually find24 against railroads anyway, right?25 MR. ROTHFELD: I -- I wouldn't want to4￼ - Subject to Final Review1 commit myself to answering that question affirmatively,2 Your Honor.3 The Court has said that -- that FELA was4 enacted to address particular problems in the5 administration of the common law prior to 1908.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It also said that there's7 a relaxed standard of causation. I think that's what8 Justice Kennedy is referring to when he said "proximate9 cause light." But we have said in more than one case10 that there is a relaxed standard of causation in FELA11 cases. Was that wrong?12 MR. ROTHFELD: I think there are two ways to13 respond to that, Justice Ginsburg. The first is that up14 until the Rogers decision, which is -- which is one of15 the ones which has created I think some confusion in16 this area, the Court was quite clear and unambiguous17 that proximate cause in FELA applied in the ordinary18 sense.19 As I say, in cases like the Brady case the20 Court stated what proximate cause means; it stated in -­21 in entirely traditional terms that -- that the plaintiff22 had to demonstrate that the injury followed in a23 natural, probable foreseeable way from the wrongful24 conduct, and so that -- that was the standard.25 The Rogers case, which was the source of5￼ - Subject to Final Review1 some of the confusion in this area, in our view, as -­2 as we think Justice Souter correctly demonstrated in his3 opinion in Sorrell, and as we explain at some length in4 our brief, Rogers we think did not address causation at5 all. The Rogers case was a situation in which therewas what are a6 were a multiplicity of causes, and the question7 -- what should -- should the rule be when there8 number of -- of entities that contribute to the9 accident. It had nothing to do with remotenessor 10 directness of the cause, what we usually think about11 when we talk about proximate cause.12 In -- in the years since Rogers was decided,13 when the Court -- got out of the business of deciding14 FELA cases on the facts, it had not had occasion on -­15 in any case to address specifically what proximate cause16 meant in the FELA context.17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -­18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we have used that19 language. You -- you have not responded to -- to the20 question where -- where did this language that does21 appear in our -- in our cases about the relaxed22 standard, where -- where does that come from?23 MR. ROTHFELD: That -- that comes from, W24 submit, from sort of a loose description of what was25 going on in the Rogers case, which involved a6￼ - Subject to Final Review1 multiplicity of causes rather than directness and2 remoteness of causes, and so the cases in which that3 language appears, which are the Crane case and the4 Gottshall case, did not involve causation at all. The5 question of causation was not presented to the Court in6 those cases.7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It has nothing to do with8 the line of cases I think in the '40s in the FELA cases9 where the message of this Court seemed to be quite10 clear, FELA cases go to juries? There are a number of11 cases with reverse dissents that seem to -- to say just12 that.13 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, that -- that goes to14 the question that Justice Kennedy raised at the outset,15 which is how much evidence, whatever the standard of16 causation is, how much evidence must there be to go to17 the jury? And our presentation here is that FELA did18 not change the ordinary standard on -- on that question.19 But that -- but that is not the question that's20 presented in this case.21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what -- can you22 explain to me -- I mean, here the judge charged in the23 words of the statute, and they are also the words used24 in the model Federal instruction: Did plaintiff's25 injury result in whole or in part from the railroad's7￼ - Subject to Final Review1 negligence?2 You would say: Was plaintiff's injury3 proximately caused. And as you no doubt know,4 Mr. Rothfeld, that term "proximate cause," it just5 juries. So considering that these cases go to the6 what do you say to the instruction that's now given,7 based on the words of the statute, "Did plaintiff's8 injury result in whole or part from the railroad's9 negligence"? What should the judge charge instead of10 that?11 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think there are -­12 there are two parts to your question, Justice Ginsburg.13 One -- one is, what's wrong with the instruction that14 was given here; and the other is can juries understand15 proximate cause as a concept.16 On -- on the first point, we have no17 objection to the instruction containing the language of18 the statute. The problem is that to be comprehensible19 and intelligently applied by jurors, it has to say more20 than that. Proximate cause we submit is an element of21 the cause of action and that has to be explained to a22 jury. It couldn't be the case in a Sherman Act case,23 for example, that a judge could simply charge the jury:24 You are to determine whether there has been an25 unreasonable restraint of trade; now go to the jury room8loses jury,￼ - Subject to Final Review1 and answer that question. There is a lot more that has2 to go into that cause of action, including, as it3 happens, proximate cause.4 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Rothfeld, could you5 explain to me how it would have made a difference in6 this case, that instruction?7 MR. ROTHFELD: It -- it would have made a8 difference I guess in two respects. One is that the9 plaintiff's theory has never at any point been that10 there was proximate cause in this case. He did not11 contend that there was before the -- the district court12 and he does not contend in his brief before this Court13 that there was proximate cause made out. And so -­14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, maybe explain the15 difference. I mean, you were answering my question, and16 I asked how would you tell the jury? You said it's okay17 to say: Did plaintiff's injury result in whole or in18 part from the railroad's negligence, but the judge must19 say something more. So what is the something more?20 MR. ROTHFELD: The something more is what21 this Court said in its Brady decision, in which it22 described -- the decision in Brady, which is cited and23 discussed in our opening brief in -- in some detail.24 Brady described what proximate cause means in the FELA25 context; and it means, the Court said, that there must9￼ - Subject to Final Review1 be a demonstration that the plaintiff's injury resulted2 from the wrongful conduct in a way that was natural,3 probable, and foreseeable. That -- that was a4 traditional statement, is still today a traditional5 statement of proximate cause.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Natural, probable, and7 foreseeable?8 MR. ROTHFELD: And foreseeable. That -­9 that language was taken in the Brady case directly from10 the Court's decision, 1876 decision in the Kellogg11 decision, which we also cite in our brief, which states12 -­13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell me -- there14 is an article that suggests that juries don't actually15 understand what "proximate cause" means; and I think,16 and Justice Ginsburg can correct me, that what does that17 mean to a jury -- natural, probable, and foreseeable?18 MR. ROTHFELD: Well -­19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are the three phrases20 different? And how much more detail do you have to get21 in to describe that difference in a comprehensible way?￼2223 second part24 distracted,25 of the criticism of proximate cause as being confusionMR. ROTHFELD: Well, that -- that was the of Justice Ginsburg's question, and I got and I'm happy to address it. I think most10 - Subject to Final Review1 to the jury has actually been directed at the word2 "proximate," that commentators and some courts have said3 that's a confusing word, it suggests immediacy, it4 suggests closeness in time, it sounds like5 "approximate," and so juries find it confusing.6 But there is -- once it's spelled out, I7 mean, the fact is juries have been applying proximate8 cause, which has been a fundamental, settled, universal,9 universally accepted part of common law of torts, in the10 medicine context in particular, and it has been settled11 for 150 years.12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Apparently only FELA juries13 cannot understand it; all other juries find it okay.14 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- it is our15 submission that FELA juries would have no more16 difficulty applying it than do juries under the Sherman17 Act or RICO or the securities laws or, the other18 statutes that this Court has said include a proximate19 cause requirement, or that juries apply every day in20 courts across the country in court cases.21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I just don't -- and22 maybe this has already been asked, but I'm not sure from23 a juror's perspective that it makes terribly much24 difference the exact formulation of this instruction. I25 think a juror who sees an employee is suing the11￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425railroad, and it turns out that what the railroad did had very little or nothing to do with what happened to the employee, they don't need an instruction about natural, foreseeable causes. They're just not going to give the awards, or they're going to give the awards even though the railroad didn't do anything that affected the employee.It's a -- it's a nuance that I just don't think has any practical significance.MR. ROTHFELD: Well, we have to assume that juries follow jury instructions. That's the fundamental premise of the system, and there is no reason to doubt that in the ordinary case, in which the contents of proximate cause are -- are explained to the jury in an intelligent -- in a way that -- that people can comprehend.JUSTICE SCALIA: Your client is entitled to have the jury disregard a proper instruction, right? That's what you're arguing?MR. ROTHFELD: If the -- if the jury -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Juries disregard instructions on probable cause, on proximate cause. They probably do it in non-FELA cases, too.MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- I -­JUSTICE SCALIA: But you're entitled to have12 - Subject to Final Review￼ - Subject to Final Review1 them disregard the correct instruction rather than an2 incorrect instruction, right?3 MR. ROTHFELD: I will endorse that.4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My point is that I5 don't see much practical difference between what you6 argue is the correct instruction and what your friend7 argues is the correct instruction.8 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, certainly, in terms -­9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, law10 students, professors, and some judges have had trouble11 defining the concept of proximate cause for centuries.12 I don't know why we expect a juror to be able to13 navigate through those nuances, either.14 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- the -- the15 principle of proximate cause, the idea that there has to16 be some limitation beyond but-for causation on17 liability, has been universally recognized. Recognized18 by -- by courts, by this Court, by commentators, by the19 Restatement. The Third Restatement, just published,20 clearly endorsed it. They use -- they quibble about the21 terminology, but they clearly endorsed the absolute22 necessity of a proximate cause limitation on liability.23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think that over the24 last few decades, there's been an increasing emphasis on25 foreseeability as a component of proximate cause?13￼ - Subject to Final Review1 MR. ROTHFELD: There -- there probably has2 been. I mean, I'll defer again to the Third3 Restatement, which has a very useful summary of the4 course of the law in this area. And the principal tests5 that are now being used by courts are foreseeability and6 directness, which are closely related, I think. I mean,7 clearly, as this Court stated just this month in the8 Stout case, it stated a test of proximate cause in terms9 of whether -­10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you give some11 examples of what causes would be proximate and what12 causes would not so qualify? Something that's -- you13 said but-for is no good. So what would be a but-for14 cause but not a proximate cause?15 MR. ROTHFELD: A but-for cause in this16 context would be, there's a defective brake on -- on the17 locomotive and it comes to a sudden stop. If the18 conductor, standing in the locomotive when the train19 stops, is thrown to the floor and injured, clearly that20 is proximate cause. It -- it is -- it is an injury that21 is related to the risk that made the conduct actionable22 in the first place.23 The reason that having defective brakes is24 negligent and gives rise to a cause of action is because25 it can cause an accident that will cause people to fall,14￼ - Subject to Final Review1 cause the train to hit something, will cause derailment.2 That's why it is negligent, and if the kind of injury3 that follows from the accident is related to that risk,4 that clearly is proximate cause.5 The kind which is not would be, train stops6 because of the defective brake. No one is injured.7 Conductor gets off the train to walk along and see8 what's going on, trips and turns his leg, or is bitten9 by a snake.10 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Rothfeld, are there any11 cases like that in the FELA world? You know, I take it12 that this basic instruction that was given in this case13 is the instruction that's given in most cases. If you14 look across the range of cases, do you find jurors15 awarding damages in the kind of situation that you're16 talking about? In other words, is this a real-world17 problem?18 MR. ROTHFELD: They did in precisely the19 case I just described, a case called Richards from the20 Sixth Circuit, which is cited in the amicus brief21 submitted by the Association of American Railroads. The22 train stops because of a defective brake, the conductor23 gets off, walks along, turns his ankle and sues.24 Clearly, the risk of someone getting off the25 train and having a fortuitous injury is not the kind of15￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425risk that gave rise to the negligence. I mean, it's negligent to have a defective brake, but not because there's a bystander who might be bitten by a snake or turn -- turn his ankle.JUSTICE BREYER: Is there a case like that? MR. ROTHFELD: As I said, the Richards case. JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but I mean somebodymight think that having to go off and patrol a thing in a rough area is something that happens with a sudden stop: You run a risk of turning your leg.I agree with you about the snake. Is there any case about the snake?MR. ROTHFELD: I -- I can't cite you a snake case directly, but -­JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So the furthest -­ the furthest -- the furthest that you go is the case of sudden stop in the wilderness, gets off, rough area, and twists his ankle.MR. ROTHFELD: Or I'll -- I'll cite you -­JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know. Is that proximate cause or not? Maybe it isn't.MR. ROTHFELD: I'll give you two answers to that, Your Honor. First of all, there are other cases. Another case, for example, cited in the amicus brief that I referred to is the Schlumpert case from Georgia,16 - Subject to Final Review￼(Laughter.) - Subject to Final Review1 in which there's a defective coupling device lying on2 the ground. If it had -- if it had fallen off the train3 because it was defective and fallen on someone's foot,4 clearly that's proximate cause. But it's on the ground.5 The employee comes along, picks it up, throws off -­6 throws off his -- throws out his back, and sues. That7 is not the kind of -- of injury that one would foresee8 comes from having defective couplers.9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And do you want -­10 what instruction would you give that would tell the jury11 to allow damages in one of those -- the first of the12 coupling cases, but not in the second?13 MR. ROTHFELD: The instruction we ask for is14 the one this Court gave -- said should be given in the￼15 Brady case: Natural, foreseeable,16 not -­17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:18 sit there and say, one of those is19 and probable, but the other isn't?20 MR. ROTHFELD: I would21 itis-­22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:23 "natural" means. You know, so it's not a supernatural24 situation?2517and probable. It isAre jurors going to natural, foreseeable,-- I would say thatI don't know what - Subject to Final Review1 MR. ROTHFELD: Well -- well, I'm just2 quoting the Court's language to you, Your Honor. But -­3 but certainly, foreseeable and probable, one would say4 that -­5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not foreseeable6 that if you drop a coupling where it's not supposed to7 be, somebody will come along and try to pick it up and8 move it?9 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, but it's not10 foreseeable in the sense that it is unrelated to the11 risk that gave rise to -- to the cause of action in the12 first place. I mean, it's foreseeable in the sense that13 anything is foreseeable.14 If I give the classic example: I drive -- I15 drive you to New York, from Washington to New York, and16 I drive too fast, exceeding the speed limit. That's17 negligent. It's negligent because I run the risk, if I18 drive too fast, of hitting somebody, of hitting another19 car, of driving off the road. And so if I do that and20 you're injured as I drive you to New York, you can sue21 me.22 But that doesn't happen. I drive -- I get23 to New York safely, you get out of the car, and as soon24 as you get out, you are struck by lightning. It's a25 but-for cause of your being struck by lightning that I18￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425drove too fast. You wouldn't have been there when the lightning struck.JUSTICE BREYER: You could have been bitten by a snake when you're getting out of t car.(Laughter.)JUSTICE BREYER: But there has been no such case, to your knowledge?MR. ROTHFELD: Or -- or, more likely, you could have been hit -- hit by a car driving across Fifth Avenue too fast.JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Rothfeld, your instruction actually used the term "probable cause." Are you -- "proximate cause." Are you saying now that that's not necessary, that as long as you say "reasonable and foreseeable," you would be satisfied?MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think that it should include the term "proximate" simply because that has traditionally been the requirement. That's what this Court has said in cases like Brady. It's what the Court has said in cases applying other proximate cause -­ other elements of proximate causation in other circumstances. But it is the concept.I mean, as I said, "proximate" is a confusing word. That has been recognized sort of across the board. So it has to be spelled out and unpacked.19 - Subject to Final Review￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE KAGAN: So why use it at all? If you think that "reasonable" or "foreseeable" are less confusing words, why shouldn't we just tell the jury to use those words instead?MR. ROTHFELD: I -- again, I don't think that it is essential that it use the word "proximate" if it spells out what is meant by "proximate" in -- in -­ as-­JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the spelling out is natural, probable, and foreseeable?MR. ROTHFELD: Again, that is the term that this Court used in Brady, and that is -- is closely related -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Although your proposed instruction didn't use the word "foreseeable"?MR. ROTHFELD: It did not use the word "foreseeable." It used "natural and probable." Butwe -- we endorse, again, the test that this Court has stated in the FELA context very clearly in the Brady case. There are -- as has been noted in some of the questioning, there has been discussion between courts and commentators over the years about what the best way is to define proximate cause and explain it to the jury.I mean, in terms of the question posed by the Chief Justice, does it actually make any difference,20 - Subject to Final Review￼ - Subject to Final Review1 I think not only do we have to assume that it makes a2 difference, because juries are presumed to follow their3 instructions, but the kind of instruction that was given4 here was essentially a but-for instruction, that if you5 find that -- that in any respect, the injuries6 essentially7 misconduct,8 railroad -­9would not have occurred but for the for the -- for the negligence of theJUSTICE ALITO: Could you explain how it10 might have made a difference in this particular case11 based on the facts of the case? As I understand it,12 Mr. McBride's theory was that as a result of having to13 use the independent brake extensively over a long period14 of time with this wide-bodied cab, his hand got tired15 and it fell, and it hit the independent brake.16 Is that -- that's the theory?17 MR. ROTHFELD: Well -- that -- that -­18 that's his explanation of the accident. The theory of19 negligence, as I understand it, as it was presented to20 the jury by his expert was that the configuration of the21 train that he was driving was unsafe because it -- it22 could lead to derailments, it could lead to breaking of23 the couplers.24 As explained by his expert, the -- the25 theory was not that there was something unsafe about the21￼ - Subject to Final Review1 arrangement of the braking system, and so, I think that2 the -- the way in which a proximate cause instruction3 properly given here could have made a difference is that4 the jury could have found, well, yes, it was negligent5 to have these five locomotives arranged in the way that6 they were, but that had nothing to do, except in a but­7 for sense, with the fact that the -- the -- that8 Mr. McBride's hand was injured; that the jury could have9 made that determination and so it could have made a10 difference.11 Now, I mean, the fact is there was no12 proximate cause argument made below because the13 instruction that was given by the district court14 excluded it. And so, as I said before, the -- the15 theory of the case advanced by Mr. McBride below simply16 didn't take account of proximate cause.17 Now, if the -- if we prevail here and the18 case goes back, he will be free to argue under a proper19 instruction that there was proximate cause, that somehow20 the configuration of the train affected his -- his21 handling of the brake.22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're really suggesting23 that the defense attorney here wouldn't have argued the24 concept of proximate cause in saying the negligence had25 nothing to do with him just deciding to hit the brake?22￼ - Subject to Final Review1 MR. ROTHFELD: The -­2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- I -- I -- I -- it's3 farfetched, don't you think, that because the judge4 refused to give a proximate cause charge that the idea5 of it wasn't argued to the jury: What we did didn't6 cause this.7 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, there -- there is no8 question that what the railroad did caused in the but­9 for sense. Mr. McBride would not have been in the cab10 operating the brake system had it -- had it not been for11 the configuration of the -- of the locomotives. And, so12 if we assume that the configuration of the locomotives13 was negligent, then but for the negligence of -- of the14 railroad, this would not have occurred. And that in15 fact is -- is the terms in which the case was argued to16 the jury by Mr. McBride's lawyer, who said, in so many17 words: But for the negligence of the railroad, this18 would not have occurred.19 JUSTICE SCALIA: So the -- but the question20 is, what was your argument? What was your side's21 argument? Did you argue, in effect, proximate cause?22 MR. ROTHFELD: Our side argued that there23 was no negligence at all, that -- that -- that the24 configuration of the railroad was perfectly proper, and25 that -- the -- the -- there was a contributory23￼ - Subject to Final Review1 negligence component to what was going on here. In2 fact, the jury found that Mr. McBride was contributorily3 negligent in part, and that was part of the -- of the4 defense presentation, too.5 But just two or three -- to take a step back6 to first principles, on the assumption that proximate7 cause -- that there is a difference between instructing8 the jury on proximate cause and not, because the court9 -- it has been a part of tort law, you know, for time10 immemorial on the assumption that it does make a11 difference and it has been an important part of tort law12 because it has been universally recognized by courts, by13 academics, by the Respondent that there has to be some14 limitation on liability beyond but-for causation. If15 there is not, there is the danger of sort of infinite16 liability, of limitless liability, and particularly of17 fortuitous liability, because there is no way that the18 defendant in a situation like this can anticipate that19 it's going to be held liable for this kind of injury.20 So proximate cause has been regarded as an21 essential component of the tort law. And that being so,22 FELA creates a Federal cause of action for negligence,23 it creates a Federal tort. It -- a fundamental24 principle of statutory interpretation, this Court has25 applied many times, most recently just this month in the24￼ - Subject to Final Review1 Staub case, that when Congress creates a Federal tort,2 it means to adopt the general background of tort law,3 and Congress -­4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there any -- any5 negligence-type statutes? I mean this one, I mean, it's6 odd to say that the judge erred in reading to the jury7 the words of the statute, did plaintiff's injury result8 in whole or in part from railroad negligence. All that9 Federal statutes, negligence statutes that use the word10 "proximate" -­11 MR. ROTHFELD: There are -- there are12 Federal statutes that use the word "proximate." I don't13 know that there are any negligence statutes. So far as14 I understand from our review of the law, at the time15 that Congress enacted FELA in 1908, there -- there were16 no such statutes that made use of the term "proximate."17 And the presumption then, as now, is that18 when Congress creates what amounted to a Federal tort,19 the assumption is that it intends to adopt a background20 of tort law. That was true in the Sherman Act, it was21 true in RICO, it was true in securities laws, it was22 true just as earlier this month in the Staub case, a23 statute which did not use the term "proximate."24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you said your defense25 at trial was not about causation, it was no negligence,25￼ - Subject to Final Review1 right?2 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, that's -- that's right.3 Given the instruction that the jury received, which does4 not -- did not include a proximate cause requirement,5 and given that if one assumes that there was negligence,6 there is no doubt that the -- that the injury here was7 the but-for product of that negligence, there sort of8 was no room for negligence to be argued to the jury on9 the defense side. I mean, for proximate -- for -­10 for -- for causation to be argued on the defense side.11 JUSTICE ALITO: Assume you could talk to the12 jury and the jury says to you: We found negligence, so13 we don't want to hear about that; and we've found but­14 for causation and we don't want to hear about that; now,15 explain to us why there isn't proximate cause here?16 What more -- what -- what would you say?17 MR. ROTHFELD: In -- in this case we would18 say the negligence that is being presented to you and19 that you have presumably found is that the configuration20 of these locomotives was dangerous because it could lead21 to derailment, it could lead to breaking of the couplers22 between the cars. That is the negligence. And23 proximate cause, properly understood, means that the24 injury on which the plaintiff is suing has to follow in25 a probable, natural, foreseeable way from that -- that26￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425negligence.JUSTICE KAGAN: But wasn't the theory different, Mr. Rothfeld? Wasn't the theory that the configuration of the train made the braking and the switching much more difficult for the person in this position?MR. ROTHFELD: Well, if I may, I'll answer that and then sit down.That, as I say, was not the theory that was presented by the plaintiff's expert. To the extent that that is -- is a viable theory, it could be presented on remand. The argument can be made. I think it's a difficult argument, but -- but it was not presented to the jury here because there was no proximate cause instruction, so there was no opportunity for the question to be -- be -- be vetted.And with that, thank you, Your Honor.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Frederick.ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:This case is a case that presents a non-existent problem and a solution that is in search of27 - Subject to Final Review￼ - Subject to Final Review1 a non-existent problem, because there are no real2 reported cases where there have been problems arising3 under the Rogers instructions that have become the model4 instructions under the Federal Rules for over 50 years.5 And if could I just begin, Justice Kennedy,6 with your question which opened this up, proximate cause7 serves two principal functions. One is to limit the8 scope of the persons to whom the tortfeasor owes a duty;9 and the second is to limit the kinds of injuries that10 that person would be liable for.11 The innovation in FELA that is so important12 to understand about why the relaxed causation standard13 became the accepted standard under FELA was that FELA,14 by its plain terms, did away with the first concept of15 proximate cause because it limited the duty to the16 employee by the employer. There is no one outside of17 that relationship that can bring an action under FELA.18 And the second thing that it did was it put19 into what is now section 51 that if the negligence20 results in, quote, "in whole or in part" from the21 negligence of the railroad, that is enough for injury.22 At common law the proximate cause standard required that23 the railroad's negligence be the sole cause. So the24 innovation that created the relaxation in the causation25 standard was the inclusion of these words in part, and28￼16 last cause, 1718 part" apply19 negligence?20 language?21substantial factor -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Why doesn't "in whole or in to the elimination of contributoryIsn't that an adequate explanation for the - Subject to Final Review1 so over time -­2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, the other side3 says that what that meant, and -- and -- and the4 language of our cases seems to support that, "in whole5 or in part" simply eliminated the common law doctrine of6 contributory negligence, whereby if the plaintiff also7 had been negligent, the plaintiff could not recover,8 and -- and FELA uses a -- a -- a comparative negligence9 standard.10 MR. FREDERICK: And this Court has rejected11 that kind of approach almost from the beginning of the12 statute. In Campbell in 1916, the Court asked whether13 FELA has completely eliminated the idea of proximate14 cause. The Court has eliminated and the plain language15 precludes the sole cause, immediate cause, direct cause,￼MR. FREDERICK: It's -- it's not one that's 22 consistent with the Court's cases. And let me point you23 back to the day Rogers was decided. If we accept for24 purposes of argument -- and I'm only accepting it for25 these purposes -- that Rogers was only about multiple291 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425causes, on the very same day it decided two other cases that arguably were only about single causes. It decided a case under the Jones Act, the Ferguson case, and it decided another case under FELA, the Webb case. In both of those cases, there were no multiple causes, there was no contributory negligence; but what the Court said was that on today we are announcing this standard, we apply that standard to overturn directed verdicts where juries had come to the conclusion that the railroad's negligence had played a part, even a slight one, in producing the injury sustained by the worker.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think that the phrase in the statute "in whole or in part" allows juries to impose liability based on but-for causation?MR. FREDERICK: No. The -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why -- why not?MR. FREDERICK: As this Court put a gloss onthat language in Rogers, it -- it construed those words to mean that the railroad's negligence has to be found to have played a role, however slight, in producing the injury.

FREDERICK: No. JUSTICE SCALIA: Why not?30 - Subject to Final Review￼ - Subject to Final Review1 MR. FREDERICK: Because the railroad's2 negligence there -­3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Once you abandon a4 proximate cause requirement, however you want to define5 that, I don't see why the snake isn't covered, or the6 lightning on 42nd Street.7 MR. FREDERICK: Because there the railroad's8 negligence played no part in producing the jury. It's9 the producing aspect that provides a little bit more -­10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure it did. The train11 wouldn't have stopped, the conductor wouldn't have12 gotten off, he wouldn't have been bitten by the snake.13 If the -- if the car had not traveled to New York over14 the speed limit, the -- the passenger wouldn't have been15 on 42nd Street when the lightning struck. I mean, how16 can you say it didn't play a part? Of course it played17 a part.18 MR. FREDERICK: It was certainly an element19 of the existence of the condition. But what the Court's20 cases, Justice Scalia, after Rogers have done, and I21 think this is an important part of the history, is that22 there are a couple of outlier cases, to be sure. Courts23 have corrected them all by saying that the judge -- that24 the jury could not have reasonably found based on common25 experience that this snake bite or what have you was31￼5 producing, and in the snake case6 matter. It's simply the timing,7 that's how I read it.8the negligence doesn't et cetera. And is -­MR. FREDERICK: Yes.JUSTICE BREYER: Andread it. I'm not sure; you know.

How can you say the - Subject to Final Review1 proximately related to -- played a part.2 JUSTICE BREYER: As I read the statute -- as3 I read the statute, it insists, as interpreted in4 Rogers, that the negligence has to play a part in910 courts have11 suspect from the answers I've gotten so far there's12 never been a court that read it differently.1920 train would21 negligence didn't play a part? Had the train not22 stopped, he wouldn't have been walking along and been23 bitten by the snake.24 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Scalia -­25 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean do words mean32I guess that's how￼ - Subject to Final Review1 anything? How can you possibly say that negligence2 didn't play a part? It obviously did. It seems to me3 you're arguing for -- not the nonexistence of proximate4 cause. Nobody in his right mind could argue for the5 nonexistence of proximate cause. You are arguing for6 some different -- different definition of proximate7 cause, and I would like to know what that -- what that8 new definition is, as opposed to the definition that Mr.9 Rothfeld proposed.10 MR. FREDERICK: Well, let me start with this11 by saying that the Court and the language of the statute12 have already eliminate six possibilities for proximate13 cause; and the question now is whether there's something14 additive to the words that Mr. Rothfeld now proposes for15 the first time, because this was not language that they16 proposed in their proffered jury instruction, which can17 be found in the red brief at page 11. There they18 followed the Illinois proposed instruction which says19 "natural or probable sequence." That language does not20 appear in Brady. In Brady, a 1943 case from this Court,21 the words are used "natural and probable consequence," a22 consequence, of course, being a result, a sequence being￼23 an order of 2425 "probable,"events.Now, their instruction rests on the word which of course in common understanding and33 - Subject to Final Review1 most juries would commonly understand, "probable" means2 more likely than not, which is directly in contention3 with the statutory words "in part," and directly4 contrary to the way courts had universally understood5 this language since Rogers.6 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know if they said7 this, but I mean, as I read it, I thought the reason8 that negligence doesn't play a part is the act which was9 negligent played a part, of course; it was "but for";10 but the fact that it is negligent is totally irrelevant,11 because it's not within the risk in any sense12 whatsoever.13 Now as I -- you know the area. I don't put14 -- don't just agree with me because I'm saying it. Is15 that roughly the -­16 MR. FREDERICK: That is correct, Justice17 Breyer. And in the cases -- and there really are only a18 few cases where you can find these kind of outlier facts19 and these kind of, you know, "out there" situations, and20 one of the reasons is because FELA is only a21 compensatory damages statute. It only addresses the22 actual injury and the compensation for the worker.23 There are no punitive damages, there are no attorney's24 fees, there are no treble damages.25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're in the jury room34￼ - Subject to Final Review1 and a juror says: This wouldn't have happened but for2 the wide locomotive; therefore, there should be3 liability. What -- and assume the jury has all of the4 Federal reports in there and the judge lets them read.5 What -- what is there for another juror to say that this6 is wrong?7 MR. FREDERICK: The negligence theory here,8 Justice Kennedy, if I could go back to that, was not9 stated in a way that we would subscribe to by -- by Mr.10 Rothfeld. Our theory of negligence at trial was11 twofold.12 One was that these wide-boded locomotives13 were not appropriate for the switching exercise that the14 train men were doing on that day, and in fact the15 supervising engineer said this was the only time that he16 was aware in his long experience where these wide-body17 locomotives were used for this specific purpose which18 required a lot of braking activity.19 The second theory of negligence was that Mr.20 McBride was put to this purpose without proper training.21 He has complained on the day; he was uncomfortable and22 he didn't know whether he could operate that locomotive;23 and the jury was entitled reasonably to infer that that24 poor training was a -­25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How did any of those35￼ - Subject to Final Review1 things cause his injury?2 MR. FREDERICK: Because -­3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You've used the4 formulation negligence played a part in the injury. So5 how did those things play a part?6 MR. FREDERICK: His -- let's start with his7 poor training. There was testimony that a person who8 was more skilled in the art of dealing with a wide-boded9 locomotive would be able to manipulate the independent10 brake with the automatic brake in a way that would not11 cause the repetitive stress that Mr. McBride suffered.12 And there was further testimony that using a wide-body13 locomotive, which is more difficult to manipulate for14 the switching operations, and here we're talking about15 moving in and off main tracks to couple trains, train16 cars so that they can be used for a longer17 destination -- that that kind of equipment was not18 suited for the purpose.19 Mr. McBride's testimony was when he had used20 the wide-body locomotive, he had done so on long trips21 over long distances that didn't require the same kind of22 ready, manipulative braking of the independent brake.23 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you don't assert that24 that's a foreseeable consequence of the negligence of25 using a wide-body train?36￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR.

FREDERICK: WhatCourt -­JUSTICE SCALIA: I'mcase is because I can't believe you don't believe in proximate cause. I just think you're -- you're giving a different definition of it, and I'm trying to figure out what your definition of it is.MR. FREDERICK: My definition, what I think the Court did in Rogers was to try to end the debate over how confusing the word proximate cause is in these kind of cases by offering simple and direct instructions that juries could understand and apply, and that has been the case over the last 50 years.37say it doesn't have to didn't ask forso you -- you conceded I -- I would say this￼trying to see what your1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SCALIA: Do it. I'm still waiting to hear your instruction, which is supposedly something other than "but for." Is it just "but for"?MR. FREDERICK: I would take the words of Rogers. I think the jury here was properly instructed.JUSTICE SCALIA: With -- what are the words? Give me the words.MR. FREDERICK: The words are on page 10 of the red brief, Justice Scalia, and it follows the model form instruction that's used in all the Federal courts, "defendant caused or contributed to plaintiff's injury if defendant's negligence played a part no matter how small in bringing about the injury. The mere fact that an injury occurred does not necessarily mean that the injury was caused by negligence."JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't think that's "butfor"?MR. FREDERICK: Whether you think it's "but for" or not I think is beside the point.JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't care whether I think. We've got words here. What do those words mean?MR. FREDERICK: Those words mean that "but for" plus a relaxed form of legal cause associating the negligence in playing a part in produce the injury. That's how Rogers understood it.38 - Subject to Final Review￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SCALIA: Negligence is a given; the negligence is not what I'm asking about. I'm asking about causality, and what you have just read is "but for" cause.MR. FREDERICK: Well, I would disagree with that Justice Scalia, and I think the Rogers Court disagreed with that too, because after Rogers this Court upheld in Inman a case on a directed verdict where it concluded after the Rogers instructions had been used that nonetheless the negligence of the railroad had not played a part. That's a case involving a drunk driver who hit a flag man at the site of where the flag man was operating.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I -- can I go back a second and perhaps follow up Justice Scalia's question in a slightly different way? Do you believe a railroad can be held liable for a harm it could not reasonably foresee?MR. FREDERICK: Yes.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Now, perhaps, we can get to why, under what formulation, if it didn't know harm was going to happen or could happen.MR. FREDERICK: Well -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Reasonably foreseeable. MR. FREDERICK: Yes. I think that the39 - Subject to Final Review￼ - Subject to Final Review1 concept of foreseeability is one that has alternated in2 and out of this Court's cases, but let's take the case3 of Gallick in 1963, where a fetid pool with vermin and4 rats were allowed to live by the railroad's negligence,5 and it was believed that an insect was growing -- insect6 bodies were growing in that fetid pool, and as a result7 of that insect bite, the injured worker's legs had to be8 amputated by the effect of this insect bite.9 Now, many people would argue -- in fact, the10 lower court had concluded -- that it was not reasonably11 foreseeable that the railroad's negligence in allowing12 that stagnant pool to exist would nonetheless lead to13 the injury sustained by the worker.14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It might not be15 reasonably foreseeable that an amputation would occur,16 but it was reasonably foreseeable that some injury to17 people would happen as a result of these infected insect18 bites, no? That's what the court ultimately said.19 MR. FREDERICK: That's correct. But what20 the court had also done was to rely on earlier cases in21 which it's saying these concepts really are relaxed22 because the purpose of FELA is to provide a substitute,23 if you will, for workers' compensation, where if you can24 establish negligence on the part of the railroad and it25 causes, in part, the injury, the railroad will be liable40￼ - Subject to Final Review1 for that.2 And that's why this -- these concepts of3 proximate cause really are getting at a different4 problem, which is that when these statutes are enacted,5 you're trying to guard the defendant's liability against6 the entire world. And that's why it makes sense to7 impose some kind of restriction for foreseeability or8 for directness, because otherwise anybody could be9 liable to anybody else. Here, that problem is removed,10 because the railroad is the only -- can only be sued,11 under FELA, by the employee, and only if its negligence12 plays a role in producing that injury.13 If I could go back to the words that14 Mr. Rothfeld's trial counsel had proposed, the "probable15 sequence" word is now not even used anymore in Illinois.16 So it would be very odd to think that you would reverse17 an instruction here, where the proffered instruction by18 the railroad doesn't even State what -- the proximate19 cause instruction in the model language.20 Now the model language under Illinois calls21 for the natural and ordinary course of events. That's22 how proximate cause is now done under the Illinois23 proposed instructions. And it's hard to know how that24 language, Mr. Chief Justice, takes us any different from25 the common instruction that all juries are given, to use41￼ - Subject to Final Review1 their common experience and their common sense in2 evaluating the evidence. If what proximate cause now3 means under these types of standards is the ordinary4 course of events, all we're doing is asking juries to5 apply their common sense without introducing the word6 "proximate cause," which has been demonstrated to7 confuse juries because most of them, you know, many8 think that "proximate" means something like estimate9 or-­10 JUSTICE SCALIA: If the other side doesn't11 insist on that, the other side -- we'll give you that12 one.13 MR. FREDERICK: And we're delighted with14 that concession, Your Honor.15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, suppose a16 juror says, We wouldn't -- goes to the judge and says,17 We would like to have an explanation of, what does it18 mean that the injury results in whole or in part from19 the railroad's negligence? What would the judge20 respond?21 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Ginsburg, I'm not22 entirely sure how a trial judge would take a request for23 further clarification of this word's -- this Court's24 words that clarify the "resulting in whole or in part25 from." I'm not aware of any cases where anyone42￼ - Subject to Final Review1 challenged the use of the Rogers language on the ground2 that it wasn't simple and direct and therefore couldn't3 be understood.4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, this jury found it,5 though. What -- what would you tell the jury?6 MR. FREDERICK: I beg your pardon?7 JUSTICE SCALIA: This jury found it unclear8 and asks you. What would you say?9 MR. FREDERICK: I think -- and I've never10 served as a trial judge, but I think my -- my direction11 would be to go back and try again based on the words12 that are there, because the whole idea behind these13 words was to try to end the debate between this Court14 and many State courts that simply didn't grasp that FELA15 was intended to provide a remedial statute with a16 causation element that was a weaker causation element17 than in normal negligence cases. And so this Court was18 taking dozens of cases under FELA between the 1930's and19 the 1950's in which the Court was looking at directed20 verdicts by State supreme courts that were overturning21 jury verdicts. And the whole idea behind making this22 the language of what constitutes a jury case was to23 remove the appellate review process from a lot of these24 things and to leave these questions up to the common25 sense of the jury.43￼ - Subject to Final Review1 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what if the jury says,2 Well, does it mean that but for the negligence, the3 injury would not have occurred? Then what would the4 trial judge 56 question, I7 No, that's not correct, the words -- please focus on the8 words: The negligence playing a part, however small, in9 producing the injury. I mean, I'm not aware if juriessay?MR. FREDERICK: If the jury asked athink the judge would write back and say,10 get to this but for versus what is a relaxed -­11 JUSTICE SCALIA: You think that eliminates12 but-for cause, to tell them that negligence plays a13 part, no matter how small, in the injury?

Surely the burden is on the19 railroad to come up -- I would have thought that if they20 wanted to overturn the pattern instructions that have21 been used in nearly a half a million cases since Rogers22 was handed down, that they would have more than a case23 that they cite from one of their amici. I mean, they24 don't even cite the Richards case in their main briefs.25 And so surely -- you know, we're here to44MR. FREDERICK: No, Justice Scalia, ourthat it is but-for plus a relaxed form of that's been well-recognized in the cases and - Subject to Final Review1 debate these hypotheticals, I would2 don't have any relation to the real3 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose4 sufficient, is it necessary for the5 foreseeable? What does the trial judge say then?6 MR. FREDERICK: I think the trial judge7 says, No, it is not necessary for it to be foreseeable8 in a direct -- if the negligence plays a part, however9 small, in producing the injury.10 And that's why in cases like the Ferguson11 case, which was decided the same day as Rogers -- I12 mean, that's a very out-there set of facts, where the13 ship steward -- and remember, what you decide here also14 applies in the Jones Act for sea workers as well. But15 in that case, the Court said it was a jury question,16 whether the failure to provide an appropriate to17 implement to scoop hardened ice cream from the freezer18 on the ship was foreseeable, whether or not the ship's19 steward, in serving the ice cream, would reach for a20 butcher knife to try to chip away and lead to the21 severing of two of his fingers.22 I mean, we're talking about a dangerous23 situation, Justice Alito. At the time that FELA was24 enacted, in a year prior to that, some 12,000 people25 died and there were hundreds of thousands of injuries,45suppose, but they world.the jury asks, Is it injury to be￼25 1963 -­ - Subject to Final Review1 and the idea behind the statute was to provide a broad2 remedy so that rail workers could be compensated, not3 get extra damages like punitive damages, but just4 compensated for their injuries. And so the result is5 that railmen know they're going to have to go before6 juries exercising their common sense, and juries have,7 in many, many cases, ruled in favor of the railroads.8 And that system ought to be allowed to continue.9 If I could go back to one last point, and10 that is the idea of statutory stare decisis. We believe11 that because Rogers construed the "in whole or in part"12 language, it's entitled to statutory stare decisis where13 jury instructions have used that language.14 And at some level, this case is not too far15 from the Hylton case, which was decided in the early16 '90s, except the difference is in Hylton, the Court had17 dealt with a case from the early 1960s called Parden.18 And that case had had many of the underpinnings of -- of19 the question there that had been discredited or undercut20 by subsequent decisions.21 Here, there are no cases since Rogers that22 suggest doubt on the general validity of the Rogers23 rule. You have the cases that were decided in the24 immediate proximity of Rogers; you have Gallick in￼4612 which is no13 elimination14 the risk.15common law proximate cause and theof contributory negligence and assumption of - Subject to Final Review1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: We have three justices of2 this Court that say Rogers is irrelevant because it had3 to do only with multiple causes.4 MR. FREDERICK: And my answer to that,5 Justice Ginsburg, is that after Rogers, the Court6 applied the Rogers language to single cause cases. We7 have Webb, we have Ferguson, we have Kernan, we have8 Gallick, we have the statement in Crane that comparing9 the actions of the nonemployee, the -- the explanation10 for why the nonemployee has to go to common law is11 because there are these special features of FELA, one of￼And then subsequently when the Court in16 Ayers and then in Gottshall says very clearly these are17 ways that FELA has departed from the common law and from18 the other statutes, in Gottshall the Court was very19 clear that it is relaxed causation and that this is one20 of the departures from normal common law standards.21 would seem odd to hold now that all of a sudden we're22 going to talk about common law standards for causation23 where the Court over a series of decision over the last24 hundred years has knocked out six of the prevailing25 versions of proximate cause that were then in vogue.47It1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425That would be a very odd way to -- to rule.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Frederick, go backagain and tell me what a -- what a judge would say to a jury so he or she doesn't say but-for is not, not using those words, tell me in simple, plain language how a judge differentiates to a jury the difference between but-for and this causation. What would a judge say?MR. FREDERICK: Okay, I would start with the language in Rogers, and then I would say -­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The -- that negligence played a part in the injury?MR. FREDERICK: Right. In producing -­ producing the injury.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Producing the injury?MR. FREDERICK: That's correct. And that part of that played a part -- you know, rests on the common sense of whether or not a jury thinks that a particularly improbable set of -- of events is something that would be within the common experience of someone to view as -­JUSTICE SCALIA: It sounds like foreseeability you're talking.MR.

Which do you want?(Laughter.)MR.

And so I would stand on that basis, and I would further stand on the ground that this Court -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, at -- at -- at least that, it seems to me, is a jury question.MR. FREDERICK: That's right, Justice Kennedy, and the jury here applied the statute the way it was intended. It found fault with my client, and it found fault with the railroad and it apportioned damages accordingly.JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but -- but it was not instructed on foreseeability?MR.

FREDERICK: They defined proximate cause by saying natural or probable sequence, JusticeGinsburg. That's how proximate cause was defined in their words, and the way they defined it didn't include the word "foreseeability."JUSTICE SCALIA: That sounds like a good definition of foreseeable, doesn't it? It's natural and probable.MR. FREDERICK: Probable, though, doesn't -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Could something be natural and probable and not foreseeable?MR. FREDERICK: Justice Scalia, the word "probable" is more likely than not, which is thestronger standard, it's intention with the words "in part" in the statute. Result in part is not something that is more likely than not. For that reason, we believe the Court should adhere to the Rogers approach. It's worked, it's allowed juries to exercise their common sense without being confused by these elusive proximate cause formulations.50 - Subject to Final Review￼ - Subject to Final Review1 The other side has failed to identify a2 problem, and there's not the slightest reason to think3 that any alternative formulation would work any better.4 JUSTICE ALITO: Could I just ask you this5 factual question? Was it Mr. McBride's theory that his6 injury resulted from the repetitive use of the7 independent brake or was it that the -- as a result of8 the repetitive use his hand fell down and it hit the9 independent brake, and that was the cause of the injury?10 MR. FREDERICK: I think it's -- both11 theories were presented, and they were both based on the12 improper equipment that he was asked to use and his13 improper --14 are classic15 causation.1617 1819 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD20 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER21 MR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Your Honor, just a22 few quick points.

ROTHFELD: That is a different kind ofJUSTICE BREYER: It is not foreseeable. - Subject to Final ReviewMR. ROTHFELD: It has been -- the rule of common law from -­JUSTICE BREYER: You're just saying, it's all foreseeable, not foreseeable.MR. ROTHFELD: No. The question is whether or not the kind of -- the risk of -- that there would be an injury follows from the -- the nature of the misconduct that gives rise to liability in the first place, and it is -- common law has always recognized that if you're risking a particular kind of injury, that someone is going to be hit, you take your victim as your find them, and that is put -- put in a different basket of -- of doctrine altogether.So -- so first, again I -- there is no alternative to proximate cause, but "but for" cause; that's been universally recognized as an unacceptable basis for liability.Second, if I could return to our snake just for a moment. It has been recognized that the -- the nature of the protection that's provided by the tort law is related to the -- to the risk of injury that gives52￼ - Subject to Final Review1 rise to liability in the first place. If there -- the2 risk of injury is that a defective brake is going to3 lead to a derailment or an accident, injury that follows4 from that risk is compensable; injury that does not,5 like walking along and turning your leg or being bitten6 by a snake is in a different category, it's not7 predictable and foreseeable or natural in that sense.8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why not, if you know9 that there are snakes along this route, just like10 there's an infected vermin or insects or something else?11 I-­12 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, the question would be13 one for the jury if it's properly instructed. And in14 fact in the Gallick case, as I think Justice Sotomayor,15 you -- you have recognized, the Court said that that was16 foreseeable. And the jury -- the issue can be posed to17 the jury, the jury can determine whether it is a natural18 problem.19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it's not that it's a20 matter of law?21 MR. ROTHFELD: No. That -- that's right,22 that's right.23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: A matter of law, there24 was -- there could be no proximate cause. You're25 arguing that a jury should determine whether or not they53￼ - Subject to Final Review1 could anticipate somebody slipping on a slope?2 MR. ROTHFELD: That -- that's generally3 right. I mean, there will be circumstances, as the4 restatement says, that -- in which it's so clear that it5 is not a -- a probable, natural, foreseeable consequence6 of -- of the wrongful conduct, that it should not go to7 the jury. And -­8 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't -- isn't Mr. Frederick9 right in saying that asking whether something is10 probable is very different from asking whether it's11 foreseeable?12 MR. ROTHFELD: They -- clearly they are13 closely related. I mean the Court in Brady stated14 that -- that test, as natural, probable, foreseeable.15 If it is natural and probable, it is likely to be16 foreseeable. And -­17 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if it's probable it's18 foreseeable, but it can be foreseeable even though it's19 not probable.20 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, it -- but I think what21 probable means in this context it has to be foreseeable,22 not simply in the theoretical, I can foresee if I drive23 too fast in New York, maybe there will be a lightning24 strike -- I mean, I can imagine that. But it has to25 have -- pass a certain threshold to -­54￼ - Subject to Final Review1 JUSTICE SCALIA: If that's true, that -­2 everything that's natural and probable is foreseeable,3 but not everything that's foreseeable is natural and4 probable, you were requesting a jury instruction that5 didn't go as far to help you as was possible, but you6 were still requesting a jury instruction that was on the7 road.8 MR. ROTHFELD: That's -- to me the only9 question now here before this Court is whether we are10 entitled to a jury instruction that states properly the11 nature of the proximate cause test, and if the case goes12 back under that standard, then the arguments that have13 been suggested by Mr. Frederick can be presented to the14 jury. But -- but as you say, Justice Scalia, that's15 right; and to the extent that there was anything wrong16 with the instruction, we would provide it.17 JUSTICE SCALIA: This case go to the jury?18 MR. ROTHFELD: I think it would be open to19 argue that it's so clear that -- that there was no20 proximate cause that it shouldn't; but that's a question21 to be posed on remand.22 JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry, Mr. Rothfeld, I23 didn't understand what you just said, because the24 requested jury instruction that -- that you gave was any25 cause which in natural or probable sequence produced the55￼ - Subject to Final Review1 injury. Is that right?2 MR. ROTHFELD: That was the requested3 instruction.4 JUSTICE KAGAN: So that's essentially saying5 that the jury has to say it's 51 percent likely to6 produce the injury, isn't that right?7 MR. ROTHFELD: I -- it was not put in those8 terms. I -- I would not think -­9 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, it says natural or10 probable, and probable means more likely than not, which11 is 51 percent.12 MR. ROTHFELD: I -- again, it was not -­13 unpacking those terms, and I would say it does not have14 to be -- the answer is -- is no. The jury doesn't15 define that it is -- it is necessarily going to be the16 outcome, but it has to find that there is some17 substantial probability that it will be the outcome,18 before liability can attach, would be our -- our19 submission.20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.21 The case is submitted.22 MR.
