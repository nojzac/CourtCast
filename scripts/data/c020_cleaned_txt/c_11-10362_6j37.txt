UnitedStates.            Mr. Paolella.        ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. PAOLELLA,         FOR PETITIONER, APPOINTED BY THIS COURT            MR. PAOLELLA:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:            The plain language of Section 2680(h)'s is lawenforcement proviso waives sovereign immunity inclear, precise and unambiguous terms.  It extends thewaiver to any claim for one of the six enumerated tortscommitted by a Federal investigative or law enforcementofficer acting within the scope of his or heremployment.            And it defines investigative or lawenforcement officer as any officer of the United Stateswho is quote, "empowered by law," unquote, to carry outsearches, seizures or arrests.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Would that include, say,a meat -- a meat inspector?  There is a wide range ofFederal employees that have arrest or search orseizure -­3￼1 MR. PAOLELLA: The proviso doesn't say any2 employee of the United States who is authorized to carry3 out a search, seizure, or arrest. It used the term "any4 officer of the United States." And I believe that the5 term "officer" carries some water here. If we look at a6 spectrum of individuals who have powers -- for example,7 to carry out searches -- we can envision on the one hand8 very traditional core law enforcement officers.9 Let's take a DEA officer who can carry out10 arrests, do searches and seizures, is authorized to use11 force. At the other end of the spectrum, we have12 something like a meat inspector or an OSHA inspector,13 who may have a limited ability to carry out searches,14 but these are searches that are in really a law15 enforcement capacity -- an administrative capacity as16 opposed to a core law enforcement capacity.17 So the government raises the argument, and18 we think it's a plausible interpretation, that by using19 the term "officer" rather than any employee of the20 United States, that there was some limiting factor21 imported into the statute, thereby the statute's plain22 language.23 And I would trust my colleague from the24 Solicitor General's office to map the boundaries of25 that. I would say that in any case, a correctional4￼1 officer, who are the individuals who are involved here2 in committing the complained-of acts, certainly falls3 much closer4 than to the56 in the States and then in the Federal Government, is a7 correctional officer or prison guard usually deemed to8 be a peace officer? Do you know?to core law enforcement on that spectrum administrative side.JUSTICE KENNEDY: As a general matter, first9 MR. PAOLELLA: The -- yes. In many states10 that use the term "peace officer" in the statutes11 defining a peace officer for things -- for example,12 authorizing the use of force or authorizing the carriage13 of weapons -- many States -- it's not uniform, but many14 States include correctional officers within that ambit.15 The Federal Government typically does not16 use the term "peace officer" in its statutes, but if you17 look at Federal statutes that use the term "law18 enforcement officer," which is the very term that's used19 in subsection (h), many -- many of those other statutory20 schemes expressly include correctional officers. So,21 for example, for purposes of civil service pay, for22 purposes of death benefits, of retirement benefits.23 JUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't prove that24 they're officers. I mean, that's -- that's not the test25 for an officer, how much you're paid. The test is5￼1 whether you2 laws of the3 but I'm not4 significant5 States.exercise significant authority under theUnited States.  That's a pretty fuzzy line,sure that a prison guard exercisesauthority under the laws of the United6                 MR. PAOLELLA:  I would think in the context7 of the prison, it's hard to imagine how a prison guard8 could exercise any more authority than they do. In9 addition to their correctional function, prison10 correctional officers are essentially the police force11 for the prison.12 They are charged with maintaining order, and13 they're charged with enforcing the laws of the United14 States within the confines of the prison, and indeed in15 some specified cases, outside the prison walls. For16 example, they are explicitly authorized under Section17 3050 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code not just to carry out18 arrests in prison for violations of the Federal law, both by19 prisoners and visitors, but to carry out arrests outside20 the prison walls to prevent prisoner escapes or to21 prevent assaults on other law enforcement officers. So22 there's quite expressly an arrest authority granted to23 correctional officers. In addition, they have the power24 to search for contraband, both in the context of25 visitors to prison and prisoners themselves.6￼1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, you've argued2 something slightly different than I took from your3 briefs. Earlier, in response I think to4 Justice Ginsburg, you were queueing closer to the5 Solicitor General's position that this has to be limited6 in some way. And you said you'll let them establish the7 boundaries.8 boundaries.910 enforcement11 acting -- as the Ninth Circuit says -- acting within a12 law enforcement activity? Because I am finding it hard13 to figure out why we shouldn't permit tort liability on14 an OSHA inspector, who, in inspecting whatever he or she15 is inspecting punches someone or does some intentional16 assaultive act, why they should be permitted to do that.I don't want to let them establish theI want you to tell me, is it criminal lawagents, is it law enforcement agents with --￼17 Assuming it18 enforcement1920 begin answering that question by making a distinction21 which I think is an important distinction here, between22 the definition of status and the definition of thefalls within the definition of a law activity.MR. PAOLELLA: Justice Sotomayor, let me23 conduct that's implied here. Because I think this is a24 crucial difference between the amicus's argument on one25 hand and the Solicitor General's office on the other71 hand.2 The amicus would limit the type of conduct3 that's covered by the statute. They would limit it to4 actions that occur in a law enforcement capacity. So5 I'm not sure exactly what that means. I think that gets6 passed along with ---78 is arrests,9 was.1011 activities,12 topic --1314 broadly. Let's assume I was willing to define it to15 include all of the activities that a law enforcement16 agent would engage in, including protective services,17 security services, like your officers.18 MR. PAOLELLA: Yes, Your Honor.19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume that we've20 defined it more broadly. What's the problem with their21 position?2223 position is 2425 amicus's or8JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think they're saying search and seizure, and whatever the thirdMR. PAOLELLA: Or some other similar which, again, I'm not sure addresses theJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But let's define it more￼MR. PAOLELLA: The problem with their -- with the amicus --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And of -- yes, with the government's, meaning, instead of1 limiting it2 enforcement34 requirement5 statute. The statute is very precise.6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I will give you --7 I'll give you a textual basis. Why is it if all the8 statute is concerned about is the status of being a law9 enforcement -- investigative or law enforcementto criminal activity, limited to law activities broadly defined.MR. PAOLELLA: The problem with amicus's is it has no textual basis in the10 officer -- why is it that the exception it makes does11 not eliminate the exemption for libel, slander,12 misrepresentation, deceit or interference with contract13 rights?14 There is excepted from the provisions of the15 Tort Claims Act any claim arising out of assault,16 battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious17 prosecution, abusive process, libel, slander,18 misrepresentation, deceit or interference with contract19 rights.20 However, for -- for purposes of this21 exemption from the exemption -- the exception from the22 exemption, they leave out the latter part. Why did they23 only put in the others? I think the reason they only24 put in the others is that those are the kind of torts25 that would be conducted in the course of conducting a -­9￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425what's the words -- investigative or law enforcement activity.MR. PAOLELLA: Well, Your Honor --JUSTICE SCALIA: The others would not -- would not occur.MR. PAOLELLA: I think that that is a limiting factor that is not just implicit but explicit in the statutory text.JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but it's -- it's a limiting factor that -- that shows, that displays an intent to limit the -- the activities of investigative or law enforcement officers to those activities conducted in the course of investigating or enforcing the law.MR. PAOLELLA: Well, the fact that Congress was so explicit about categorizing precisely the kind of torts that are covered here -- that sort of conduct -- and the fact that Congress was so precise about cross-referencing Section 1346(b), which incorporates the scope of employment requirement, suggests to me that when Congress wanted to confine the capacity in which the acts occurred, it could do so, and it did in fact do so.JUSTICE GINSBURG: I understand -- JUSTICE SCALIA: Why would it leave out10￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425those other ones? That's what I'm asking you. What possible reason is there to leave out libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights?MR. PAOLELLA: That was a policy judgment that Congress made, that it would not --JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I didn't deny that it's the judgment. What reason could there be for that judgment?MR. PAOLELLA: That it didn't think that those sorts of torts in this context -- and I think we all agree this is a law enforcement-oriented provision. It's called the law enforcement proviso.JUSTICE SCALIA: I give you a reason.MR. PAOLELLA: Yes.JUSTICE SCALIA: The reason -- the reasonthey left it out is that they don't think those torts would be committed in the course of investigating or enforcing the law.MR. PAOLELLA: I think that's right, Your Honor, but that doesn't mean that from that we ought to draw an entirely extra-textual additional limitation that goes beyond the specific line that Congress did, in fact, draw here.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Your view is that the11￼1 limitation is scope of employment.2 MR. PAOLELLA: That's right.3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The scope of employment4 is, and you don't add on anything else to that. You5 don't add arrest, search and seizure.6 But does this whole issue have an academic7 flavor, because how in the world could the conduct8 involved in this case qualify as within the scope of9 employment?10 MR. PAOLELLA: First of all, Your Honor, I11 think that the question of scope of employment was12 something that was conceded below. It was never13 litigated. It was never briefed before the Respondents'14 brief. And from my reading of the question presented as15 this Court formulated it, it was excluded from the16 question presented. So I don't think this Court needs17 to address it. It's more properly addressed on remand18 if it's important.19 But here I think that there is an argument20 that's within the scope of employment. And if you look21 at cases, for example the Mary M. case out of the22 California Supreme Court, there the California Supreme23 Court held that a sexual assault by a law enforcement24 officer of an individual who was subject to that25 officer's authority could be held to be within the scope12￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425of employment, because an officer is vested with authority and it is reasonably foreseeable that that authority can sometimes be abused if it happens when the officer is in uniform, on job hours, dealing with someone who that individual is authorized to use appropriate force against.And even in Pennsylvania, you see cases where people do outrageous things, like a private detective shooting a picketing protester, where the Pennsylvania courts have held that that's within the scope of employment.It's a complicated issue. It's an issue of State law and it will be different in every State, which is why I would suggest it's more appropriate for this to be handled on remand rather than have a ruling by this Court on a narrow issue of Pennsylvania State law. But I think it is hardly implausible that Pennsylvania courts would find this within the scope of employment.Your Honor, if there's no further questions, I will reserve the remainder of my time.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yang.ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG,FOR RESPONDENT, SUPPORTING REVERSAL AND REMAND MR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice and may it13￼1 please the Court:2 The text and structure of the law3 enforcement proviso in the Federal Tort Claims Act more4 generally make clear that the proviso unambiguously5 waives sovereign immunity for claims arising under the6 six intentional torts listed for acts or omissions of7 persons qualifying as Federal law enforcement officers8 while acting within their scope of employment.9 Nothing in the statute supports amicus's10 additional limit, which would require such officers to11 be acting in a law enforcement capacity or by exercising12 law enforcement authority, neither of which phrase13 occurs within the statute itself. Quite the contrary --14 JUSTICE KAGAN: What are the kinds of15 things, Mr. Yang, that would be within the scope of16 employment, but would not be acting in a law17 enforcement capacity for a law enforcement officer?18 What's the difference between those two standards for a19 law enforcement officer?20 MR. YANG: Well, this is complicated by the21 fact that for the Federal Tort Claims Act, scope of22 employment is a question that turns on State law. As a23 result it will vary. Some States have a rather broad24 understanding of scope of employment and sometimes in25 fact will encompass within the scope of employment14￼1 rather egregious intentional torts. It's not2 necessarily what the Court might think of as within the3 scope of one's Federal law enforcement authority.4 So with respect to law enforcement5 authority, I mean, this -- that makes the question a6 little more difficult because that is not something that7 actually appears in the statute and it's not something8 that the United States embraces as a test because it is9 a creation of the amicus.10 What the statute here does, the only term --11 the only place that it uses law enforcement is12 defined term "investigative or law enforcement13 and then what it does in defining that term --14 JUSTICE KAGAN: But you can't give15 couple of examples of how the difference would16 you know, in some States, where something would be --17 would meet the scope of employment test, but not meet18 the acting as a law enforcement officer test, for a law19 enforcement officer again.20 MR. YANG: Again, acting as a law21 enforcement officer test is not something that appears22 in the statute and it's not something that even amicus23 has tried to meet the limitations of. It could mean24 various things. It could mean, for instance, something25 as limited as executing a search, seizing evidence or15in the officer"￼me just a matter,1 making an arrest. That would be the Pooler type of2 rationale.3 It could be something incident to that,4 writing a report, as amicus suggests. It could be other5 things. Law enforcement officers often aren't doing the6 very things that we're talking about. They go on7 patrol, they talk to kids in schools. There are all8 types of things that law enforcement officers might do9 that don't fall within what might thing -- what one10 might think of as what, you know, you see on television11 when officers are making contact with the public in12 rather high stakes incidents.13 So it's difficult both because we have a14 State law term that varies and a term that doesn't even15 appear in the statute and that we don't embrace. So16 again, it's difficult to provide examples in any17 definitive way because both of the comparators shift18 depending on what we're talking about.19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Yang, even if --20 if -- it depends on State law, that's clear. But does21 the United States sometimes concede scope of authority22 so it can represent -- it can be the sole defendant in23 the case, the individual officer is off the hook, so24 that the United States could make the argument: It25 never happened; the officer didn't do what the plaintiff16￼1 charged?2 MR. YANG: I believe, if I understand your3 question correctly, the answer is yes, but let me4 qualify that. This came up in a case called5 Osborne v. Haley. And the question about scope of6 employment for purposes of the Westfall Act turns on7 whether at the time of the alleged incident the officer,8 or employee in many cases, was acting within the scope9 of his or her employment.10 Now, when the11 this is authority that is12 General, which is in turn13 Attorney's offices, investigates the relevant14 circumstances and determines that the allegations are15 just false, not correct at all, in fact it never16 happened, the employee was sitting at his or her desk17 beavering away at important Federal matters, in that18 instance, the Government will say that the employee was19 in fact acting within the scope of his or her employment20 and can explain that the reason for that is the21 Government rejects the underlying factual assertion.22 That's something that then is litigated if23 the Plaintiff seeks to challenge the scope24 determination. And the Court's decision in Osborne25 explains that this is how the situation will play out,17United States investigates, delegated to the Attorney redelegated to the U.S.￼1 is that then the merits of the case ultimately condensed2 into a challenge to the scope certification of the3 Attorney General.4 So, no, we don't simply say they were within5 scope for no reason. We determine whether they were6 within scope by evaluating the circumstances at issue7 and if the alleged circumstances did not occur and the8 employee was acting within the scope properly, we will9 certify that the employee was acting within the scope.10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you go back and11 tell me, yet again -- you give a limiting principle, but12 I'm not sure how it applies. You seem to be saying --13 do you agree with your -- with the Petitioner that law￼14 enforcement 151617 have all of18 from those in the civil area who have similar powers to19 arrest, search and seize, to --officer includes correction officers?MR. YANG: It does.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And why? Because they those other powers, so how is that different20 MR. YANG: Well, I guess there are two21 elements to the definition of investigative or law22 enforcement officer within the statute. First, they23 have to be an officer of the United States. And the24 term "officer" when we are talking about Federal25 officers, the dictionary definition that most commonly181 and comfortably applies here, are ones that we're2 talking about like sheriffs, constables, bailiffs,3 people who have normal Federal criminal law enforcement4 -- well, not Federal but criminal law enforcement5 responsibilities.6 That -- you know, when you back out to the7 second criteria, we think that reinforces --8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How about Customs9 agents?10 MR. YANG: Customs agents? I don't know if11 they have criminal -- I believe if we assume that they12 are simply doing a civil function, Custom agents would13 not fall within the term "officer" as normally applied.14 Let me give you an example that the amicus15 raises, Federal forest employees -- Forest Service16 employees. Forest Service employees, the clerks that17 work in D.C. are not what one would normally think of as￼18 an officer,19 phrase "law2021 employees I22 the parks.232425 giving tours. They are usually doing sort of a mixture19particularly when we are talking about the enforcement officer."JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: My problem is park think of as officers when you meet them at They are guarding the parks.MR. YANG: Some, some --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or they may also be1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425of-- is--MR. YANG: Actually, I don't think thatJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- duties.MR. YANG: -- that's correct, Your Honor. The Forest Service, as other park -- the Park Service, has different roles for various individuals within their employ. And there are, in fact, law enforcement officers in the Park Service, and there are law enforcement officers in the Forest Service, and their duties are what one would traditionally think of as law enforcement.JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Yang, the United States didn't take this position below, right?MR. YANG: That is correct.JUSTICE SCALIA: This is a change of heart. How long ago was it that the United States took the opposite position, the position argued by amicus here?MR. YANG: Well, this is the Orsay position, which is not the Pooler position I believe the Court is talking about. Pooler, the Government has not taken the view that the Third Circuit was correct and Pooler, as far as I can tell, except within the Third Circuit, is binding precedent.Now, when we take a step back and abandon20￼1 Pooler's limited approach and apply a more amorphous law2 enforcement capacity, law enforcement authority, the3 Government has done that in a number of lower cases,4 including several courts of appeals --5 JUSTICE SCALIA: So it couldn't be that6 obvious, I guess?7 MR. YANG: Well, I think in those cases the8 Government took a position that never was a position9 that made it to the Solicitor General's office. And10 when we took this -- both in the Reynolds case when11 there was an adverse decision to the United States and12 in this case, we determined that the position was not13 one that could be -- was not correct under the text.14 And I think, as amicus's -- amicus does, I15 think, a valiant job of trying to defend that position,16 but at the end of the day, there simply is not a textual17 argument to get to that outcome.18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think it is true that19 there is a strong textual argument for your position.20 But let me ask this: Are there any studies or any21 statistics we can look at to see as a predictive matter22 how many prison suits against the government this ruling23 that you propose would -- would cause? It seems to me24 we have close to 200,000 Federal prisoners, I think, and25 this prison work, there is a lot of shoving, guards have21￼1 to break up fights.2 So there is going to be any number of3 instances where the question is did the guard overreach.4 And if I make the assumption, and it's just an5 assumption because I haven't looked at any statistics,6 but there is -- this is going to vastly expand the7 number of cases in which the Government is the8 defendant. Doesn't that bear on the likelihood of the9 congressional intent to adopt your position?10 MR. YANG: I guess there is a few parts to11 that question. On the statistics, I am not aware of any12 statistics that we would be able to reliably extrapolate13 to see what this would mean. I think there may well be14 some additional cases. However, there are other tools,15 as we explain in our reply brief, including the Prison16 Litigation Reform Act, which requires the prisoners both17 pay their filing fees and if they obtain three strikes,18 must in fact -- they lose IFP status and must pay that19 filing fee in advance, and it's a substantial amount of20 money for many prisoners, given what they earn.21 So we think that it's not a reason to ignore22 what we think is the plain text, particularly where23 Congress here has in the proviso specifically referenced24 Section 1346(b). Section 1346(b) makes clear that the25 waiver of sovereign immunity applies to acts or22￼1 omissions committed within the scope of employment.2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can you suggest why3 Congress might have left out libel, slander,4 misrepresentation?5 MR. YANG: Yes. I think --6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why would they leave7 that out if they are only looking at the office8 at the function that the person is performing?9 MR. YANG: Well, I think that thoseand not torts the10 serve as a rough approximation of what Congress11 anticipated would be the areas where it thought12 United States should be liable, when we are talking13 about Federal law enforcement officers. And I think in14 fact --15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. I mean, that's the16 point. So what you are saying is that it suggests that17 they mean Federal law enforcement officers engaged in18 law enforcement.19 MR. YANG: Well, not -- I don't know that20 that is the case, Justice Scalia. Certainly there is21 some correlation between those torts and how we should,22 for instance, understand "officer of the United States,"23 things like false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious24 prosecution. All evoke Federal criminal law enforcement25 ideas. However, when we look at the text that Congress23￼1 used to implement the statute, the text is not like any2 of the other instances within the Federal Tort Claims3 Act, where Congress has limited the waiver to particular4 types of activities or carved out certain activities.5 In fact, what Congress did was reference6 back to the general waiver provision which explains that7 the waiver applies to acts within the scope of8 employment.9 If Congress had wanted, for instance, to say10 only within law enforcement capacity, it would have used11 very different language. The language of sections --12 the other provisions in Sections 2680, for instance,13 subsections (a), (b), and (c), which limit -- which14 carve out the execution of a statute or regulation,15 exercise of discretionary functions, the loss,16 miscarriage or negligent transmission of postal matter,17 assessment or collection of taxes or customs duties, (f)18 specifically directs -- carves out the imposition or19 establishment of a quarantine, (j) carves out the20 combatant activities of military forces. If Congress21 wanted to use similar language like law enforcement22 activities of a law enforcement officer, it would have23 done that.24 And the United States -- I don't want to25 bang the drums too loudly here. We did take a contrary24￼1 position previously, but when our office reviewed the2 case, we simply determined that the position could not3 be one that would square to the test.4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume we adopted5 the definition Justice Scalia just proposed, law6 enforcement7 activities.8 enforcement910 What we are11 term does not even -- does not appear in the statute.12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you can look at it13 both ways. Are correction officers as officers who are14 protecting or securing prisoners, are they acting in a15 law enforcement capacity in your -- forget about what16 act, what tort they commit, but do they function --17 MR. YANG: There could be many answers to18 that question.19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay.20 MR. YANG: You could, as the amicus or as21 the Petitioner suggests, say that the enforcement of a22 criminal sentence is part of law enforcement capacity,23 so anything that they do is law enforcement.24 You could think of law enforcement capacity25 as more like arrests, you know, searches for violations25officer engaged in law enforcementWould correction officers be engaged in lawactivities?MR. YANG: Well, yes -- maybe yes, maybe no. talking about is an undefined term and the￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425of Federal criminal law, and that sort of thing. Those might be exercises that the Court would have to engage in if Congress had actually used text directing the Court to look at that.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. MR.

BUCHOLTZ: Mr. Chief Justice and may itplease the Court:I hope to convince the Court of two thingstoday. First is about our reading of the law enforcement proviso as limited to conduct of investigative or law enforcement officers acting as such. The first is that that reading is textually plausible. It is a reasonable reading of what Congress enacted in light of the structure of the statute and in light of ordinary English usage.JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask, in light of your opening statement, are you then abandoning your position that it must be either arrest, search or seizure? You have used the Ninth Circuit formula.MR. BUCHOLTZ: Well, Justice Ginsburg, it's26￼1 not really clear how different the Ninth Circuit and the2 Third Circuit are from each other, because there haven't3 been cases that have arisen that have really tested the4 proposition that the Third Circuit meant only, literally5 only, the execution of a search, the seizure of6 evidence, or the making of an arrest, and that would7 exclude conduct very closely incident to one of those8 things. Those cases just haven't arisen.9 So the courts have used different10 formulations. They appear to mean slightly different11 things by them, but I wouldn't want to exaggerate the12 differences between the Third Circuit and the Ninth13 Circuit. Both are trying to capture what Congress was14 getting at here, which was the law enforcement proviso15 was about law enforcement activity. It was about16 covering the United States under the FTCA for abuses of17 law enforcement authority like had occurred in18 Collinsville, which was the national scandal that19 prompted the enactment of the proviso.20 So I think the answer to, Justice Ginsburg,21 to your question, is: We think that if you take the22 Third Circuit's language in Pooler, which of course is23 not this case, but if you take the Pooler language24 literally and you say that the only conduct covered is25 conduct in the course of -- that's language the Court27￼1 used a few times in Pooler -- in the course of a search,2 an arrest, or a seizure of evidence, that's problematic3 because it's clear that Congress was trying to cover4 abuses of law enforcement authority, including malicious5 prosecution and abuse of process, which we know because6 Congress included those torts in the exception to the7 exception. And if you had a situation where an officer8 conducted a search and then wrote a false report about9 the search that he had conducted, the writing of the10 report wouldn't literally be in the course of the11 search. And so if you take those words in Pooler literally,12 that would be excluded. That can't be right.13 So to that extent we agree with the Ninth14 Circuit position rather than the Third Circuit position.15 But again I'm not really sure that it's fair to16 attribute that extreme position to the Third Circuit.17 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Bucholtz, the statute18 itself has a kind of conduct-based limitation in it. It19 says law enforcement officers acting within the scope of20 their employment.21 So I guess my question is, given that there22 is that conduct-based limitation in the statute, why one23 would substitute for it law enforcement officers acting24 as law enforcement officers? Why wouldn't one use just25 the conduct-based limitation that's already there?28￼1 MR. BUCHOLTZ: Justice Kagan, I don't think2 it's a substitution. I think it's an addition if it's3 anything. But really the reason is that under ordinary4 English usage, when there's a reference to somebody5 defined by their status, it's fair to assume that the6 reference to the person defined by their status is7 really just intended to cover things they do in that8 relevant status and not things they do in some other9 capacity.10 What we're asking the Court to do here is11 exactly what the Court did in Lane v. Pena. In Lane v.12 Pena, the statute at issue was the Rehabilitation Act.13 It waived sovereign immunity and provided a damages14 remedy against Federal providers of funding. The15 Department of Transportation clearly was a Federal16 provider of funding. It gave out all sorts of funding17 to all sorts of recipients.18 But that's not what the case was about. The19 case was about the Merchant Marine Academy and somebody20 who was dismissed from it. And what the Court said is21 the reference to Federal funding providers like the22 Department of Transportation had to be read as limited23 to Federal funding providers acting as such. Those were24 the Court's words, "acting as such."25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay. And then -- then29￼2021 acts of law22 enforcement23 authority.24 enforcement25 have, whichJUSTICE KAGAN: But again, it's not just any enforcement officers. It's acts of law officers acting within the scope of their And now you're saying acting as a law officer. I mean, one question I suppose I is the same question that I gave to Mr.301 take that theory and track through the statute to show2 me how that theory works, which is what your opening3 argument was going to do.4 MR. BUCHOLTZ: Justice Kennedy, in the first5 sentence of the proviso, the operative provision,6 Congress referred to acts or omissions of investigative7 or law enforcement officers of the United States.8 Congress didn't say any acts or omissions of9 investigative or law enforcement officers were covered.10 It didn't say all were covered. It just said acts or11 omissions of law enforcement officers in the same way12 that the statute at issue in Lane referred to conduct of13 a Federal funding provider.￼And so what this Court should do, we submit, acts or omissions of investigative or law officers of the United States as limited to1415 is construe16 enforcement17 acts or omissions of those defined -- that defined class18 of persons in the relevant capacity, when they're acting19 as law enforcement officers.1 Yang, is what's the difference between those two things?2 And I guess the second question is: Why would we3 substitute one phrase about how they have to be acting4 for the phrase that Congress actually used?5 MR. BUCHOLTZ: Congress didn't, in the6 proviso, Justice Kagan, Congress did not actually use7 the phrase "scope of employment." It did not actually8 incorporate scope of employment as a limitation9 explicitly in the proviso. It -- it incorporated10 1346(b), which contains the scope requirement. But the11 proviso -- in the proviso, Congress did not actually12 speak in terms of scope of employment as the operative13 limitation. So I don't think we'd be substituting the14 acting as such limitation for anything that actually15 appears in the proviso.16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it a limitation? Is17 scope a limitation? I thought that you -- you didn't18 question that, that scope is a limitation on the conduct19 that's covered, right?20 MR. BUCHOLTZ: Justice Ginsburg, we21 certainly agree that -- that the conduct that's covered22 has to be within the scope of the Federal officer's23 employment. The only point I was trying to make a24 moment ago in response to Justice Kagan is that25 requirement exists in 1346, not in the proviso by its31￼1 terms. We certainly agree with that, and as we've2 argued in our brief, we think that one way the Court3 could affirm the judgment below is to hold that the4 officers here were not acting within the scope of their5 employment, taking the allegations as true, as they have6 to be at this stage of the case.7 But to return to Justice Kagan, to your8 question about why Congress would have wanted to -- the9 Court to -- to interpret "acts or omissions of law10 enforcement officers" as acting as such, it's because --11 in part the answer is because scope turns on State law.12 So Congress doesn't know when it enacts the proviso13 what's going to be covered if the only limitation is14 scope, because that turns on 50 different States' laws.15 And -- and I think that it's fair to say that there are16 actual meaningful differences between different States'17 laws as to scope as we -- as we point out in our brief.18 But the other past of the answer is the --19 is the second part of this Court's analysis in Lane v.20 Pena, which is it's entirely possible literally to read21 the Rehabilitation Act in Lane, and I would grant that22 it's possible literally to read the words in the23 proviso, as covering everything that a defined law24 enforcement officer does within the scope of employment.25 But the Court said in Lane: We can't read the statute32￼1 that way, because we're talking about a waiver of2 immunity, and waivers of immunity, even if you don't3 have to put a heavy thumb on the scales and even if you4 don't have to require that it be unequivocal -- we're5 not going that far here -- you can't interpret it more6 broadly than there's any reason to think Congress meant.7 JUSTICE BREYER: What does it leave out?8 What does it leave out, your theory? A policeman's a9 law enforcement officer. What does he do on his job10 that isn't in a law enforcement role?11 MR. BUCHOLTZ: Well, there may be certain12 types of law enforcement officers, Justice Breyer, who13 generally aren't engaged in law enforcement activity14 when they're within the scope of employment. But that's15 not the case with respect to correctional officers like16 are at issue here.17 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I see.18 MR. BUCHOLTZ: And the reason for that is --19 and other types of officers, which hopefully I'll be20 able to get to, but correctional officers first since21 that's what this case is about. 18 U.S.C. 3050 is what22 makes correctional officers fall within the second23 sentence of the proviso, the definition that Congress24 provided of investigative or law enforcement officers.25 It's what gives them the authority to execute -­33￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: So your idea here is a park2 policeman who is engaged in law enforcement some of the3 time, but engaged in giving tours the rest of the time.4 You're saying what you would do is say when he's engaged5 in the law enforcement he's covered, but not when he's6 engaged in the tour.7 MR. BUCHOLTZ: That's right, because he8 meets the status-based definition that Congress9 provided, but there's no reason to think Congress10 intended that he be covered when he's not engaged in law11 enforcement 1213 is it about14 that was committed here, which was an alleged sexual act15 which nobody could, except by some definition of State16 law, think that that ever happens naturally in theactivity.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. What -- what a corrections officer other than the act￼17 course. But that's an intentional assault. The very18 definition of the crimes that are covered assumes that19 it's not an act that's licensed. So, why isn't the20 correction officer acting in a law enforcement capacity21 when he's restraining people and securing them?22 MR. BUCHOLTZ: Because the correctional23 officer essentially has two capacities. 18 U.S.C.24 3050, which is the only source of law that anyone has25 pointed to, to make correctional officers fall within341 the definition of law enforcement officers in the first2 place, it has nothing to do with correctional officers'3 daily interaction with already incarcerated prisoners.4 It authorizes correctional officers to arrest escaped5 inmates and to arrest visitors to prisons. It has no6 application to their daily interaction with7 prisoners who are already incarcerated.8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the takedown9 that occurred here and I -- it's not uncommon. The --10 your definition includes three things, arrest, search,11 seizure. And correctional officers do engage in12 searches of cells for contraband, and they do engage in13 seizures. Those are not -- this isn't like arrest,14 which you point out the arrest is unusual; it's an15 escapee or a visitor. But that's not true of search and16 seizure.17 MR. BUCHOLTZ: Justice Ginsburg,18 correctional officers do search prisoners' cells on a19 routine basis as part of their duty to maintain order20 and security within the prisons. That responsibility21 comes not from 18 U.S.C. 3050, but from 18 U.S.C. 400122 and following, which is an entirely different set of23 legal authorities that has to do with the Attorney24 General's management of the Bureau of Prisons under his25 supervision and correctional officers -- and 28 C.F.R.35￼1 Part 552, which is where the correctional officers get2 their authority from to search prisoner cells, et3 cetera.4 We think that when -- when correctional5 officers are engaged in that kind of activity, they're6 acting in a security capacity to maintain order and7 security within the prison. They're not acting in their8 very narrow law enforcement capacity conferred by 189 U.S.C. 3050. This case doesn't have --10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, what happens --11 what happens in the police precinct when police officers12 are holding pretrial detainees? Are they acting as13 police officers or as security people? Or even when a14 prisoner comes back to court for a court appearance and15 there are U.S. marshals who guard them rather than16 correction officers, what are they serving as in your17 mind?18 MR. BUCHOLTZ: Well, as I said before,19 Justice Sotomayor, I think there are certain types of20 law enforcement officers who generally when they're21 acting within the scope of employment are engaged in law22 enforcement activity. And deputy U.S. marshals would23 probably fall within that. But the important point24 about this case is it doesn't, Justice Ginsburg, involve25 an allegation about a search. So whatever the Court36￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425might think the right way to look at correctionalofficers when they're engaged in searches might be, thiscase isn't about a search.            JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, why isn't this -- whyisn't what the prison guard does law enforcement?  Imean, the law says these people are going to be lockedup and he's enforcing that.            MR. BUCHOLTZ:  The law is already --            JUSTICE BREYER:  It says he's going to be inprison under these da, da, da, da, da.  You know, all thatda, da, da means the conditions of the prison, et cetera,they're all regulations, rules, statutes.  He'senforcing them, why not?            MR. BUCHOLTZ:  Justice Breyer, I think wecan tell from the definition in the proviso whatCongress was focused on when it -- when it referred tolaw enforcement officers.  We can tell what Congress --            JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, so now you're sayingwhat those three things could provide the definition?            MR. BUCHOLTZ:  And -- and -- and otherconduct that --            JUSTICE BREYER:  And are you saying that?            MR. BUCHOLTZ:  -- I used before is yes, withthe caveat, and I think it's an important one, that it'snot just those three things, only what occurs in the37￼1 course of those three things the way Pooler could2 possibly be3 incident to45 EPA is engaged in law enforcement when it enforces6 statutes and regulations, do you?read, but also conduct that's closely those things.JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you don't think the7 MR. BUCHOLTZ: It depends, Justice Scalia,8 it depends --9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would an officer of the EPA10 be a law enforcement officer when he writes a letter to11 a company saying, you know, you are violating section12 such-and-such of the statute? Is that a law enforcement13 officer?14 MR. BUCHOLTZ: Well, the person who writes15 the letter may qualify as a law enforcement officer16 under the definition, but that's a different question, I17 would submit, than whether that -- whether that act18 constitutes law enforcement activity.19 I think the answer to that question,20 Justice Scalia, is probably no, but the important21 follow-up is if that person meets the definition of law22 enforcement officer because he's an EPA agent, and after23 the letter he follows up and goes to the premises of the24 recipient of the letter, knocks down the door and25 conducts an illegal search, that's what Congress was38￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425trying to cover.            JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah, but EPA is not whatI'm thinking of, I don't think they are.  I am thinkingof policemen.  Okay.  Now, one basic job of a policeman isto patrol, but not arresting people, not searching andnot seizing evidence.  They are on patrol.  That'sbasically what they do.  All right?  Is that a lawenforcement activity?            MR. BUCHOLTZ:  If it's an FBI agent?            JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, but Imean in places -- it's Federal, I understand.  So I'msure we can find analogies in the Federal situation toordinary policemen.            MR. BUCHOLTZ:  Justice Breyer, the answer --the answer -- well, it might not be so easy to find ananalogy to an ordinary policeman --            JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  But FBI agents,who are the federal police, they're people on Federalenclaves, for example, there are -- they are on Federalenclaves, they act like policemen, okay.            MR. BUCHOLTZ:  Sure.  And when they areengaged in patrols, I think it's fair to say that'sprobably law enforcement activity --            JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  That's favorable.  Imean, what I'm thinking of is either you can have a39￼1 broad definition or one that's going to get into trouble2 when we consider real policemen. So if you have a broad3 one, then I don't see how prison guards get out of it.4 If you have a narrow one, my guess is we could find lots5 of Federal policemen who really are policemen who aren't6 doing what falls -- who are doing what falls outside7 your narrow definition. I wish I could think of better8 examples, but I came up with the ones I did.9 MR. BUCHOLTZ: Then maybe I should try to10 return to some of the examples that other Justices have11 given. So there was talk earlier about an OSHA12 inspector. The Government's position -- and I think13 this is an important difference between our position and14 the Government's -- the Government would say that15 because OSHA isn't a criminal law in the traditional16 sense and an OSHA inspector or an OSHA agent isn't17 enforcing criminal law in the colloquial sense, that18 that shouldn't be covered.19 But if the OSHA inspector knocks down your20 door and conducts an illegal search and batters you, why21 shouldn't that be covered? We know that's a law22 enforcement abuse, and we know that law enforcement23 abuses is exactly what Congress is trying to get at. The24 Government, it's like it's trying to relitigate Marshall25 against Barlows where this Court held that OSHA40￼1 inspectors have to have a warrant even though you could2 think of OSHA as being administrative or civil as3 opposed to criminal. That's the argument that the4 Government made there a generation ago and they lost.5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So how does that argument6 help your case?7 MR. BUCHOLTZ: Because, Justice Kennedy, the8 point in this case is that we agree that correctional9 officers fall within the plain language of the10 definition that Congress provided. Again, the structure11 of the proviso is there are two sentences, an operative12 provision and the definition.13 We are trying to get the Court to construe14 the operative provision, the first sentence, in the same15 way the Court did in Lane against Pena. The Government16 is trying to get the Court to construe the definition,17 the second sentence. What Congress said in the18 definition, what the term means, the Court has much less19 scope to construe that in some way other than the20 literal language that Congress provided where Congress21 said what the term means.22 So we agree under the plain language of the23 definition that correctional officers are investigative24 or law enforcement officers because of 18 U.S.C. 3050,25 which gives them the power under limited, and41￼1 inapplicable here, circumstances to arrest.2 We think that if you look at correctional3 officers under 18 U.S.C. 3050 or under the different4 authorities under 18 U.S.C. 4001 and following and the5 regulations, that they wear two hats. Sometimes they6 act in a law enforcement capacity, but not usually,7 because that only applies in the narrow context of8 escapes or visitors. When they are dealing with already9 incarcerated prisoners, like in the allegations here,10 they are really not acting in that capacity at all.11 They are wearing a different hat.12 JUSTICE SCALIA: You are saying that the13 Government is trying to minimize the consequences of14 coming out its way by providing a definition of the15 officers covered, which will not hold. You think it16 does cover a broader category of officers including OSHA17 inspectors, but it does not cover them when they are not18 engaged in law enforcement activities.19 MR. BUCHOLTZ: Justice Scalia, you have20 absolutely perfectly encapsulated our position. Thank21 you.22 (Laughter.)23 MR. BUCHOLTZ: The reason why we think that24 that difference between our position and the25 Government's is important is that the Government's42￼1 position would render the proviso severely2 underinclusive. We know Congress was trying to get at3 law enforcement abuses and provide a remedy. And4 Congress -- the Government would say that if it's not a5 traditional law enforcement officer in the colloquial6 sense of like a constable, that it's not covered. But7 all sorts of agents of the United States from OSHA to8 FDA to all sorts of other agencies, to EPA, engage in9 law enforcement activity like the three things we know10 Congress was focused like a laser beam on: Executing11 searches, seizing evidence, making arrests for12 violations of Federal law. And I don't see any basis13 consistent with the text or our understanding of what14 Congress intended, to the extent it's different from the15 text, to say that that's not covered.16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The one other advantage of17 your definition is that it takes us out of workplace18 fights between two employees, because presumably the19 officers who punch each other out, if that incident20 occurs, aren't acting in a law enforcement capacity. I21 am assuming that is part of your argument as well.22 MR. BUCHOLTZ: That's part of it, that's23 right.24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Then it goes25 back to the question I asked one of your adversaries,43￼1 which is all of this depends on how broadly or narrowly2 we define law enforcement activities.3 If we take it as broadly as the Government4 is suggesting, at moments, it would -- we could very5 well say, you are right, it's a law enforcement6 activity, but not as narrowly as some would have it be.7 It would include securing or detaining people, or8 securing or detaining people. And it would include the9 Park Service person who stops a visitor and punches them10 out. It would include the military personnel who stops11 someone and does an intentional tort against them, even12 though they may just be walking on the grounds rather13 than serving as security that particular day.14 So the point is, why should we give it the15 narrow reading you are giving, and not the broader16 reading the Government seems to be suggesting?17 MR. BUCHOLTZ: Well, two parts to the18 answer, Justice Sotomayor. The first is the Government19 is trying to give the first sentence the broader20 reading, which it recognizes then creates a problem that￼21 it tries to22 way that we2324 Justice Sotomayor, is it's about congressional intent.25 Justice Kennedy asked earlier about whether thesolve by narrowing the second sentence in a think won't hold.But the other part of the answer,441 Government's interpretation or the Petitioner's2 interpretation would unleash a flood of suits by3 prisoners and whether it's fair to think that Congress4 would have intended that. If you look at the5 legislative history of the proviso, there is absolutely6 no indication that anyone in Congress contemplated that7 the proviso would or could or should apply in the prison8 situation. All Congress was focused on was providing a9 remedy for the kinds of raids that had occurred in10 Collinsville.11 And so I think when somebody has two hats,12 like a prison guard has, because, again, there is two13 different sources of legal authority that they are14 exercising, 18 U.S.C. 3050 versus 4001, or a military15 policeman who has two hats, in the cases like Holian that16 we describe in our briefs where the Government made the17 argument that where a military policeman is engaged in a18 military function, not a law enforcement function, that19 they are not covered.20 We think where somebody who meets the21 definition that Congress provided of an investigative or22 law enforcement officer has two distinct hats, two23 distinct capacities. When they are not acting in the24 law enforcement one, they are not covered. There is no25 reason to think that Congress intended that military45￼1 police or prison guards be covered when they are2 maintaining order on a military base or within a prison.3 That's not what Congress was trying to get at.4 And we think again a severe disadvantage of5 the Government's position, they are trying to solve --6 in a sense they are trying to solve the same problem7 that we are with our acting as such interpretation, but8 they are trying to solve it through the wrong part of9 the statute and in a way that -- in a way ends up with10 the worst of both worlds.11 You end up with broader coverage of the kind12 of conduct that's covered, broader than there is any13 reason to think Congress intended, conduct that doesn't14 involve law enforcement activity at all, but a narrower15 class of people whose conduct is covered. Where that16 excludes people like OSHA inspectors, FDA agents, EPA17 agents and in the rare circumstance where the Forest18 Service employee is acting as a law enforcement officer19 rather than as a botanist or an entomologist or20 something like that, we think Congress intended to cover21 them.22 We know from the definition that there were23 three exercises of law enforcement authority that24 Congress was focused like a laser beam on: Executing25 searches, seizing evidence and making arrests. Where46￼19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It has to be a law20 enforcement function. Give -- give me an example21 case where -- where scope would also be relevant,22 also be applicable -- if you -- if there is a law23 enforcement function, then it fits. So what does24 add?of a wouldscope25MR. BUCHOLTZ: Well, if an officer is471 somebody meets the definition of law enforcement officer2 and they are doing one of those three things, there is3 no basis not to say that they are covered.4 We think it's better to interpret the first5 sentence of the proviso the same way the Court did in6 Lane against Pena as limited to acts or omissions of7 investigative or law enforcement officers acting as8 such, and keep the definition that Congress provided the9 way Congress provided it.10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then scope becomes kind11 of a surplusage.12 MR. BUCHOLTZ: Not surpluses necessarily,13 Justice Ginsburg, because it varies among States. There14 could be States where scope is narrower or broader, and15 there could always be situations where State law is such16 that the easiest way to resolve a case is under scope,17 and not under the concept of acting as a law enforcement18 officer.￼1 executing a search but he's doing so because of a2 personal vendetta against the person whose premises he's3 searching, and he's -- and he's not -- under whatever4 the State -- State's law that is applicable, if there is5 a relatively narrow conception of scope so that you have6 to be trying to serve your employer, which is the7 traditional rule, and not just sort of on the job in a8 loose sense, which is what the D.C. rule has come to be,9 an officer who is engaged in a search or making --10 making an arrest for a completely inappropriate reason,11 not trying to serve the employer, not in any way that's12 authorized by the employer, might not be within the13 scope, but might be engaged in one of the three law￼14 enforcement15 other --1617 is supposed18 evening, he19 somewhat recalcitrant, and two guards carry him back to20 the cell block. Is that an arrest?21 MR. BUCHOLTZ: No, Justice Kennedy, it's not22 an arrest, for, among other reasons, the reason that23 prison guards don't have any legal authority to make an24 arrest in that circumstance.25 The prisoner's already been arrested.48activities that Congress specified. And theJUSTICE KENNEDY: A prisoner -- a prisoner to be back in his cell block at 6:00 in the isn't, he's on the recreation yard, he's1 That's how he got to jail in the first place.2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, he's violating the3 prison regulations.4 MR. BUCHOLTZ: Yes. And 28 CFR part 5525 sets out the authorities that prison guards have to6 enforce prison regulations to maintain security and7 order within the prison, like in that circumstance.8 That's not making an arrest. The prison guards have the9 authority --10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's not a law11 enforcement function as contemplated by the statute, in12 your view?13 MR. BUCHOLTZ: That's correct,14 Justice Kennedy. That -- that may involve the use of15 force and I -- you know, you can make an argument that16 -- that when you pick somebody up like in your17 hypothetical, that that's like an arrest at common law.18 There's no reason to think Congress was getting at that,19 was trying to cover that in the proviso.20 Where somebody has two different distinct21 capacities as a matter of law, the way Bureau of Prisons22 guards do, and they're acting in the one and not the23 other, then I think that's the simple answer, is that --24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the difference25 between the officer who punches the prisoner to get him49￼1 on the ground and pick him up? Would it apply to the2 officer who files an arrest complaint against the3 prisoner, and not to the security officer who just4 merely carries him back to his cell?5 MR. BUCHOLTZ: Justice Sotomayor, the6 hypothetical is --7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or does some physical8 injury that's substantial. So the intentional assault9 gets treated as an exception to this only when the10 security officer actually files an arrest complaint? Or11 would it at all?12 MR. BUCHOLTZ: Are you talking about a13 Bureau of Prison guard filing the arrest complaint?14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes.15 MR. BUCHOLTZ: Well, I think -- one thing to16 point out is the government informs the Court in its17 reply brief that in a situation where there has been a18 violation of prison rules that may also be a violation19 of Federal law that may also be a crime, such that, you20 know, in ordinary English usage, you could refer to the21 prison guard as conducting an investigation for22 violation of a Federal crime.23 What happens is the BOP guards don't do that24 themselves. They call in the FBI. That's what the25 government says in its reply brief. So I think that50￼1 itself is an indication of the distinction between2 prison guards who are law enforcement officers as3 Congress has defined the term, but who are not4 traditional law enforcement officers, as the government5 seeks to define -- redefine the term, and in that6 capacity are not acting as law enforcement officers.7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Bucholtz, I'm sure you8 have done this already, so I apologize, but could you9 just state your definition of what it means to be acting10 as a law enforcement officer? What activities other11 than the three listed get included?12 MR. BUCHOLTZ: Well, Justice Kagan, it's13 hard to give a simple comprehensive answer that applies14 to all different types of law enforcement officers. Let15 me start by saying that the three things that have to be16 included are the three things that Congress specified,17 and that's one of the problems with the government's18 definition, is that it reads out cases involves those19 three activities, involving, in the government's view --20 kinds of officers.21 JUSTICE KAGAN: But you don't want to limit it22 to those -- so what else gets in the mix? How would you23 define it generally?24 MR. BUCHOLTZ: So -- in a case that involves25 one of those three things but also something else that's51￼1 incident to or related to those three things, we think2 it would probably be artificial. And you can imagine3 all sorts of hypos, but it might well be artificial to4 separate the writing of the -- of the report about the5 arrest from the arrest itself. So conduct incident to6 one of these three specified activities we think is7 probably covered. We also think that maybe when you are8 talking about a type of law enforcement officer like an9 FBI agent who is wearing his law enforcement hat all the10 time, doesn't have a second distinct capacity as a11 matter of law, like a military policeman or correctional12 officer, that maybe a broader definition is appropriate,13 that maybe the FBI agent who is --14 JUSTICE KAGAN: Maybe? I mean, yes or no or15 when or --16 MR. BUCHOLTZ: Well, I mean, Justice Kagan,17 in fairness, this case doesn't present that question,18 because it doesn't involve any law enforcement activity at all.19 JUSTICE KAGAN: But if we're going to adopt20 your definition, we have to have some understanding of21 where it's taking us.22 MR. BUCHOLTZ: Of course. Of course. And23 where I think it would be taking the Court is that as24 always, there could be hard cases that could arise that25 the lower courts would have to grapple with, but I think52￼1 the important concept is, that where somebody has two2 hats, a law enforcement capacity and some other3 capacity, then it's easy to draw that line, in concept.4 Again, there could be hard cases, but as a concept, it's5 easy to draw that line.6 Where somebody doesn't have two hats, they7 only have one hat, like an FBI agent, and they are on8 the job and9 think of as10 covered. I11 that.12they are engaged in what normal people would law enforcement activity, maybe that'sdon't really have a -- have a problem withI think -- I think that's probably13 consistent with what Congress was getting at. And maybe￼14 the way to think about it is, Congress defined "law15 enforcement officer" with reference to the three16 specified kinds of exercises of law enforcement17 authority, but when the FBI agent is interviewing a18 witness or potential suspect but hasn't yet gotten to19 the point of arresting a person or conducting a search,20 you can think of that as preliminary to an exercise of21 one of the three specified authorities, because after22 all, that's what the FBI agent has the authority to do,23 it's what his job entails.24 And depending on how the initial questioning25 goes, that might be the next step. And so it's never531 far from the scene, when an FBI agent is engaged in what2 you would normally think of as law enforcement activity,3 that one of the three specified law enforcement4 activities could be in the offing.5 That's very different when you're talking6 about Forest Service employees who technically meet the7 definition but who usually are not doing anything within8 a million miles of what normal people would think of as9 law enforcement activity.10 So I think it's important to distinguish11 between different kinds of people who fall within the12 definition. And -- I understand the Court wants to try13 to figure out what the implications of this14 interpretation would be. I think that in the prison15 context, the answer is clear, because there are two16 distinct capacities. And that's a hugely important17 context as a practical matter, given the point that18 Justice Kennedy made about the likelihood of an enormous19 number of claims that Congress probably didn't intend.20 In the military police context, where there21 are also two distinct capacities, it's probably pretty22 easy to draw the line. In other cases, it will be23 case-by-case whether something that the Plaintiff24 alleges should be thought of as law enforcement activity25 or law enforcement officer acting as such. We don't54￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425have a problem with the broad interpretation of law enforcement activity acting as such, dealing with the traditional law enforcement officer in a context that it's clear Congress intended.Honors.CHIEF JUSTICE MR. BUCHOLTZ:ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Thank you very much, YourROBERTS: Mr. Paolella, youCHIEF JUSTICE have 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OFCHRISTOPHER J. PAOLELLA, FOR PETITIONER, APPOINTED BY THIS COURTMR. PAOLELLA: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.Let me begin by addressing Justice Kennedy's point, his question regarding the possibility of a flood of lawsuits from prisoners. I think it's important to keep in mind that right now, Pooler and Orsay are the minority rules. Most Federal courts have adopted a broad interpretation of the law enforcement proviso.So if adopting a broader interpretation here would open the flood gates, the flood gates are already open, and they have been for 40 years in most of the country. And we haven't seen a flood of FTCA suits brought by prisoners, especially since the passage of the PLRA --JUSTICE KAGAN: Have they also adopted the55￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425government's view of what counts as an officer, or have they not?MR. PAOLELLA: I -- I don't think that the really been litigated in the Federal courts. hasn't come up. And I think that that's anissue hasIt simplyindication that it's -- it's a workable test. It's -- it's not something -- that there are many, many cases, the vast majority of cases, involve individuals who will be by any reasonable definition core law enforcement officers. As far as I am aware, every Federal court to address the issue has defined correctional officers as law enforcement officers. You know -- as officers, as that term is used.￼So I think that these things are really ultimately noncontroversial.JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you support the government's position on who's an officer, right? So it wouldn't include EPA. Is that --MR. PAOLELLA: I think that the word "officer" carries some water in this statute, and it means something other than "employee."JUSTICE SCALIA: Is thatayesorano? MR. PAOLELLA: Yes.Justice Scalia, let me return to yourearlier point about inferring congressional intent from,561 for example, from the list of enumerated torts. And I2 think it's important to keep in mind that the best3 evidence of Congress's intent is the text of the4 statute. And the fundamental problem with amicus's5 position is that he very ably uses tools for construing6 ambiguous statutes to construe a statute that at its7 core is not ambiguous, it's precise and it's definite.8 Now, the coverage that is created by the9 literal words of the statute may be debatable as a10 policy matter. Maybe it makes sense to include11 correctional officers, maybe it doesn't. But it's not12 absurd. And this Court's rule is when you were13 construing a non-ambiguous statute, Congress gets to14 draw that policy line, not the Court, as long as the15 result is not absurd.16 And we would argue that Congress drew that17 policy line here. It very specifically provided that18 any claim based on enumerated tort by a federal law19 enforcement officer acting within the scope of his or20 her employment, is where it drew that line, that's what21 the statute literally says. There is no argument about22 that. And I think that all of the results, the parade23 of horribles that amicus has raised, again, may be24 debatable as a policy matter, but not one of them is an25 absurd exercise of Congress's responsibility. And as a57￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425result, we would urge the Court to reverse.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.Mr. Bucholtz, this Court appointed you as an amicus curiae to brief and argue the case in support of the judgment below, and you have ably discharged that responsibility for which the Court is grateful.Thank you.
