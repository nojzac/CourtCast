Janette Knudson.          Mr. Jorden.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES F. JORDEN               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MR. JORDEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          Petitioners' claim for injunctive anddeclaratory relief to enforce the terms of thereimbursement clause in the benefit plan at issue in thiscase falls squarely within the language of ERISA, section502(a)(3)(A), which appears in full text at page 13 of ourbrief, which provides for a civil action by a fiduciary toenjoin any act or practice which violates the terms of the101112131415161718    plan.19202122232425          In its first amended complaint, Great-Westsought injunctive and declaratory relief prior to the timeany of the funds were disbursed in this matter in theState court proceeding.  It sought injunctive relief andother appropriate equitable relief to enforce the terms ofthe employee benefit plan.          QUESTION:  Now, you say to enjoy any act or --                             3                                                                                             1    do you think that includes to enjoin your refusing to pay 2    me money that you owe me?  Because it doesn't just say to 3    enjoin.  It says, to enjoin any act or practice, or (B) to 4    obtain other -- other -- appropriate equitable relief. 5    So, I -- you know, I take that to mean an injunction that 6    is a normal equitable injunction, an injunction -- an 7    injunction that is equitable relief.  And -- and that puts 8    the burden on you to -- to show that refusing to pay me 9    money that you owe me can be enjoined in equity, which I10    don't think it can.11              MR. JORDEN:  Well, Your Honor, we believe that12    the language and the structure and the purpose of ERISA13    support the proposition that section 502(a)(3)(A),14    specifically in this case (a)(3)(A), to enjoin the15    Knudsons from disbursing funds as to which they had power16    to determine --17              QUESTION:  Well, if you want to talk about18    purpose, I frankly don't see why it is in accord with the19    purpose to limit the relief to equitable relief.20              MR. JORDEN:  Well, Your Honor, we believe it is21    equitable relief.22              QUESTION:  You know, if the only way to get the23    relief is at law, the purpose of the act would -- would24    allow you to get relief at -- at law.  But -- but the act25    chose not to go that far.  It just says, you know, to4                                                                                                                                 1    enjoin any act or to obtain other appropriate equitable 2    relief. 3              So, you don't think the injunction portion, to 4    enjoin any act or practice, refers to normal equitable 5    injunction.  It could be -- it's a type of injunction that 6    would not have been available in equity. 7              MR. JORDEN:  Well, Your Honor, two things. 8    First, I believe in this case on these facts the 9    injunction was a typical injunction.  Prior to the time10    actions were taken by the Knudsons to disburse any of the11    funds from -- from Hyundai, an injunction was sought12    against them to prevent them from disbursing those funds13    until the Federal claim under 502(a)(3) --14              QUESTION:  Why isn't that clearly wrong?  I15    mean, if you have an adequate remedy at law, I don't think16    you can issue an injunction.  What's wrong with the17    perfectly adequate remedy, that you go bring a suit under18    State law?  You attach the asset, and if you win, you get19    the money.  What's inadequate about that?20              MR. JORDEN:  Two points on that, Your Honor.21    First -- first is that if you're assuming that there's an22    adequate remedy at law --23              QUESTION:  I didn't assume it.  I want you -- I24    say why isn't it an adequate remedy at law.  And if it is25    an adequate remedy at law, why isn't that the end of this5                                                                                                                                1 case? 2              MR. JORDEN:  Well, one would have to presume 3    that we were seeking money damages in this case. 4              QUESTION:  You could go into a court of equity 5    in the year 1750 where they really knew equity -- 6              (Laughter.) 7              QUESTION:  -- and I guess that they would have 8    said, I'm not going to issue you the injunction that you 9    happened to get here because you have an adequate remedy10    at law.  And -- and as I read this, I can't get over in my11    mind that there is an adequate remedy at law.  That's why12    I asked you the question.  I'm trying to get your answer.13              MR. JORDEN:  In fact, Your Honor, the concept of14    a constructive trust, which is -- which is employed by15    many of the lower courts, the courts of appeals, to16    enforce these reimbursement causes --17              QUESTION:  Well, I know many constructive -- I'm18    going to stop you because -- right where you're going.19    I've found many cases where you impose a constructive20    trust on funds that go out of the trust and you trace21    those funds.  But I can't find the case -- and you may be22    able to get me one -- where you impose a constructive23    trust on money that never originated from a trust that has24    nothing to do with this.  Now, maybe if you -- so, in your25    answer right now, maybe you can cite me that case.6                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. JORDEN:  Judge Posner -- Judge Posner inHealth Cost Controls, Your Honor, v. Washington held thata constructive trust was a proper remedy in this context.And indeed, at common law, a -- in imposing a constructivetrust, courts of equity decided -- concluded, becauseafter all, a constructive trust was essentially implodinglegal remedies because the person attempting to -- toimpose the constructive trust did not have legal title tothe property, therefore courts of equity had to step inand impose an equitable remedy.          QUESTION:  What you -- what you sought here, Mr.Jorden, was an injunction, I take it.          MR. JORDEN:  That is correct, Your Honor, andthat is precisely within the language --          QUESTION:  Yes, and I want to ask you somedetail about the injunction that was granted.          Was it simply an injunction that required therespondent here to hold onto the funds, or was it an -- aninjunction against their refusing to pay the funds to you?          MR. JORDEN:  We sought an -- an injunction atseveral levels, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Yes.  Which one was finally issued?          MR. JORDEN:  None, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Well --          MR. JORDEN:  No injunction was issued.  No7                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9injunction was issued.  The injunction was denied by thedistrict court.          QUESTION:  And -- excuse me.          QUESTION:  And what -- what were the terms ofthe injunction which you sought?          MR. JORDEN:  We sought an injunction either to-- for the Federal court to enjoin the State courtproceeding from -- from the second -- from enforcing thatsettlement or to enjoin the Knudsons, the respondents inthis case, from disbursing the funds that were ultimatelypaid out in that settlement or from directing parties whoreceived those funds from disbursing those funds.          QUESTION:  But you didn't seek an injunctionagainst them for refusing to pay you the funds?          MR. JORDEN:  Well, as a part of the mandatoryinjunction, the language of the mandatory injunction thatwas sought, Your Honor, was to pay the plan the $411,000that the Knudsons, unjustly enriched, owed back to the10111213141516171819    plan.2021 22 23 24 25          QUESTION:  Well, supposing that you have a claimagainst somebody for $1,000 because you painted theirhouse, could you go into court and get an injunctionagainst them refusing to pay the claim to you?          MR. JORDEN:  Well, Your Honor, the concept ofspecific performance for the payment -- for the8                                                                                            1    enforcement of an obligation is definitely an equitable2    concept.  And as this Court in Bowen determined, when you3    are seeking to enforce against someone that they -- that4    they carry out the very obligation that, either under a5    statute or under the terms of a plan, they're obliged to6    carry out, as was the case in Bowen, the fact that money7    might ultimately be paid does not make that money damages.8    That's still specific relief.9              QUESTION:  Okay.  That doesn't -- that doesn't10    rule out equity.11              But take the case -- I was going to ask you a12    question similar to the Chief Justice's.  Let's assume13    someone has signed a promissory note, and on the date the14    promissory note becomes due, the individual is entitled to15    an inheritance under a probate court decree.  Would equity16    grant an injunction at the behest of the noteholder17    against using the inheritance for any purpose other than18    paying the note?  I would have thought not.  And that19    seems to be very similar to the situation that you're in20    here.21222324259                                                                                                                                          MR. JORDEN:  It is not clear to me if equitywould have done that, Your Honor.          But I will say this.  If Congress decided in502(a)(3) to permit fiduciaries to enforce the terms of aplan, they -- they cited in 502(a)(3)(A) the authority to 1    seek injunctions to enforce the terms of the plan.  It is 2    clear that at common law injunctions were equitable in 3    nature.  The fact that in a later portion of 502(a)(3) it 4    refers to other appropriate equitable relief, it seems to 5    us, simply reinforces the notion that fiduciaries -- first 6    of all, fiduciaries have an obligation -- 7              QUESTION:  So, you're, in effect, saying that 8    (B) -- the reference to equity in (B) does not limit the 9    breadth of the authority in (A).  That's your real10    argument, isn't it?11              MR. JORDEN:  That's part of our argument, Your12    Honor.  It is absolutely.13              Section 404(a) of ERISA obligates fiduciaries to14    enforce the terms of the plan.  It's one of their15    obligations.16171819202122232425          QUESTION:  And is -- is that --          MR. JORDEN:  It's hard to --          QUESTION:  Is that argument based on theassumption that if a legislature increases the injunctiveauthority of a court by statute, that injunctive authorityis still equitable?          MR. JORDEN:  Your Honor, since I understand --          QUESTION:  If you think it would -- I think youwould want to say --          MR. JORDEN:  -- that the Congress cannot --                            10                                                                                             1    cannot simply grant injunctive authority and call it 2    equitable.  However, it is quite clear -- 3              QUESTION:  Yes, but -- 4              MR. JORDEN:  -- that enforcing the terms of a 5    trust are equitable. 6              QUESTION:  I -- I thought you would answer yes 7    because it seems to me that helps you.  I -- I -- 8              MR. JORDEN:  Well, I think -- 9              QUESTION:  I would assume that a legislature, if10    it's a State court -- or the Congress, if it's a Federal11    court -- can say the injunctive power extends beyond what12    was traditionally equity to A, B, and C and that you could13    still call it fairly equitable.14              MR. JORDEN:  Oh, yes, Your Honor.  That is true.15    Absolutely.16              QUESTION:  And -- and in this case it was in17    conjunction with declaratory relief I thought.  Have we18    ever said that declaratory relief is equitable or --19              MR. JORDEN:  Is equitable in nature?  I don't20    know, Your Honor.21              QUESTION:  Isn't it clear that declaratory22    relief is neuter?  That is, you can have a declaratory23    relief, I -- X owes Y X amount of money.  That's the24    declaration.  A declaratory judgment can be either,25    depending upon what else you ask for.                                  11                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. JORDEN:  Well --          QUESTION:  What else you could ask for.          MR. JORDEN:  That's correct, Your Honor.  Adeclaratory relief can be both.  The declaratory reliefhere clearly would be equitable in nature because it'senforcing the terms of a plan.  The Congress --          QUESTION:  You talk about injunction andspecific performance.  The one word that I haven't heardfrom you yet -- and I'm surprised I haven't -- is10    restitution.111213141516171819202122232425          MR. JORDEN:  Yes, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  That this is what you're seeking isto get back, to recoup what's owed the plan from thislarger pot.          MR. JORDEN:  We are seeking restitution, whichis clearly an equitable remedy, which was recognized bythis Court's decision in Mertens as an equitable remedyand -- and reconfirmed in the more recent decision --          QUESTION:  Mr. Jorden, may I ask --          MR. JORDEN:  -- of Harris Trust.          QUESTION:  -- a question not quite along theselines of whether you properly sought an injunction, butacknowledging that you did seek an injunction and it wasrefused?  And as I understand it, the Federal court, thedistrict court, refused in part because the petitioner,12                                                                                             1    Great-West, said that it only had a right to that part of 2    the settlement allocated to past medical expenses and that 3    only $13,828 was allocated to past medical expenses.  That 4    was part of the reasoning in the denial. 5              MR. JORDEN:  That is correct, Your Honor. 6              QUESTION:  And -- and as I understand it, Great- 7    West did not appeal from that.  I mean, it just -- you've 8    accepted that apparently. 9              MR. JORDEN:  No, Your Honor.  Great-West --10              QUESTION:  There was no appeal, was there?11              MR. JORDEN:  Yes, Your Honor.  There was --12    there was a -- that case, the pending case -- a summary13    judgment motion was filed by Great-West seeking the14    Federal court, notwithstanding the judgment in the State15    court -- of course, Great-West was not a party to the16    State court proceeding, Your Honor.  The Federal court17    proceeding -- the summary judgment motion was filed18    seeking the reimbursement claim, the restitution amount.19    The district court denied that, and that case was appealed20    to the Ninth Circuit.  The Ninth Circuit said we don't21    have jurisdiction because you're seeking money.22              And -- and our position is, first, we were23    seeking an injunction.  That gave the Federal district24    court jurisdiction.  That gave -- that gave a cause of25    action which they could consider under 502(a)(3)(A).  And13                                                                                                                                1    beyond that, we're seeking restitution for the balance of2    the money that is owed the plan based on the unjust3    enrichment of the --4              QUESTION:  Why was it that Great-West didn't5    intervene in the State suit?  Certainly it knew about it.678 way? 9MR. JORDEN:  Yes, it did.QUESTION:  Or try to subrogate the claims some                MR. JORDEN:  Well, that goes to the question of10    whether Great-West -- Great-West had no obligation to11    intervene.  In -- in some cases, in fact, in Jefferson-12    Pilot v. Krafka, which is -- which appears at page 29 of13    our -- of our brief, in the footnote 11 -- State courts14    have no jurisdiction to construe the terms of an ERISA15    plan except under section 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA which16    allows a participant to bring a claim for benefits.17              Now, if the participant had wanted, as the18    Court-appointed amicus brief argues that this should have19    all been decided in one court -- if the participant had20    wanted to have this decided in State court, they could21    have brought Great-West in by alleging a claim under22    502(a)(1)(B).23 24 25          Now, the State court would have had concurrentjurisdiction.  That is the only place in ERISA which givesState courts jurisdiction to construe the terms of a plan.14                                                                                             1              Bearing that in mind, Justice O'Connor, if 2    Great-West were to intervene, it would be asking the State 3    court to construe the terms of the plan to determine the 4    status of its restitution rights. 5              QUESTION:  May I just interrupt you?  I'm not 6    quite clear on that.  Why do you have to construe the 7    plan?  It seems to me the plan is perfectly clear.  You're 8    enforcing the plan.  You're not construing it. 9              MR. JORDEN:  Well, I think, Your Honor, if you10    look at the -- at the district court's decision, which --11    excuse me -- the State court decision, joint appendix 143,12    the State court makes very clear that it is in the process13    of making its decision reviewing -- it calls it the health14    insurance policy.  It's not really that -- reviewing the15    terms of the plan and construing the terms of the plan for16    the purpose of determining what's the appropriate17    restitution, what's the appropriate reimbursement.18              Our position is the State court had no19    jurisdiction to do that unless they were doing so under a20    claim brought by the respondents under 502(a)(1)(B), in21    which case, of course, we could have removed that to22    Federal court.23              Not having done so, we also don't have a right24    to go into State court and ask the State court to construe25 that.15                                                                                                                                 1              Now, one of the reasons why 502(a)(3) has to 2    give us a right to enforce the terms of the plan is 3    because we know the beneficiary has a right to do that. 4    Under 502(a)(1)(B), it can go into State court or Federal 5    court and enforce the terms of a plan, including to get 6    benefits and money. 7              Second, we ought to be able to go into a Federal 8    court and enforce the terms of the plan.  And the fact 9    that we get money shouldn't preclude us from doing that.10              And finally, Congress requires us to go in and11    enforce the terms of a plan under 404.  And indeed, courts12    have uniformly said we're entitled to do that.  For13    example -- a very clear contract case -- if an employer14    fails to make the contributions to a plan, where is the15    fiduciary going to get the authority to go and sue the16    employer?  Under 502(a)(3)(A).  That is where they go.17              So, there is no reason why -- Congress clearly18    intended under 502(a)(3)(A), when you're enforcing the19    terms of a plan, unlike as in Mertens where you were not20    enforcing the terms of a plan, where you were not21    enforcing the terms of a specific provision of ERISA, here22    it is clear that we should be entitled to enforce the23    terms of a plan even if that means preserving -- returning24    money to the plan.25              QUESTION:  But you --16                                                                                                                                1234567    equitable.8              QUESTION:  Well, you -- well, you say then9    Congress, when it said you can grant an injunction, didn't          QUESTION:  But it has -- it has to come withinthe limits of -- of the equitable adjectives in -- in thesection you're talking about.          MR. JORDEN:  Well, Your Honor, if it's aninjunction, it doesn't -- our view is it -- it isequitable.  By -- by definition, Congress has said it's10    mean an injunction of the kind that the courts of equity11    traditionally grant, but just anything the court felt12 like.13              MR. JORDEN:  Well, we believe, Your Honor --14              QUESTION:  Is that what -- is that what you're15 arguing?1617    would say that Congress -- as this Court has said, ERISA18    principles start from trust principles unless the19    language, the structure, or the purpose of ERISA is to the20    contrary with respect to the particular issue.  There are21    -- trust principles apply in enforcing the terms of a22    plan.  You can't enforce the terms of a plan unless you're23    applying trust principles.  That means any injunction to24    enforce the terms of a plan by definition must be25    equitable in nature.17                                                                                                                                MR. JORDEN:  No, I would say not, Your Honor.  I1              QUESTION:  Well, I -- I certainly don't follow2    that at all.  But you're certainly entitled to make the3    argument.45 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  You were making the argument that inany case restitution was an equitable remedy.  Therefore,even if we leave injunction and specific performance outof it, what you're seeking --          MR. JORDEN:  Yes, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  -- is restitution --          QUESTION:  But it isn't equitable.          MR. JORDEN:  Restitution --          QUESTION:  My -- my book of restitution sayssometimes it's equitable, sometimes it's legal.          MR. JORDEN:  That is true, Your Honor.  And --and citing to Judge Posner again in -- in Health CostControls, he says it's legal in a legal case and equitablein an equitable case.          QUESTION:  It's just what my book says.          MR. JORDEN:  And in that case -- in those caseswhere -- where a plan is seeking restitution, it'sequitable in nature.          If I may reserve, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Jorden.          Mr. Wolfson, we'll hear from you.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R.Q. WOLFSON                            18                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425     ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,                SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS          MR. WOLFSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          I'd like to start with the point that was beingmade by my colleague, which is that this is the onlymechanism by which a plan can enforce a term of the plan.This is equitable relief under ERISA.  It can be -- anumber of kinds of equitable relief are available.  If nota mandatory injunction, then the classic forms ofequitable relief, specific enforcement of the terms of aplan --          QUESTION:  I've looked up every one of those,and having looked up every one of them, our research sofar shows that there is no category, specific,restitution, anything else, that this would count asequitable because in each instance, they would have saidthat there is an adequate remedy at law and there is nobasis for a constructive trust, because this is not fundsthat come out of the trust.  Rather, it's exactly whatJustice Souter said.          MR. WOLFSON:  Several points --          QUESTION:  That's the question I posed, andthat's what I would like --          MR. WOLFSON:  Several points, Justice Breyer.                            19                                                                                             1    First of all, there is no adequate remedy -- there is no 2    adequate or certain remedy at law in a situation like 3    this.  ERISA itself does not provide for a claim of money4 damages. 5              And it's very important to remember we're 6    talking about whether a -- a term of the plan can be 7    enforced.  There is a strong Federal policy in favor of 8    some mechanism for enforcement of the term of the plan. 9              Now, there's no -- Mertens teaches us there's no10    Federal action for damages based on a violation of the11    plan.  There is no State law action for damages for a12    violation of the plan because this -- this is governed13    exclusively by Federal law.  It involves the construction14    of a term of the plan.  And indeed, if the plan were -- if15    the plan were to seek an action for damages or an16    injunction under State law, that would be deemed17    completely preempted by Federal law under -- under this18    Court's previous decisions.  So -- excuse me.19              QUESTION:  So, you say that -- that under this,20    since it's exclusively Federal causes of action and since21    the Federal statute does not provide for any legal remedy,22    that any so-called equitable remedy is available because23    there is no legal relief.24              MR. WOLFSON:  My point, Justice Scalia, is --25              QUESTION:  Is that -- is that your point?  So,20                                                                                                                                 1    you could bring an injunction -- if a plan provided that 2    somebody would pay a lump amount of cash to the plan on a 3    certain day, you could bring an injunction to prevent that 4    person from failing to pay the lump amount of cash. 5              MR. WOLFSON:  Well, if -- if the plan provided 6    -- it's quite possible if the plan provided, for example, 7    that an employer would make a contribution to the plan, to 8    ensure that the plan was adequately funded, in the amount 9    of $1,000 a month and then the employer refused to do so,10    it's difficult to believe Congress intended that there be11    absolutely no remedy for enforcement of such a central12    term of the plan which would be necessary to make sure13    that the plan could continue in existence.14              QUESTION:  Well, but -- okay.  Why did -- why15    did Congress limit the relief to the term equitable then?16    It could have -- it could have given a much broader17    charter, but our cases interpreting it have said it means18    equitable.1920212223242521                                                                                                                                MR. WOLFSON:  Mr. Chief Justice --QUESTION:  That is a real limitation.MR. WOLFSON:  There are -- there are in -- thisties to one of Justice Breyer's points.  There areexamples under which courts of equity would enforce, byspecific enforcements, contracts to pay money.  And theseare -- we've cited to Pomeroy, and there's a lengthy 1    footnote in that page at Pomeroy we've cited in our brief. 2    Examples, contracts to pay insurance, contracts to pay 3    indemnity, contracts to hold harmless, all of which bear a 4    strong family resemblance to the kind of thing we're 5    discussing -- 6              QUESTION:  But the key to this is your statement 7    that there is no remedy in the State court because it's 8    interpreting the plan.  If a beneficiary -- can a 9    beneficiary sue the plan in State court where10    interpretation of something is required?  Is there some11    kind of lawsuit where they can do that?12              MR. WOLFSON:  A beneficiary could -- could sue13    the plan under 502(a) --14              QUESTION:  Okay.  Now, that being so --15              MR. WOLFSON:  Right.16              QUESTION:  -- because -- follow me because it's17    quite important to me.  Why then couldn't you say, but of18    course this isn't preempted, of course the right remedy is19    the State court remedy for damages, and of course in that20    situation Congress intended the plan to be able to sue to21    get their money back, and whatever interpretation is22    necessary by the State judge is fine?  Why can't you say23 that?24              MR. WOLFSON:  Well, first of all, even if the25    beneficiary sued the plan under 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA,22                                                                                                                                 1    that is a Federal law lawsuit.  So, there's no question 2    that still Federal law governs.  So, there's no question 3    at all about resorting to a separate corpus of State law 4    to interpret the plan. 5              Second, Congress for various reasons said that 6    the beneficiary could sue the plan in State -- in State 7    court.  It did not provide that the plan could sue the 8    beneficiary in State court.  ERISA is quite clear that 9    that has to be in Federal court.  There's exclusive --10    exclusive jurisdiction over a civil action brought to11    enforce an action brought by a fiduciary for -- for the12    various kinds of equitable relief set forth in section13    502(a)(3).  So, for one, as is in the plan's shoes, it is14    equitable relief under ERISA or nothing.  And that --1516    action.171819    did occur to me in the last hour, Mr. Chief Justice.20              Now -- now, one other point.  The complaint does21    say for -- the complaint was framed when the money had not22    yet left Hyundai and was framed at that point in terms of23    a prohibitory injunction.  It did ask for such other24    equitable relief as might be available.  And there are25    classic forms of equitable relief that would be available,23                                                                                                                                QUESTION:  So, we should have a Bivens cause of(Laughter.)MR. WOLFSON:  Well, it -- it did occur -- that 1    restitution, a constructive trust, or an equitable lien, 2    which might -- any number of which might be applied in 3    this case depending on who might be the appropriate 4    defendant or what -- what theory or where the money is and5 so forth.6 Now -- 7              QUESTION:  But you're -- you're saying that 8    given the timing of the suit, this falls literally 9    squarely within subsection (A).10              MR. WOLFSON:  At the timing of the suit, I think11    there would have been -- there would have been no problem.12    A prohibitory injunction would have very properly been13    issued by the district court to prevent the funds in the14    settlement from being disbursed in violation of the plan,15    which is how (a)(3)(A) is framed.16              And there is a res, by the way.  It may not be17    money that came -- it may not be the exact same dollars18    that came from the plan, but the settlement check and the19    amounts that are derived from it are a res over which a20    constructive trust might properly issue.21              Another point about money coming from the plan.22    In Harris Trust, the case that the Court decided a couple23    of years ago, that was a claim -- an equitable claim for24    restitution.  And the Court had no difficulty with25    concluding that such an equitable claim would lie.                                  24                                                                                                                                1              But I don't think anybody thought that Salomon2    Brothers, which had participated in the fiduciary breach3    -- I don't think anybody thought they were still holding4    the same dollars that they had obtained by participating5    in the breach of the fiduciary duty.  I mean, it was -- it6    was a question of replacing those dollars, and that's --7    and that's a proper application of the equitable remedy of8    restitution. 9101112131415          QUESTION:  Mr. Wolfson, I -- I want to be clearabout the Government's position.  The Government'sposition is that if you're under (a)(3)(A), it must be aclassic equitable injunction that you're seeking?          MR. WOLFSON:  No.          QUESTION:  Or rather, it doesn't matter?  inwhich case, I don't know why you're going into all of16 this. 171819202122232425          Is the Government's position that under(a)(3)(A) you can enjoin any act that is in violation ofcommitments made under the plan?          MR. WOLFSON:  I don't think it is limited by(a)(3)(B) that says appropriate equitable relief.  Ithink --          QUESTION:  Okay.  So, whether -- whether itwould be an ordinary injunction that a court of equitywould give out or not, you -- or courts have the power to25                                                                                             1    enjoin.  Is that right? 2              MR. WOLFSON:  Well, Justice Scalia, I don't 3    think Congress can simply declare that black is white.  I 4    mean, Congress cannot simply declare that something is an 5    injunction which isn't really an injunction. 6              But there is a question as to whether (a)(3)(A) 7    might be limited to prohibitory injunctions as opposed to 8    mandatory injunctions, but -- 9              QUESTION:  Yes, because it says enjoin any act,10    not -- not any failure to act.11              MR. WOLFSON:  But -- but (3) -- but (3)(B)(ii)12    also refers to enforcement of the term of the plan, and13    that -- that is --14              QUESTION:  Well, do you think -- do you think an15    injunction can issue under (B)?16              MR. WOLFSON:  (B) little -- (B)(ii), little17    Roman ii, refers to enforcement of the term of the plan I18    believe.  And I think specific enforcement of a term of19    the plan, which is again a remedy which was typically20    available in a court of equity, would classically fall21    under that situation and then not --22              QUESTION:  Well, but can't -- don't you think23    you can make an argument that since Congress has dealt24    with injunctions in (A), (B) does not authorize25    injunctions?26                                                                                                                                 1              MR. WOLFSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I wouldn't 2    slice it that -- you know, that closely.  Enforcement of 3    the term of the plan very often might require an order in 4    the nature of specific enforcement of a plan that might 5    not fall -- if -- if (a)(3)(A) were limited to prohibitory 6    injunctions, I think (a)(3)(B) would be there to remain. 7    And as the Court pointed out -- made clear in Harris 8    Trust, all of (a)(3) is really kind of a catchall or a 9    safety net kind of remedy that's there to ensure that10    plans are enforced according to their terms.  That is a11    fundamental --12              QUESTION:  May I go back to --13              MR. WOLFSON:  -- policy of ERISA.  Excuse me.14              QUESTION:  -- to Justice Scalia's question about15    (a)(3)(A)?  Supposing the statute said to compel any party16    to do X, Y, or Z, and to -- in such a case they may call17    the remedy an injunction, even though it wouldn't18    otherwise, would that be -- does Congress have power to do19    that?  Compel the party to pay money, list all the things20    that the plaintiff here is asking for, but not describe it21    as an injunction and then say, and they may call that an22    injunction if that relief is granted.  Why couldn't they23 do that?24              MR. WOLFSON:  Well, Congress could do it, but I25    don't -- I mean, Congress could do it.  But I think an27                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9ordinary understanding of the term injunction -- itdoesn't have to be limited to a specific analog that acourt of equity might have issued in 1685, and Congresscan expand the court's injunctive power.  I don't thinkthat Congress was intending to say, well, it's reallydamages, but we'll just call it -- call it an injunction.But this is not --          QUESTION:  Thank you -- thank you, Mr. Wolfson.          Mr. Taranto, we'll hear from you.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD G. TARANTO      AMICUS CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW          MR. TARANTO:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          I'd like to summarize the three points I want tomake for why petitioners' money suit does not requestappropriate equitable relief and therefore is outside          My first point --          QUESTION:  May I just be sure you cover itbefore you get through?  What about it being within(a)(3)(A) and that (a)(3)(A) just gives the word enjoin avery broad, non-historic meaning, according to myhypothetical a second ago?  Why is that impossible?          MR. TARANTO:  I -- I think because of the wordother in -- in the -- the provision.  To -- to separate28                                                                                            1011121314151617    502(a)(3).18192021222324251 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the enjoin clause from the other appropriate equitablerelief I think does impossible violence to thecongressional specification that injunctions are a subsetof the appropriate equitable relief.          One practical consequence I think that wouldfollow from wrenching those apart would be that a plancould write a liquidated damages or some other damagesprovision into the plan and then seek an injunction forpayment of that money.  I don't think that that --          QUESTION:  What would be so terrible about that?          MR. TARANTO:  Oh, I'm not sure that there wouldbe anything terrible, and I don't think there would be acongressional -- I mean, I think Congress could call aremedy anything it wants, subject to constitutionalconstraints, for example, Seventh Amendment constraints,and Seventh Amendment issues might well arise.          QUESTION:  How would you enforce a liquidateddamages provision, assuming a plan has one?          MR. TARANTO:  I don't think one is enforceable.          QUESTION:  So, there's a lot of stuff that's --that's permissible under ERISA that is simply notenforceable in courts.          MR. TARANTO:  I don't know how much.  Liquidateddamages -- I will make specific reference to anotherprovision of 502, which is 502(g).  The question --29                                                                                             1    Congress specifically dealt with the question of 2    delinquent contributions by enacting section 515.  It 3    limited 515 to delinquent contributions from multi- 4    employer plans and plans adopted pursuant to collective 5    bargaining agreements.  And then it said there's a 6    specific remedy for that, 502(g)(2), which talks about 7    legal relief.  That expanded the universe of relief 8    available for a particular kind of monetary issue which 9    includes liquidated damages.10              But the limitations that Mertens I think11    correctly identified in 502(a)(3) -- namely, it's limited12    to equitable relief -- by its terms, carves out of the13    universe of remedies that our legal system has14    traditionally thought necessary one particular or one --15    one subset of that relief and says this is all that's16    available.17              There are other circumstances ERISA by virtue of18    a broad but not universal preemption in which plan terms19    are not, in fact, remediable.  When beneficiaries seek20    medical treatment to which they're guaranteed under the21    terms of a plan and don't get it in time before it becomes22    a moot point, those provisions become unenforceable.  It's23    not unheard of in ERISA.24              Now, I do want to say that I think that the25    particular interest that we're talking about here, the30                                                                                                                                 1    plan's interest in recourse to recover money that ought to 2    come from somebody else -- namely Hyundai, the third- 3    party tortfeasor or alleged third-party tortfeasor -- I 4    think need not be viewed as unavailable.  I think that 5    preemption law does not go so far as to rule out, in 6    particular, the plan's suit as subrogee in State court, a 7    plain, garden variety tort suit -- 8              QUESTION:  Why -- why subrogee?  Because this to 9    me now I'm thinking, having listened to this, is a key10    point to me.  Why can't the plan simply bring an ordinary11    contract action attaching the asset in State court?12              MR. TARANTO:  That -- that --13              QUESTION:  Why does it have to be a subrogee?14              MR. TARANTO:  Well, I think that this Court's15    preemption decisions, as I read them, don't make that16    impossible, but make it more difficult.17              QUESTION:  All right.  Now, are we dealing with18    language in decisions that didn't focus on this19    circumstance?  Because it's very hard for me to believe20    that Congress would not have wanted the plan to be able to21    sue people who owed them money including beneficiaries.22    After all, the purpose of ERISA is to protect the assets23    of the workers in plans.  So, I'm -- I'm quite interested24    if you can say anything more about this point.25              MR. TARANTO:  Well, I -- I do think that this31                                                                                                                                 1    Court's preemption decisions, from Pilot Life and some of 2    its successors, have language in them that, taken all by 3    themselves, might suggest that any contract cause of 4    action on the same subject that is addressed in one of the 5    ERISA remedial provisions would be preempted.  Each of 6    those cases, in fact, involved requests for greater relief 7    than was made available, and that might well be a problem 8    for the kind of contract action you're talking about here. 9    If that relief is legal relief and it's covered by10    502(a)(3) as a subject matter and Congress did not provide11    for it, there is a fairly strong inference that that kind12    of relief was relief that Congress did not want provided.13              QUESTION:  Now, which -- which would be the14    easier route?  If I'm convinced that, of course, Congress15    wants the plan to be able to get its money back, legally16    now is it more proper to say it's not preempted the State17    court action, ordinary contract with attaching the assets?18    Or is it more legally correct to say there is no State19    court action; therefore, there is no adequate remedy at20    law; therefore, an action close to restitution or specific21    performance lies?22              MR. TARANTO:  Well, I -- I don't think that it,23    in the end, works to say that anytime equitable relief --24    that anytime there's no legal relief, then there must be25    equitable relief because then I think we've erased the32                                                                                                                                 1    distinction Congress has meant -- has created. 2              I do think the subrogation action presents a 3    much easier case, indeed a case that ought to fall outside 4    preemption law.  It has not been the case under ERISA and 5    it has not been the case under the Labor Management 6    Relation Act section 301 provision that ERISA draws on 7    that, as petitioners' counsel said, every suit involving 8    interpretation of the plan is preempted, every State court 9    suit.  This Court, for example, in the Lingle decision,10    which I did not cite in -- in my brief, but Lingle against11    Magic Chef at the very end says plan interpretation -- or12    I guess collective bargaining agreement interpretation in13    the 301 context -- is something that State courts can do14    as an adjunct to a suit where the elements of liability15    and the duties are determined otherwise.16              QUESTION:  Mr. Taranto, what about the presence17    of State subrogation laws where the State has a strong law18    reflecting its policy that there shouldn't be any19    subrogation actions in the State court?20              MR. TARANTO:  Well, I -- I think that I would21    agree with petitioners that the question of the plan's22    rights are matters of Federal law, and I don't think it is23    possible for a State to say an ERISA plan that does24    provide in terms for subrogation, stepping into the shoes25    of the beneficiary's tort claim -- I don't think a State33                                                                                                                                 1 2 3 4 5 6    contract? 7              MR. TARANTO:  I don't know about all -- all -- 8              QUESTION:  Provisions for excessive punitive 9    damages?  I mean, there are all sorts of State provisions10    for contract law.  They're -- they're all to be set aside11    once -- once you have an ERISA contract?12              MR. TARANTO:  Well, I -- I guess I -- I should13    say, although I guess it's not my place to be doing a lot14    of conceding this morning, but I would be happy, of15    course, if -- if many State laws were not preempted.16              I think for purposes of this case in addressing17    the -- the concern about whether plans have recourse, a18    very narrow question is presented, and that is whether19    plan's tort suit against the alleged tortfeasor is20    preempted because not in determining whether the -- the21    third-party alleged tortfeasor violated a tort duty and is22    liable, not in determining the amount of -- of overall23    harm caused, but rather, in deciding whether the plan can24    be there as a plaintiff and what portion of any such25    recovery would belong to the plan, those essentially34                                                                                                                                could properly deprive the plan of -- of that right.  Ithink that would be a matter of -- of Federal law.But once the plan --          QUESTION:  All other State restrictions oncontracting are overridden simply because it's an ERISA 1    ancillary matters, which might require interpretation of 2    the plan -- those, it seems to me, don't get preempted. 3    And as long as those don't get preempted -- 4              QUESTION:  It's very odd that you'd have a -- a 5    body of Federal common law that can be applied only in 6    State courts. 7              MR. TARANTO:  Well, I -- I don't think that this 8    would be only in -- in State courts because there could be 9    -- I mean, the interpretation of -- of many plan10    provisions is going to come through an (a)(1) action, the11    beneficiary suing for -- for benefits.  There may be12    specific kinds of equitable relief that is -- that are13    requested that would fall under 502(a)(3).14              My -- my point is that there is no reason to15    distort what I think is the natural meaning of equitable16    relief based on an admittedly serious concern that a plan17    might not have recourse for money because I think the plan18    does have recourse for money through bearing the burden of19    pursuing that money against the tortfeasor, in which the20    interpretation of the plan is ancillary and -- and21    incidental just like at the very end of the Lingle against22    Magic Chef decision, which was then quoted and picked up23    again in the Livadas decision in 1994, in the labor24    contract context.  State courts are entitled, despite a25    generally very broad preemption of the labor contract35                                                                                                                                 1    interpretation, to interpret labor contracts.  So too with 2    respect to the plan for this limited role for subrogation. 3              QUESTION:  Mr. Taranto, you -- what you're 4    telling us then is that there would be no preemption in 5    this class of cases, that in this class of cases where the 6    plan insurer is saying we want to get from this recovery 7    the amount that we advanced, that in this class of cases 8    you would have an entirely Federal law governed claim that 9    could only be brought in State court.10              I don't want to talk about the other claims that11    you might have, but here where the plan insurance company12    says, here's this tort recovery, we want our piece of it,13    we want that restored, we want our advance restored to us,14    for that category of case, you're telling us you have a15    claim under Federal law that can be brought only in State16 courts.17              MR. TARANTO:  I -- I -- if I can say it slightly18    -- slightly differently.  I think that the State tort law19    is the claim -- creates a claim for negligence and any20    damages caused by that.  What subrogation does, which I21    think ought to be a matter of Federal common law which22    probably just follows the terms of an ERISA plan, is say23    that the plan can step into the shoes of the beneficiary's24    rights under State law.  And I do think that that mode of25    proceeding to find essentially a -- to find a recovery out36                                                                                                                                 1    of money that in justice, according to petitioners, ought 2    to come from the third-party tortfeasor is available in 3    State court.  And therefore, a principal worry about 4    adhering to what I think is the natural meaning of 5    equitable relief in (a)(2) -- in (a)(3) weakens 6    substantially. 7              QUESTION:  I -- I see that except for one point. 8    I don't see why you're going down the subrogation route, 9    which at least one of the amicus briefs suggests would10    cause a lot of problems, rather than simply saying it's a11    straight contract action under State court -- under State12    law.  Why?  What's the -- you have a reason for doing it.13              MR. TARANTO:  The -- the reason that I --14              QUESTION:  Is what?15              MR. TARANTO:  -- that I have suggested is that16    the contract action between the plan or its fiduciary,17    which the cases have not treated as identical, but the18    contract action against the -- against the beneficiary to19    -- for a supposed violation of the terms of the plan feels20    an awful lot like the subject matter covered directly by21    (a)(3).  And if, therefore, that contract action would be22    requesting relief that could only really be legal relief,23    there would be a much stronger preemption argument, a24    conflict preemption argument, that says Congress really25    did say we want equitable relief, we don't want legal37                                                                                                                                 1    relief, and that would be a stronger preemption -- 2              QUESTION:  At which point you'd say that 3    Congress certainly didn't mean they can't sue people to 4    get money belonging to the plan.  We have the -- am I 5    right?  I'm trying to -- it's a kind of circle, and I'm 6    trying to see if I have the -- all the parts. 7              MR. TARANTO:  I -- I think we're understanding 8    each other, and I -- and I can see the way out of the -- 9    the stronger preemption argument as to -- as to that.  I10    think the preemption argument as to the subrogation suit,11    the ordinary tort suit, is much, much weaker to begin with12    and therefore doesn't require as -- as strong a -- a13 response.14              QUESTION:  Mr. Taranto, can I ask you to respond15    to an argument that occurs to me?  If -- going back to the16    text of (a)(3), if you just had (a)(3)(A), I -- I think17    you've agreed one could read that to just have a sort of a18    statutory injunction that is divorced from prior equity19    practice and just includes doing anything that is20    necessary to comply with the plan.  But you respond to21    that by saying, but (B) says other equitable relief, which22    therefore has the effect of narrowing what otherwise might23    be a permissible reading of (A).  Am I correct that that's24 your --25MR. TARANTO:  Yes.                  38                                      1              QUESTION:  But my -- my -- the reason I'm2    concerned about that response is it seems to me that (B)3    was intended to broaden the remedies available rather than4    to narrow them, and you're necessarily construing it as a5    narrowing construction.6              MR. TARANTO:  Well, I -- I think I'm construing7    it in -- in two ways.  Perhaps as narrowing, but more8    importantly as clarifying what otherwise would, I think,9    be the more reasonable reading of (A), the enjoin clause,10    even if there were nothing else.  I think the more11    reasonable reading would be injunctions as equity made12    them available.13              When I read -- what your first comment said, if14    all that was there was the enjoin language, I think that15    language by itself might be taken to mean enjoin any16    violation of the terms of the plan.  I don't think that17    that would be the better reading even without the language18    that follows, but I think the language that follows19    compels adoption of that because it characterizes as20    equitable relief the injunctions provided for in the first21    clause.22232425                                                                                                                                          QUESTION:  Is there any legislative historyindicating why Congress limited the relief which itpermitted in this section to equitable relief?MR. TARANTO:  I'm not aware of any.  I -- I have                  39 1    reviewed the -- the legislative history, the collective 2    three-volume legislative history, and as I think some of 3    this Court's decisions have -- have indicated, some of the 4    earlier bills contained broader relief provisions, legal 5    or equitable relief, and that was cut back for reasons 6    that at least I don't recall having seen. 7              In -- in the one reference to -- which I cited 8    in -- in my brief I think at page 27 -- in one of the 9    Senate reports that discusses the immediate predecessor of10    this provision, there's no general reference to any kind11    of relief that's necessary to -- to make plans protect all12    of their rights or vice versa.  It's been principally a13    beneficiary protection statute.14              And there's also no general reference to15    restitution in the abstract.  There's a reference to16    injunctions and specifically to constructive trusts.  So,17    even there, there isn't a general idea that anytime we're18    talking about what sometimes are called direct damages or19    general damages or contractual damages, and therefore20    making whole the loser of a particular sum of money that's21    been promised, that that action would somehow be22    transformed into an equitable action when historically it23    very plainly wasn't.24              QUESTION:  Any more so --25              QUESTION:  Well, couldn't you have historically40                                                                                                                                1 gotten -- 2              QUESTION:  Any more so than -- than the back pay 3    under title 7, which is money?  Why isn't this really 4    comparable to that?  I mean, Congress, one would assume, 5    didn't want compensatory damages or punitive damages, and 6    that's what they meant when they said appropriate 7    equitable relief.  But if back pay, which is fungible 8    money, can be classified as equitable, why not this kind 9    of restitution?10              MR. TARANTO:  Let me -- let me try to answer11    that -- that this way.  This Court has never said that for12    the important constitutional question, that back pay is13    indeed equitable relief for Seventh Amendment purposes.14    It has several times said we are not deciding that and15    have not decided that.16              The courts of appeals have, for many years, in17    fact so held.  But if you look back at the original18    decisions that so held back in the 1960's, they all rested19    on something that is suggested directly by the language of20    title 7, which is not that back pay standing alone is21    equitable and therefore outside the jury trial right, but22    that equity always had the power to award money when23    incidental to and intertwined with traditional equitable24    relief.  In -- in the context of title 7, as in the25    context of the National Labor Relations Act on which title41                                                                                                                                 1    7 was based, back pay enters not as a separately 2    authorized remedy, but as reinstatement with or without3 back pay. 4              QUESTION:  But you could have under both -- I 5    think this is correct -- the Fair Labor Standards Act and 6    under title 7, a monetary remedy without any 7    reinstatement. 8              MR. TARANTO:  And -- and I agree that the courts 9    of appeals have, for a long time, treated that as outside10    the jury trial right, but this Court has never said so.11    And perhaps more importantly as a matter of congressional12    intent, there's no reason to think that Congress in 1974,13    when writing the ERISA provision, was adopting any14    specialized meaning of equitable relief that Congress may15    have had in mind in -- in the title 7 context.16              QUESTION:  Well, why wasn't there a reason given17    -- the limitations on the plan's ability to sue elsewhere?18    And as Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg's line of19    questioning suggests, it seems to me that if (A) and (B)20    are both going to do some work in the statute, that to21    insist that (A) simply embodies the historic definition of22    equity is -- is too narrow.  And you can say that what23    Congress intended to do was to expand the injunctive power24    to analogs that are close to equitable actions here in25    accounting or instructions to a guardian or instructions42                                                                                                                                 1    to a trustee, it seems to me, is very close to historic 2    equitable -- 3              MR. TARANTO:  But (B) -- (B) does quite 4    definitely, as Harris Trust indicates, expand beyond 5    injunctions the available relief.  Because Harris Trust, 6    after all, was a classic form of restitution where the 7    money that was being sought was traceable.  It, of course, 8    doesn't have to be the very same money.  It can be either 9    money commingled with other funds or the product or10    profits from it, which are exactly the three things that11    this Court listed in -- in Harris Trust.  That wouldn't,12    under any circumstance, be an injunction, but it would be13    a traditionally available form of equitable relief.14              But that doesn't mean that the whole of15    502(a)(3), both (A) and (B), can reach beyond the limits16    that equity made -- set on the relief that the court of17    chancery would -- would make available.                QUESTION:  No, but your --                QUESTION:  Even if Congress has directed                MR. TARANTO:  I'm sorry?181920    otherwise.2122232425          QUESTION:  The question is, hasn't Congressdirected otherwise necessarily in (A)?          MR. TARANTO:  I -- I don't think so because,again, textually the two clauses are linked by the word43                                       1    other.  And if it weren't the case, then again a plan 2    could write a damages provision into its -- into itself 3    and effectively turn (a)(3) into an authorization to get 4    damages by saying we're just seeking, by enjoining the 5    promised damages that you cause, an injunction. 6              QUESTION:  But you're -- you're using the word 7    other as -- as implying in (A) a limitation of (A) to only 8    those instances in which a 1750 or whatever court of 9    equity would have awarded an injunction.10              But isn't there another way of -- of giving some11    -- some meaning to other here?  And that is to say that12    other was referring back to injunctions which (A) refers13    to simply as a generic form of relief.  Everybody would14    agree.  What -- what's an injunction?  A legal remedy or15    equitable remedy?  Sure, it's an equitable remedy.  And16    the only thing that -- that other is referring to in (B)17    is the kinds of remedy.  It doesn't necessarily imply that18    that kind of remedy, when awarded under (A), was a -- was19    a remedy only in those instances in which in the old law20    it could have been awarded.21              So, why isn't the -- the generic remedy meaning22    of other a satisfactory construction which then leaves the23    courts free to issue any kind of injunction under -- under24    (A) to enjoin a violation of the plan?25              MR. TARANTO:  Well, I -- I guess I -- I find the                                  44                                                                                                                                 1    -- the much more natural reading of this provision in the 2    context of (a)(2) which talks about equitable and other 3    remedial relief and (g)(2) which talks about legal and 4    equitable relief to be that Congress in (a)(3) said we 5    want equitable relief available. 6              And I -- I take it, at least, that a specific 7    illustration of why it doesn't make much sense to separate 8    those -- those apart even aside from what I think is the 9    more natural textual point is that it would allow the plan10    again to write damages provisions into their terms, the11    plan's, and then come into court and say, we want an12    injunction for the beneficiary to pay us any damages that13    are caused by -- by some act because that's what --14              QUESTION:  Yes, but -- presumably, under --15    under (A), under any injunction practice, the -- the court16    would require proof that there was need for an injunction17    in the first place.  In other words, one couldn't simply18    come in and say, gee, they might violate it, so give us an19    injunction.20              But if one could make out a -- a case in the21    first instance for their need -- of a need for the22    injunction, that it seems to me would answer your concern23    that it could be -- that (A) thereby could be turned, in24    effect, through a plan provision into a general legal25 remedy.45                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. TARANTO:  But I'm not sure, I guess, if --if a plan term said the beneficiary -- I mean, I thinkthis could go either way, but to take --          QUESTION:  You're going to take it one stepfurther and say you can always get an injunction under anycircumstances saying pay over the money.          MR. TARANTO:  Right, right.  And I -- and Ithink that that's -- that that's just so far outside anyrecognizable concept of -- of equitable relief --          QUESTION:  Well, I -- I agree but I think it'salso pretty likely outside anything that Congress mighthave been thinking about too.  Isn't it?  In other words,the -- the very fact that Congress perhaps didn't --didn't have that in mind, because it is so far-fetched, isa -- is a good reason to read (A) as -- as broadly as I'm10111213141516    suggesting.17              MR. TARANTO:  Well, I -- I guess I -- I would18    say that it's -- it is a better reason either to let19    Congress alter the statute if unanticipated problems have20    -- have arisen or, more immediately, to make sure that21    preemption law isn't taken to an extreme that precludes22    what I think is the more -- is the preferable solution23    anyway, which is that there is -- by the very terms of the24    plan, there's an intrinsic reference of this interest, of25    this right, to an underlying State court suit.  It is46                                      1    preferable from a systemic point of view, from the point2    of view of avoiding the extra costs of duplicative3    litigation, of avoiding the potential conflict between4    Federal and State courts on either the very same or5    closely related questions for there to be a single,6    consolidated proceeding in which the entire question gets7    wrapped up who is supposed to get the single pot of money.8              There may be special reasons, as there was in9    this case, where the State court is probably uniquely10    entitled to create the special needs trust.  There are11    good reasons for that consolidated State court proceeding12    to be the forum where the plan protects this interest, and13    preemption law I think very readily allows the plan to do14    that.151617181920212223242547                                                                                                                                          As long as there is that outlet, perhaps evenunder Mertens, if there isn't that outlet, but as long asthere is that outlet, then I think the more naturalreading of 502(a)(3) should be respected.          QUESTION:  Mr. Taranto, I think there's sometension between the argument you're making now, which iscertainly a persuasive argument, and the cases you cite onpage 38 of your brief that talk about the gap betweenFederal law and State law.          MR. TARANTO:  Well, those -- I -- I agree thatthere is -- that there are certain gaps between Federal1    and State law that, in the beneficiary context, have2    become all but commonplace because there is an inference,3    which no court has yet figured a way to -- to supersede,4    the way Justice Breyer was talking about, that when5    beneficiary relief under (a)(1) is limited to benefits,6    it's not that Congress has, in effect, determined that7    damages that flow from violation of term plans to -- to8    provide necessary medical services are not available.9 10          If the Court has no further questions.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.          The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 12:02 p.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)11    Taranto.121314151617181920212223242548
