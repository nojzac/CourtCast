Town of Gilbert.      Mr. Cortman.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID CORTMANON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. CORTMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      The town's code discriminates on its face bytreating certain signs differently based solely on whatthey say.  For example, political signs may be 32 squarefeet, may be unlimited in number, and may be placed inthe right­of­way of the entire town for five monthsbefore the election; but the church's signs can only beone­fifth of that side ­­ size, only placed in the darkof night, the night before the church service.      While the church's signs with directionalcontent are only allowed up for 14 hours, other signswith directional content are allowed up for much longer.For example, builders' directional signs to home salesevents are allowed up to be the entire ­­ are allowed upthe entire weekend, and homeowners' association eventsigns are allowed to be up for 30 days.3￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      JUSTICE GINSBURG:are you seeking?  Do you ­­ do you want whatever is themost favorable rule, say, for ideological signs?  Isthat what you want?  Or do you accept that it could besome limit on event signs, say, some reasonable timelimit?MR. CORTMAN: We're ­­ we're seeking the same as the ­­ the favorable signs, which, in this case, would be both ideological and political signs.      And ­­ and the reason on that ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the ideological isn't time unlimited.MR. CORTMAN: Well, but it's not allowed on the right­of­way, and so that's a major factor in this case because political signs are allowed on the right­of­way, and so the treatment that we're seeking is merely equal treatment under the First Amendment.JUSTICE GINSBURG: The same treatment as political signs, then, is that ­­MR. CORTMAN: The ­­ the same treatment as political signs that are allowed up in the right­of­way, that's right.      And ideological signs, interestingly enough,are still based into their own content category, butthey are not allowed on the right­of­way, yet they are4￼Well, what are ­­ what￼1 allowed up for an unlimited period of time.2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you ­­ are you3 seeking unlimited placement?4 MR. CORTMAN: We are not. We're seeking5 placement that any other temporary signs get, which is6 the category that we're talking about.7 And, in fact, the ­­ the city, the town here8 has freedom to regulate the amount of time signs can go9 up, the size of the signs, the number of the signs. All10 our argument is, is that they do it across the board and11 not treat signs differently based on their content.12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your ­­ your13 argument does not turn on the fact that it's a church's14 sign, does it? I mean, you ­­ your argument would be15 the same if this is a temporary sign about where the16 soccer game was going to be?17 MR. CORTMAN: Well, that's right. And ­­18 and the church's sign merely adds additional components19 to it. For example, the town puts our ­­ the church's20 sign into a category called directional signs; but, yet,21 the church's sign has religious speech on it. It has,22 obviously, directional speech. It has ideological23 speech. But that's correct, it's ­­ it's equal24 treatment for that type of sign.25 And ­­ and the category ­­5￼1 JUSTICE KAGAN: Can I ask about the category2 for political signs, which is the most favorable?3 Because all the time this Court says that political4 speech is the most valued kind of speech. It's at the5 heart of the First Amendment. It gets special First6 Amendment protection. So in a way, why aren't ­­7 isn't ­­ isn't the locality here basically adopting the8 same kind of category­based understanding of political9 speech and its special rule and First Amendment analysis10 that this Court has very frequently articulated?11 MR. CORTMAN: But I think this Court has12 also said, for example, that ­­ that religious speech13 also handles that category of core speech under the14 First Amendment. And the problem is, is what the ­­15 what the town does here, it's valuing speech, and I16 think that is one of the problems. It is saying that17 political speech in this case is more valuable than an18 invitation to church.19 And so I think this Court has made clear20 that ­­ that the government ­­21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I ­­ I'm sorry.22 That was the significance of my prior question.23 What ­­ what they're really saying is that24 political speech is more valuable than speech about25 where the soccer game is. In other words, I thought you6￼1 indicated that your argument did not depend on the fact2 that the sign was a sign for the church.3 MR. CORTMAN: Well, that's right. It4 doesn't depend on that fact. I was merely referring to5 the facts of this case. I apologize ­­6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Don't you think that7 political speech is more valuable than directions to the8 soccer game?9 MR. CORTMAN: Maybe in some people's eyes,10 but the problem we have is ­­ is should the government11 be deciding what speech is more valuable than others,12 because that is exactly what it did in this case. It13 has said that, in fact, your speech is not valuable and14 we can completely ban it. And I think one of the15 problems ­­16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, let's ­­ let's17 take a sign that in all other ways is equal except that18 it says no signs on residential property except19 properties that are being sold. And so it's valued the20 homeowner's right to sell its property. Would that be21 contrary of the First Amendment, and if not, why is that22 value any different than valuing political speech?23 MR. CORTMAN: I think it would be. I think24 this Court's case Linmark dealt with a similar25 circumstance, where in that city, it banned all7￼1 residential signs except for ­­ in fact, it was the2 reverse. It banned for sale signs and allowed some3 residential signs that were exceptions.4 But this Court said exactly that, that the5 town shouldn't value different types of speech,6 especially on private property when you have homeowners'7 rights that also comes into play in addition to speech8 rights.9 JUSTICE ALITO: What if it's commercial and10 it relates to a one­time event. For example, for a yard11 sale.12 MR. CORTMAN: Right.13 JUSTICE ALITO: If the State and the city14 allow election­related signs to be put up in the15 right­of­way, then anybody who has a yard sale has an16 equal right?17 MR. CORTMAN: Well, I think ­­ I think18 commercial speech, under this Court's jurisprudence, can19 be treated differently, and that's one of the important20 things. The category here is narrow because government21 speech ­­ government can put up whatever signs that it22 would like. It doesn't trigger any problem under the23 First Amendment.24 We hear a lot in the other briefs about25 warning signs and other types of signs. The government8￼1 is free to put up all the signs that it would like2 without triggering this problem. Commercial speech is3 also in a different category, according to this Court.4 So the narrow category that we're talking5 about is temporary signs, not permanent signs, that are6 put up in the right­of­way that can be regulated.7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think directional8 signs is a valid category?9 MR. CORTMAN: The reason I don't think it is10 is because here, the direction is part of the invitation11 to come and worship or part of the invitation to come to12 a different event. So the directional part of it is in13 addition to the ideological speech, the invitation to14 come in and worship. And so although it appears to be a15 different category of directional, it's important to the16 speech of the church, inviting the community and saying17 come worship with us, and here is where we are located.18 And what's interesting about that, if the19 church, for example, says we're meeting now at a senior20 living center, that is considered to be a directional21 sign because the definition is a sign that is intended22 to invite and direct someone to your service, that would23 then be banned in the right­of­way.24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I guess you see the25 concern, if an affluent person wants to celebrate a91 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425birthday, he can put "Happy birthday, Uncle Fred" asmany places as a political sign, and as for long.MR. CORTMAN: Well, I think one of the issues is if the government has decided that its interest ­­ which, by the way, is what drives this, the interest in safety and aesthetics, which is the two interests the government proposes. If those have already been deemed to be less important than speech, then I think speech should be allowed. But ­­      JUSTICE KENNEDY: But your answer to thequestion is "Happy birthday, Uncle Fred" can have asmany signs and for as long as the political campaign.MR. CORTMAN: I think ­­ I think that is right. And I ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: That has ­­ that has to be ­­ seem to me ­­ what about historical marker, the birthplace of James Madison or whatever?MR. CORTMAN: I think the answer to that is the government is free to put up that marker without any ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no, it's privately ­­ privately owned.MR. CORTMAN: Well, I think if it's ­­ if it's allowing private speech, then we engage in the problem of valuing. For example, in that case, we think10￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that marker is more important than someone else'sspeech.JUSTICE KENNEDY: So again, under your view, "Happy birthday, Uncle Fred" and "Save your soul" and "Birthplace of James Madison" can all be up for the same length of time, same size.MR. CORTMAN: I think it can, because otherwise I think we have a problem with content­based discrimination ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: What about permanent signs? I assume that what you say about temporary signs would apply equally to permanent signs, wouldn't it?MR. CORTMAN: It would, but in a different category. In other words, our category that we're discussing is temporary signs, so ours wouldn't affect permanent signs. I believe you could make ­­ that's a content­neutral category.      But if you had a permanent sign, I thinkwithin the permanent sign category, the answer is ­­      JUSTICE SCALIA:category ­­MR. CORTMAN:     JUSTICE SCALIA:the same ­­MR. CORTMAN:   Within the permanent signYes.   ­­ they all have to haveI believe so, because ­­11￼￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: ­­ except commercial, I2 assume.3 MR. CORTMAN: And especially if ­­ most of4 the permanent signs are commercial signs. When we talk5 about billboards and other types of signs, so this Court6 I think has made clear if you have, for example,7 billboards and other permanent signs that do allow8 commercial speech, then the municipality must allow9 noncommercial speech.10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you11 characterize ­­12 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what would happen if13 one church has a ­­ always meets in the same place and14 it wants to put up a sign that says, every Sunday this15 is the place to go, and another church moves around, so16 it wants to put up a temporary sign. Do they have to be17 treated the same?18 MR. CORTMAN: I think they would. If we're19 talking about the category of what goes on public20 property, what goes on the right­of­way. On their own21 property is a different question. But here, the town22 has already decided to allow an unlimited number of23 political signs up to 30 square ­­ 32 square feet for24 nearly the entire year. There are four elections in25 Arizona, so with this time limit of five months, you12￼1 have political signs in an unlimited number. And those2 signs affect the safety and aesthetics interest the same3 way as the church's sign does, the same way as an4 invitation ­­5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you create your6 temporary category without reading the sign? And7 so there is some force, the counterargument that what is8 being regulated here is not the content but the function9 of the sign. So how do you get around that argument?10 Because you've already created a category that requires11 you to read the sign.12 MR. CORTMAN: I don't think it does, and the13 reason the way the temporary sign is defined here is14 merely a sign that's both intended and constructed not15 to be permanent. So it doesn't matter what is on that16 sign; that's why we think that category is content17 neutral, because as long as it's a temporary sign, it18 doesn't matter what the sign says. A permanent sign is19 just duration, and there can be duration requirements,20 there can be size requirements, location requirements.21 That the government ­­22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your point is if23 it's ­­ if it's stuck in the ground with a little24 stake ­­25 MR. CORTMAN: Right.13￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: ­­ then it can be2 treated one way, but if it's in concrete ­­ but ­­3 MR. CORTMAN: That's right.4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me that5 you are trying to find a, I don't know, a difficult way6 to deal with an issue that could be readily addressed7 just by seeing if the sign is for a limited event. In8 other words, what if somebody ­­ every time ­­ you know,9 the stake in the ground at least could last for three10 weeks, so every three weeks, they come along and stick11 the stake back in the ground. You are saying the only12 way they can distinguish is by looking at whether it has13 a stake in the ground or whether it's in concrete, and14 yet that seems to me that15 doesn't answer the city's16 MR. CORTMAN:17 here is that if the city, the town has already18 agreed that an election is an event, and so we have an19 election that's an event, but yet that single event sign20 can be up for five months, and yet we have an event21 where that single event can only be up overnight. And22 so it's already made that determination that it would23 allow those types of signs for what I think is a24 comparable use, a single event to a single event.25 The other thing I would say is if you allow14doesn't help the ­­ thatlegitimate concern.But I think what is important￼1 signs to be up for one single event for five months,2 certainly there should be some way to say, well, if we3 have a recurring event as we do here, certainly the sign4 should be allowed up at least 5 and ­­6 JUSTICE KENNEDY:7 an election is a single event8 football game, a cookout, a basketball championship,9 it's ­­ it seems to me is a very difficult thing for10 this Court to have to decide. It's just not ­­ a11 political campaign is a dynamic that goes on for some12 weeks that the signs initiate a discussion. Now I can see13 where you can say the religious sign does or at least14 should initiate the same discussion of ­­ on issues that15 are certainly of the same importance, if not more.16 MR. CORTMAN: Certainly ­­17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it seems to me you are18 forcing us into making a very wooden distinction that19 could result in a proliferation of signs for birthday20 parties or for every conceivable event that could be up21 for five months.22 MR. CORTMAN: But I think the problem is23 there ­­ there already is that here, because we have an24 unlimited number of political signs. And so if the25 streets are already littered in an unlimited number of15equal to the same time,Well, I mean, to say thatin the same way as a￼1 political signs, which they are, then how serious is the2 town's interest to reduce clutter? And I think that's3 the problem. The way to reduce clutter is to say, for4 example, many different ways, you can only have one sign5 per block, five signs total. It could only be a certain6 size.7 But it's hard to take the interests8 seriously of reducing clutter when it allows political9 signs to clutter the entire town in an unlimited number10 for the entire year. The church's signs or an event11 signs are not the problem. What we have here is ­­ is12 carte blanche authority for political signs to clutter13 the landscape, unlimited in number for the entire year,14 and yet the concern is for maybe a few more signs that15 may be placed.16 JUSTICE ALITO: Can the town say that signs17 relating to a one­time event, an election or anything18 else that occurs on a particular date, have to be taken19 down within a period of time after that event? And if20 can say that, isn't that content­based, the way you21 define that concept?22 MR. CORTMAN: I don't believe it is. In23 fact, the Washington, D.C., municipal regulations have24 that exact code, and ­­ and it's one that we would25 recommend to the Court. I believe it's 13605.161 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      And what it says is all temporary signsshould be treated the same, period.  You can put ­­ youhave to put your date on the sign for when you put itup.  Every temporary sign can be up for 180 days.  Ifit's tied to an event, after the event is over, it needsto be down 30 days after the event.      I think ­­ our opinion is the reason that iscontent­neutral is whenever something is over, if yourstore is closed, the event is done, then the sign can beremoved.  But the important part is every sign can be upfor the same amount of time, even if it is that eventthat's over now.  And I think that's the way youdeal with these ­­ these single event ­­JUSTICE ALITO: I thought you said the way you distinguish between temporary signs and permanent signs is based on the ­­ the nature of the sign, not what it says.MR. CORTMAN: Right.JUSTICE ALITO: So that gets you over the problem Justice Sotomayor mentioned about having to read the sign.MR. CORTMAN: Right.JUSTICE ALITO: But if this ­­ if there's a rule that says the sign has to be down within a certain period of time after the date of the event, which is on17￼￼1 the sign, I don't see how you get around to reading the2 sign.3 MR. CORTMAN:4 reading is the date, and5 date to be placed on the6 placed and ­­ and for ­­7 is. But I think that ­­8 JUSTICE ALITO:9 sign for a yard sale two Well, what you would be­­ and the code requires thesign both for when the sign isyou know, for what the event   So if somebody puts up adays before the yard sale, then10 they can ­­ that can stay up for 48 days after the yard11 sale? It has 50 days or whatever the period of time is?12 MR. CORTMAN: Yes, according to ­­ according13 to the code. But what is interesting, that time period14 can be anything the town desires. It ­­ it doesn't need15 to be 1617 signs18 size.19 three20 and that's part of our point.21 And I think one of the things to take a ­­22 to take look at is the amici brief that's been filed on23 behalf of the town by the National League of Cities, and24 the reason that brief is important, for example, on25 page 10 and 13, it lists dozens and ­­18­­ and we're not looking for signs all year long.The town can say, for example, temporarycan be up for seven days, they can be a certain Like Washington, D.C., does, you can only havesigns per block, have to be spaced out.

CORTMAN: Page 10 of the amici brief on behalf of the National League of Cities on behalf of the town. And the reason I point out this brief is we don't believe that the content­neutral regulation would tie the hands of the town because, as ­­ as they say, there are dozens and dozens of ways to regulate signs on a content­neutral way. For example, and this has to do with permanent signs ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: What page is this again?MR. CORTMAN: This is page 10 on the National League of Cities' amici brief.JUSTICE SCALIA: Got it.MR. CORTMAN: It says you can regulate locational criteria, off­site signs, number of signs, spacing, setbacks, placement criteria, roof sign, ground signs, wall signs, projecting signs. And all my point is, as we look through their brief, there are innumerable ways for the Court ­­ excuse me ­­ for the town to regulate signs.      There is no reason to look at the content ofthe sign, and the reason is the content of the signaffects the ­­ the government interest of safety andaesthetics in the same way.  If ­­ if you have, forexample, clutter, whether it's the church's sign or a19￼￼1 political sign, it's going to clutter the roadways the2 same way.3 So the way to deal with clutter is an easy4 rule, and, in fact, even the town concedes that the5 content­based test that this Court has ­­ has used and6 that the majority of the circuits now use in the sign7 context ­­ the First Circuit, the Second Circuit, the8 Eighth Circuit, and the Eleventh apply this test to sign9 codes, and what they say, it's actually easier for the10 town because you don’t­­11 JUSTICE BREYER: For the towns it might be.12 What about there are vast areas of the country where13 there is scenery and people want to keep the scenery the14 same, and they don't want signs at all, but they don't15 want to say no signs because someone who wants to put up16 a sign that says Geronimo is buried 50 feet away from17 here.18 MR. CORTMAN: Right.19 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, if they say, okay,20 we'll make an exception for that, does that mean that21 they have to have an exception for everything, and22 pretty soon the entire State of Wyoming is just filled23 with clutter?24 MR. CORTMAN: I wouldn't say everything.25 But what I would say is ­­ is content­neutral20￼1 categories. But they can say, for example, each person2 could ­­3 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, it's not a4 content­neutral category. What it is, is it is a5 category that says if you want to say Geronimo is buried6 here you can, because that will bring people to look at7 the grave, and that's it; we don't want anything else.8 We're trying to keep the place looking nice.9 Now, that's not a city. Cities are filled10 with clutter anyway, at least most parts. But that's ­­11 so ­­ so what is ­­ I'm trying to drive at what is your12 definition of "content­neutral," which is something that13 I wonder since I think the entire U.S. Code is filled14 with content distinctions. All of crime is filled with15 content distinctions. All of regulation has content16 distinctions.17 So what is it precisely in respect to the18 content­neutral rule that is consistent with the U.S.19 Code and is consistent with the example, if any, that I20 gave?21 MR. CORTMAN: The definition we would22 propose is the same one this Court has used since the23 Mosley case about what is content­based, and that is if24 there ­­ the restriction or the regulation looks at the25 subject matter, looks at ­­211 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      JUSTICE BREYER:code and solicitation, where if you solicit for certainthings you commit serious crimes, and if you commitcertain ­­ solicit for certain other things, they areless serious and so forth.

This, in3 fact, is a criminal law. If you continue to put up your4 signs, you could actually get fined and jail time. So I5 believe the First Amendment would also apply if it's6 speech­related.7 An answer to your hypothetical, I think8 there are many ways for the locality to regulate those9 signs. For example, if it doesn't want many signs, it10 can say one person can put up a temporary sign or a11 permanent sign or whatever have you.12 But to say, for example, you could put up a13 private sign because you think this one location is14 interesting, what if another person has a location they15 want people to come visit? Should the government be16 able to say, well, we think your location is important,17 but your location is not.18 And our response is the government could put19 up the sign if it ­­ if it wants to make that choice20 about historical landmarks or other types of signs or21 directional types of signs.22 I ­­ I'd like to reserve the remainder of23 time for rebuttal if I may.24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,25 Mr. Cortman.231 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Mr. Feigin.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J.

FEIGIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:      We agree with Petitioners that Respondents'ordinance here is unconstitutional, but we think that acontext­specific intermediate scrutiny approach shouldapply in evaluating speech­permissive exceptions to asign ordinance where those exceptions are based on thesame longstanding traditional rationales that justifythe sign ordinance as a whole.      A wooden application of strict scrutiny inthis context would suggest that it's presumptivelyunconstitutional, for example, for a town to limit signson public property but have an exception if you want topaint your street number on your curb.      Now, that doesn't make a great deal ofpractical sense, and that's not an example I just madeup.  That's essentially the ordinance that this Courtupheld, albeit without specifically addressing thisparticular issue, in Taxpayers for Vincent.      On a theoretical level, the normal reasonsfor deep judicial skepticism of exceptions to a24￼￼1 regulation of speech don't apply in the context of that2 street address exception, exceptions for danger or3 safety signs, or other types of exceptions that track4 the normal safety and nonproliferation rationales for a5 sign regulation. Those kinds of exceptions don't create6 any inference that the government is attempting to favor7 one viewpoint or another, that it's trying to limit the8 set of ideas that are going to come into the public9 marketplace, or that it doesn't truly believe in the10 safety and nonproliferation rationales that underlie the11 sign regulation as a whole.12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I mean, you ­­13 you obviously know the difficulty with that, which is14 how does the government decide when there should be an15 exception or how does a court decide when there should16 be an exception and when there shouldn't be? I mean, I17 understood the whole point of the strict scrutiny for18 content­based restrictions is to find out which are the19 types of speech or the particular types of regulation20 that should be given an exception, rather than starting21 with saying, well, you don't apply this scrutiny because22 there ought to be an exception.23 MR. FEIGIN: Well, I think the main problem24 with strict scrutiny in this context is it sends a25 signal to legislatures that they are on safer ground if25￼1 they enact a broad and undifferentiated restriction on2 signs than if they try to tailor it only to those types3 of signs that actually cause the problem that they are4 trying to prevent.5 And I think that the way the Court can6 manage the situation is to see whether, under7 intermediate scrutiny, there really are safety and­or8 nonproliferation rationales that track onto whatever9 exception is being drawn.10 So if we could use, for example, Justice11 Sotomayor's example of the "For Sale" signs. A town12 might permissibly have an ordinance that limits the13 number of signs you can have on your lawn to two, two14 signs of any type; but it might also say, you know,15 we're not going to count "for Sale" signs against your16 quota of two and the reason is that "For Sale" signs are17 only up on a very small percentage of properties at any18 given of time, they are up for a very limited purpose19 when the property is for sale, and they go down once the20 sale is consummated.21 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you want us to sort ­­22 sort these ordinances out one by one and examine each of23 these exceptions and say, you know, this is okay and24 this isn't okay? I don't know that the Federal25 Judiciary is numerous enough to do that, and it's a much26￼1 more simple rule that the other side presents: Treat2 all signs the same. If clutter is the problem, they all3 clutter. And you shouldn't ­­ you shouldn't allow or4 disallow on the basis of the message.5 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, it's a simple6 rule, but I think it's an extremely impractical rule7 that is going to foreclose experimentation and local8 solutions to local problems.9 Let me give you another example of a town10 that has some sort of sign restriction, but it doesn't11 apply that sign restriction to safety signs like12 "Children at Play" or "Hidden Driveway Ahead." If you13 are going to apply strict scrutiny to those kinds of14 exceptions, they are probably not going to pass muster15 unless it's a really watered­down version of strict16 scrutiny that I think is unfamiliar to the courts.17 There is actually a fairly robust18 empirically ­­19 JUSTICE SCALIA: What is the problem? You20 make ­­ you make your sign limits big enough that those21 signs will attract attention, that's all.22 MR. FEIGIN: Well, I think towns23 legitimately should not have to be put to the choice if24 they want to prevent the proliferation of signs that25 would cause safety problems ­­27￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA:2 signs, in which case they can be as big as the town3 wants. We're just talking about private signs here.4 MR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, I'm not ­­5 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you're ­­ you're saying6 every private individual has to have a big sign,7 "Children At Play," right?8 MR. FEIGIN: Well, I don't want to resist9 too hard the idea that the Government can put up any10 signs it wants, but I think the reason we think the11 Government could put up the signs here is not because12 the Government can say that it can speak on certain13 topics and private citizens can't, but because of the14 nature of the signs that are being put up, which means15 that some work has to be done here by the fact that the16 types of signs I described are safety signs.17 Now, if we’re going to subject that kind of18 exception to strict scrutiny, it turns out there's actually19 a fairly robust empirical debate about whether "Children20 At Play" signs or "Hidden Driveway Ahead" signs actually21 do enhance safety. And courts are going to have to make a22 one­size­fits­all conclusion about whether the state of23 the evidence, which right now is fairly equivocal,24 justifies that sort of exception. I think courts are25 likely ­­28Or have the town put up the￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I'm not2 sure ­­ I'm not sure your whole approach is not3 precluded by our decision in McCullen. There, we said4 that a facially neutral law does not become content­5 based simply because it may disproportionately affect6 certain types of certain topics. And we said the7 question in such a case ­­ in other words, when you are8 dealing with a facially neutral law ­­ is whether the9 law is justified without reference to the content. So10 it seems to me that you've got to get over the content11 neutrality. Your argument only applies when it's12 content neutral and yet here we're dealing with a13 situation where you're saying it's an exception to the14 content­based rule.15 MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I think16 the Court can deal with the competing interests in this17 case more easily not by getting bogged down in the18 definition of content­based and content­neutral, which I19 can address in a second, but by focusing more on the20 bottom­line question of whether this is an appropriate21 case for the application of strict scrutiny or22 intermediate scrutiny.23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: When you use those labels24 in the context of the First Amendment, do they mean the25 same thing that they mean in equal protection? That is,29￼1 intermediate scrutiny is a pretty tough standard in2 equal protection.3 MR. FEIGIN: Well, I think there are a4 couple of flavors of intermediate scrutiny, both under5 the Constitution at large and under the First Amendment6 in particular. I think here we would be urging7 something more like a reasonable fit test, which we8 think would give municipalities enough room to draw the9 kinds of distinctions that I think they reasonably10 should be able to make between painting your street11 number on your curb so people can more easily find your12 house and restrictions on, you know, particular types of13 speech that are much more likely to be motivated by14 disagreement with that speech.15 We do think that intermediate scrutiny has a16 fair amount of teeth in the circumstance, I mean, and17 we're putting our money where our mouth is because we18 think that the particular ordinance at issue here fails19 intermediate scrutiny.20 But intermediate scrutiny would give21 municipalities enough room to draw these kinds of22 distinctions and to draw, in particular, the kinds of23 distinctions that are drawn in the Highway24 Beautification Act, which allows certain types of signs25 that do enhance safety and aesthetics, but generally30￼1 doesn't allow the ground on the sides of freeways to2 become a breeding ground for signs which would decrease3 driver safety and decrease appreciation ­­4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:5 I'm sorry.6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:8 library could say big books are preferable to little9 books and it so happens that big books are coffee books10 and little books tend to be mostly political, so we're11 going to put all the political books in the basement and12 all the big books on the main floor?13 Is that a distinction that the First14 Amendment permits?15 MR. FEIGIN: I think a court might be16 reasonably fairly skeptical of that kind of distinction.17 But I think signs, Your Honor, present particular First18 Amendment problems that the Court had to grapple with19 and didn't quite resolve in MetroMedia and City of20 Ladue.21 One distinct problem with signs is that22 the ­­ it's very difficult for legislatures to tailor23 sign regulations and describe types of signs that it24 doesn't think it needs to regulate to advance its25 interest, thereby allow more speech, without describing31Do you think that a ­­    Justice Sotomayor.Do you think that a￼1 those types of2 content­based.3 very difficult4 context­specific rule in this circumstance would be5 appropriate.6 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see why. I mean,7 you say it, but why is it true? Just make whatever the8 sign requirement is big enough that any private signs9 that need to get people's attention will get people's10 attention.11 MR. FEIGIN: Well, I think ­­12 JUSTICE SCALIA: What you say about signs I13 assume applies to noise as well, right? If the city has14 a noise ordinance, it can distinguish between noises for15 various purposes. A political sound truck before an16 election can be given a higher allowance, and, I don't17 know, a street evangelist given a lower allowance.18 MR. FEIGIN: I don't think that would be19 permissible, Your Honor. I think one key here is that20 the types of exceptions we're talking about, the only21 types we think should be subject to intermediate22 scrutiny, are ones that track the safety and23 nonproliferation rationales for the sign ordinance as a24 whole. If the City is advancing a distinction based on25 the fact that they think political speech or ideological32signs in a manner that could be viewed as  And that's what makes sign regulationand why we think some sort of￼1 speech is more valuable than, say, religious speech, we2 think that would be subject to strict scrutiny.3 Thank you.4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.5 Mr. Savrin.6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP W. SAVRIN7 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS8 MR. SAVRIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it9 please the Court:10 The problem with applying strict scrutiny in11 this case or this type of case is that it will have, we12 believe, the opposite effect. It will limit speech13 because towns, cities will enact one size fits all. In14 order to do that, as Petitioner's counsel indicated,15 there need to be limitations on the number of signs, on16 the duration of signs. The signs would have to be all17 large enough to accommodate the largest message that18 needs to be communicated.19 And in order to pass strict scrutiny, the20 legislatures in these towns and cities across this21 country would be inclined to ban all signs except those22 that the First Amendment absolutely allows.23 JUSTICE ALITO: You can make that argument24 in all kinds of contexts. I don't know where it gets25 you. Suppose that the question is, whether the town is33￼1 going to allow anybody to speak in a park, and the2 town ­­ the town council says, well, you know, we would3 like to have people be able to speak on subjects that we4 like, but there are some subjects we really don't like.5 We don't want people to speak on those. So we have the6 choice, we allow everybody to speak or we allow nobody7 to speak.8 So you can make exactly that same argument in lots9 of other contexts where I don't think the distinction10 could be justified. Isn't that right?11 MR. SAVRIN: I think there is a difference,12 Justice Alito, in signs as opposed to speech because13 signs do take up physical space. They displace other14 uses of land, and they perform different functions.15 One thing that we would like to emphasize in16 this case is that the temporary directional sign17 provision is limited to in signs that are intended to18 guide travelers along a route from Point A to Point B.19 If they have expressive content on them, then they are20 no longer a directional sign but are then an expressive21 sign; and there is a different provision that applies22 for that.23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So if the sign here said,24 "We welcome you to attend our church service," and then25 it says on the bottom, meeting place, and it specifies34￼1 the meeting place, but the message is "we welcome you to2 attend our service," that's ideological?3 MR. SAVRIN: That is ideological. That4 would not be a directional sign because it's not5 directing travelers along ­­ along the route to that6 location.7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it says also "welcome8 you to attend our church service, it will be held at."9 So it's giving the direction, but it's also expressing10 the message that everyone is welcome to come worship.11 MR. SAVRIN: I believe the way that this12 code has been interpreted, Justice Ginsburg, is that13 that would not be a directional sign because it's not14 saying turn right, turn left, go straight a few miles.15 It's not giving directions about how to get there.16 So I believe that that type of sign would be17 permitted under this ordinance as an ideological sign18 and would not be limited to the terms of the temporary19 directional.20 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Savrin, could I ask what21 the ­­ your justification is for these specially22 generous provisions on ideological signs? I mean,23 putting aside the level of scrutiny, why do you have24 these very generous rules for ideological signs as25 compared to others?35￼1 MR. SAVRIN: Well, specifically on the2 ideological signs is to protect the First Amendment3 right of anyone to speak on any topic at any time. The4 difference in the ­­5 JUSTICE KAGAN: So you are not even6 purporting to have a content­neutral justification for7 this. You are essentially saying, yes, we generally8 dislike clutter, but we're willing to make exceptions9 for clutter for speech that we think has special First10 Amendment significance.11 MR. SAVRIN: That would not be our position,12 Justice Kagan. Our position is that it's not13 content­based in a constitutional sense for purposes of14 applying strict scrutiny, that the distinction is15 permissible here without relation to the content or in16 terms of favoring or censoring certain viewpoints or17 ideas.18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, viewpoint19 discrimination is quite different from content20 discrimination. And you are trying to reduce our rules21 against discriminating on the basis of content to a rule22 against viewpoint discrimination.23 MR. SAVRIN: Not just view ­­24 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, ideological signs,25 that is a content category, and there is as much a First361 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Amendment right to give somebody directions as there isto speak about ­­ about being green or whatever else.Is there no First Amendment right to give somebodydirections?MR. SAVRIN: Justice Scalia, we would say that the ­­ they perform different functions. It certainly ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: They sure do, but is there a First Amendment right for these other messages or not?MR. SAVRIN: I think they would have a right to speak, and I think that they do have that right to speak and that intermediate scrutiny applies to regulations about how speech can be communicated as opposed to what can be communicated.JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you did say in your brief that the First Amendment does not require directional signs, so they could be banned altogether.MR. SAVRIN: I think if it's narrowly tailored and meets the intermediate scrutiny test in a particular jurisdiction, then ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that is a lot of words. I'm giving you an example.The law says no directional signs. That's the law. Does that ­­ is ­­ does that offend the First Amendment?37￼25 JUSTICE BREYER:First question would be:￼1 MR. SAVRIN: I think that it ­­ well, when2 you say offend the First Amendment, I think you would3 have to apply the intermediate scrutiny analysis and our4 position would be that it would ­­ that it could survive5 that analysis.6 If I could return to Justice Kagan's7 question about the interests that are served, it's8 different. A directional sign, there needs to be more9 than in order to direct travelers along a route, so that10 justifies a ­­ perhaps a smaller size. There is no11 contention in the record; in fact, the court of appeals12 found that they function as intended. As far as the13 duration is concerned, there's no travelers going to an14 event that is not presently occurring. In fact, the15 Town of Gilbert expanded the time frame from 2 hours to16 12 hours, and I ­­ our question is whether or not that17 is something that implicates First Amendment18 jurisprudence as opposed to ­­19 JUSTICE BREYER: You say on ­­ suppose we're20 talking about the context of signs. You say, well,21 let's look to the purpose of forbidding ­­ any22 prohibition, and I guess it has to do with safety or23 beautification.24 MR. SAVRIN: Yes.38￼1 Is there some category that you don't allow to put up2 signs? Answer, no. Everybody can put up signs.3 So what about applying strict scrutiny to4 that? If you are going to distinguish on the basis of5 what the sign says, you have to have an awfully good6 reason, if your decision is you can't put up one at all.7 Next, you put them up, but you have all content ­­ all8 kinds of distinctions how, how long, et cetera.9 Now,10 have more11 the sign.12 municipal13 or something. I mean, you know, you maybe have more14 leeway there.15 But still they're saying you would flunk16 even that test here because there isn't really a very17 good reason at all in this case for making the sign18 smaller or for putting it there for such a short time.19 Now, how do you react ­­ there are three20 parts: One, very tough if you are going to say you21 can't put it up at all, sometimes called strict22 scrutiny; two, somewhat more lenient if it gets up, but23 you are trying to distinguish among how and under what24 circumstances, how long; and then three, do you even25 satisfy that one? That's called time, place and manner,39in respect to that, maybe you shouldleeway, leeway depending upon the purpose of  So if, for example, it's about an open air,movie, you could say put up signs about movies￼1 the second one.2 MR. SAVRIN: Yes, okay. Well, with respect3 to the first one, the interest most of the times in sign4 ordinance regulations as the ­­ as you've indicated, is5 aesthetics and safety. With respect to aesthetics, I6 don't believe that that would meet the definition of a7 compelling interest, so that it's ­­ it's automatically,8 presumptively, and conclusively unconstitutional if the9 strict scrutiny is applied and that's the ­­ there is no10 compelling interest.11 With respect to the interests at stake here,12 we again believe that directional signs are functionally13 different from an ideological sign or even from a14 political sign, that the directional signs do not need15 to be larger and also that there are more of them. And16 so if there are more of them, the trade­off is ­­ at17 least the legislature in this town has decided the18 trade­off is that they need to be smaller because they19 need to guide travelers along a route.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: And political signs are21 there almost all year, on the rights­of­way. You talk22 about clutter. What if somebody doesn't like politics,23 and he says politics is spinach. I want ideology. I24 would like ideological signs on the right­of­way. You25 say, I'm sorry, you are wrong, we think politics is more40￼1 important, because we are politicians and we're on the2 city council.3 (Laughter.)4 MR. SAVRIN: I have two responses to that,5 Justice Scalia. The first one is that there is a6 statute in Arizona that this ordinance complies with in7 terms of the placement, the duration, and the size of8 the political signs. The town doesn't have any leeway9 in that because it needs to comply with the statute.10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does this State statute11 have the same size and duration? The State statute says12 that you have to allow political signs, but does it13 specify the size and the duration?141516 town 171819 State law?20 MR. SAVRIN:21 JUSTICE SCALIA:22 Amendment complaint is, what, the State made me do it?23 MR. SAVRIN: Well, our defense ­­ well, in24 part, yes, because we need to comply with the statute,25 and it doesn't make sense that, as a result, all signs41MR. SAVRIN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it does. JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you're saying that the ordinance just mirrors the State?MR. SAVRIN:JUSTICE GINSBURG:Yes.  Yes, it does.      And do you have thatI do.  It's section 16­1019.    So your defense to a First￼1 need to be ­­ meet those provisions for purposes of2 preserving beauty, reducing clutter, so on and so forth.3 JUSTICE SCALIA: It makes a lot of sense if4 you believe in the First Amendment.5 MR. SAVRIN: Well ­­6 JUSTICE SCALIA: If you believe that neither7 the State nor the city is entitled to say politics is8 really important, as opposed to music.9 MR. SAVRIN: The other consideration here,10 Justice Scalia, is that we're talking about public11 property. And one of the issues that has not been12 developed, certainly in the record in this ­­ at this13 Court, is the extent to which the government can select14 subject matter for what is a non­traditional public15 forum. So there are issues as well that would need to16 be developed a little bit further before any application17 of intermediate scrutiny, we say, could be continued ­­18 if they ­­ if the ­­ if their ­­ if this Court were to19 find problems with the Ninth Circuit's application of20 intermediate scrutiny, and I think that there would21 still be some issues on location that would need to be22 developed on the public forum, and that ­­23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You say the street is not24 a ­­ not a traditional public forum?25 MR. SAVRIN: That is the ­­ certainly42￼1 Gilbert's position. It was something that was argued in2 the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit did not resolve3 that issue. But I believe that would be a question of4 Arizona law.5 But, again, we have not developed that and6 that issue has not been developed in this ­­ at this ­­7 in this Court, and I think the reason is because the8 issue in this Court is whether or not strict scrutiny9 applies.10 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, how do you justify11 the ­­ the differing treatments of Petitioner's sign, on12 the one hand, and the weekend builder event signs and13 homeowners' association signs? Homeowners' association14 signs can be 80 square feet, and the Petitioner's sign15 can be 6 square feet.16 MR. SAVRIN: The homeowners' signs are not17 really directional signs, because they can only be18 within the residential community. They are not19 directing travelers off site, in a generic sense, to a20 location. There is also a permit requirement.21 And the other thing is ­­ about the 8022 square feet is, that is total sign area. That's not one23 sign. That's the total sign area you can have.2425 denied one of those permits?43CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Has anyone ever been     MR. SAVRIN:     JUSTICE ALITO:     MR.

SAVRIN: I don't know the answer to that question, Your Honor.JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose the Petitioners want to put up a sign that says, we're having a churchservice at 10:00 o'clock on Sunday morning. Under your code, when can they put that up and when do they have to take it down?MR. SAVRIN: They could put it up 12 hours before, so that would be 10:00 o'clock p.m., and they could take it ­­ and they have to take down, I believe it's an hour afterwards.JUSTICE ALITO: So they can put it up after dark on Saturday and then they have to take it down within an hour after, when, the commencement of the service, or ­­                             Do you think that reallygives them an opportunity to invite people to come totheir service?MR. SAVRIN: The purpose of these signs isnot supposed to be invitational; it's supposed to be directional. If the event was occurring at 10:0044￼1 o'clock at night or at2 could be up during the day. If the event occurs all6:00 o'clock in the evening, it3 weekend long, it could4 it's tied to the event.5 So in that sense, it ­­ it absolutely serves6 its purpose for having on ­­ on the 12 hours before,7 because if they want to invite members of the public to8 the services, they can and do have many other9 opportunities and alternatives ­­ including signage,10 including the ideological sign ­­ that they can use.11 JUSTICE ALITO: So they could put up a,12 quote/unquote, ideological sign that says, "Come to our13 service on Sunday morning," but no arrow, and then they14 put up another sign that says, this is the arrow? Or15 maybe they put up on the first sign, "Come to our16 service on Sunday morning; we can't tell you now where17 it will be because the town won't let us, but if you18 come ­­ if you drive by here tomorrow morning at a19 certain time, you will see an arrow."20 (Laughter.)21 MR. SAVRIN: The sign could say, Your Honor,22 where it is taking place, but if it is intending to23 guide travelers to that location, then it would need to24 comply with ­­ with the provisions.

SAVRIN: Well, Your Honor ­­ our14 response to that, Your Honor, is that the directional15 signs, in order to work, need to guide travelers along16 the route. So there's going to be a whole lot of these17 signs in order for them to function as intended. It can18 be a mile away, it can be two miles away.19 So having just one sign, perhaps, under20 the Court's hypothetical, it seems rather silly, but if21 you are thinking about having a whole bunch of these22 signs over a long distance, then I think then that ­­23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does Good News ­­ does24 the Good News church have a number of signs ­­ just as25 illustration, how many signs do they have?473 that 45 when6 pass78they have quite a few.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you see that caryou ­­ can you see that sign at all when you­­MR.

I know9 all when you pass in a moving car?10 MR. SAVRIN: Yes. In fact, the court of11 appeals has found that it functioned as intended and12 there is no indication that ­­ that it did not. So13 there's ­­ it seems to me that those are the kind of14 decisions, as far as size, duration, are ones that15 should be the fodder of legislative deliberation. And16 as long as it meets the intermediate scrutiny test, it17 should pass Constitutional muster.18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Whatever that is. Whatever19 that is, right?20 MR. SAVRIN: Well, the intermediate scrutiny21 test, I think, is if it's narrowly tailored, and also if22 there are alternative modes of communication. But I23 think that applying strict scrutiny to these types of24 regulations will result in sign ordinances being struck25 down uniformly, just about, and the only speech that ­­481 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that will be allowed will be speech that is constitutionally required. Everything else will not be.     But I think the problem, if there is one,that Gilbert has gotten into is that it allows a lot ofspeech that a lot of other ordinances might not in a lotof different formats.MR.

And what we're saying ­­JUSTICE KAGAN: So that goes back to what Justice Scalia said. It's viewpoint neutral, but, you know, it's content­based. And maybe you are just saying that we've run amok on this content­based distinction, and there would be an argument there. But, I mean, it is content­based to say what is ideology and what isnot.MR. SAVRIN: And I would agree that that's what we're arguing, Your Honor, that what we're saying is that the First Amendment is ­­ guards against the abridgment of speech. And having a rigid content50￼1 definition to be the on/off switch for whether strict2 scrutiny or intermediate scrutiny applies does ­­ is not3 workable, does not achieve common­sense results.

SAVRIN: Well, the person ­­10 JUSTICE SCALIA: So we're ­­ we're supposed11 to sit here and say, oh, political speech is the most12 valuable and then you can allow that, but ideological speech13 comes in a close second, and then what?

I17 don't think you should want any governmental official,18 even ­­ even a judge, to do stuff like that.19 MR.

And we don't19 believe that that in and of itself justifies strict20 scrutiny.21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.22 Mr. Cortman, you have four minutes23 remaining.24 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. CORTMAN25 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS53MR. SAVRIN:a ­­ a nuance, as the Federal government hasNo.  We think that there needs￼1 MR. CORTMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.2 Just a few quick points in response, if I may.3 Clarification point on the State statute.4 First of all, when this case began, the State statute5 was not in effect, and political signs were actually6 allowed up for longer than the period of time. When the7 State statute was enacted, it actually lessened that8 time. So it's not the State's doing that the town9 decided to allow political signs in its ­­ in its10 right­of­way.11 But even with the State statute, the ­­ if12 the State has decided that its interest in free speech13 in political signs outweighs the interest in safety and14 aesthetics, then the town should basically adopt an15 ordinance that abides by that. And the simple way to do16 that is to treat it as a constitutional floor. If the17 State has decided that we're going to allow political18 signs up for that period of time ­­ and by the way, the19 statue doesn't mention other signs. So it's not a20 restriction like this town code is. All it says is,21 we've deemed it important enough for political signs to22 be up for ­­23 JUSTICE KENNEDY:24 political signs.25 MR. CORTMAN:54    It's just permissive forThat's right.  And so the￼1 response by the town is, okay, if that's the case and2 the State has decided that political signs outweigh our3 interests in safety and aesthetics, the way we deal with4 that is treating other similar signs the same.5 I think, a couple other points, the noise6 ordinance is a perfect example, whether it's the that7 side case or the Kobachs case. This ordinance would be8 akin to allowing, for example, political speech to be9 much louder in decibels and for longer periods of time,10 and someone on the street corner inviting someone to11 church must be quieter and for lesser periods of time.12 And quickly, if I may address the safety and13 beautification interests, they are certainly important14 interests. But as this Court said several times in15 Carey v. Brown, for example, and Discovery Network, the16 distinctions, the content­based distinctions in the code17 bear no relationship to the government interest. The18 distinctions don't advance those interests.19 And as to being under­inclusive, I think20 it's similar to what this Court found in Discovery21 Network. When there the town wanted to prohibit 62 news22 racks and then allow 1,500 to 2,000 news racks to23 remain, this Court said that was under­inclusive and24 would fail just on that. Here, the town is allowing an25 unlimited number of political signs, but then551 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425prohibiting just a few other signs.     Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
