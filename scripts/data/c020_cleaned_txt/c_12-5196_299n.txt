Alfred H. Siegel, Chapter 7 Trustee.      Mr. Hellman.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW S. HELLMANON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. HELLMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:      Congress expressly prohibited what thebankruptcy court did here.  Under Section 522(k) of theCode, Congress specified that a debtor's exemptproperty, his homestead, his pension, his wedding ring,is not liable for the payment of, quote, "anyadministrative expense."JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Will you crank up your ­­ your thing? I can't you hear well enough. That's good.MR. HELLMAN: Congress, in Section 522(k), specified specifically that a debtor's exempt property is not liable for any administrative expense.      The bankruptcy court was not free tooverride that express and specific prohibition in thename of equity, a point that has been clear for at least3￼JUSTICE ALITO:It's less than $70,000.  So￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314151617181920212223242580 years, since this Court's case in Ginsberg & Sons,and said Congress made the judgment that debtors andtheir dependents, even dishonest debtors, ought not bedeprived of their exempt property such that they wouldemerge from bankruptcy as wards of the State.      Instead, Congress authorized other seriouspunishments for debtor misconduct.  But arguments forpunishment that the Code forbids must be addressed toCongress and not the supposed equitable discretion ofthe bankruptcy court.      Now, if I could, I'd like to ­­JUSTICE ALITO: I am somewhat taken aback by your constant reference ­­ your repeated references to "wards of the State."      What we're talking about is whether yourclient gets $75,000.  Do you think everybody who doesn'thave $75,000 is a ward of the State?MR. HELLMAN: This is his last $75,000, Your Honor.JUSTICE ALITO: Yes. Well, do you ­­ do you know what the ­­ the median net worth of a household in the United States is?MR. HELLMAN: It's ­­ it's about ­­ I'm not sure what the median net worth ­­4￼1 the question here is not whether he's going to be a ward2 of the State. The question is whether he's going to be3 above the median in his assets.4 MR. HELLMAN: Well, I think what's going on5 here, Your Honor, is actually a federalism principle.6 Congress recognized, in 522, that States, in effect,7 would be the ones who would have to take care of those8 who do not have a home, do not have tools of trade, do9 not have a pension.10 And so what 522 does is it says that the11 State authorizes you an exemption, and you claim it, and12 it becomes exempt, then you get to keep it through the13 bankruptcy law, because otherwise, in effect, it is the14 State that ends up being required to house or support15 or ­­ or help those and their dependents who are16 deprived of, essentially, their last dollar, which is17 what is exactly the case here.18 Here every penny ­­ all of Mr. Law's19 creditors in this case have been paid off. The trustee20 has already received approximately $280,000. We're just21 talking about literally, literally, the last $75,000,22 and all of it, that would be going to the trustee.23 JUSTICE GINSBURG:24 because I thought that $75,00025 of the claim, that there would5I don't follow that,would go to satisfy partstill be the legal feesJUSTICE ALITO:What was ­­ what was the￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425unpaid.MR. HELLMAN: All his creditors ­­ the debtsthat existed beforehand ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. But now the ­­ thetrustee, who is obliged to try to find what assets he orshe can, spends a huge amount of money in order to ­­ toprove that this claim of a second mortgage was false.      And ­­ and there should be ­­ so whathappens then, on your theory, that all that money wasspent and the result is that the second mortgage iscanceled; the creditors are satisfied?  Nobody pays thelegal expenses.  Is that ­­MR. HELLMAN: Well, the first 280,000 have been satisfied, and the trustee was not obligated by any law to pursue the administration of the estate in a way that would be cost­ineffective.      But our point here is that Congress had madethe determination ­­ we could have ­­ there could be apolicy discussion, of course, about whether exemptproperty ought to be allowed to go to the administrativecosts of the estate or to prepetition creditors insituations in which the ­­ a court finds litigationmisconduct.      But that is not the judgment Congress made.6￼1 trustee supposed to do? Suppose the trustee has a meter2 running on ­­ on his desk, and he's hot in pursuit of3 this phantom Lily Lin of China, but we get ­­ we get to4 the point where he's down to the ­­ he says, well, if I5 do any more work, the only way I'm going to get paid is6 out of the $75,000. I better stop because, otherwise,7 I'm going to be working free.8 What should he do?9 MR. HELLMAN: Well, the trustee, in that10 situation ­­ and the trustee handbook, pages 4­3, 4­4 of11 the trustee handbook that the United States Office of12 Trustee puts out, notes that administrators on the13 estate ought to assess whether or not pursuing a claim14 will be an effective ­­ will yield an effective return15 for the estate.16 And, again, Congress, made the judgment17 that, when a debtor lies to a court, he loses his18 discharge. And that has an effect on the debtor's19 obligations going forward. It means that the debtor's20 prepetition debts, to the extent they're unsatisfied,21 stay with him for the rest of his life.22 But Congress did not say the denial of23 discharge allows the trustee to recover anything more24 than it otherwise would.25 So, again, I think the question is one of7￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425policy, and one the policy where Congress has spokenclearly.  The text of ­­      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:policy?MR. HELLMAN:      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:me that a court's sanctioning power is among one of themost respected and longstanding powers.  So puttingaside the government's reliance on the statutory scheme,I don't see it.  But how about the inherent power?MR. HELLMAN: Well, inherent power ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Meaning, you want to read a preclusion of the inherent power out of ­­ not from an express term, but implicitly.MR. HELLMAN: No, Your Honor. Just ­­ I should note, of course, inherent power was never argued below, nor presented in the bio. But I think the more important response to your question is the following:We are not talking in this case about the inherent power to sanction a litigant.      This ­­ we don't dispute that Rule 11 existsand other punishments exist under the Code.      This case is about a court saying theproperty from which that ­­ that sanction can besatisfied, out of what property can that sanction be8Can we talk about thatYes, Your Honor.      I mean, it would seem to6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. HELLMAN: Not ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ inherent power, can't use that property. That's what you're saying.MR. HELLMAN: My point is that there is no longstanding tradition of the same vein of a court being able to sanction, to be able to say, you owe attorneys' fees for this bad conduct. That's not what this case is about. This case is about the property out of which that sanction can be paid.And Congress spoke specifically. And when Congress speaks specifically, this Court recognized in NASCO, in Nova Scotia, and in a long line of cases beforehand, in the Article III context no less, in the Article III court, this Court recognized that where Congress speaks expressly, a court does not have the inherent power or otherwise to reach the contrary result.      And I think the Ginsberg case is quite onpoint here because the facts of that case were strikingeven today.      There, in Ginsberg, the debtor was a9￼1234 its ­­ 5paid or forced to be paid. And there ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you are talkingabout the inherent power.  You're saying a court, in￼1 corporation, and an officer of that corporation was2 seeking to flee the jurisdiction with corporate cash,3 funds of the corporation. A creditor went to the4 bankruptcy court and said, we need to detain this5 person, arrest him. He's fleeing with property of the6 estate.7 This Court said the arrest writ was not8 valid. Why? Because the Bankruptcy Code specified the9 situations in which arrest was authorized.10 Conditions A, B, and C needed to be11 satisfied. This was situation D, and the creditor12 adverted to the general equitable powers of the13 bankruptcy court, which are codified then, as now, in14 a provision. And this Court said, no, the specific15 provision that's at stake here, at issue here, means16 that the equitable provision, the general equity cannot17 overcome that.18 And in fact, Ginsberg was a less clear case19 than this one. The arrest provision in Ginsberg was20 framed affirmatively. You may arrest if situations A, B21 and C are here. And the Court said you can't add22 situation D to that.23 This is a case not by implication, but an24 express prohibition: Exempt property is not liable for25 the payment of any administrative expense, save in two10￼1 situations. It wasn't even as if Congress ­­2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Your position is that the3 trustee can take no action to make the estate whole in4 the event of, say, Justice Alito's type of hypothetical,5 the bank ­­ the estate bankruptcy trustee spends6 $125,000 in legal fees to bring property back to the7 estate that had been concealed by wrongful conduct of8 the debtor and the debtor still gets $75,000 of that?9 There’s nothing the bankruptcy trustee can do to make10 that bankruptcy estate whole?11 MR. HELLMAN: Of course, as was the case12 here, there was a denial of discharge, the classic and13 serious penalty for debtors who engage in misconduct14 before a bankruptcy court. Now what that means in almost15 every case is that there will be debts owed to16 pre­petition creditors that remain unpaid.17 It's essentially the bankruptcy death18 penalty in the sense that it makes the debtor liable for19 the rest of his days until those debts are paid off.20 That's a very serious punishment.21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is It? Now what about the house? The22 house was still exempt because if they levy on the23 house, you go back to bankruptcy and it's still exempt.24 So there's nothing you can do to make the trustee ­­ the25 estate whole.11￼1 MR. HELLMAN: Two points, Your Honor. One,2 the question to where you want to draw the line about3 deterring debtor misconduct and leaving debtors without,4 literally, their last dollar coming out of bankruptcy is5 an important question, but a policy question, and one6 where Congress has spoken with an expressed prohibition.7 Now, there are other sanctions, not ­­ none8 of which were levied here or sought to be levied here,9 Rule 11 and the like, that might serve to provide an10 additional source of funds, but not from exempt11 property, because Congress has walled that off. If one12 looks ­­13 JUSTICE BREYER:14 certain retirement funds.15 MR. HELLMAN:16 JUSTICE BREYER:17 has $4 million in this special retirement fund account18 and he's behaved in the most extraordinarily dishonest19 way, the trustee has no power to impose a sanction on20 those funds, even if he'll earn a big income, he's lied21 nonstop, etcetera.22 MR. HELLMAN: Congress has amended23 Section 522 already eight times since 1978, about once24 every 4­1/2 years, if my math is correct, to fine­tune25 the extent to which debtors can claim exemptions. As12The same thing is true ofYes, Your Honor.   So if, in fact, the person￼1 the Court is aware, in 2005 for example, the ­­ Congress2 limited the extent to which a debtor could claim an3 exemption in his homestead, I suppose precisely for4 analogous reasoning to what Your Honor suggests.5 It's still nonetheless perfectly clear from6 Section 522(k) that Congress has not created or allowed7 some sort of free­floating equitable discretion for8 bankruptcy courts to reach a different result in cases.9 And again I would like to point the Court to Section10 522(c) as well, which is the companion provision to the11 administrative expenses provision.12 As the Court, of course, is aware, debtors13 often have debts arising from all sorts of improper14 conduct, willful and malicious injury, criminal15 restitution awards, fraud, embezzlement, there is a16 whole list of these things in Section 523 and the Code17 makes these debts non­dischargeable, inherent per se18 non­dischargeable, meaning that when you go through19 bankruptcy you’re not going to be able to escape paying20 these debts once the bankruptcy is over.21 However, in Section 522(c)(1) of the code22 Congress picked out just two, just two of those23 categories of debts, alimony and certain tax liability,24 of these non­dischargeable debts that could be satisfied25 from exempt property.13￼1 The debtor who has a wrongful death2 judgment, the debtor who has a fraud judgment, the3 debtor who has a criminal restitution award, all of4 those debts are non­dischargeable, they stay with the5 debtor until they're paid, but they are expressly not6 paid from exempt property.7 That is a quintessential policy judgment of8 Congress's to decide where to draw the line between9 deterring, not making bankruptcy a haven for those who10 seek to avoid their misconduct or engage in misconduct,11 but at the same time recognizing that taking someone's12 homestead ­­ taking someone's homestead in effect, with13 respect, does leave them without a home, and14 essentially ­­15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: When he takes that16 $75,000 and assuming he doesn't pay debts with it and he17 invests it, what happens to the income on that18 investment? Is that exempt, too, from paying off his19 creditors?20 MR. HELLMAN: It's actually even less21 friendly to the debtor than that, Your Honor. Under22 California law ­­ and Federal law takes State law23 exemptions as it finds it absent a contrary Federal24 provision ­­ the debtor if he ever were to receive the25 $75,000, by law, California law, would have 6 months to14￼1 reinvest it in a homestead. That's what California is2 doing. It's saying, we are going to give you the3 opportunity to reinvest and have a home.4 If it's not reinvested, it's not exempt, at5 least not for purposes of the Federal scheme going6 forward. If it doesn't retain its exempt character,7 then if he puts it in a bank account, that's not exempt;8 the interest and principal, both of those are available9 to satisfy any creditor who might ­­ who might be out10 there to whom he owes funds.11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's California, but12 that's not necessarily every other State.13 MR. HELLMAN: Those States that give a14 homestead exception, and that's 48 of 50, all, with the15 exception of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, which use the16 Federal homestead exemption, all of those ­­ the vast17 majority of those States have a reinvestment principle.18 I know Illinois does, I know that several19 other States do as well, for just the reason Your Honor20 suggests. This money is not put away in a box such that21 it can't be touched again. The homestead exemption22 represents an opportunity for the debtor to have a home.23 That's what California law protects and California in24 its judgment decided to award.25 JUSTICE GINSBURG:15Are you saying that he￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425must spend the $75,000 on a new residence within howmany ­­ what period of time?MR. HELLMAN: 6 months, Your Honor.JUSTICE GINSBURG: 6 months. And if at the end of 6 months he can't find a home at that price, then what happens?MR. HELLMAN: California law says it needs to be reinvested within 6 months in a homestead. Otherwise it loses its exempt character.

And the way￼1 debtor is not liable for his administrative expenses2 once the bankruptcy case closes, even if there has been3 a denial of discharge.4 Congress has determined that, although a5 debtor will be on the hook for the debts that he brought6 into bankruptcy, he will not be on the hook for debts7 arising from the administrative expenses going forward,8 because I think Congress understood that those expenses9 might be out of the debtor's control and that a debtor10 ought not leave bankruptcy in a worse condition ­­11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So then what you said12 before needs to be modified. He does get to keep the13 $75,000 because there is no creditors to be paid off14 from.15 MR. HELLMAN: The $75,000 is not protected16 from any creditor who might have a claim to it. That's17 all I meant to suggest, Your Honor. In this case his18 creditors have in fact been paid off and there is no19 sanctions award or other award that would ­­20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: When you say, "paid off,"21 do you mean paid off 100 percent?22 MR. HELLMAN: The ­­ his primary creditor23 was a judgment creditor who had a debt of $160,000;24 negotiated it down to $120,000 in exchange for being25 paid first. And I do mean 100 percent, yes.17￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what you started2 with, oh, this is a terrible sanction, he's denied a3 discharge and all that, that doesn't mean a thing to4 him, does it? Because everybody's paid off. He doesn't5 have any debts.6 MR. HELLMAN: This debtor does not have any7 remaining debts. Most debtors, however, because of the8 way the priority scheme works in bankruptcy, will be9 paying their administrative expenses first and have10 their debtor­­bligations come second. And, of course, if there11 is a non­dischargeable debt, as I said, then even12 without a finding of non­dischargeability, those stay13 going forward.14 And I want to emphasize again that we are15 not talking here ­­ my friends on the other side suggest16 that this is sort of from a deep tradition of the17 inherent power of a court to sanction. This is not18 about that power. This is about the property from which19 a sanction award can be paid. There is no tradition20 supporting that award.21 And, of course, as this Court said in22 Owen v. Owen, where the code is clear ­­ and I don't23 think, with respect, it could be much clearer than24 saying not liable for any administrative expense, save25 in two situations not present here ­­ that is the181 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425code ­­ that is the language that controls.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I should know this,but who's going to get stuck with the extra couplehundred thousand dollars?  Is that the trustee in anindividual capacity or someone else?MR. HELLMAN: It's really the trustee's law firm, which is an arm of the trustee.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They don't recoup that from anywhere else, right? They are on the hook for that?MR. HELLMAN: That is correct, Your Honor. That is correct.      Now, the primary authority ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do they get a thank­you letter from the ­­(Laughter.)MR. HELLMAN: The primary authority that my friends on the other side used to support their reading of the statute is the Marrama case. And I want to emphasize, that case does not support the proposition that bankruptcy courts can violate specific provisions of the code if they believe equity warrants another result.      In Marrama, the court was ­­ the Marramamajority was clear to note that no provision of the code19￼￼ 1   expressly forbid the result that the court was going to 2   allow, and that 105 ­­ Section 105 in that case was 3   being used to accomplish something the code permits and 4   to do it promptly rather than in a delayed fashion.5 This case is not about prompt versus 6   delayed.  This is about doing what the code expressly 7   forbids.  This case is not about what Section 105 8   allows.  This case is about what section 522 expressly 9   forbids.10 And, here, Congress has made the judgment,11 considering all the different deterrent mechanisms and policy12   interests at play, Congress has made the judgment that13   administrative expenses are not liable for any14   administrative ­­ exempt property is not liable for any15   administrative expense.16 JUSTICE ALITO: In the Malley case, Justice17   Souter said that if this is not what Section 105(a) was18   intended for, it's hard to see what Section 501(a) was19   intended for.  I take it you just think he's flatly20 wrong.21 MR. HELLMAN: We do disagree, Your Honor.22   The equities in that case, I suppose, are sharper in the23   sense that the debtor is leaving bankruptcy with more24   money than he otherwise would be able to have.  But it25   is just as clear in that case that Congress has not made2025 JUSTICE KAGAN:But, Mr. Hellman, (k) of￼1 the exception that ­­ it's more than ­­ this is not a2 negative implication case.3 I want to stress that. It's not just that4 Congress hasn't put this on the list of things that5 can't be done. Congress has a flat­out prohibition the6 structure is not liable for any administrative expense7 or any prepetition debt, save in the enumerated8 circumstances.9 So, yes, with respect, I do think Malley was10 wrongly decided, and this Court need do nothing more11 than reaffirm what it has done for 80 years, which is to12 say that 105 gives bankruptcy courts the power to act.13 Our position is quite modest. We're only saying they14 can't do what the code forbids.15 Whether the code is ­­ whether they're16 acting interstitially or they're acting to carry out17 express provisions of the code, of course that's what18 105 does.19 The scholars brief that is submitted on our20 side on pages 21 to 26 lists a bevy of practices that21 will ­­ that should and will continue unabated because22 they ­­ under Section 105 by bankruptcy courts to carry23 out the administration of justice, because there are24 things that the code does not expressly forbid.211 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425course talks about exempt property.MR. HELLMAN: Yes.JUSTICE KAGAN: Is there a possibility ofreading the statute such that the exemption just nevercomes into effect?  If you look at 522(l) ­­MR. HELLMAN: Yes.JUSTICE KAGAN: ­­ (l) says, "unless a party in interest objects, the property claimed as exempt is exempt." Now, that suggests that if the party in interest does object, there's a question about whether the party claimed as exempt is exempt.      So ­­ so why isn't it a permissible readingof the statute to essentially say the court gets todecide whether this is exempt property such that (k)comes into effect, and in deciding whether it's exemptproperty, it can take into account the Petitioner'sabuse of process?MR. HELLMAN: Two points. Of course, no objection was ever lodged within the time period that rule ­­JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes. I completely agree with that, but suppose one were.MR. HELLMAN: That objection ­­ that objection would not be well founded because it is undisputed that Petitioner is entitled to his homestead22￼16 his litigation misconduct17 was otherwise entitled to18 protected by (k) and (c).19 JUSTICE ALITO:warranted taking away what heunder Section 522(l) and￼1 exemption under California law. California law says2 this is his home, he's lived there for the requisite3 amount of time, he has the equity, all of that.4 Congress later, in provisions that wouldn't5 apply to this case either, put some limits on a debtor's6 ability ­­ Federal limits on a debtor's ability to claim7 his homestead exemption; if money is poured into the8 home before declaring bankruptcy, Congress cut back on9 that a little bit. And I suppose you could have an10 objection on that basis.11 But this was not a case in which the12 Petitioner lost his exemption because he wasn't entitled13 to it. To the contrary, at page 69a of the appendix,14 the court observes this is the exemption to which he's15 otherwise entitled, but it's his ­­ the court found thatSo you're saying a creditor 20 could not have objected when your client claimed the21 exemption on the ground that the exemption is going to22 prevent the discovery ­­ the disclosure of the23 fraudulent nature of this mortgage.24 The creditor could not have objected to the25 exemption on that basis?23￼1 MR. HELLMAN: The objection was proper. So2 the answer to your question is yes, no objection ­­ no3 objection would have been proper in that situation4 because ­­5 JUSTICE ALITO: And why is that?6 MR. HELLMAN: Because Section 522, the way7 it works is that the question is are you entitled to the8 exemption under State law. That's what Section 522(b),9 I believe, asks you to look at. And then there's a10 question of is an objection going to be interposed11 within the period provided by Section 522(l).12 Congress, of course, is free to create other13 limitations on a debtor's ability to claim exemptions.14 And as I said, they have done that in Section 522(o),15 Section 522(p), Section 522(q), which deals16 specifically, by the way, with situations in which the17 very filing of the bankruptcy case is a ­­ is an abuse18 of the code.19 And in that case, in Section 522(q),20 Congress ultimately decided that for debtors whose21 fraud ­­ and is convicted of a felony whose filing of22 the case shows that it's an abuse of the code, Congress23 decided in those cases that a debtor should not lose all24 of his exempt property.25 They put a cap in at $155,000, which, as24￼1 Your Honor points out, is quite generous, quite generous2 given the median income of ­­ of the American family;3 and further stated that exemption could be tilted upward4 where necessary to support the debtor and his5 dependents. Not downward, no discretion to go downward,6 but can go upward, if necessary, in the bankruptcy7 court's view to support the debtor ­­ reasonably8 necessary to support the debtor and his dependents.9 So Congress ­­ so your question was could10 there have been an objection? The answer is no. And I11 would just say in passing that Congress has decided and12 has amended the statute several times to fine tune13 exactly when it is ­­ there ought to be or could be an14 objection to property validly claimed as exempt under15 State law.16 This is not one of those cases; far from it.17 And, again, I want to stress, this is not an argument18 from negative implication. This is not an argument from19 interstices. This is an argument from express and20 categorical prohibition.21 And if there are no further questions, I'll22 reserve the balance of my time.23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.24 MR.

KATYAL      ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      The facts explain why the bankruptcy courtexercised its discretion appropriately under bothSection 105(a) and the longstanding inherent power ofthe court.  Mr. Law committed a massive fraud on thatcourt with the fake Lily Lee mortgage and fake documents.Petitioner lied repeatedly to the court, and then liedabout his lies, all in an attempt to retain nonexemptproperty and equity in his home in contravention of thecode.      Section 105(a) was made for a case likethis.  It provides ample authority for what thebankruptcy court did, both in its first sentence, whichuses a sweeping formulation of any order necessary orappropriate and as well as its second sentence whichgives bankruptcy courts, quote, "the broad authority totake any action that is necessary or appropriate toprevent an abuse of process."      That is the language Marrama used todescribe the second sentence, and it fits hereperfectly.26JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:My problem is that the￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425problem is that I read the sentence and it lops off itsbeginning.  What the beginning says is "No provision ofthis title providing for the raising of an issue by aparty of interest can stop a court from doing that."  Anabusing process, presumably.      So how could a party legitimately, whetherthe trustee or anyone else, make any claims to theexempt property?MR. KATYAL: Justice Soto­ ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How can the Court do something neither the Bankruptcy Code nor any of its provisions permit the trustee to do?MR. KATYAL: Justice Sotomayor, for precisely the reasons that both Marrama and Justice Souter in the Malley case suggested, which is at the second sentence fortifies ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's your strongest argument, that Justice Souter ­­MR. KATYAL: Well, it's at the second sentence fortifies the first; that is, the way to understand the second ­­ the power of the court and the orders that are necessarily appropriate. One such power is to remedy fraud upon the court, the abuse of process. That's what Congress used.27￼1 code itself doesn't do that. It limits the access to2 the exemption to specified frauds, to frauds that result3 in a conviction. To amounts, it doesn't permit the4 exemption ­­ it ­­ it does away with the exemptions for5 an amount above 155.6 So if the code doesn't permit full recovery7 for fraud, why should a court be permitted to do it?8 MR. KATYAL: Well, of course, that provision9 wasn't in effect at the time. That's 522(q) which you10 are referring to. But we think 522(q) doesn't ­­ isn't11 violated here. Absolutely, you're right, Justice12 Sotomayor, if there were a violation of 522(q), 105(a)13 couldn't take that back.14 But the language of 522(q), which is found15 in the blue brief at page 19a of the appendix, just says16 that if there is a circumstance of a felony ­­ it17 doesn't even mention fraud ­­ but if there is a felony18 that occurs and ­­ in the filing of the petition, then19 it says that ­­ that you can't get more than ­­ you20 shall not exceed $156,000.21 It says nothing about the longstanding power22 of the court to depart downward and to give up to zero.23 It's just like a punitive damages cap. So Florida's24 punitive damages law says that if you have ­­ if you're25 the victim of medical malpractice or something, you can28JUSTICE BREYER:JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:MR. KATYAL:An IRA.   Thank you.  An IRA.￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425get up to $500,000.  You shall ­­ your award shall notexceed $500,000.      But of course, that doesn't take back thepower of the factfinder to say you shall get nothing ina particular case.  And this is a perfect illustrationof a case in which a debtor should get nothing.      Mr. Law tried to invoke the protections ofthe code while he repeatedly defied the obligationsunder the code at every turn.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would you ask ­­ would you answer Justice Breyer's question? Does this power go to invading the other exempt properties, like an IRS? I'm assuming there are now invasion provisions for an IRS, but would this power permit the court to invadean ­­ not an IRS ­­                         Our argument here is justlimited to this type of case in which you're lying aboutthe underlying asset itself and trying to seek anexemption.  I know the Solicitor General advances abroader argument, and I suppose that the Court can dealwith that in an appropriate case.      But here, Mr. Law undervalued his home andput all of these fake mortgages on, and then repeatedly29￼1 submitted perjured documents to the court about the very2 exemption. And as Justices ­­ Justices Ginsburg and3 Alito said before, what's a Trustee to do in that4 situation except investigate? That's his duty under5 Section 704, to try and figure out what has happened.6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, he doesn’t have to7 investigate to the tune of half a million dollars8 chasing a much smaller amount that is at issue.9 MR. KATYAL: Well, I think,10 Mr. Chief Justice, that's the wrong way to look at it,11 with all respect. For one thing, of course, the ­­ the12 trustee's actions allowed title to be cleared and the13 underlying house to be sold for $680,000, paying off all14 the creditors.15 If Mr. Law's representations were16 accepted ­­ and this is something the Bankruptcy Court17 found at page 77 ­­ the trustee would have had to18 abandon the property altogether. That's $680,000 that19 nobody would have gotten. So that's the first thing.20 And the second thing is, of course, that21 when the trustee started his investigation and realized22 there was a fake mortgage, he would have never thought23 that this would have become, as you said, a24 half­million­dollar case. He would have thought, well,25 look, these documents prove this is a fraud.30￼1 But what Mr. Law did in response was to take2 19 separate appeals to ­­ you know, 14 to the bankruptcy3 appellate court, five to4 you know, I looked at ­­5 JUSTICE BREYER:6 in view of this, I agree7 why didn't the ­­ or why8 sanction? I mean, you have apparently the authority9 here in 105 to sanction conduct abusive of the judicial10 process.11 That includes an order directing payment of12 expenses. Okay. I guess this is an expense. And that13 wouldn't be discharged, because it's a postpetition14 debt.15 So why not just do that? And even if he16 doesn't have money now, if he ever gets any he's going17 to have to pay it. So it looks as if there's an18 alternative way of paying for this.19 MR. KATYAL: So two responses. First of20 all, as to the existence of an alternative sanction, I21 think this Court in Chambers was very clear in saying22 that doesn't displace other powers of the court.23 JUSTICE BREYER: No, it doesn't. But why,24 when you have pretty clear language saying this shall25 not be used for administrative expense ­­31the Ninth Circuit.  I mean ­­    He behaved very badly, andwith that.  Why wouldn't ­­ orcouldn't the trustee simply￼1 MR. KATYAL: Because for ­­2 JUSTICE BREYER: ­­ and you have general3 language over here saying a general power to sanction,4 and you have an alternative way that's perhaps almost as5 good, why read the language that says no to say, well,6 yes?7 MR. KATYAL: I want to respond to why there8 isn't an expressed prohibition in a minute. But just9 taking your point before, the reason is the facts of10 this case. That is, the sanction would only be paid out11 of postpetition debt.12 And I think there's a pretty good reason why13 my friend's brief on the other side is willing to14 entertain sanctions and the like, because he would15 engage in the same type of conduct that he has now,16 repeatedly stymying the court in the ability to try and17 get that $75,000 sanction, should it ever be imposed.18 And so that ­­ so sanctions come from19 postpetition assets. And that's I think one of the20 problems.21 Now, with respect to the bigger question, is22 there a prohibition somewhere in the code? We don't23 think there is. We don't think 522(k) says anything24 like what my friend said in his opening sentence, that25 this is somehow an express prohibition. We think that32￼1 the language of 522(k) has to be read against three2 different things, the first, Section 105(a) and its3 sweeping language; second, something you never heard a4 word about in my friend's argument on the other side,5 which is the longstanding presumption that the6 protections of the Bankruptcy Code are meant for the7 honest but unfortunate debtor; and third, language in8 522 which Justice Kagan alluded to which suggests that9 someone is not entitled to the right of an exemption,10 and the court can take it ­­ the court can refuse to11 provide it in the first place.12 JUSTICE BREYER: If he has the exemption,13 (k) says: "Property that the debtor exempts under this14 section is not liable for payment of any administrative15 expense." That's why I thought it seemed a fairly16 definite no, unless you read the general knowledge and17 tradition to mean yes.18 MR. KATYAL: I think you have to read the19 language of 522(k), which was enacted in 1978, against20 the fact that Section 105(a) was on the books and indeed21 enhanced in 1978.22 JUSTICE KAGAN: I think that's a little bit23 backwards, right? Doesn't 105 exist to the extent that24 there's no prohibition saying otherwise? And then25 522(k) comes in, and there's your prohibition.33￼1 MR. KATYAL: No, because I think in order to2 understand what the prohibition was, you have to ­­ you3 have to look to 105(a); that is, what 105(a) does is it4 says, in general, you have this power. And indeed,5 522(k), I think it speaks of the general case in which6 there isn't this type of excessive bad faith, fraud on7 the court.8 And so absolutely, I think in general, just9 as in Marrama itself, there's general language which10 says administrative expenses normally aren't liable.11 But in the atypical case, to use Marrama's words, a case12 like this in which the only way the code would work and13 functionally work is to incentivize trustees to try and14 uncover the fraud.15 JUSTICE KAGAN: So but then you're saying16 essentially that every provision in the Bankruptcy Code17 ought to be read with an addendum that says, "Except if18 there's an abuse of process."19 MR. KATYAL: Your Honor, I think that's what20 generally both the Hunt prohibition and indeed the first21 line of Marrama says, which is that the basic idea of22 the Bankruptcy Code is to provide honest but unfortunate23 debtors a system of relief. And it misses the forest24 for the trees to essentially look with tunnel vision25 just at (k). (K) exists within a larger framework of34￼1 background duties and obligations that a debtor must2 comply with.3 A debtor can't come in and say, oh, I've4 just met 522. It presupposes they've already met, for5 example, 5 ­­ Section 521, which is a truthful6 disclosure of assets and liabilities.7 And if you adopt Mr. Law's formulation,8 you're essentially saying that the main architect ­­ the9 main safeguard against this type of abuse, the trustee,10 is left holding the bag at the end of the day. The11 trustee is the only one here who acted, I think,12 appropriately, trying to uncover all of this, and he13 would be stuck with hundreds of thousands of dollars in14 attorneys' fees.15 JUSTICE BREYER: But couldn't the ­­16 couldn't the bankruptcy judge just deny him, deny him17 bankruptcy?18 MR. KATYAL: Yes, he can deny him19 bankruptcy, but that doesn't solve the underlying20 problem that Mr. Law would still have $75,000 in assets21 that he is trying to seek under his exemption and the22 trustee has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars23 trying to unravel that scheme.24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you limit in a25 principled way ­­ you say where you differ with the35￼1 Solicitor General is that if an ­­ if an IRA had existed2 here, they would say that could be used. And you're3 saying, I don't need to go that far. That's on the4 facts. But on what theory would you limit recovery in5 those situations?6 MR. KATYAL: Well, we're not advocating for7 a limit, but I suppose if one ­­ if the Court wanted to8 find one, they'd find it in Chambers itself, which said9 that the inherent power of the court is something that10 could be exercised sparingly and only in extreme cases.11 And if ­­ if there is a situation in12 which ­­ you know, if some sort of forfeiture was a13 massive amount compared to the underlying fraud on the14 court, that wouldn't be appropriate.15 That would be reviewed under abuse of16 discretion. All we’re suggesting here ­­17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's hard to enforce.18 Every lawyer's case is an exceptional case. That's just19 the way it works.20 MR. KATYAL: Well, but I think that's a21 problem that ­­ with Chambers itself, Justice Kennedy,22 and I think the courts have figured out ways to deal23 with that problem, by saying it's only reserved for the24 exceptional case and this is really truly that case.25 This isn’t just fraud on the Court, it's36￼1 fraud on the Court squared. They're lying about the2 lies themselves. And the bankruptcy court can't work,3 it can't function if you don't have the trustee4 incentivized to under ­­ to undertake the kind of5 investigation that occurred here.6 My friend talks about denial of discharge or7 criminal penalties being ways to try and deal with this,8 but all of those sanctions depend on the action of the9 trustee to uncover the fraud in the first place.10 And when you have someone like Mr. Law,11 who's a serial liar to the Court, this isn't just bad12 faith, Justice Kennedy. This isn't just ­­ you know,13 one document that is wrong by 5 or $10, this is repeated14 perjury to the Court. And that is the quintessential15 thing Section 105 is about when it talks about abuse of16 process.17 If you don't permit equitable forfeiture18 here, you are essentially giving effect to Mr. Law's19 abuse of process. With respect to the underlying ­­20 JUSTICE BREYER: It made me think of a ­­21 think of a bankruptcy petitioner who, in part, has a22 debt arising towards a creditor that consisted of the23 most frightful conduct you can think of. I mean,24 something really awful that he did to somebody. And yet25 that debtor can be excused, bankrupt, and keeps the37￼1 $75,000.2 Now, while lying to a bankruptcy trustee is3 bad, it's not hard for us to think of conduct that's far4 worse. And yet, he can keep the $75,000. Why should ­­5 why should this particular form of bad conduct allow the6 invasion of the homestead?7 MR. KATYAL: For two reasons,8 Justice Breyer, because Section 105(a), as well as the9 inherent power of the Court deal with specifically this10 type of situation, abuse of process, fraud on the Court11 itself, not any type of prepetition conduct or anything12 like that. It's targeted to this. And, of course, the13 language in 522(q), which we were talking about earlier,14 is only about that prepetition conduct.15 It doesn't have ­­ so absolutely. Congress16 is free, if they want, to abrogate 105(a) or the17 inherent power of the Court and to say, look, if you've18 engaged in bad faith, fraud on the Court, whatever,19 you're still entitled to your exemption. That's not20 what it says.21 To the contrary, and this picks up on22 Justice Kagan's point earlier, 522(l) and (v) provide a23 mechanism to reject an exemption that is being sought.24 And here, that happened. 522(l) says ­­ and this is25 laid out at our brief at pages 38 and 39 ­­ if someone38￼1 raises an objection to an exemption that a debtor is2 seeking, that exemption can be3 JUSTICE GINSBURG:4 had to be raised by a creditor5 MR. KATYAL: It doesn't ­­6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought ­­ isn't there7 a provision that says, and if there's no objection, the8 exemption is what is claimed?9 MR. KATYAL: 522(l) doesn't say that. It10 refers to a party in interest, which could be a trustee11 as well. And so here, we think both the trustee12 objected in filing the motion for ­­ in 2006 as well as13 the Court itself. Section 105 has to be read alongside14 522, and it provides the Court the sua sponte power to15 do so.16 There is a time limit, Justice Ginsburg, in17 Rule 403, but that time limit can itself be extended if,18 under the terms of the rule, if there's been a19 subsequent amendment of the underlying schedule. And20 here we think effectively, there was a subsequent21 amendment of the underlying schedule; that is, Mr. Law22 lied.23 And I think there's a very strong reason why24 the time limit shouldn't apply here. Imagine that a25 debtor took a fake set of exemptions and bribed the39denied.I thought the objectionwithin a certain time.7 JUSTICE GINSBURG:8 trustee.9 MR. KATYAL:      Maybe you get it from theI think that ­­      The faithless trustee.You might be able to go after￼1 trustee to look the other way for 30 days. If that were2 discovered on day 45, I think it would be thoroughly3 implausible to think that you could ­­ that the debtor4 could get the underlying exemption, something that he5 bribed and lied about just because it didn't meet the6 30­day requirement.10 JUSTICE GINSBURG:11 MR. KATYAL:12 the trustee as well, but I don't think that the13 underlying exemption would be given in that14 circumstance. It's a paradigmatic instance of both the15 105(a) power as well as the inherent power of the Court.16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I recognize the problem17 that if you have sanctions, that he can't pay the18 sanctions and you're right back where you started. But19 are there cases in which there are sanctions imposed of20 an amount such as $75,000, $100,000?21 MR. KATYAL: Sure. There's been a ­­ there22 have been a number of cases, the red brief talks about23 them at page 32 going all the way back, in which the24 exemptions have been denied altogether for purposes of25 bad conduct. And we think this case falls within that.401 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE ALITO: Well, Mr. Hellman said that the creditor and, I guess, any other party could not object to the exemption on the ground that the house was burdened with a fraudulent mortgage. Do you agree with that?MR. KATYAL: I don't. I don't think anything in the language of 522(l) so restricts it. There are other provisions in the Code which say if an objection has been made, for example, to a creditor under Section 502, that the Court's power to deny that relief is circumscribed in 9 different ways. But there is no restriction on the power of the Court here.      And that's why I think Justice Kagan'squestion gets at this point, which is 522(k) assumesthat an exemption has been given, and there's a strongreason under the Code the Court is given the power todeny an exemption in the first place.JUSTICE ALITO: Do you have any authority that says that there could be an objection on that basis?MR. KATYAL: I think just the text at 522 itself says so.If there are no other questions.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Ms. Harrington.41￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425     ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON,     FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTMS. HARRINGTON: Thank you,Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      I'd like to start, if I could, by taking alittle bit of a step back to note that outside of thebankruptcy system, an individual who runs up more debtsthan they can satisfy with their collective assets hasno right to wipe out those debts while retaining some oftheir property in the face of unpaid assets.  That rightonly comes from the Bankruptcy Code itself.  But youonly get that right if you follow the rules ofbankruptcy.      The Petitioner asked this Court tomyopically focus on certain provisions of the Code andonly provisions of the Code that actually benefit thedebtor.  But you have to look at any provision of theCode in the context of the whole Code itself because allthe provisions are intended to work together.      In this case, the surcharge order wasnecessary and appropriate to enforce provisions such asSection 521 and Section 704 of the Code.  Section 521imposes duties on debtors.  Those duties include theduty to honestly disclose assets and liabilities, the42￼￼1 duty to turn over property to the estate, to the2 trustee, and the duty to cooperate with the trustee3 throughout the case.4 Now, Mr. Law flouted all of those5 obligations, making it impossible to carry out the6 provisions of those parts of the Code without7 surcharging him in some way.8 Section 704 imposes duties on the trustee.9 Those duties include the duty to investigate the10 financial affairs of a debtor and the duty to collect11 the property of the debtor, reduce it to money and give12 that money to creditors. And the trustee doggedly13 pursued his duties under Section 704, but because of Mr.14 Law's bad faith litigation behavior, he imposed a great15 cost on the exercise of those duties.16 And so the Bankruptcy Court exercised its17 discretion to try to offset some of those costs by18 imposing a surcharge on what would have otherwise been19 exempt property of the debtor.20 JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Harrington, you clearly21 have the facts on your side. The question is whether22 you have the law. And ­­ and 522(k) says, as23 Justice Breyer said, "Property that the debtor exempts24 under this section is not liable for payment of any25 administrative expense."43￼1 Now, as I read your brief, you're2 essentially asking us to put the word "usually" in that3 provision. Is not usually liable. When is it ­­ when4 is it liable? It's ­­ it's liable when there are5 special circumstances dealing with debtor dishonesty.6 And where does that come from?7 MS. HARRINGTON: What we're asking to do is8 look at all the provisions of the Code together. And9 certainly, Section 522(k) expresses Congress's policy10 judgment that generally honest debtors should not have11 their exempt property used to pay administrative12 expenses.13 But as I've said, 521 and 704 express14 Congress's policy judgments about what debtors are15 supposed to do and what trustees are supposed to do.16 And Section 105 give ­­ gives Bankruptcy Courts17 authority to address very unusual circumstances that18 involve bad faith litigation conduct. So that's bad19 conduct in the litigation.20 I think that is an implicit exception to21 most of the general rules that are laid out in the22 Bankruptcy Code.23 In this case, it's really impossible for the24 Court to have carried out all of the provisions of the25 Code, but that's directly because of the debtor's44￼1 behavior in this case, Petitioner's behavior. And so2 here in this extraordinary circumstance, the Bankruptcy3 Court addressed that bad faith litigation behavior by4 exempting what otherwise would have been ­­ by ­­ excuse5 me ­­ surcharging what otherwise would have been exempt6 property.7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is the ­­ you8 do have good facts on your side. But what if the9 offense is simply the failure to list a particular10 asset? Does that justify a departure from the usual11 rule?12 MS. HARRINGTON: I mean, if it's a13 negligent ­­ negligent failure to list the asset, then I14 don't think ­­15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No you know, it's a ­­16 it's a bank account that's held in ­­ you know, a17 separate name or it's separate real estate. It's fairly18 common for debtors to leave off some assets they want to19 conceal. Is that, as a general rule, sufficient to20 justify this unusual authority?21 MS. HARRINGTON: I think if they do it in22 such a way that then they spend the assets ­­ so the way23 this issue usually comes up, the way it's come up in24 most of the courts of appeals is that a debtor tries to25 hide a nonexempt asset and then wastes the asset in some45￼1 way, usually by spending it, and then when it's2 discovered, this is how it came up in the Malley case in3 the First Circuit, then the Bankruptcy Court surcharges4 the exempt property to sort of compensate the estate for5 the wasted nonexempt property.6 And so I think that ­­ that's certainly, in7 our view, an appropriate exercise of authority under8 Section 105, because there, the debtor is trying to ­­9 he doesn't necessarily exit the bankruptcy with more10 money than he would be entitled to, but he has11 money during the bankruptcy and he spends that12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then13 then it becomes a not very unusual exercise of14 authority. It becomes pretty common since the15 concealment of nonexempt assets is a fairly ­­16 want to say it happens all the time ­­ but it's a fairly17 common situation.18 MS. HARRINGTON: I don't think it happens19 terribly often, and when it does happen it isn't very20 often that the debtor spends the money that he's21 concealing. He's usually trying to keep the money. And22 so if it's discovered that he has hidden an asset that23 he should have turned over, then the Bankruptcy Court24 can merely order him to turn over the money, to turn25 over whatever the asset was.46moremoney ­­it ­­I don't￼1 It only ­­ it is only necessary to surcharge2 what would otherwise be exempt property if that3 nonexempt asset no longer exists.4 Here, of course, it's a little bit of a5 different situation. This Petitioner imposed enormous6 costs on the estate, radically depleted the value of the7 estate by requiring the trustee to run up huge8 attorneys' fees in order to effectuate his duties under9 the code.10 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any case law ­­11 because 522 says in (b), it says "The following property12 may be exempt." It doesn't say it has to be. So is13 there any case law where the debtor writes down ­­ you14 know, a piece of property and a creditor comes in and15 says: He can't exempt that he has behaved outrageously,16 and it fits within the category, but he has behaved17 outrageously.18 Is there any case law that says under those19 circumstances the bankruptcy judge can refuse the20 exemption one way or the other?21 MS. HARRINGTON: None that I am aware of.22 And our view of the case is not so much that the23 exemption was denied in this case, but that the ­­24 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, you first have to25 get to the thing where the ­­ we are pretending to put476 MS. HARRINGTON:7 cases, it's not so much that8 to the exemption, so much as9 disallowed at the end of theWell, the majority of thethere's been an objectionthe exemption has beencase or surcharged.￼1 the creditor, the bankruptcy judge, as if he were2 another creditor. The thing, the property, appears on a3 list that says exempt. And then the trustee or the4 judge says: No, I'm not going to let you exempt it.5 And that's basically what he's done.10 But I'm glad ­­ you know, in the11 hypothetical you posited, it's the creditor who is12 expending effort and potentially incurring attorneys'13 fees in order to expose a debtor's fraud. And in that14 case, those would not be administrative expenses, and15 you would think that, at least under the Court's16 inherent authority ­­ under ­­17 JUSTICE BREYER: You see what I mean? Not18 only is it administrative expenses, but you have to19 somehow say, well, the judge is a constructive creditor,20 and he constructively objected. There are an awful lot21 of "constructive's" in that sentence that I just gave22 you.23 MS. HARRINGTON: Right. And, again, that's24 not our view. Our view is that the exemption was25 disallowed, that the debtor is not allowed the benefit48￼1 of the exemption.2 But if the creditor had been the one who ran3 up the attorneys' fees, he could certainly be paid under4 the court's inherent authority, as in Chambers v. NASCO,5 and it would be strange to think that the trustee is the6 only person who couldn't be paid in this sort of7 circumstance just for doing what the code tells him he8 has to do.9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Harrington, at the10 cert stage in this case, the Government suggested the11 distinction between two situations: One, an action by12 the debtor to remove property from the estate, leaving13 the creditors unsatisfied.14 And that's where you say this power of15 exemption can be taken away. And then the other side16 was where the creditors are paid in full and only the17 trustee's litigation expenses are at issue. Are you18 dropping that distinction?19 MS. HARRINGTON: No, Justice Ginsburg, I20 think ­­ I think the distinction we were trying to make21 was more what I was discussing with the Chief Justice,22 which is when a debtor wastes nonexempt assets and can't23 turn them over, nonexempt property, can't turn it over to the24 estate, and so then is forced to turn over exempt25 property so that the surcharge doesn't pay attorneys'49￼1 fees; it just compensates the estate, and by extension2 the creditors, for property that should have been turned3 over.4 Our suggestion was that this case, you could5 decide the case on a narrow grounds and it wouldn't6 necessarily resolve the issue in those other cases,7 because in this case the sanction was to pay attorneys'8 fees, which under a court's traditional inherent9 authority, a court can order one party to pay another10 party's attorneys' fees when it's in response to11 extraordinary bad faith litigation conduct.12 Now, even in Chambers v. NASCO, it's true13 that the Court was divided in that case, but it was14 mostly divided about whether the bad faith in that case15 was in the litigation or before the litigation. Here,16 there is really no doubt that all of the bad faith17 conduct in this case is in the litigation. And that's18 really a very traditional exercise of the court's19 inherent authority to sanction that type of behavior20 through attorneys' fees.21 I think it's important to note also in this22 case that the available remedies really are insufficient23 to deal with this debtor's misconduct. He suggests24 dismissal, discharge, and Rule 11 sanctions. Of course,25 dismissal wouldn't do anything to punish him because his5025 MS. HARRINGTON:So our view is that he￼1 creditors have been paid and he would just exit the2 bankruptcy with all of the exempt property he would have3 gotten if he had been honest.4 The same thing with discharge. He was5 denied a discharge of his debts, but then after that the6 trustee sold his house, and it sold for $300,000 more7 than he had represented it was worth. And so all the8 creditors were paid. And so that really had no9 practical effect in this case.10 It's also not clear that Rule 11 would be11 sufficient to fully compensate the Trustee for the12 expenses that have been incurred, because Rule 1113 sanctions generally aren't available for matters on14 appeal.15 And as the record reveals, much of the16 expenses that were incurred in this place ­­ in this17 case resulted from the debtor's more than a dozen18 appeals to the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel and to the19 court of appeals.20 JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm not sure I understand21 that. Are you saying that the court could not just have22 fined him, let's say, $100,000 or however much he23 wanted, however ­­ whatever the costs were, and that he24 could get that out of the debtor's future earnings?511 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425could have ­­ the court could have imposed a sanction,and that would not have been a prepetition debt, so itwouldn't have been discharged.  And if the court hadordered the debtor to pay the money on pain of contempt,he could have enforced that order notwithstanding anyState law provision that would have exempted theproperty after the bankruptcy.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.      Mr. Hellman, you have 5 minutes remaining.    REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW S. HELLMANON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. HELLMAN: Thank you, Your Honor. Just afew brief points in rebuttal.      I think from the litany of punishments thatthe Government has pointed to in this case, the questionhere is not whether a Bankruptcy Court can sanction adishonest debtor.  It can.  The question is whatsanctions has Congress forbidden or allowed.  This is acase in which Congress has drawn a line and said exemptproperty may not be used to satisfy any administrativeexpense.      My second point is that I think there mayhave been some confusion about what it is to claim anexemption under the Bankruptcy Code.  If you look atSection 522(b) of the code, what you'll see is that a52￼￼1 debtor is allowed to claim an exemption, may claim an2 exemption, under State law or Federal law, depending on3 the scheme that the State has opted into.4 The right to the exemption is a product of5 State law unless Federal law says otherwise. And6 Federal law has started to say otherwise in the7 Bankruptcy Reform Amendments of 2005. Congress saw a8 problem in 2005 where debtors were pouring money into9 their homesteads, then declaring bankruptcy, and then10 seeking to have all of that property be claimed as11 exempt.12 Congress amended Section 522 to deal with13 that problem, to place limitations on that type of14 misconduct. Congress has not created a generalized15 equitable discretion exception to Section 522. And I16 suggest that the reason it has not done that is because17 we're talking about exempt property, the core property18 of the debtor.19 And it would dramatically shift the power20 between trustee, as the Chief, as Mr. Chief Justice was21 suggesting, dramatically shift the power between the22 trustee and the creditors and the debtor if a debtor's23 homestead, pension, or wedding ring or other exempt24 property becomes fair game and at issue if the trustee25 makes a motion to suggest that the debtor hasn't behaved53￼1 as forthrightly as the trustee claims he should have.2 And I want to stress again, at the risk of3 repeating myself, we are not talking about the4 traditional, venerable inherent powers of the Court to5 award attorneys' fees. There's a Rule 9011 in the6 Bankruptcy Code. It wasn't invoked here, shouldn't have7 been invoked here. But what we are talking about8 instead is the property from which that sanction can be9 satisfied.10 Congress has determined that exempt property11 cannot be used to satisfy administrative expenses. The12 worst prepetition conduct that one could imagine, say,13 in a couple of narrow circumstances ­­ Congress has made14 the choice here as to the status of exempt property.15 In the RadLAX case, in the Ginsberg case,16 and I'm not aware of any case to the contrary in17 between, Congress ­­ the rule in this Court is the18 specific provision controls.19 Here, Congress has spoken specifically,20 expressly, not by implication, but through prohibitive21 language saying that exempt property is not available to22 satisfy administrative expenses.23 For those reasons, we would ask the Court to24 reverse the surcharge order. Thank you.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.541 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      The case is submitted.      (Whereupon, at 12:36 p.m., the case in
