GELLER                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. GELLER:  Thank you, Justice Stevens, and mayit please the Court:          The Internal Revenue Code generally requires1011121314151617   sales.18every corporation to pay an annual tax measured by itsentire net income, but Congress decided 30 years ago inthe DISC and FSC statutes that it wished to encourageexports by giving favorable tax treatment to the portionof a company's net income that's attributable to export￼          In order to determine the extent of this incometax benefit, it's obviously critically important todetermine precisely how much net income is generated by acompany's export sales in any particular year.192021222324   calculation to be made.  Gross revenues from export sales25   were to be reduced only by those costs that were directly          In enacting the DISC statute, Congress saidquite specifically how it expected this export net income31111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051   and factually related to the export income.  Export sales2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9revenues were not to be burdened with unrelated expenseswhich would distort the true amount of export income, andthereby reduce the intended incentive.          The DISC regulations, which were promulgatedshortly after the statute was passed, reiterate that theremust be a direct factual relationship between export salesand expenses.          QUESTION:  Where do you -- do you get thatproposition in the statute, Mr. Geller?101112   two separate statutory provisions.  One is section 994.MR. GELLER:  Justice Scalia, we get it out ofQUESTION:  Where are these to be found?13141516171819   receipts.  We think that the common sense nature of the20   word attributable, which this Court in the tax context has21   construed to mean generated by, or caused by, is that you22   have to take the export -- the revenues from exports and23   reduce them only by the costs or deductions that are24   related to those exports, or else you can't possibly come25   up with a true figure of export -- net export income41111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          MR. GELLER:  These are -- this is found onpage 27a of the appendix to the petition.￼          And specifically, the reference in 994(a) and994(a)(2) to the requirement that a determination must bemade of the net income, quote, attributable to export1234   under the code, don't they?  And -- and doesn't the5   Government use this same procedure that it's been using6   here in other -- in other areas where it has to7   attribute -- where -- where R&D expense has to be8   attributed?9 10 11          MR. GELLER:  Yes.  It relies on a provision,which we'll talk about in a few minutes, that has many,many applications, and it may well be that in a number ofthat's attributable to those -- to those sales.          QUESTION:  I -- I suppose that -- that R&Dexpenses have to be attributed in a lot of other instances12   those other applications, it's perfectly valid.  Our13141516171819202122232425position is --          QUESTION:  Well, why is that?  I mean, why isit attributable --          MR. GELLER:  Well, as I hope to --          QUESTION:  -- okay elsewhere to -- to producethis result, but not okay here to produce this result?          MR. GELLER:  Because it -- the DISC provisionsare unique in a number of respects, one of which is itallows the taxpayer to engage in a particular grouping oftransactions, and the -- the -- as we'll talk about in afew minutes, the R&D regulations insist that R&D beattributed in a way that disregards the particulargroupings that the taxpayer has selected.51111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1             But there's another statutory provision that I'd2   like to call your attention to, Your Honor, and that's3   section 861.  861 is a section of the code that has been4   in the code, was in the code for more than 50 years at the5   time the DISC statute was passed, and it provides for how6   deductions are to be allocated to gross income.  This --7 8 9this appears at page 26a of the appendix.          Now Congress, in passing the DISC statute, saidquite specifically that it wanted deductions under theDISC statute to be allocated in a way generally inaccordance with the principles of section 861, which werewell-established at that time.1011121314151617   statute, would you say Congress said it.  When it's inQUESTION:  Where -- where did Congress say that?          MR. GELLER:  Congress said that in the reportsof the House, of the tax-writing committee.￼QUESTION:  Just for my benefit, when it's in thelegislative history, would you tell me who said it?          MR. GELLER:  Yes, Your Honor.181920212223   It's in the reports of the tax-writing committees.  But,24   Your Honor, these were not idle statements.  These were25   not statements of individual Congressmen, or statements on61111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          QUESTION:  Because when you say Congress saidit, I thought you mean it's in the statute.MR. GELLER:  Well, it's not in the statute. 1   the floor.  These were deliberate statements put in the 2   reports of both the House and Senate tax-writing 3   committees which focused specifically -- specifically -- 4   on how Congress expected these deductions to be allocated. 5   And I would refer the Court to page -- 6             QUESTION:  And I'm sure everybody who voted for 7   that knew about those statements. 8             MR. GELLER:  Your Honor, these were specific 9   statements that went to the heart of the issue that's10   before the Court today, and we've quoted them at page 2211   of our brief, the blue brief.  Congress said thatthese 861 rules --          QUESTION:  The committee said.  Please, please.          MR. GELLER:  The committee reports said --12131415   excuse me, Justice Scalia.  The committee reports said16   that -- that the 861 rules, which are important because17   later the regulations themselves under DISC reference the18   861 rules, so it's -- and that's the heart of the￼19   Government's argument in this case, so it's important to20   understand what people thought at the time these 861 rules21   meant.22             QUESTION:  But -- but why does 861 get you out23   of the general allocation provisions any more than 99424   does?  In other words, the question was, why do we ignore25   the usual rule for apportionment of R&D?  And you said,71111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051   well, because 994 is -- is specific and -- and has some2   policies of its own.  And then you said -- and to further 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   to 861 after the DISC regulations were finalized.  It was10   added in 1977.  The DISC statute was passed in 1971.  The11   DISC regulations were finalized in 1975.  So our position12   is it's important to understand what Congress in 197113   thought it was doing in the DISC statute, and therefore it14   seems to us extremely important that it said that it15   expected deductions, including presumably any deduction,16   including R&D, to be allocated in accordance generally17   with the principles of section 861, which were described18   quite clearly in the Senate and House reports of the19   tax-writing committees to --20             QUESTION:  Mr. Geller, there's one problem.21   Perhaps you can cast some light on it.  The word is22   attributable that you pointed to in 994.  And the R&D you23   have divided into Blue Sky and program- or product-24   specific.25             MR. GELLER:  Yes.81111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005that argument, you show us 861.          MR. GELLER:  Yes.          QUESTION:  But the regs that we're talkingabout, which the Government relies on, are under 861.          MR. GELLER:  Yes, but the -- the regulation,Justice Kennedy, that the Government relies on was added￼ 1             QUESTION:  That -- that's Boeing's creation. 2   The R&D -- that division is eminently manipulable, it 3   seems to me, if it -- it's the distinction whether it's 4   allocated across the board because of Blue Sky or 5   particular program or project depends on some official act 6   by a corporate board which could be yesterday, could be 7   next month.  It's in the control of the corporation. 8             MR. GELLER:  Not -- not quite, Justice Ginsburg. 9   It's not manipulable.  It has to satisfy the regulations10   promulgated under DISC.  The DISC regulations -- and here11   I would refer the Court to page 33a of the appendix to the12   petition, and specifically the grouping regulations --13   provide that a taxpayer can only group -- can only group14   transactions if they fall within a recognized industry15   product line.  So, in other words, you can't -- you can't16   allocate expenses to any sorts of transactions you want.17   They have to be grouped in a way that's consistent with18   the DISC statute.19             And that's exactly what Boeing did here.  The20   Blue Sky R&D was attributable to all of their airplane21   products, and therefore it was allocated to the groupings22   of all of the different airplane programs.  These23   program-specific R&D -- and I don't think there's any24   factual dispute about this.  The program-specific R&D was25   factually and directly related only to a specific program.91111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1   The 747 R&D, for example, was -- was factually and2   directly related only to the 747 program.  And that's why3   Boeing allocated that R&D only to the 747 program.4             QUESTION:  Mr. Geller, can I ask you a factual5   question that will help me understand?  Does the -- is6 7 8 9there just one DISC involved here, or do you have severalDISCs for different product lines?          MR. GELLER:  No.  It's one -- it's one DISC.          QUESTION:  So that what difference would it makewhether it was the 747 program, or the 727 program if theDISC sells them both anyway?1011121314151617   DISC.  So, therefore, here, we determine what the export18   income is for the 747 program, which takes the revenues19   from the 747 program and reduces them by the deductions,20   including R&D that's factually and directly related to the21   747 program, and you -- you come up with the CTI for the22   747 program.  Under -- it's not all mixed together as one23   group of export income.  Under -- under the statute and24   regulations Boeing was entitled to group transactions.25 The -- the problem here is that the regulation 101111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          MR. GELLER:  Because, Justice Stevens, under thestatute, combined taxable income or export income is -- isto be determined on the basis of product groupings, or atleast, the taxpayer has the option of choosing to group bydifferent products rather than by all the sales of the￼ 1   that the Government relies on takes huge amounts of R&D 2   that are directly related to a specific program and 3   allocates them among all of the programs. 4             QUESTION:  But, of course, the converse, I 5   suppose under your view, all of the R&D would go to the 6   domestic corporation because it all takes place before the 7   product is put on the market. 8             MR. GELLER:  No.  It doesn't really matter 9   whether the product is on the market or not, Your Honor.10   It has to be allocated to a class of gross income.  Now,               QUESTION:  Right.that class of gross income may well include, as it does inthis case, products or programs that aren't yet on themarket that are being developed.1112131415161718192021   millions of dollars of R&D expended in that year.  In our22   view, the regulations make it quite clear that Boeing had23   to allocate those deductions, that R&D and other24   deductions, to the 757 program.25             QUESTION:  Well, what -- what do you say to at111111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          MR. GELLER:  And nonetheless, the regulationsare quite clear that the deductions have to be allocatedto that class of gross income.￼          So, for example, in the 757 program, which wasin -- which was being developed in 1982, there were nosales of the 757 in 1982, and yet there were hundreds of 1   least this argument of the Government?  I -- I guess the 2   Government would probably say, sure, there's -- there's a 3   kind of factual sense in which there is the kind of 4   relationship that you're talking about.  But if you want 5   the closest relationship -- the most perfect 6   relationship -- you would capitalize your R&D and you 7   would start amortizing it when you actually have a product 8   that is generating income that you're selling.  That would 9   be the closest match you could get.10             That match, in effect, has -- has been -- has11   been set aside.  Instead of forcing you to do that, the12   law now allows you to -- to use your R&D as -- as a13   current expense.14             Once you start using it, once you start treating15   it as a current expense, that very close relationship that16   you have, if you had capitalized it, is gone.  And what17   the Government is saying is, it's a judgment call how18   close it's got to be now, now that you have broken the19   link and have allowed current expense.  And that kind of a20   judgment call is quintessentially the judgment call that21   the -- that the Treasury makes when it's write -- when it22   writes regulations.23             And why isn't that a pretty powerful argument?24   And if it is, how do you get over the point of25   reasonableness or -- or Chevron deference as the121111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1   Government would see it?2             MR. GELLER:  Well, Justice Souter, you've3   described the Government's position.  Let me see if I can4   respond to it.5             But generally, just -- as to the last point --6   this is not a legislative regulation.  There really is no7 8 9Chevron deference that's in play here.          QUESTION:  Well, there's -- there's -- certainlythere is some degree of deference here.          MR. GELLER:  There is some degree of1011   reasonableness.12             QUESTION:  We can argue whether it's Chevron or13   not.14             QUESTION:  It was a notice and comment15   regulation.16             MR. GELLER:  It was, but it was promulgated17   under section 7805.  There's no specific provision in the￼1819202122232425code that allows the Treasury to issue legislative regshere, but I don't want to get off on that because it --          QUESTION:  But you -- if it's -- whether youcall it -- if you call it an interpretive regulation --          MR. GELLER:  Yes.          QUESTION:  -- it still deserves some respectfrom a court --          MR. GELLER:  Yes.131111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   give rise to future year income.  In fact, most expenses 9   give rise to future year income.  The fact that an expense10   may occur in year 1, and the income may be generated in11   year 2, is a commonplace.  It doesn't in any way --12             QUESTION:  Sure they do.13             MR. GELLER:  It --14             QUESTION:  But the most precise way to match it,15   I -- I would suppose, is the capitalization way.  And the16   Government says once you -- once you lose the17   quintessentially perfect way of doing it, then how you're18   going to recognize it is a judgment call.19             MR. GELLER:  Well, I don't accept -- they can't20   capitalize it, Your Honor, because Congress made a21   judgment in section 174 of the code in order to encourage22   R&D to allow it to be immediately deducted in the year in23   which it's incurred.24             QUESTION:  Absolutely.  And they say when25   Congress made that judgment, there's a further judgment141111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005QUESTION:  -- does it not?          MR. GELLER:  Yes, it does but it has to beconsistent, obviously, with the legislative scheme thatit's interpreting.          Justice Souter, let me answer your question anumber of different ways.First, it is not at all unique for expenses to￼ 1   left and that is the judgment how close has it got to be. 2             MR. GELLER:  Yes, but the Government's 3   regulation here is not close at all.  The Government 4   concedes that -- that expenses for R&D give rise to future 5   year income.  They can't -- because of section 174, they 6   can't --               QUESTION:  Well, sometimes -- sometimes they do 8   and sometimes they don't.  I mean, if things work out 9   fine, the answer is yes.  If they don't work out fine, the10   answer is no.  And that's -- that's one of the -- that's11   one of the problems that the Government raises.12             MR. GELLER:  Well, look at what the 8(e)(3)13   regulation does, Your Honor.  It doesn't make any attempt14   to match current year R&D expenses with some future income15   that might be generated from that R&D.  What it, instead,7￼does, it allocates all of that income to current yearexpenses -- to current year revenues for products thathave no relation whatsoever to that R&D.16171819202122232425   whatsoever.  I take it then you are saying that the          For example, let me say -- come back again tothe 757 program.          QUESTION:  Well, here -- may -- may I interruptyou with this question?MR. GELLER:  Sure.QUESTION:  You say it has no relation151111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051   Government is simply factually wrong when it makes the2   statement that R&D, which may have a closer relation to3   one product line than another, nonetheless tends, as a4   general rule, to have benefits that go beyond product5   lines.  We -- they -- they, in effect, say, look, you6789   I'm saying clearly in this case it's factually wrong.  Forlearn useful things, and you use them all over the place.          Are you saying that that is factually wrong?          MR. GELLER:  Yes.  I'm saying that -- that --10   example, this case went off on cross motions for summary11   judgment.  There was really no dispute that Boeing had --12   as a factual matter -- allocated the R&D expenses13   correctly.  As a factual matter.  The Government said they141516171819202122232425had to be reallocated because of this conclusivepresumption in section 8(e)(3).          But, yes, I'm telling you, Justice --Justice Souter, that that's incorrect as a factual matter,that in fact, under section 174, in order to take adeduction for R&D at all in any circumstance, DISC or noDISC, the taxpayer has to be able to factually relate thatR&D expense to a particular product.          QUESTION:  Oh, you've got to show therelationship --          MR. GELLER:  Yes, factual relationship.          QUESTION:  -- but it doesn't follow from that161111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1   that there is no benefit to product lines outside of that2   relationship.          MR. GELLER:  Yes, but if there -- there couldwell be a spill-over benefit to future product lines, butthat doesn't, A, mean that it's not directly and factuallyrelated a specific current program.345678   Government's position here, Justice Souter.  Even if it9   is -- there is some spill-over effect for future productAnd also, look at the oddity and anomaly of the10   lines, when the Government -- when the -- when Boeing was11   developing the 757, it's conceivable that they were12   learning things that would benefit future products.  But13   what the Government does is take all that R&D and allocate14   it to existing products, sales of existing products that15   couldn't possibly have benefitted from that R&D.16             QUESTION:  That's so.  But could -- I'd like17   very much to hear your response to Justice Kennedy's18   question.  Was it -- and where we started was with Justice19   Scalia and Justice Kennedy.  And as I understand where20   they were driving, there is a statute, and the statute is21   DISC.  And under this statute, there's either some22   language, or there's some history anyway, which is of23   interest to me, which says when you work out the24   allocation rules, follow section 881 -- or 861.25             MR. GELLER:  861.171111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  861, which is for allocation of allkinds of things --          MR. GELLER:  Well --          QUESTION:  -- for Puerto Rico, to abroad,et cetera.          So now we look to 861.          MR. GELLER:  But --          QUESTION:  And lo and behold, what they did in861, after DISC was passed, is they changed the 861 rules,and in those changed rules, it says you're going toallocate everything to a SIC category called101112   transportation services.  And then it has a little13   sentence here.  The taxpayer may not subdivide thecategories in this list.          MR. GELLER:  Yes.1415161718192021222324   things wrong with that, Justice Breyer.  The first is, as25   you yourself pointed out.  At the time Congress made this181111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼QUESTION:  All right?  So that's their 861 rule.MR. GELLER:  That's -- that is the --          QUESTION:  All right.  Now, what legally iswrong with that --MR. GELLER:  What's legally --          QUESTION:  -- since Congress told them to use861, and here they're using it.MR. GELLER:  Well -- well, there are a number of1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9cross-reference, at the time the legislative history saidthat the rules under 861 would be followed, and at thetime the regs were issued in 1975 that cross-referenced861, this 8(e)(3) rule, which is an aberrational rule,doesn't follow the general guidelines of the 861 rules.It was not even in the regulation.          QUESTION:  That's right.  In respect to that,for you to win on that, we'd have to say that Congressintended that the rules be different for DISC's than forPuerto Rico, for Europe, for Saudi Arabia --1011121314151617   different.18             MR. GELLER:  I'm saying DISC is different,19   Justice Breyer.MR. GELLER:  Oh, absolutely.  Absolutely.          QUESTION:  -- for everything.  Or we'd have tosay that we're throwing out this reg for everything.          MR. GELLER:  No, no, no.  The reg has many otherapplications, and we're not suggesting that it be --          QUESTION:  So you're saying DISC has to be￼20             QUESTION:  Okay, what in --21             MR. GELLER:  And let me explain, if I could --22             QUESTION:  Yes.  That's what I wanted to --23             MR. GELLER:  -- why DISC is different.24             QUESTION:  That's -- we are.  I -- all right.25             MR. GELLER:  DISC is different because -- for191111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051   two reasons.  One is, DISC provides preferential tax2   benefits to a -- to a subclass of net income, export net3   income.  It is critically important to have an accurate4   calculation of what the export net income is.  You cannot5   have an accurate calculation of the net income from sales6   of 747s if you're going to start with the gross revenues7   from the sale of 747s, and then you're going to deduct8   from it expenses that have no factual relationship to9   747s.  You inevitably are going to be left with an10111213   regulations.  In 1973, Treasury issued proposed14   regulations under 861 that specifically said how R&D was15   going to be -- was going to be allocated in the context of16   a DISC.  They gave an example, which is identical to the17   example of this case.  It was an example involving a18   manufacturer that manufactured four-, six-, and eight-19   cylinder engines.  Each was grouped as a separate product20   line, as it was entitled to be --21             QUESTION:  I'll assume the example was22   identical.erroneous net income calculation.          Now, I want to also add that this was focused onin 1973 and 1975 when the Treasury was issuing its DISC￼23 24 25          MR. GELLER:  It is identical.          QUESTION:  And I will take your words that youhave just said.201111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. GELLER:  Yes.          QUESTION:  And I will ask you why a differentperson quoting those words couldn't make the identicalargument in respect to the tremendous tax advantages givento Puerto Rico --          MR. GELLER:  Because --          QUESTION:  -- or in respect to the supremeimportance of having allocation between Europe and theUnited States among subsidiaries --10111213   accurate.14MR. GELLER:  You'd have to look -- you'd have toQUESTION:  -- and principal corporations belook --               MR. GELLER:  You'd have to look at those15   statutes.  It may well be that 8(e)(3) couldn't be applied￼there at all if it would lead inevitably to an incorrectcalculation of -- of that net income.16171819   Honor.  Two things in addition.  First, Justice Breyer,20   the 994 regulations do not incorporate verbatim all of21   these 861 rules.  They don't incorporate 8(e)(3).  They22   don't incorporate -- they say that the allocations to be23   made under section 994 are to be done generally in24   accordance with the rules under 861.25             At the time that that was put in the211111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005But there's something in addition here, Your1   regulations, the rules under 861 unequivocally provided2   that there had to be, for every allocation, a direct3   factual relationship between the expenditure --4             QUESTION:  Yes, but that doesn't mean when --5   you say in accordance with 861.  Does -- does that mean as6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425it now exists, or --          MR. GELLER:  Yes.          QUESTION:  -- 861 as it may be amended from --or, you know --          MR. GELLER:  I --          QUESTION:  -- as it may be interpreted from timeto time by -- by --          MR. GELLER:  Not -- not --          QUESTION:  -- by Treasury?          MR. GELLER:  I believe, Justice Scalia, not ifan aberrational -- not if a rule could be put in severalyears later that's inconsistent with the rules that thetax-writing committees and that the Treasury Departmentassumed --          QUESTION:  But that --          MR. GELLER:  -- would be the 861 rules.          QUESTION:  That's a different argument.  That --          MR. GELLER:  That excepts --          QUESTION:  What I'm saying is it doesn't seem tome, even if you believed in -- in legislative history, you221111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1   can't rely on the fact that they say it's going to be done2   pursuant to 861.  The Government says, we are doing it3   pursuant to 861.4             MR. GELLER:  But not pursuant to the rules.5   This is -- if you look, in fact, at the 8(e)(3)6   regulation, Justice Scalia, it begins by explaining why7   it's deviating from the general rules of 861, why it felt8   the need for R&D to deviate from the general rules that9   require a factual connection between expenditures and              Now, there's another -- there's --10   revenues.111213          QUESTION:  If you -- if you want me to say thata regulation drawn after a statute was enacted, anotherstatute, is -- is invalid because the intervening statuteis -- is applicable instead, what -- what case do I cite,141516   or what rule?  Is -- is the rule just that the specific17   controls over the general?  I mean, is that all we're18   talking about?19             MR. GELLER:  It is.  It is certainly the20   specific controls over the general.  It is also the fact21   that there was a regime here that requires a -- accurate22   calculation of export income.  The rules that were23   promulgated in 1975 did that.  An aberrational rule was24   put in in 1977 which we say is inconsistent with the25   accurate calculation of net income and can't be applied,￼231111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   at least in this context. 2             But there's another reason, Justice Kennedy, why 3   the 1977 8(e)(3) regulation is inconsistent with DISC, and 4   that's the grouping regulations, which I want to call your 5   attention to, which is a very, very important part of the 6   DISC statute. 7             If I could call the Court's attention to the 8   grouping regulations which appear at -- at 994(c)(7), 9   which is the bottom of page 33a of the appendix to the10   petition, you will see that the -- the taxpayer was11   entitled to group its products, to figure out export12   income not in gross, but on the basis of each product or13   recognized product line, which is what Boeing did here.14             And if the Court would look at (6)(iv) in the15   middle of page 33a, you'll see that the regulations16   provide that the taxpayer's choice as to how to group is17   controlling -- controlling.  And the regulations go on to18   say that costs deductible in a particular year shall be19   allocated and apportioned to the classes of gross income20   resulting from such grouping.21             QUESTION:  Now -- now, perhaps you can help me22   here because this is a complicated statute.  Is the23   Government going to answer that, of -- of course, that24   is -- is controlling, but that is only for the purpose of25   one of the three -- of -- of one of the three choices that241111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1234   argument.  But it's completely inconsistent with the words5   of the regulations, Justice Kennedy.  The regulations say6   that all of the determinations under (c) have to be made7   consistent with the grouping, including the allocation of8   deductions.  So --it makes in -- and -- and it's made the choice to have thecombined income?MR. GELLER:  Yes, that's the Government's          QUESTION:  And where -- where does it say that?          MR. GELLER:  It says it in the language that Ijust read to you, that the -- all -- that the costsdeductible in a taxable year shall be allocated to theitems of gross income resulting from such grouping.          So, here, Boeing grouped its -- its classes ofgross income -- 91011121314151618             MR. GELLER:  Excuse me.  Yes.19             QUESTION:  What were you reading from?20             MR. GELLER:  I'm reading -- I'm reading in the21   middle of page 33, Justice Stevens, the (iv), the22   paragraph --23             QUESTION:  Oh, number iv, okay.24             MR.

GELLER:  That's right.6             QUESTION:  Correct?7             MR. GELLER:  That's exactly right, Justice8 O'Connor. 9          QUESTION:  And this is how Treasury initiallythought the DISC scheme should be --101112131415161718   crucial.19MR. GELLER:  There's -- there's nothing inMR. GELLER:  I'm reading -- sub (iv), (iv).QUESTION:  Sub (iv).MR. GELLER:  (iv), Justice Kennedy.  This isthis --          QUESTION:  And you're reading under (iii)?Sub (iii)?￼          And if you look at the Eighth Circuit's decisionin St. Jude, this is one of the provisions that itreferred to as -- as showing that 8(e)(3) is completelyinconsistent with the --202122232425   expenses, and they don't track each other.  So how is it261111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          QUESTION:  But the problem is then along comeregulations under the general 861 provision governing R&D1234   Department interpretation?  That's the sticking point for5   me.that we --          MR. GELLER:  You have inconsistent --QUESTION:  -- don't defer to the Treasury 6             MR. GELLER:  Well, Justice -- 7             QUESTION:  We owe some kind of deference. 8             MR. GELLER:  I appreciate that, Justice 9   O'Connor.  You don't defer, I think, for several reasons.10             First, the language of the statute -- it's11   critical to determine an accurate calculation of export12   net income.  The 8(e)(3) regulation provides conclusive13   presumptions in place of factual matching so that it14   inevitably will lead to an incorrect -- and secondly, as I15   said, the -- it was the understanding of everyone,16   including the Treasury Department when it issued the DISC17   regulations in 1975, that the taxpayer's choice of18   grouping would be controlling, that -- that allocations of19   deductions, including R&D deductions, would be -- be made20   on the -- on the basis of the taxpayer's grouping.  And21   when 8(e)(3) comes in, it says, no, no, no.  For R&D --22             QUESTION:  Mr. Geller, on that point doesn't the23   word grouping, the last word in subparagraph (iv), refer24   to the three choices in subparagraph (vi) of the -- on --25   on page 32a?271111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1234567   cumbersome.  Congress understood that and therefore8   expected that there would be grouping.  The taxpayer is9   entitled to choose two different ways to group its          MR. GELLER:  No, no, no.  I think it refers tothe -- to the choices that are to be made in paragraph(vii) at the bottom of page 33a, and the top of 34a.          The groupings are -- you can -- you candetermine CTI, Justice Stevens, either on the basis ofeach individual transaction, which would be very, very10   transactions.  One is by recognized product line -- which11   is what Boeing did here, the 747s, the 767s, the12   recognized product lines -- or basis of SIC code.  Boeing13   could have chosen to group its transactions by SIC code.14   It chose not to do that.15             And nonetheless, the 8(e)(3) regulation comes in16   and insists that although all other deductions can be made17   on the basis of the product groupings chosen by Boeing,18   which the regulations say are to be controlling, this one19   class of deductions, R&D, has to be allocated on the basis20   of SIC code.  And that's completely inconsistent with the21   statement in the middle of page 33a that we were talking22   about that says that all of the deductions are to be23   allocated on the basis of the taxpayer's grouping, and24   that that grouping is, in the words of the regulation,25   controlling.281111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112   argument.  If you did it transaction-by-transaction, you13   took an individual sale of a 747 --14             QUESTION:  Right.15             MR. GELLER:  -- airplane and you tried to figure16   out what the export net income was from that sale, it17   seems to me you would start with the cost of the -- of the18   revenues generated by the sale of that single airplane,19   and then you would try to figure out what costs were20   incurred in producing that airplane, including the R&D21   costs.  You would never, I think, take costs that were22   incurred that year in trying to develop a 787 airplane,23   which had no relationship whatsoever to the sale of24   that 747, and attribute those costs to it in order to25   reduce the net income.  That's what the 8(e)(3) regulation291111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          QUESTION:  Mr. Geller, I don't want to eat upyour -- your rebuttal time.          MR. GELLER:  That's all right.          QUESTION:  But -- but the Government is going tocome back and say, look it, if you did it transaction-by-transaction, we would apply our normal rule under 861.MR. GELLER:  If you did a --QUESTION:  You say it's a lot different.MR. GELLER:  I think the -- actually --QUESTION:  Would that be correct if they did --MR. GELLER:  No, no.  It would actually help our￼ 1   does. 2             If the Court has no further questions, I'd like 3   to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.  Thank 4   you. 5 6 7 8 9   it --               QUESTION:  Mr. Jones, before I lose the thread11   of -- my thread of thought, is it correct what Mr. Geller12   just said, that if it was done transaction-by-transaction,13   you would not use the same -- the same allocation basis14   that you're using here?15             MR. JONES:  No.  If it were done on a16   transactional basis, which is the -- the base case17   provision under DISC, 861 regs would tell us how to18   allocate costs to the income from that transaction.19             And what -- I mean, really the -- the first20   point of departure that Mr. Geller made from the statute21   is that he suggests that only costs -- or that any -- the22   costs must be factually related to an item of income to be23   set off against it.  But that's not the statutory24   standard.25             QUESTION:  Well, this is kind of simplistic, but301111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 2000510QUESTION:  Mr. Jones.    ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES      ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. JONES:  Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may￼ 1   it does seem that in -- in the 1970s, Congress wanted to 2   encourage exports, and to do that, they thought they 3   should make some income tax advantages for companies 4   producing products for export.  And that involved allowing 5   grouping of products and favorable income tax treatment 6   which, if you didn't have the -- the 861 regulations on 7   R&D, would allow the taxpayer to do what the petitioner is 8   arguing here. 9             So, it seems to me the argument is that the 861-10   regs are just so contrary to DISC that they shouldn't11   govern and don't govern.  Is that the thrust of it?12             MR. JONES:  Oh, clearly that's not the case.13   The 861 regs were -- were formulated for the purpose of14   determining combined taxable income for DISCs and FSCs.15   That's what Congress -- that's what the committee said16   they wanted the Secretary to do under the DISC, and that's17   what the 861 -- if you look at 861(f)(1)(iii), it says18   that expressly.  So --￼          QUESTION:  But 861 applies generally, doesn'tit, not just to DISCs?1920212223   combined taxable income for DISC in mind.  And so it's --24   it's illogical to suggest, as -- as they do --25 QUESTION: The statute was, or the reg -- 311111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          MR. JONES:  It -- it applies generally, but itwas specifically formulated with the calculation of 1             QUESTION:  You mean the reg? 2             MR. JONES:  I'm sorry.  I meant the reg.  The 3   861-8 reg was -- was formulated with the calculation of 4   combined taxable income expressly in mind, and we know 5   that both by the terms of the reg 861-8(f) -- 6             QUESTION:  Well, how do we know that? 7             QUESTION:  Getting back to Justice Scalia's 8   question, and I think it relates to what Justice O'Connor 9   is asking too, is -- is your answer to the last argument,10   that a transaction-by-transaction basis -- we would --11   would clearly not have this problem -- is we clearly would12   have this problem and we'd look at 861, and you'd lose13   there too?  Or is that not your answer?          MR. JONES:  Well, that's one way of making thepoint, but let me -- let me address directly --1415161718192021   regs apply to all of these transactions.  And you can --22   you can see that by looking at only two pieces of the DISC23   regs.24             The DISC regs, at page 29a in the middle of the25   page, says, grouping of transactions for purposes of321111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼          QUESTION:  No, no.  I want to know what yourposition is.          MR. JONES:  Well, my position is they've totallymisdescribed the grouping provision of the DISC regs, andonce you understand it, you will appreciate that the 861-8 1   applying the pricing method is provided by (c)(7).  So, 2   you group to decide what your pricing method is, and if 3   they choose the -- the combined taxable income method, 4   which they've done here, then you go to (c)(6), which is 5   back on page 33a. 6             (c)(6) says here's how you determine combined 7   taxable income.  You take the income.  You deduct the 8   costs of goods sold, and then you allocate under 9   provisions of -- of section 861 regs.  And then the10   provision that Mr. Geller cites says -- is the (iv)11   provision, which says you that allocate the costs to the12   items of income resulting from the group.  That's what the13   grouping does.  It groups the income, and then against14   that income, we apply the costs allocated under the15   section 861-8 regs.  It is --16             QUESTION:  Where is -- where that's last17   language I'm looking for?  It's on --￼MR. JONES:  It's 33 of the petition appendix.QUESTION:  33a, yes.MR. JONES:  It's the last phrase of the -- of1819202122   income resulting from the grouping.  Now, that's what the23   grouping is all about.  They're allowed to pick out athe item (iv), and it says that we allocate costs to the24   series of transactions, group the income, calculate the25   CTI for the group, so they don't have to file a separate331111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   report for a thousand different transactions.  That's all 2   that the grouping is about. 3             Now, that's been the Secretary's interpretation 4   of his own regulations for 25 years.  And of course, under 5   this Court's precedents, his interpretation of his own 6   regulations is entitled to controlling weight unless it's 7   inconsistent with the provisions of the text of the regs. 8   And as the Tax Court explained in the St. Jude case, and 9   as I have just described, the text of the reg says you10   allocate under 861 to the income resulting from the11 grouping.          QUESTION:  All right, that's fine.  But he saysthat -- and what you're supposed to do is you're supposedto, I guess, subtract the costs which are allocated to the12131415   items of gross income in that group.  Is that what you're16   supposed to do?  You take the gross receipts in that￼17 group --18             MR. JONES:  You take the gross receipts for that19 group --20             QUESTION:  -- and you subtract the costs.21             MR. JONES:  -- and then you allocate costs --22             QUESTION:  Yes.23             MR. JONES:  -- under 861.24             QUESTION:  Right.  Now, you allocate them25 under 861.341111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 2000510111213141516171819202122232425says -- you'd say, well, my goodness, you're going toallocate his whole laboratory costs which does nothing butfish diseases to the growing of roses because both arefarming or fisheries.          Now, is it -- something like that is really outof whack, it makes so little sense that that isn't areasonable method of allocation under anybody's theory.          MR. JONES:  That's -- that's a fair synopsis oftheir position, and -- and the defects in it --          QUESTION:  Right.          QUESTION:  So why is it reasonable to allocatethe fish disease research to rose culture?          MR. JONES:  Well, let me start with what theSecretary was supposed to do in the regs, and get to youthe answer to your question.          The -- the statute on which the regs are adopted351111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MR. JONES:  Right.QUESTION:  So we go to 861 --MR. JONES:  Right.QUESTION:  -- and he says, now, if you look at123456789   what he has is he does research on fish diseases.  And he861, and try to allocate according to 861 to the groupthat they've picked out, it's seriously nuts, basically.          I mean, imagine that you had a farmer and thefarmer raised roses, and he had some fishes, and -- and￼ 1   doesn't just say you allocate the costs that are 2   definitely related to the product in determining what 3   costs would be charged against it.  It also says you 4   allocate to it a share of costs that cannot definitely be 5   allocated to any particular item of income. 6             Now, when the conundrum for research costs -- 7   and the reason that we have a separate regulation for it 8   is that there's more than one way that research costs are 9   treated under the code.  When research costs are10   capitalized and amortized over their useful life, they're11   then properly attributed -- as this Court said in12   INDOPCO -- to the revenues as they're received.  But when13   the taxpayer makes the election that section 174 gives it14   to take a current deduction, it severs any relationship15   between the costs and the income.  There is a mismatching,16   as we say.  There is no proper connection between the17   costs and the income.18             Now, the reason that we need to -- the -- the --19   in that case where there is no definite relationship20   between the costs and the income, the default principle of21   the statute is that the costs are to be allocated over all22   income of the taxpayer, not just the income from any23   specific product, but the income from --￼2425 that.  QUESTION:  He'll grant you all that.  He grants361111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1             MR. JONES:  No -- 2             QUESTION:  But he says, you know, sometimes it 3   is clear.  For example, it is clear that roses don't get 4   fish diseases, and similarly, he says, it is equally clear 5   that -- I don't know the factual details, but he says it's 6   equally clear that a 727 research is not as vague as a -- 7   is -- is different from a 757.  Just the same -- roses and 8   fish diseases.  And he says where it's that clear, it's 9   not reasonable for the Treasury to try to pretend that10   it's vague or hard to allocate, et cetera.11             MR. JONES:  The -- a reason why the regulation12   is reasonable is because if, as I have just said, the13   statutory default cases -- you can apply it against all14   income.  What the Secretary has said is, well, I'm not15   going to make you apply it against all income.  I'm going16   to make you apply it only against a subcategory of income,17   in this case, the income associated with sales of a18   product from which foreign sales income might be derived.19             QUESTION:  Yes, but you use this link -- this20   severance argument, and you say, oh, well, once you do21   this, you sever the expense from the future income.22   I would have thought -- please correct me if I'm wrong --23   that all expenses are -- are severed in the sense that all24   expenses can be used for future income.25             MR. JONES:  No.  That's a -- that's a fallacy371111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   in -- in the suggestion of Mr. Geller that mismatching 2   occurs all the time.  It's very rare for mismatching to be 3   tolerated.  For example, if a taxpayer spends $10 building 4   a widget in year 1, and sells the widget in year 2, the 5   $10 he spent in year 1 isn't mismatched.  It's put in the 6   inventory costs.  It's charged as a component of the costs 7   of goods sold in year 2, when the item is sold.  The code 8   is -- and the Secretary is very thorough about routinely 9   requiring matching of expenses.10             This is an exceptional situation created by the11   Congress allowing the current deduction, but as Justice12   Souter pointed out, allowing the current deduction for13   research doesn't mean that that's -- that Congress decided14   it was definitely related when it was taken.  It clearly15   isn't definitely related.16             And so my -- my point was that if it would have17   been reasonable for the Secretary to just do what the18   statute says, which is we'll apply it against all income,19   it's more reasonable, the Secretary decided, to apply it20   against a smaller category.  And then -- and then 5 or 721   years later, the Secretary decided it was even more22   reasonable to -- to apply it against a somewhat narrower23   category, and we got down to SIC code 3.24             Well, these are all alternatives, each of which25   is reasonable.  They're more reasonable than the statutory381111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   default case, the Secretary decided. 2             QUESTION:  Under code 3, would there be any 3   difference?  It was still transportation equipment as a 4   category. 5             MR. JONES:  For Boeing, we can go all the way to 6   SIC code category 4, which is planes and parts.  I mean, 7   this -- this issue is sort of abstract in this case 8   because whatever, you know, objective test the Secretary 9   had used, it would result in the same in -- in this case.10             QUESTION:  Where does the statute say you could11   just apply it across the board?  By -- the statute in 994that I have just refers to 50 percent of the combinedtaxable income, and that doesn't define --12131415161718   middle says that you allocate a ratable part.  It says19   par, but I think that's ratable part of expenses which20   cannot definitely be allocated to some item or class of21   gross income.  So you -- and you -- you would under the22   default case make that allocation across all items of23   income.24             QUESTION:  Well, his argument is that it can --25   that -- that the research on fish can definitely be391111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          MR. JONES:  I'm talking about section 861, whichis at page 26a of the petition appendix.￼QUESTION:  26a, yes.MR. JONES:  And subpart -- part (b) in the 1   allocated to fish. 2             MR. JONES:  If -- if it's currently deducted, it 3   cannot be definitely allocated to an item of income.  You 4   see, petitioner just takes two words out of the statute 5   and changes them.  The statute says you allocate costs 6   that cannot be definitely allocated to an item of income. 7   And he says, well, we allocate costs that are factually 8   related to a product.  Well, that's not what the statute 9   either says, or is about.  We allocate costs to income not10   to products.Now, the --QUESTION:  It says item or class of gross111213   income.14             MR. JONES:  Right.15             QUESTION:  What is -- what is class of gross16 income? 1718   products, they -- they group all the sales of Boeing 707s.19   Then you allocate the costs to that group based on the20   costs that can be directly allocated.21             QUESTION:  For that year.22             MR. JONES:  -- and they share --23             QUESTION:  You're saying it has to be that year.24             MR. JONES:  Yes, and a share of the costs that25   cannot be directly allocated to an item -- to any item of401111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼MR. JONES:  Well, for example, if they group 1   income. 2             Now, this -- the reasonableness of this -- of 3   the Secretary's approach is especially clear in light of 4   the alternatives that he faced.  If he had adopted the -- 5   the position that petitioner prefers, the result would be 6   that petitioner would claim an expense against a product 7   that was going to be built and sold some other time, and 8   never charge that expense against that product when it's9 sold.10             Now, the obvious and unimpeachable result of11   that is they overstate their foreign sales income.  And in12   this case, they do it by $2 billion over the period that's13   at stake.  They overstate their foreign source income,14   which has the direct consequence of overstating the -- the15   DISC and FSC benefits that they calculate based on that16   amount of combined taxable income.17             QUESTION:  But isn't it true, just going back to18   Justice O'Connor's thought, that -- that the19   consequence -- the Government's position is that all20   research and development cost gets allocated to the DISC21   when you're in a business like they are?22             MR. JONES:  I think that's -- I don't understand23   the factual context of that statement, but the -- the24   answer is all research costs, like every other type of25   cost gets charged against the income -- against foreign411111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   is worth knowing.  If it's capitalized and amortized, then 9   the costs are recovered as part of the cost of goods10 sold --11             QUESTION:  No.  I -- I understand the12   distinction between capitalizing it and -- and taking it13   in the current year.  But it seems to me that -- that14   the -- the net result of the Government's approach is15   that -- that all of the -- all of the research and16   development expense of the company would be attributable17   to the DISC.18             MR. JONES:  It would just be attributable to19   the -- to -- well, I mean --20             QUESTION:  If -- if the DISC is 25 percent of21   its sales --22             MR. JONES:  If all --23             QUESTION:  -- 25 percent of its R&D --24             MR. JONES:  Correct.  If all the sales were DISC25   sales, then -- then you would be right.  But if -- if some421111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005sales income to the extent that --          QUESTION:  Proportionately.          MR. JONES:  Proportionally, yes, thank you.Pro rata if it's not current -- you know, if it'scurrently claimed and not capitalized and amortized.          If it's capitalized and amortized -- I shouldjust point out because it's -- it is a factual point that￼1   portion of the sales were domestic, which is certainly the2   case with Boeing, then that portion would be allocated to3   that portion of the income.  I mean, this pro rata4 5 6 7 8 9allocation that I've been talking about, that what you'reallocating between is the sales that the DISC makes andthe sales that the DISC doesn't make.          QUESTION:  What are the -- just out ofcuriosity, what are the rough proportions of -- ofoverseas and domestic sales?          MR. JONES:  I believe the record says somethinglike two-thirds of Boeing's sales during this whole10-year period were overseas and, therefore, I assume,made through the DISC.          QUESTION:  But just as a housekeeping matter, ifBoeing were to prevail here, would it still be open forthe Government to say, well, all right, you can allocatealong your product lines, but the Blue Sky portion stillhas to be greatly increased?stage --10111213141516171819202122   The Red Sky and the Blue Sky.

At this stage of --25             QUESTION:  And that was about some 20 percent.431111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   If -- if the -- if Boeing prevails, can you still go back 2   and say, okay, you get the product line, but you've got to 3   add another 20, 30 percent to the Blue Sky? 4             MR. JONES:  I hate to make a concession that I'm 5   not 100 percent certain -- certain about, but -- 6   especially since, you know, it -- it could be of 7   importance.  I do not believe that issue is open, but 8   it -- but if it were, I would reserve our right to address 9   that.  But I don't -- I don't know exactly how it would be10 open.11             QUESTION:  Mr. Jones, I thought -- maybe I'm12   confused, but I thought the Government's position was Blue13   Sky, product-specific -- this is R&D and we treat R&D a14   certain way and we don't buy into that line, which is set15   by the company.16             MR. JONES:  Oh, I agree completely, but -- but I17   understood Justice Kennedy to be saying that if the Court18   adopted Boeing's approach, would there then be a factual19   question about what part -- whether the Blue Sky amount20   was accurately described in the record.  And I just don't21   know for certain.  My assumption is that that's not still22   open.23             QUESTION:  Is -- is it open as to -- suppose24   the -- you were to say the following.  Where a taxpayer25   can show that a particular R&D expense can be definitely441111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼8 91011121314151617          MR. JONES:  It sounds -- it sounds like youcorrectly described the statute, and let me point out thatif they, for example, did their fish research or whateverit was --          QUESTION:  Yes.          MR. JONES:  -- and they capitalized andamortized it to the -- to the appropriate products andcharged it, then -- then they would be entitled to --          QUESTION:  So -- so that's what -- that's what Ifind difficult to reconcile with the 861 -- 861-8 -- whatallocated to some item or class of gross income, otherthan the DISC class in this situation or whatever, wherethey can show that, then the commissioner cannot requirethem to allocate it to a different item.1234567   of the statute.  Now, suppose you said that.MR. JONES:  Well, it -- I --QUESTION:  That would be just taking the words￼18   is it called?  It's 861-8 --19202122232425          MR. JONES:  (e) --          QUESTION:  -- (3) --          MR. JONES:  (3)(i).          QUESTION:  -- et cetera -- sentence which saysbut you have to use two-digit SIC categories becauseI think they're so broad, those categories, that it shouldbe possible, like my fish example, to find instances where451111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   you could.  And why aren't they in that category? 2             MR. JONES:  First, it only -- that only applies 3   if they're deducted under 174.  So -- so we've narrowed 4   the issue that much.  And when they're deducted under 174, 5   as I've said, there were a series of reasonable 6   alternatives facing the Secretary based from the statutory 7   default case that you allocated across all income. 8             Now, the reason I keep stressing that point is 9   because this Court's decisions are very clear that the10   Court, especially in the context of Treasury regulations,11   doesn't sit here to decide the wisdom of the particular12   rule chosen.  It only -- in the words of Correll -- looks13   to see whether some reasonable method was applied, not14   whether this was the best one, or the most logical --15             QUESTION:  Yes, but it seems to me that what16   you're doing is -- is quarreling with the decision17   Congress made under 174.  Congress said R&D is inherently18   something that ought to be capitalized, but we think it's19   so important, it's going to be expensed.  And you keep20   saying that, well, you know, really it can't be expensed.21   We're going to, in effect, make them capitalize it anyway.22   That -- that's --23             MR. JONES:  No.  We're -- we're not making them24   capitalize it.  I mean, I would cite, really, my25   explanation of that as Justice Souter's question earlier,461111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1   that -- which is that the -- the decision to allow this2   current deduction is effective in determining taxable3   income for domestic purposes.  We don't dispute that4   there's a deduction, but I'll point out 861 -- the mere5   fact there's a deduction doesn't tell you how to allocate6   it.  And the -- 861 says that if the deduction is not7 8 9definitely related to some item of income, then you chargeit against all the items of income.               QUESTION:  Can -- can I come back to the Blue10   Sky expenses?  A question that was asked earlier caused me23 24 25that's what this case is really all about is thispeculiarity --          QUESTION:  But that's the whole scheme that471111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005to question my understanding of the case.          As I understand it, Boeing is willing to accept11121314   DISC.  Right?a ratable portion of the Blue -- Blue Sky expenses in itsMR. JONES:  Yes.  They actually want to --1516171819202122   than amortized over the proper future income.  That's --￼          QUESTION:  Just a -- what it -- what it'sobjecting to is -- is those expenses that -- you know,that -- that go to fish research, those expenses that areidentifiable to a particular category.          MR. JONES:  Just to elaborate, that go to fishresearch that that -- that were deducted currently rather 1   Congress passed in the '70s to try to encourage exports. 2   So it just -- the interpretation of 861 in the regs seems 3   to go somewhat contrary to the overall purpose of the 4   scheme for DISCs. 5             MR. JONES:  Several -- several courts have 6   correctly said that the purpose of the -- of the combined 7   taxable income calculation is to serve as a limit on the 8   DISC and FSC benefits.  Congress didn't intend unlimited 9   benefits.  They didn't intend to allow benefits of the10   type that Boeing is seeking where they inflate their11   foreign source income by not -- not putting the costs12   against that income in calculating it.13             And so, the answer to your question is no.  The14   Secretary's rule is designed to accomplish the correct, in15   the Secretary's view, determination of combined taxable16   income for this very purpose.17             Now, it -- I think that -- that the issue18   that -- that may actually be the one the Court wants to19   consider first is that in 1984, when Congress enacted the20   FSC provision, it -- it in our view ratified and adopted21   the very cost -- research cost allocation regulation that22   we have in this case.  In -- in the Deficit Reduction Act23   of 1984, there are two provisions that relate to this24   case.  Congress adopted -- enacted the FSC which, of25   course, is based on the provisions of the DISC, and -- and481111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   it also contains the combined taxable income method of 2   limiting the -- the benefit.  And -- and at the same time 3   that they adopted the FSC, they enacted a provision that 4   took one piece of this regulation out and suspended it. 5   That's the piece called geographic sourcing.  That, for 6   purposes of citation, is 1.861-8(e)(3)(ii). 7             This case is about 1.861-8(e)(3)(i), which is 8   the rule that calculates combined taxable income.  And 9   when Congress took out -- said we're going to suspend this10   geographic sourcing rule in this regulation, they said,11   we're not suspending this regulation for application in12   calculating combined taxable income for DISCs and FSCs.13             Well, under this Court's decision in14   Lorillard v. Pons, that is a ratification and adoption of15   the regulation.  The Court made the point in Lorillard               QUESTION:  Can I -- Mr. Jones, can I go back for     just a second -- and be sure I understand something￼that when a --16171819   right -- to the fish/roses hypothetical?  Am I correct in202122232425assuming that the fishes -- the research on the fisheswould be charged to the DISC only if fishes and roses werein the same SIC grouping?          MR. JONES:  Under any scenario, that's correct.          QUESTION:  Oh.  So if they're in a differentgrouping, then the rose farmer wouldn't have to pay for491111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9the fish research.          MR. JONES:  That's correct.  I was assuming youcarefully constructed your question.          QUESTION:  But the -- but the grouping can be asbroad as -- as transportation equipment.          MR. JONES:  It can be quite broad.          QUESTION:  That's a pretty broad group.          MR. JONES:  It can be quite broad.  But thepoint is that it's not --               QUESTION:  And it includes, by the way,11   agriculture, forestry, and fisheries.  That's one12 category.13             (Laughter.)14             MR. JONES:  It's not -- it's -- the point is15   it's not as broad as the statutory default rule.  The10￼23 24 25default principle.          QUESTION:  Where is that?          MR. JONES:  That's in 861(b) at page 26a of the501111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005statutory default rule is by definition reasonable, andthe -- the narrower rule that the -- that the --16171819202122   related to an item of income.  That's the statutory          QUESTION:  You've lost me.  The statutorydefault rule --          MR. JONES:  Is that you apply these costsagainst all items of income because they're not definitely1   petition appendix.  It says that --QUESTION:  Got you.MR. JONES:  Okay.Now, on the ratification point, Lorillard v. 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   administrative interpretation.  Now, that's not a -- by 9   itself an overpowering presumption, but what Lorillard10   pointed out was that when Congress, in doing that, looks11   at the agency's interpretation and excised a portion of12   it, the inference that it approved the remaining part is13   very strong.14             Now, here, it's strong not only because of that15   inference, but because Congress said -- I'm sorry -- the16   committee that made this amendment said that they --17   although they were excising this part about geographic18   sourcing, that the part about combined taxable income19   calculations for DISCs and FSCs would remain in effect.20             Now, petitioner says, but 2 years later Congress21   did something that somehow negates at that ratification.22   Well, of course, the sub -- Congress can't change the law23   as ratified, but that's not what happened in '86 in any24   event.  What happened in '86 was that the -- the committee25   what was -- that was removing the suspension of the -- on511111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005Pons makes the point that when Congress enacts a statutethat's based upon a -- a prior -- the provisions of aprior act, it is assumed to have adopted the -- the￼ 1   the geographic sourcing rule said that we're not saying 2   whether the regulation is valid or not.  Well, the 3   regulation that they were talking about was the geographic 4   sourcing rule.  Petitioner says, well, they were talking 5   about the whole rule.  No.  They were talking about the 6   geographic sourcing rule as we know from the last part of 7   that same report which says that nothing in this act has 8   anything to do with the use of these -- of the -- of the 9   research cost allocation regulations for calculating10   CTI -- combined taxable income -- for DISC and FSC11   purposes.12             QUESTION:  Correct me if I'm wrong.  In the13   court of appeals opinion -- and it's the paragraph at14   12(a).  I think you'll be familiar with this one, where15   the court of appeals said, the more narrowly a taxpayer16   chooses to define incomes, the more costs become17   indirectly or indefinitely related.  Can I be excused from￼trying to understand that, or --          (Laughter.)18192021   I can't promise results.  It -- it looked to me like what22   they had in mind was the thought that this -- that a23   taxpayer who says my research only relates to wing nuts24   on -- on this plane is -- is defining it so narrowly that25   it's not realistic.  And -- and indeed, the record of this521111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MR. JONES:  Well, I can try to help, but I'm --1   case reflects that -- that research on one type of plane2   has applications on other types of planes.  And -- and I3   think what the court was addressing there was his view4   that -- that this was an appropriate accommodation.  This5   was one of the choices that the Secretary had.  It was a6 7 8 9reasonable choice.          QUESTION:  It really was restating the problemrather than offering a specific solution.          MR. JONES:  I think it was restating the problemin a way that indicated it felt that the Secretary'schoice was a reasonable one.10111213   continuing significance of this arrangement?  I -- we're14   now past the successor of the FSC.  Is that true?QUESTION:  Mr. Jones, can you tell us this15             MR. JONES:  Yes.  The FSC is no longer with us.16   It was replaced by the extraterritorial income17   provisions -- maybe in '98.  I'm not sure.￼1819202122232425          QUESTION:  What about the two-digit SIC?  Isthat still with --          MR. JONES:  Two-digit is -- it was replaced bythe -- the narrower three-digit band in '94, I believe.          QUESTION:  So if we thought the two-digit was alittle bit going too far, would that throw open all kindsof claims on the -- on the -- from all kinds of people?          MR. JONES:  Well, I mean, again, if the Court531111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9wanted -- felt it needed to look at the two-digit versusthree-digit, although to me they're just, you know,spectrums along the --          QUESTION:  The degree of specificity -- well, atleast three-digit would separate the roses from the fish.          MR. JONES:  This case really doesn't present thequestion --          QUESTION:  It doesn't.          MR. JONES:  -- because, as I said, there'sjust -- is -- there's no question that Boeing goes all the1011   way to SIC 4.  And so if the standard is are the productsreasonably related, which -- which is --          QUESTION:  So we don't have to consider it.  All12131415161718   the Secretary didn't have to pick the best one.  He just19   had to pick one of them.  And I -- if you thought thatwe'd have to --          MR. JONES:  I don't think you have to consider￼202122232425none of these were reasonable, then -- then, you know, itwouldn't matter which one he picked.          QUESTION:  At some point they certainly --          MR. JONES:  If there are no further questions,thank you.          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Jones.541111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005it, but if you did, I think you would do it in the contextof realizing these are reasonable alternatives, and that 1 2   left. 3 4 5 6 7   the -- on the Government's -- the -- the problem with the 8   Government's position here.  It's simply an unwillingness 9   to accept the fact that Congress created a number of10   incentives here that were not designed simply to raise11   revenue.  They had other purposes such as the export --12   the -- the beneficial treatment of export income and also13   the immediate deductibility of -- of R&D.14             Now, the Government tries to defend this15   regulation here on the -- on the basis that there's this16   temporal mismatch and it's all the result of not17   capitalizing.  I should say a number of things about that.18             First, this was not the basis for the regulation19   at the time the regulation was issued.  It was not the20   basis for defending this regulation in the lower courts.21   And it -- and the Government's position is not even22   consistent with that regulation because if the whole23   problem here is the lack of a temporal mismatch, you would24   think that if you had a class of gross income in which in25   a particular year there was both revenues and R&D551111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005Mr. Geller, you have a little over 2 minutesREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER      ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. GELLER:  So much to say.Justice Kennedy, I think you put your heart on￼ 1   expenses, well, in that situation there's no temporal 2   mismatch.  They would at least allow you to allocate those 3   R&D expenses to that revenue in that year.  No.  Even if 4   there's revenue in a class of gross income in a particular 5   year, they still insist that those R&D expenses be spread 6   across all of the income in that SIC code. 7             Now, I want to mention St. Jude, because in this 8   case we're dealing with airplanes and airplanes, and while 9   the -- the costs are specifically allocated only to10   particular programs, it gets a little more complicated.11             But look at St. Jude.  In St. Jude, you had a12   manufacturer who was exporting artificial heart valves.13   That's all it was doing, is manufacturing and exporting14   artificial heart valves.  In the same year, it was15   engaging in R&D for insulin pumps, and for pacemakers.16   The Government insisted that the export income from the17   sale of those heart valves be reduced, and that the DISC18   benefit be reduced because of the R&D spent on these other19   products that obviously had no basis or relevance to the20   sale of the heart valve simply because they were all21   within the broad -- same broad SIC code.22             And I should say, Justice Kennedy, the Ninth23   Circuit's opinion I think is somewhat unintelligible.24   The -- the part that you -- you referred to, we all25   stumbled over because it makes no sense.  The more561111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1   narrowly -- the more narrowly you define your classes of2   gross income, the more that -- that costs will be directly3   allocated to more than one class of income.  It's not a4567   specific programs.  That's all we ask that we be allowed8   to do.question of anything being indirectly allocated.          And there's no default rule at issue here eitherbecause all of our costs are directly allocable to 9             We ask that the judgment in the Ninth Circuit be10   reversed.  Thank you.111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Mr. Geller.          The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)￼571111 14th Street, N.W.
