WYCOFF:  Justice Stevens, and may it pleasethe Court:          Mr. Pace, at age 17, was sentenced to lifewithout possibility of parole after being misled by hislawyer and the court.          His right to Federal habeas review dependsentirely upon whether his State post-convictionproceedings tolled the AEDPA statute of limitations.  ThisCourt should --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, he -- he had a priorround of hearings at the State level on these same claims,did he not?          MR. WYCOFF:  On different claims, Your Honor.He had a first, a -- under what was called the PCHA inPennsylvania.  The tolling question here is whether thePCRA petition --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  I know, but the substance ofit, saying it isn't fair to give me life without parole31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425because of what happened, I didn't understand the plea --he raised that in State court before.          MR. WYCOFF:  He raised it in the firstproceeding an ineffective --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Yes.          MR. WYCOFF:  -- assistance of counsel claim --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Yes.          MR. WYCOFF:  -- related to that and some otherclaims related to that --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Right.          MR. WYCOFF:  -- in the second proceeding.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  And he -- he essentiallywants to relitigate the substance of those previousclaims.          MR. WYCOFF:  No, Your Honor.  He actually -- thefirst petition raised only an ineffectiveness claim.  Thesecond petition raised a due process challenge to thecolloquy, which was not exhausted in the first, raised newevidence to support the claim which Pennsylvania lawallowed him to do, and raised a constitutional and Statelaw challenge to the legality of his sentence.  There werenew claims in the second proceeding.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- of both claims was,however he dressed it up in -- in due process, that Iwasn't told at the time of my sentencing that life meant41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 life without parole. That was the essence, the core of2 his complaint the first time around, wasn't it?34 the first5 15 years.67 it was I wasn't told that life meant I would never get out8 of prison.9MR. WYCOFF:  Yes, that his lawyer misled him wasclaim, that by telling him he'd be out in 10 toJUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the -- but the essence ofMR. WYCOFF:  Yes, Your Honor.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Both times.MR. WYCOFF:  In -- in the second he raised thatthe colloquy itself was defective and that thethe life without parole sentence, was illegal10 1112 plus that13 sentence,14 and unconstitutional, apart from the misinformation15 aspect. So they were different claims.16 Let me start with statutory tolling. Section17 2244(d)(2) of AEDPA provides tolling during properly filed18 applications for State post-conviction review. Under this19 Court's unanimous decision in Artuz, Mr. Pace's PCRA20 petition was properly filed. In fact, the PCRA time bar21 functions in all material ways like the New York State22 procedural bar rules at issue in Artuz.23 Now, Artuz also identified some types of rules24 that would prevent an application from being properly25 filed, for example, the AEDPA successive bar which makes51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 you go to the court of appeals first and get permission2 before you can actually file in the district court, and it3 has a screening mechanism to make sure that only petitions4 with a prima facie chance get filed.5 The PCRA time bar is nothing like that at all.6 It's like the State court procedural bar rules in Artuz.7 There's no condition to filing. You can go and file at8 any time. The court, as a matter of law, has to take your9 petition, has to give it judicial review -- yes, Your10 Honor.11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Wycoff, are you taking12 the position that this -- that Artuz -- I thought,13 frankly, that Artuz had classified within properly filed14 timely filed and then had a footnote, and it says that15 there might be some exceptions to a timely filing rule --16 MR. WYCOFF: Yes, Your Honor.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- rule. And they're not18 taking a position about that. But you quickly said this19 time limitation falls under the procedural bar label.20 MR. WYCOFF: I'm sorry, Your Honor. Yes. This21 -- Artuz said that a time limit without exception, say, in22 30 days you must file in 30 days, no exception, or in 123 year, no exceptions -- that's what Artuz called a24 condition to filing and that you're either in or you're25 out in that rule.61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          And Artuz, though, reserved the questionpresented here of whether a time bar with exceptions, likethe PCRA time bar -- whether that could be properly filed.And so obviously, Artuz reserved the exact question here.But what -- the analysis of Artuz controls here and showsthat this petition was properly filed.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it depends on what theexceptions are.  If -- if -- as -- here I understand thereare three exceptions.          MR. WYCOFF:  Yes, Your Honor.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And they're all spelled out inthe statute.          MR. WYCOFF:  They're similar to the AEDPAexceptions.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  And -- and if you do notplead any of those exceptions when you -- when you file,it seems to me it's not properly filed.          MR. WYCOFF:  Well, there are a couple ofresponses to that, Your Honor.  First of all, in -- interms of Mr. Pace, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has saidit wasn't at all clear before, roughly, December of 1999that you actually need to plead those exceptions in yourpetition.  Now they say you should plead them in yourpetition, but at the time it wasn't clear.  Certainly the-- the form that the prison provides --71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't care what thePennsylvania law is.  I mean, it -- it seems to me if youhave a statute that says it's untimely unless one of thesethree exceptions apply, and -- and you -- you simply fileand you don't say -- and it's clearly out of time withoutone of the exceptions, and you simply file and don't saybut this exception applies, it seems to me that's notproperly filed, whatever the rule in -- in Pennsylvaniawas.          MR. WYCOFF:  If -- in terms of -- to go toArtuz' analysis, you would have to look at each -- theexceptions are -- go claim by claim.  You would have tolook at each claim and see did you plead the exception forthis claim, yes or no; this claim, yes or no.  So again --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you haven't pleaded any ofthem, none at all.  You just file it --          MR. WYCOFF:  In that case --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- several years out of time.You -- you make no assertion that any one of the -- of thethree specific exceptions applies.  I don't see how thatcould possibly be considered properly filed.          MR. WYCOFF:  Because the court still accepts it,reviews it to see if any of the exceptions apply.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ah, that -- that's your theorythat -- that --81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. WYCOFF:  And -- I'm sorry.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Unless it can be rejected bythe clerk --          MR. WYCOFF:  Not at all, Your Honor.  It's notthat -- that theory at all.  In -- in Pennsylvania, thecourt accepts it and gives it judicial review and reviewsit claim by claim to see if any of the exceptions apply.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you haven't made the claim.          MR. WYCOFF:  Well, that's what the court woulddetermine.  And presumably in a case like that, the courtwould be able to dispose of it quickly and --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What -- what does thePennsylvania court -- law now say with respect to claim-by-claim pleading of the exceptions?          MR. WYCOFF:  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court nowhas said you should plead in the PCRA petition theexceptions.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Claim by claim?          MR. WYCOFF:  For each -- any claim that you'reraising, yes.  It goes claim by claim.          JUSTICE BREYER:  This problem couldn't ariseagain in Pennsylvania, couldn't it, because they have a 1-year statute of limitations?  So there would be no waythat you could be untimely filing within the 1 year thatyou have to go to Federal court.91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. WYCOFF:  It -- it can arise again, YourHonor, and that --          JUSTICE BREYER:  It can?  How could it --          MR. WYCOFF:  Yes, it can arise again and -- andwill many times arise again because consider someone who'salready had his or her AEDPA year pass and then discovers,say, a Brady claim and wants to go back and litigate that.Under AEDPA, you would have a year to get back into courtwith that.          JUSTICE BREYER:  You do.  I thought AEDPA youhad to file within a year.          MR. WYCOFF:  Yes.          JUSTICE BREYER:  And then if you miss the year,you're out of luck.  Period.          MR. WYCOFF:  That's -- yes, but under State law,you only have 60 days to get that.  So someone inPennsylvania who finds a Brady claim, say, has to get backinto State court within 60 days of discovering that.  Sohis -- he -- he could go into State court --          JUSTICE BREYER:  I see.  So in other words, he-- his conviction is final.          MR. WYCOFF:  Yes.          JUSTICE BREYER:  60 days runs after his finalconviction and then between the 60th day and the 365thday, he has discovered his Brady claim and has not got101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 into court within 60 days.23 within 604 his State5 litigation, the court says, you know, you really should6 have found it 59 days ago, not 60.7 JUSTICE BREYER: And Justice Scalia's question8 -- I'm interested in this. It couldn't arise. That is, a9 person who files his State collateral petition more thanMR. WYCOFF:  Or he finds it in what he thinks isdays of when he should have found it.  He filespost-conviction application.  After years of10 365 days after the finality of the State court direct11 review, that person is out of luck under anybody's12 interpretation because more than a year has passed since13 it became final, i.e., the State direct review. Am I14 right or wrong about that? That's what's puzzling me.15 MR. WYCOFF: It -- it depends on if there's a16 new -- if -- if there has not been a new triggering date,17 other than the finality for the AEDPA date, then you will18 be out of time for AEDPA.19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But AEDPA -- it doesn't say 120 year and that's it. AEDPA has exceptions.21 MR. WYCOFF: Yes, it does, Your Honor.22 JUSTICE BREYER: The exemptions still could be23 the problem.24 MR. WYCOFF: Yes. And in fact, everyone now who25 has, say, a Brady claim is going to have -- under Third111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Circuit law as it is now, is going to have to come intoFederal court and file a protective habeas petitionbecause the odds are very likely that more than a -- theAEDPA year is going to run while they litigate this.life backJUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.  We would have to breatheinto the stay and abey --MR. WYCOFF:  Yes, Your Honor.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But let me ask you this.Returningspecific exemption --don't care if          MR.you plead these --WYCOFF:  I --12 Washington, DC 20005 1-1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400to our earlier discussion about pleading a          MR. WYCOFF:  Yes.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- are there States, do youknow, where that is not required and the State court willgo through the exceptions even if you haven't pled them?          MR. WYCOFF:  Well, Pennsylvania actually doesthat and certainly did it at the time Mr. Pace waslitigating.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but I thought you saidPennsylvania law had changed now.          MR. WYCOFF:  They have said now you should pleadthem at the petition -- in the petition.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But my -- my question is doyou know if there are other States where they say, we￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- exemptions specifically ornot?  We're going to look through it and find it forourselves.          MR. WYCOFF:  I -- I don't know the answer tothat.  I know that was the practice.  In -- in fact,Pennsylvania courts still do that.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you say that if that's thecase, you can file a -- a State -- a State claim that isplainly no good and until the State court finally getsaround to -- to telling you that it's no good, your --your AEDPA claim is tolled.          MR. WYCOFF:  Yes, while you're -- and the Statecould easily prevent that by setting up some kind ofprefiling requirement for --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that's, in -- in effect,saying that there is no -- that the properly filed, giventhe Pennsylvania procedure, does not include timely filed.          MR. WYCOFF:  The -- the question of whether itwas timely or not is not actually determined until the endof the litigation.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But -- but you have just saidthat the -- the court will look on its own to see if thereare these exceptions.          MR. WYCOFF:  Yes, Your Honor.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So that there would be no131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 case of an untimely filing in this period when the court2 was -- even if you raised no exception, was going through3 them.4 MR. WYCOFF: Yes.5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There would be no case in6 which an untimely filing would be included in properly7 filed because the very fact that the court itself would go8 through the petition to look for exceptions would take it9 out of the category.10 MR. WYCOFF: Yes, Your Honor, and exactly the11 same could be said about Artuz, the procedural bar rules12 in Artuz, whether someone pled --13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- the difference was14 that Artuz ranked timely filing as an ingredient of15 properly filed, and you say but not in Pennsylvania the16 way it's set up. Timely filing is not an ingredient of17 properly filed.18 MR. WYCOFF: Because the State court lets you19 file it and gives it judicial review and applies it claim20 by claim.21 JUSTICE SOUTER: But don't -- don't you have a22 -- a -- sort of a second prong to -- to your response?23 And I -- I wanted to get into this. You -- you have said24 Pennsylvania will let you file even though ultimately it,25 you know, may well determine that you -- you were out of141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 time and you don't fall within any of the exceptions.2 Well, that's -- that's an answer. I'm not sure it's a3 strong enough answer to respond to Artuz.4 But I thought you had a second part to the5 answer, and I thought your second part to the answer was6 in that kind of situation, the Third Circuit practice, the7 Third Circuit rule is that unless we go through the8 Pennsylvania process, even if we know from day one that9 we're out of time, we think we have a -- an excuse, but10 even though we -- we think from day one we're out of time,11 unless we exhaust the Pennsylvania process, they will12 throw us out for nonexhaustion. And the reason they will13 throw us out from nonexhaustion, as opposed to going14 directly to the question whether there is an excuse for15 nonexhaustion, is because Pennsylvania will actually let16 us litigate this --17 MR. WYCOFF: Yes.18 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- and not determine it as a19 threshold matter.20 So -- so your answer, as I understand it, is21 Pennsylvania let's you litigate it, and the Third Circuit22 requires you to litigate it so that the only reasonable23 thing for us to do is to litigate it even if you may say24 in the abstract it's a purely threshold time question.25 And for that reason, there should be tolling. Isn't that151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 your argument?2 MR. WYCOFF: Yes, Your Honor. And it's -- it's3 connected to the statutory language. AEDPA says we'll4 toll for properly filed applications. That -- AEDPA is5 keyed to how much process the State post-conviction courts6 will give you. In a -- in a State where they say anyone7 who comes after a year, we won't give you any review and8 you're just out of court, AEDPA says when -- that's not --9 we're not10 toll, but1112 mean, the13 State system that has an absolute statute of limitation14 with no exceptions. You're almost going to have to18 around to19 is tolled20 21saying it's out of time, your -- your AEDPA time--MR. WYCOFF:  Well --JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- by which time you filegoing to consider that properly filed.  We won't--JUSTICE SCALIA:  This is putting such a -- Isystem is not going to work.  It -- it's a rare15 inquire into exceptions. So you're saying this is a way16 to avoid -- avoid AEDPA endlessly, just keep filing claims17 that are out of time, and until the court finally gets22 another one that's clearly out of time. And until that23 one is resolved -- I -- this couldn't be what AEDPA was --24 was meant to establish.25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and if you're tempted161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 to answer, well, people want to get out so they're not2 going to sit around forever, then we'd ask you what about3 the death cases.4 MR. WYCOFF: Okay, and that was what I was5 tempted to answer, and since you said it, I'll go straight6 to the death cases.7 In Pennsylvania, certainly there's no -- a8 death-sentence prisoner can get nowhere by filing what he9 knows to be an untimely PCRA petition because Pennsylvania10 law requires the Governor to sign warrants when the11 conviction is final and then at every break in the12 litigation basically after that. And the PCRA courts13 cannot grant a stay of execution until after they find14 that the petition is both timely and meritorious. So it's15 not --16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure that would apply17 to other States.18 MR. WYCOFF: That's true. And I mean, each19 State can set up a system to -- to satisfy its needs.20 Pennsylvania could set up a system like the AEDPA21 successor bar to say you're not going to be filed at all22 until we give you permission.23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under your rule that filing is24 sufficient, are there any instances of -- of frivolous25 petition where your rule would not apply?171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. WYCOFF: Well, I think all the courts of2 appeal that have -- have talked about that have thought --3 have said that you really shouldn't start figuring out4 whether it was a frivolous assertion or meritorious --5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then Justice Scalia's6 prediction is -- is right. You just keep filing and7 filing.89 someone  MR. WYCOFF:  Presumably you could and if there'swho wants to do that, which is going to be a10 rare -- 1112 Suppose13 majority wanted a standard that would prevent absolutely14 frivolous filings on the basis of -- of statute of  JUSTICE BREYER:  Suppose you lost on that one.that you wanted some kind of a -- suppose that the15 limitations. Would you -- what standard would -- what --16 what's our choice of standards there? Could we -- one,17 obviously, that the prisoner has to be in good faith.18 Another could be he has to be in good faith and there has19 to be a reasonable argument that it hasn't run. Maybe20 there are others that you've thought of.21 MR. WYCOFF: I think that going down that path22 is going to open up just a nightmare of -- of litigation23 in Federal court about -- if you start talking about good24 faith and are you -- if the State courts deny it, can you25 still say it was nonfrivolous? I think all the courts181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 just across the board have tried to avoid that type of2 thing.3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Try -- try this simple rule.4 Where you're dealing with a statute of limitations that5 has exceptions, it's not properly filed if you do not6 assert the existence of one of those exceptions.7 MR. WYCOFF: Two -- I have two things to say8 about that. One is it creates a problem with Artuz9 because that type of rule -- assuming the exceptions are10 like the PCRA exceptions which go claim by claim, that's a11 claim-by-claim rule which would then create the anomaly12 that Artuz shied away from, that you look to whether it13 was a properly filed application, not to whether it was an14 application with properly filed claims.15 The second point is that -- is that for Mr.16 Pace, whatever the merits of that rule may be going17 forward, it -- it can't be used against Mr. Pace because18 there was no such requirement in Pennsylvania. I mean,19 presumably the -- I assume the Federal courts are not20 going to make up this rule, that it's going to be up to21 the State courts to say what their filing --22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why not? We make up a23 lot of stuff.24 (Laughter.)25 MR. WYCOFF: Well, Artuz talks about you look to191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 the State's procedural filing requirements. This is a2 Federal statute and properly filed is given a Federal3 meaning, but you presumably look to the State filing4 requirements, as you did in Artuz, to determine what that5 means.6 Now, all of these concerns about delay and so on7 are the exact same concerns, where there in Artuz someone8 could file successive petition after successive petition9 in New York if they want to delay. It's just not -- it's10 not a -- it's certainly not a problem for noncapital11 cases.12 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought the whole purpose of13 AEDPA was -- was to prevent delay. I mean, that's --14 that's what's -- it seems to me counter-intuitive about15 the position you're -- you're urging upon us. Here is a16 statute that was meant to stop these things from dragging17 on endlessly.18 MR. WYCOFF: Yes.19 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you tell us don't worry20 about these things dragging on endlessly.21 MR. WYCOFF: I'm not -- I'm saying AEDPA says22 come to Federal court within a year. We'll toll when23 you're in State court if it's properly filed. Properly24 filed, if the States let you file a lot of stuff, we're25 going to -- comity requires to allow that, and we'll toll.201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425If the States don't --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's unrealistic if theStates allow you to file a lot of stuff.  You're -- you'resaying the only way the States can stop this thing fromgoing on and on and on is to adopt an absolute rigidstatute of limitations, no exceptions.          MR. WYCOFF:  That's one way or a prefilingrequirement.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Give me another way.          MR. WYCOFF:  The AEDPA prefiling requirementwhere you go to the court and you say, I'd like to filethis petition, tell me if I can, and the court says, 30days later, yes or no.  That's --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Oh, but if it takes a year alater, then we --          MR. WYCOFF:  Well, yes.  If -- the AEDPA --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Then you just repeat theprocess one step backward.          MR. WYCOFF:  No, Your Honor.  I think the courtsare -- are -- the Federal courts are capable of tellingthe difference between an application for State post-conviction relief on the one hand and a motion for leaveto file an application on the other hand.  In fact, theSeventh Circuit in -- in the Smith v. Walls case and theTinker v. Ward case that we cited in our brief had exactly211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that distinction between an Indiana rule which had a2 prefiling requirement and an Illinois rule --3 JUSTICE BREYER: What about a -- a rule4 requiring good faith or reasonable argument in death5 cases? In all the other cases, there's no incentive to do6 this endless filing, and in death cases, there is. So in7 those death cases, we would insist that it is not properly8 filed if it's out of time unless the prisoner in good9 faith and with a plausible argument, a reasonable argument10 thought it was in time.11 MR. WYCOFF: I suppose that -- I mean, that12 could be a construction of the statute as long as you let13 people -- people are going to come to Federal court first14 and get -- for stay abeyance if you do that. If you don't15 know until the outcome years later whether you were16 tolling or not, that's going to cause everyone to file17 protective filings.18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think that's a19 reasonable interpretation of properly filed and -- and20 what I proposed to you is not a reasonable interpretation21 of properly filed?22 MR. WYCOFF: Well, I was just --23 JUSTICE SCALIA: How can you -- how can you24 tease that elaborate system out of -- out of the words25 properly filed but you cannot tease out of it --221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. WYCOFF:  The --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- simply showing on its facethat there's either an absolute statute or that one of theexceptions to the statute exists?          MR. WYCOFF:  The problem with that in terms --is that it conflicts with Artuz' idea that the -- any rulethat's a condition to filing has to go to the applicationas a whole.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I don't think it actually-- I mean, in -- I think they're about equal, aren't they,in respect to language?  And the argument against theother one is that prisoners are going to get mixed upabout it.  They -- they don't know exactly what they'resupposed to put.  The argument against the one I proposedis it adds complexity of decision-making.  Sort of betweenthe two, it's rather hard to see.          MR. WYCOFF:  Just --          JUSTICE BREYER:  They each have their problems.          MR. WYCOFF:  Just in terms of -- of policy, Ithink any rule you adopt that's not mechanical and doesn'tlet people know on the front end whether they're tollingor not, there's going to be floods of protective filings.          Now, the -- the rule like -- a rule which is --which -- where they know going in and whether they'regoing to be tolled or not, then they can say plead --231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 litigate in State court becoming -- before coming to2 Federal court.

As Judge Giles found, Mr. Pace acted diligently14 and appropriately under the circumstances.15 It seems this is a clear case for equitable16 tolling. This is a case where --17 JUSTICE SCALIA: The circumstances included the18 fact that he sat on this thing for 3 years. He could have19 brought it 3 years earlier, couldn't he?2021 the first22232425 you fold that into the circumstances,MR.

WYCOFF:  I have, I think, four responses to    First, Mr. Pace was not sitting on his hands for4 years.  This is a man who entered prison at age5 these6 17, barely educated, barely literate, drug-addled. This7 is not someone who was prepared to litigate on his own8 when he came into prison. This is someone who -- whose9 legal papers were destroyed by the prison. This is10 someone who was without counsel for that entire time that11 you're talking about. This is someone who had very12 limited access to a law library throughout that time. Mr.13 Pace spent those years teaching himself how to do law14 which he --15 JUSTICE16 out that you have17 you weren't going18 sent up for life.19 MR. WYCOFF: In fact --20 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, what does it take if --21 can a 17-year-old figure that something has gone wrong22 here?23 MR. WYCOFF: Well, in fact, that -- that claim24 was litigated -- litigated in the first petition, and in25 fact, he didn't think of that. If you look at his pro se251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-SCALIA:  -- take a whole lot to figurea claim where your lawyer told you --up for life and it turned out you were￼1 PCHA petition, he didn't know that was a claim. It's a --2 it's a form that he filled out and handed in and appointed3 counsel came up with that claim in the first post-4 conviction proceeding.5 This is much more complex than that. If you6 look at his briefs, which are in the joint appendix,7 Pennsylvania had a very complex system of law here where8 they had statutory bar rules but they had judicial9 exceptions to those rules. And it's not an easy matter10 for someone to figure that out.11 Mr. Pace educated himself. Just compare the pro12 se pleading filed in 1992 to what he filed in 1996, and13 you can see what he did during these 4 years.14 The other -- the other -- just -- my light is15 on, but just the other things I'd like to mention about16 that are that keep in mind, during this time there were no17 time limits on filing in either State or Federal court.18 The commonwealth has never alleged any prejudice from this19 time, and there's never been any allegation that Mr. Pace20 acted in bad faith and with any -- any intent to delay.21 In fact, this is someone who wanted to get his claims22 heard, wanted to figure out how to do it right, and did23 figure out how to do it right in the end.24 I would like to reserve the rest of my time.25 JUSTICE STEVENS: You may.261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. WYCOFF:  Thank you.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Eisenberg.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD EISENBERG                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MR. EISENBERG:  Justice Stevens, and may itplease the Court:          I'd like to address the structure of thePennsylvania filing deadlines for post-conviction reviewbecause I think they shed some light and need somediscussion here.          What Pennsylvania did was to establish a 1-year, flat time limit that applies to everybody.  1 yearfrom conviction.  It's automatic.  It doesn't matter whatthe nature of your claims are.  It doesn't matter when youdiscovered your claim.  In order to comply with that timelimit, all you have to do is file a post-convictionpetition within 1 year of finality.          The rest of the statute is essentially aseparate set of filing deadlines for petitioners, forsuccessive petitioners, for people who either have alreadyhad one round of post-conviction review or who haven'tbothered to pursue it.  Those people, said thelegislature, are only going to be entitled to furtherpost-conviction review, to additionalconviction review if they fall into a27rounds of post-particular class ofWashington, DC 200051111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  1-￼1 claim that couldn't have been raised earlier. And -- and2 the legislature identified three classes that mirror the3 three provisions in the Federal statute of limitations.4 And if the petitioner falls within any of those classes,5 he then has 60 days from the time that that claim arose in6 order to come into court.7 Now, if a petitioner files a post-conviction8 petition and he's within a year of finality, those so-9 called exceptions don't come into play. They don't apply.10 He doesn't need to meet them. Those are for the second11 petitioner.12 So what Pennsylvania really has is a two-level13 system of statutes of -- of filing limitations. And of14 course, in order for the court to determine whether the15 petitioner has met the filing deadline, he has to look at16 these three classes for someone who has passed 1 year from17 finality. That's not an exception in the way I think that18 the petitioner and some of the lower courts have used the19 term at all. These are simply different kinds of filing20 limits. And of course, the court has to look at the21 statute and the nature of the claims to see whether review22 is available and to see whether the petitioner has sought23 review within the proper time.24 Nothing about that system makes those so-called25 exceptions not time limits. They're still time limits,281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425and if you don't file in time and come within one of thoseclasses, then the second petition, successive petitiontime limits don't apply to you and you're out of time.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but if we accept yourposition, it seems to me that State prisoners are goingto have to go but once to Federal court and then they're-- they're going to run into an exhaustion requirement.          MR. EISENBERG:  Well, they're not going to runinto an exhaustion requirement, Your Honor, because ifthey've already been through one round of State post-conviction review, then they are unlikely to be able toexhaust more claims because there's a -- there's a --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, we're --          MR. EISENBERG:  -- 1-year time limit.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- we're assuming a late-discovered claim that's within AEDPA.          MR. EISENBERG:  That's right.  And so thequestion is whether -- and what petitioner is reallysaying is that the AEDPA 1-year time limit should besuspended essentially indefinitely as long as thepetitioner wants to argue that he may have some late-discovered claim in State court.          JUSTICE BREYER:  It -- it's my -- I still have afeeling that this is a limited universe.  Now, my reasonfor thinking that is that the Federal statute says you291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 have to file within a year of -- and then it lists four2 dates. And the middle two are special new cases, unusual3 probably. The first one and the fourth one are the4 important ones. The first one is final in the State5 courts, your first round, and the fourth one is newly6 discovered evidence.7 Now, my guess is most States also allow you for8 collateral -- to file collateral relief in those two9 circumstances. And in most States probably you get nearly10 a year from the same kind of event. So if you go after11 the year, you're out of luck in Federal court. If you're12 within the year, you're probably okay for the State. But13 there are a few States that have -- maybe Pennsylvania --14 just 60 days from one of the events, newly discovered15 evidence, but a year for the Federal. So we're talking16 about people who file between 2 and 12 months. That --17 that must 18192021 not -- 2223 I got this complicated thing right?24 MR. EISENBERG: Only -- it's -- that is true25 only for successive petitioners. For people who aren't301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-be a pretty limited class.MR. EISENBERG:  It's -- it's not, Your Honor.JUSTICE BREYER:  It's not?MR. EISENBERG:  And -- and the reason that it'sJUSTICE BREYER:  But have I got it right?  Have￼1 satisfied with the round of direct appeal and a round of2 first -- of post-conviction review in State court. And so3 the question is whether the Federal statute should be4 interpreted in a way that essentially writes off the5 State's time requirements for the successive petitioner so6 that we can make sure that the successive petitioner can7 exhaust whatever new claims he wants to come up with in8 State court before he comes to Federal Circuit.9 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, let's --10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What do I do it in a State11 where there is a plausible close question of whether or12 not the successive petition is barred in the State court?13 And I interrupted Justice Breyer, but I -- I think it's14 along the same line.15 MR. EISENBERG: The -- the general rule -- and16 this is implicit I think in the fact that Congress passed17 a statute of limitations. The general rule is that the18 petitioner is entitled to whatever he automatically gets19 in State court in order to exhaust a universe of claims,20 not all possible claims, but whatever claims can be21 exhausted within those guaranteed rounds of review. At22 that point, he should go to Federal court.23 If new claims arise after that, then Congress24 specifically provided for them in the25 successive petition procedure that it311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  1-second andhas in the FederalWashington, DC 20005￼1 statute.2 The way that would interact --3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But no -- there's still an4 exhaustion requirement.5 MR. EISENBERG: The way that would interact with6 -- for exhaustion purposes with a State like Pennsylvania7 is this. The petitioner finishes his direct review. He8 finishes his post-conviction review. He has a set of9 clearly exhausted claims. He files a fully exhausted10 petition in Federal court. No Rose v. Lundy problem. If11 a new claim arises at that point, then he has to go to12 State court and try to exhaust that claim in State court.13 He can do that while a Federal petition is pending or even14 after a first Federal petition has already been disposed15 of. In fact, he may have to because the claim may not16 arise before the end of litigation in Federal court.17 When he gets to State court, he's either going18 to be deemed timely or not. Actually the fact that we19 have a 60-day time limit as opposed to a whole year helps20 him because it helps make it clear to him that he's got to21 come to State court at a point where he's really got a22 long time left to deal with Federal court because he's23 going to --24 JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't there a wrinkle to25 this? Isn't the wrinkle that even in cases in which you321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 and I might say patently he's going to be out of time if2 he goes back to Federal court, the Third Circuit is3 requiring him to go there anyway, go through the formality4 of formal exhaustion, if you will, before they'll consider5 it? And isn't that a basis at least for equitable6 tolling?7 MR. EISENBERG: With respect to your argument,8 the answer is absolutely not. First of all, as you have9 just observed, that's really an argument that goes to10 equitable tolling. Even petitioner doesn't bring in the11 Third Circuit law with respect to statutory tolling,12 JUSTICE SOUTER: Right.13 MR> EISENBERG: with respect to understanding14 the -- the language of the statute.15 As to equitable tolling, however, the factual16 premise is wrong. It's not true that the Third Circuit17 forces the defendant to go back to State court no matter18 what. In fact --19 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Help me -- help me out20 here because I -- I just don't remember well enough. I21 thought that's what Judge Giles was getting at when he22 said, you know, he would have been thrown if he hadn't23 gone through the State procedure. So help me out. Is24 that what he was getting at or not?25 MR. EISENBERG: That is what he was getting at 331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 but at a limited point in time, and the whole question for2 equitable tolling purposes was at what point in time.3 Nobody argues that the Third Circuit still is making4 everybody go back and do it no matter what.5 What the petitioner argued was that the Third6 Circuit case law, as of 1997 when he was first starting7 his second round of post-conviction review in State court,8 as of that time, he says, the Third Circuit case law said9 you have to go back no matter what even though10 Pennsylvania has a -- this new statute of limitations.11 That's not what the Third Circuit says, though.12 And all the cases that the petitioner relies on primarily13 -- he cites a -- a case called Doctor, a case called14 Banks, a case called Lambert. All of those cases were15 decided before the Pennsylvania courts began applying the16 new jurisdictional time bar in State court.17 JUSTICE SOUTER: If that means the petitioner18 was wrong, doesn't it also mean that Judge Giles is wrong,19 and if Judge Giles can't figure it out, isn't there a20 pretty good argument that the petitioner ought to get21 equitable tolling?22 MR. EISENBERG: Well, there are a number of23 problems with the equitable tolling, Your Honor. But even24 taking that main one, that the petitioner made a mistake25 of law, that he didn't figure out correctly whether he was341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 supposed to go back to State court, even on that point,2 Your Honor, that's not grounds for equitable tolling. You3 take a risk when you make a legal argument that it will4 fail. This legal argument was controlled entirely by5 State law, and what the Third Circuit, as opposed to Judge6 Giles who was reversed by the Third Circuit said, is that7 you have to look back to State law.8 What the Third Circuit has said -- and the --9 one of the cases cited in our brief at page 49 is Walker10 v. Frank. Chief Judge Becker said no, we're not going to11 give equitable tolling to these defendants because at the12 very latest -- at the very latest -- they had to know by13 December of 1997 that they were going to be time-barred in14 State court. This petitioner filed --15 JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but Judge Giles didn't16 understand it either.17 MR. EISENBERG: Judge Giles didn't say that --18 that the State law would never in the future be applied to19 these defendants. He said at this early time it was still20 unclear whether it would be applied.21 JUSTICE SOUTER: So far as this case is22 concerned, yes. And -- and so if Judge Giles got it23 wrong, isn't there a pretty good argument for equitable24 tolling when the petitioner gets it wrong?25 MR. EISENBERG: What there is is an argument351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that he had an argument to make in Federal court that he2 was not -- that he was still going to have the opportunity3 to go back to State court.4 But the problem is that Federal courts can't5 decide for the States how their time bars are going to be6 applied. And if instead they said --7 JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but this argument is not8 trying to decide for the States. This argument basically9 is if nobody can figure it out, including a Federal10 district judge, at least give me the benefit of the doubt11 with equitable tolling.12 MR. EISENBERG: It's not true that nobody could13 figure it out, Your Honor. In fact, all the cases that14 the petitioner cites in his brief from Federal district15 court judges who were sending defendants back to State16 court during this period because they said, well, maybe17 you'll get exhaustion anyway, maybe you'll be able to18 exhaust claims, of those cases that are cited in the19 brief, most of them are from the same one judge who kept20 saying the same thing over and over. Several of the other21 cases didn't even talk about the State time bar, and at22 that same period of time, there were other district judges23 who weren't sending defendants back, who were saying24 there's a new State time bar, you're barred in State25 court, and therefore, if you want to raise this claim in361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Federal court, you can, but you face procedural default.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  But if he had gone into theFederal court he went into, and he had not gone throughthis State procedure, he would have been turfed out.          MR. EISENBERG:  You can't get equitable tolling,Your Honor, our position would be --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, answer that question --          MR. EISENBERG:  I'm sorry.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- before you tell me what theconsequence is.          MR. EISENBERG:  No.  That's what Judge Gilessaid many years after the fact.  Do we know that's whatJudge Giles would have ruled at the time?  Perhaps.  Butthere are other judges, Federal judges, who were rulingotherwise at the time, and the Third Circuit --have toin goodnot to?  JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, I mean, don't -- don't wetake Judge Giles' statement as being a statementfaith unless there is a pretty darned good reason          MR. EISENBERG:  The point is, Your Honor, thatthat's not the test for equitable tolling.  There are allsorts of arguments that a defendant can make about why thelaw is unclear.  It wouldn't have had to depend on theFederal court's understanding of this particular Statelaw.  A defendant could come along and he could say, well,371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 I'm unclear about the application of (d)(2). I've got2 circuits like the Ninth Circuit who tell me that even if3 my petition is blatantly untimely in State court, it still4 tolls. I filed, knowing I was untimely in State court,5 because the Ninth Circuit tells me that I'm still going to6 get tolling, and now you tell me I'm not going to get7 tolling?8 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Let's suppose to9 get away from it -- can I go -- are you finished with10 equitable tolling because I want to go back to --11 MR. EISENBERG: Well, I -- I have -- there are12 some -- really some -- some threshold problems with13 equitable tolling that --14 JUSTICE BREYER: I -- I have a general question15 which is not Pennsylvania. I've looked up or got a rough16 idea of the statute of limitations for a first petition in17 many States, and most of them are a year or more. So18 there's no problem. But 11 have less than a year, and in19 particular, Oklahoma has 3 months apparently. And20 Oklahoma is -- a lot of death cases come out of Oklahoma.21 So what rule would -- where I have to have -- I focus on22 Oklahoma for the reason that I think this has bite only in23 death cases because I don't see why anybody would want to24 abuse the system except in a death case. But there are a25 lot there.381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          Now, am I supposed to say in Oklahoma which hasthe 90 days but exceptions, that where somebody has fileda petition in State court, let's say, on the 180th day,and he thinks an exception applies, is he supposed to alsorun to Federal court and file a protective petition whichcould well have been dismissed on exhaustion grounds?What's he supposed to do and how is he supposed to knowwhat to do?          And one system that might work is JusticeScalia's idea.          MR. EISENBERG:  Well, it's --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Another that might work is --is requiring in death cases that it be a -- a plausibleground or something like that.  I want to know youropinion of how to deal with that circumstance.          MR. EISENBERG:  It certainly shouldn't be aplausible ground test, and even the petitioner agrees withthat position, Your Honor.          And it certainly would work if we adopted, as Ithink Congress did, a system like the one that JusticeScalia spelled out because then the defendant knows.          And I'd like to get back, as I was discussingwith Justice Kennedy, to what the defendant knows.  Heknows that if he's outside the time that he's guaranteedautomatic review, whether direct appeal or State review,391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 State post-conviction review, that his chances of2 exhausting more claims in State court --3 JUSTICE BREYER: Actually most prisoners are not4 represented, I don't think, at this stage. They -- they5 haven't a clue about the word exhaustion, and they haven't6 a clue about the statute of limitations. So they file a7 -- a paper in -- in the State court, and they say this8 roughly is what my problem is. Is that what happens, or9 are they all quite educated?10 MR. EISENBERG: Your Honor, the -- the Congress11 that passed this statute of limitations is the same12 Congress that made the decision about whether habeas13 petitioners would be appointed counsel or not. So to say14 that we can't really apply the statute of limitations15 because it would be unfair as to those petitioners who are16 unrepresented would be essentially to undercut the statute17 of limitations --18 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm trying to get from you what19 is your opinion of a practical approach to this problem in20 Oklahoma, say.21 MR. EISENBERG: The practical approach to the22 problem is to look at the statute that says you have a23 year. If you file your petition within that year,24 whatever you've got at the end of that year, you can take25 to Federal court and be confident that it's exhausted. If401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 you want to do something after that year, you can't be2 confident anymore. All you have to do is -- is count a3 year.4 Now, if something comes up after that time,5 you're supposed to go to State court first, even if you've6 got something in Federal court. This statute of7 limitations isn't supposed to be interpreted in order to8 make the Federal successive petitions standard moot and9 unnecessary. It exists for a reason. So if a -- if a10 claim arises at a later point, after you have finished11 your guaranteed review in State court, go back to State12 court, whether or not you've got something pending in13 Federal court. Don't put that new claim in with your old14 claims in Federal court because then you have a mixed15 petition. If you get exhaustion in State court, whether16 you're timely or untimely, you're going to exhaust. You17 can then go back to Federal court with a request for a18 successive petition. It -- that's what you have to do and19 that's appropriate because that's how Congress set up the20 statute, with the 1-year filing deadline and -- and a21 provision for successive petitions.22 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask how you would handle23 a case that is a successive petition, a late -- a recently24 found claim, and the -- filed beyond the statute of25 limitations but the State has three exceptions to the411111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 statute, but it does not require that the -- the2 petitioner identify the exception in the petition? It3 just allows it for the judge to decide. Would there be4 tolling during the period in which the judge decided5 whether or not the petition was timely in your view?6 MR. EISENBERG: No, Your Honor, because all the7 court is doing is deciding whether the time bar applies,8 and in order -- in a State that has those kind of9 categories, what the court is, in effect, doing is10 deciding what kind of time limit applies to this11 particular petition.12 JUSTICE STEVENS: And even if it takes a year or13 so to make that decision, you'd say no tolling.14 MR. EISENBERG: Your Honor, that's really true15 of every kind of statute of limitations issue that can16 come up. Take away those three exceptions. Just have the17 1-year flat time bar. Does that mean that the State court18 isn't going to have to take some time to look at it and19 decide? What if there's a prisoner mailbox question?20 What if there's an amendment question of the type that21 this Court just granted cert on last month in Mayle v.22 Felix? What if there's a question about how to compute --23 JUSTICE STEVENS: And in all of those questions,24 you'd say there would be no tolling in order to find out25 whether it was timely or not.421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. EISENBERG:  That's right because during thattime, the State court is deciding on timeliness, and ifit's untimely, it was untimely as of the point of filing.That's what makes it a filing requirement.  You take yourclaim and you file it --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But what about the reasoningin Artuz that the application was -- if it turns out laterit was timely, it would have been properly filed?          MR. EISENBERG:  I'm sorry.  I -- I think Iunderstand Artuz to have said that if the application wasuntimely, then it was not properly filed and it was notproperly filed from the get-go, Your Honor.          The question that was reserved in Artuz iswhether something about exceptions changes that statementin Artuz.  And my response is that certainly nothing aboutthe kind of exceptions that were present in this casechanged the response.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  No, but if I understand youcorrectly, you're saying that even if it takes the judge 6months to decide whether it was timely, if he ends up withthe conclusion that it was not timely, there would be notolling for that 6-month period.          MR. EISENBERG:  That's correct, Your Honor.          Now, in Pennsylvania, of course, all you have todo to be timely is file within the 1 year.  And whatever431111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 you've exhausted is done.2 That -- I'd like to go from that into expanding3 more on the equitable tolling because I think that that4 plays in here. This defendant had two rounds. The first5 round was 4 years, not even just 3, but I believe closer6 to 4 years before there was a filing deadline in either7 State court or Federal court. Now, when you decide to8 wait -- he didn't have a filing deadline, but when you9 decide to wait, you take your chances. There's a rule10 that's even more immutable than time limits or11 jurisdiction, and it is that things change. When you12 wait, you take the risk that your evidence may change, the13 facts may change, the law may change. That's what14 happened to this defendant while he sat and did nothing.15 He says he was learning the law during that16 period. Well, then would it -- is it just 4 years? What17 if it had taken him 8 years or 12 years to learn the law?18 He had the filing deadline that came up. He never claimed19 that he didn't understand what it was. He could have20 beaten any of those filing deadlines in State or Federal21 court. He says, I have no incentive for delay. I'm not a22 capital defendant. All I wanted was a speedy resolution23 of my claims. But in that case, he didn't need a filing24 deadline to make himself come to court.25 The fact is that there are thousands of cases in441111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 which noncapital defendants file these kinds of late2 petitions, and the State courts are trying to deal with3 them. And this is the way that Pennsylvania chose to try4 to deal with the problem in State court, in its State5 courts, not just for capital cases, but for noncapital6 cases.7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why are there thousands8 of cases in which noncapital defendants file this type of9 case? What -- what incentives do noncapital defendants10 have to drag it on?11 MR. EISENBERG: The incentive that they have to12 drag it on is that they may come up with a new legal13 theory that attracts a -- a court that they didn't present14 before, that new facts may come up, may arise that they15 try to argue. That's what this defendant did, although16 they weren't really new. They were facts that were17 available to him as of the -- the day of his guilty plea18 in 1986. He claimed that they were new. And if there's19 no cost to doing that, if in fact there may be a benefit20 to doing that, then why not? If --21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems -- it seems intuitive22 also that the prosecution's witnesses will be difficult to23 locate and so forth. Has -- has there been anything24 written about that, about prejudice to the prosecution25 from -- from delay, or is it just something we --451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. EISENBERG: Well, it's certainly something2 that --3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- we take judicial notice of?4 MR. EISENBERG: It's certainly something that5 any prosecutor would tell you, Your Honor.6 This -- this crime occurred 20 years ago in7 1985. And this was a relatively simple case. A police8 officer came on to the scene while the defendant was9 bashing the head of the victim with a nightstick. But10 even in a simple case, you're going to have problems of11 proof, and the party with the primary problems of proof is12 the party with the burden of proof, and that's the13 prosecution. So, of course, there's going to be a problem14 for the prosecution, and that's why we adopt -- one of the15 reasons that we adopt this kind time limit.16 Even once the petitioner did come back to State17 court, though, Your Honor -- and this gets back to the18 questions that Justice O'Connor was raising initially --19 he raised essentially the same claims. He says, well,20 this time around, I put them in a different guise,21 different facts in support of my claim about my guilty22 plea, different legal labels. Yes, but all in the context23 of -- of ineffective assistance because the only way he24 could get into court a second time for a second round of25 post-conviction review in Pennsylvania was to say that my461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425lawyer at my first round of State post-conviction reviewwas ineffective.  He didn't attach these affidavits frommy mother and father.  He didn't call it due processinstead of whatever else he called it.          Now, petitioner could make those --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, he also raised an -- anentirely different claim, didn't he?  I mean, it goes toultimately the same point, but he raised the claim thatthe court had not engaged in an adequate colloquy --          MR. EISENBERG:  The reason the colloquy wasn'tadequate is precisely for the same reason that he wasattacking his lawyers, in the petitioner's view, that itdidn't explain to him the meaning of a life sentence.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Right.  But that -- the -- Imean, it's a different claim.  The judge has anindependent responsibility.  It's not the lawyer'sresponsibility.          MR. EISENBERG:  Your Honor, that's a claim thatwas waived if it was not presented in the first --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  That -- that may be, but it isa different claim.          MR. EISENBERG:  But          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Itineffective assistance.MR. EISENBERG: But 47-- but --is not the claim ofthe only way that the1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 petitioner could exhaust that claim in State court on a2 second round of post-conviction review would be to put it3 in terms of ineffective assistance of first post-4 conviction counsel. And, of course, he can't then take5 that claim and come to Federal court because claims of the6 ineffectiveness of post-conviction counsel are not7 cognizable on Federal habeas review.8 So not only did he wait 4 years when he had no9 filing deadline impediments to come to court, but he then10 raised in State court claims that he couldn't have turned11 into exhausted Federal claims anyway in order to add to12 what was available to him, to the universe of claims that13 were available to him after his initial round of State14 post-conviction review.15 And we're talking about equitable tolling for16 somebody who only has a problem because of his own17 inaction for 4 years and who even then spent another 318 years in State court on claims that he couldn't bring to19 State court, and even then, in the face of developing20 State law about the time bar, refused to look at it. So21 not only did we have a statute that says you're in22 trouble, you're time-barred now --23 JUSTICE STEVENS: Just as a matter of curiosity,24 is the transcript of the plea colloquy still available?25 MR. EISENBERG: Yes, Your Honor. It's in the481111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 appendix. And what the judge --2 JUSTICE STEVENS: And was there the3 constitutional violation he alleges?4 MR. EISENBERG: What the judge said5 is, you understand that your sentence will be6 the petitioner said yes each time.7 Now, his claim later on -- and he's8 didn't think that was his claim when he filed9 post-conviction review petition in 1986. He just thought10 his claim was that his plea was involuntary. Once he got11 counsel appointed, it turned out that his claim was, oh,12 my lawyer didn't specifically -- neither my lawyer nor the13 judge specifically told me that by life they meant life as14 opposed to something less than life.15 JUSTICE STEVENS: The irony of this whole16 proceeding is it seems to me it would be a lot easier to17 decide the merits of that claim if the transcript is18 available 192021than to get into all these issues --MR. EISENBERG:  Well, but, Your Honor --JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- we have today.MR. EISENBERG:  I'm sorry.That's what happened.  That claim was litigated2223 on the first round of post-conviction review and the State24 courts rejected it because of the transcript of the25 colloquy. The defendant could have taken that claim to491111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-three timeslife, andright.  Hehis first￼1 Federal court in 1992. He just didn't. Now --2 JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, he's a 17-year-old3 without any learning in the law. He probably didn't4 realize there's any requirement that these things have to5 appear in the transcript. I mean, that's understandable.6 MR. EISENBERG: He -- he knew it appeared in the7 transcript. That was the basis of his claim in -- on8 State post-conviction review. He had not one but two9 lawyers appointed for that review and he litigated it on10 up through the State highest court.11 But even when he came back in 1996, he knew the12 statute was there. He's never claimed he was confused by13 the new time bar. He says, I thought I would get some14 exceptions to it. But then the State court came and said,15 no, it's jurisdictional, no exceptions. Defendant didn't16 do anything. It was 1997, still 2 years before he filed17 in Federal court. Didn't take note of that State -- he18 took note of it. He acknowledges in his pleadings that he19 knew about it, but he decided not to go to Federal court20 anyway.21 More -- more cases come out from the State22 courts, even the decision in his own court -- in his own23 case from the State's highest court. Even when we get to24 July of 1999 and the State supreme court denies review on25 the timeliness question in his own case, the petitioner501111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 says, even then how was I supposed to know that I wasn't2 going to get some kind of exception to the State time bar?3 I didn't know that until the next month when another case4 came out from the State supreme court. This was the third5 or the fourth from the State supreme court in somebody6 else's case. Only then in August of 1999 did I finally7 know that I was time-barred, meaning I knew then that I8 had never been getting any tolling, that for the last 39 years, I didn't have 1 day of tolling on my Federal10 claims.11 And at that point did he then go to Federal12 court? Even then he didn't. Even in August 1999 when the13 petitioner says, finally I know that I've been out of luck14 for the last 3 years, that I'm 3 years late to Federal15 court, does he rush in then? No. He waits another 516 months after August of 1999 to finally come to Federal17 court and18 I've been19 court.20say here's my petition, here's the claims thatworking on and that I have litigated in StateThat's not equitable tolling, Your Honor. It's 21 not equitable tolling under the circumstances of the22 specific circumstances of this case, and it's not23 equitable tolling in general when a petitioner claims24 essentially I have a mistake of law, I thought that I25 would win, I knew there were arguments against me, I knew511111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425I might lose those arguments, but I really thought I couldwin, and therefore you should give me equitable tollingwhile I pursue them.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Mr. Eisenberg.          MR. EISENBERG:  Thank you very much.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Wycoff, you have about 4minutes left.             REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID WYCOFF                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. WYCOFF:  Several things.  First of all, therespondent said that in the second petition Mr. Pace onlypresented State law, ineffective assistance of post-conviction claims, which are not Federal claims.  That'sabsolutely not true.  He presented the ineffectiveassistance of post-conviction counsel as a waiver-overcoming mechanism not as a substantive claim forrelief.  The substantive claims were due process claim,ineffective assistance of counsel, and new facts whichneeded to be exhausted under Third Circuit exhaustion law.          Second, respondent suggested and -- and theThird Circuit also suggested that State law somehow becameclear in mid-December 1997 when the Superior Court, whichis Pennsylvania's intermediate court, decided a casecalled Alcorn.  Alcorn was the first case to apply thetime bar.  But the Third Circuit itself, after Alcorn in521111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 the Lambert case, held that the -- the statutory language2 of the time bar is not dispositive and you have to exhaust3 even if you don't meet one of the statutory exceptions4 because the court may fashion judicial exceptions just5 like they did for all the other procedural bar rules.6 In fact, Pennsylvania in the Lambert case, in7 their opposition to the certiorari petition in May of8 1998, said that that's a correct statement of Pennsylvania9 law, that there are judicially created exceptions,10 including the miscarriage of justice exception which will11 probably apply to the time bar, just like they applied to12 the other statutory bars.13 So Alcorn did not, even if it could have,14 it's an intermediate court, it did not clear up the15 of the law. The law did not become clear as to the16 specific things that Mr. Pace alleged, which is the17 miscarriage of justice exception under Pennsylvania18 and the illegal sentence exception, judicially created19 exceptions to bar, were not rejected by the Pennsylvania20 Supreme Court until July of -- I'm sorry -- August of21 1999, which is -- by that time Mr. Pace was already out of22 State court so those -- the law became clear in State23 court after he was already done litigating.24 The Third Circuit did not actually find the25 statutory language of the PCRA time bar dispositive of the531111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-since statelaw￼1 exhaustion question until March of 2000. The district2 courts, not just Judge Giles, Chief Judge Giles' 20 years3 experience on the bench, not just him, lots of district4 courts send people back to exhaust during this same time5 period.6 State law was unclear. State law appeared to7 provide remedies and possible merits review. Because the8 State law was unclear, Third Circuit exhaustion law9 required petitioners like Mr. Pace to go back and exhaust.10 And he did exactly what the circuit law required of him.11 And as a matter of equity, the court cannot punish someone.12 A Federal court can't say, do X, and then after that person13 does it, say, sorry, you're out of court. It's not fair14 and it shouldn't happen here.15 As to statutory tolling, I just want to -- the16 -- the Court I think can just easily decide this case just17 by reaffirming the central holding of Artuz which is when18 a State court allows you to file, gives your filing19 judicial review, applies a bar rule on a claim-by-claim20 basis, that was a condition to obtaining relief on claims21 in the petition. It's not a condition to filing the22 petition itself. And if the State court eventually holds23 all your claims are barred, as they did in Artuz, the24 petition is, nevertheless, properly filed and should toll25 AEDPA's statutory -- under AEDPA's statutory tolling541111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112131415161718192021222324251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400provisions.          If there are no further questions.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Mr. Wycoff.          The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 12:00 p.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)55 1-Washington, DC 20005￼1561111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-
