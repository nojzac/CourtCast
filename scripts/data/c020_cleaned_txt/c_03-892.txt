SALMONS                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. SALMONS:  Thank you, Justice Stevens, andmay it please the Court:          Section 61(a) of the Internal Revenue Codedefines gross income to include all income from whateversource derived.  As this Court has held, that definitionis sweeping and represents an intent by Congress to exertthe full measure of its taxing power.          The court of appeals decisions below, byexcluding from respondent's gross income the portion oflitigation proceeds paid to their attorneys undercontingent fee agreements, is inconsistent with twolongstanding Federal tax law principles for defining grossincome.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Now, if -- if this didn'tinvolve the alternative minimum tax, would the amount bedeductible?          MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, but for the41111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425alternative minimum tax, there would be an -- a miscellaneous itemized deduction --          MR. SALMONS:  -- under section 212 of thecode --          MR. SALMONS:  -- that would be subject to thelimit of the 2 percent of adjusted gross income thatapplies to itemized deductions.  But section56(b)(1)(A) --Right? 2JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's of annual income.percent of -- of the person's annual income?MR. SALMONS:  Of the adjusted gross income.JUSTICE SCALIA:  For the year.          MR. SALMONS:  For the year.  That's correct,Your Honor.JUSTICE SCALIA: But, gee, in the case of a -- of a major award, that 2 percent is very likely to be exceeded, isn't it?          MR. SALMONS:  It -- it certainly may, YourHonor.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  So this is a problem that'sgoing to exist even -- even after the alternate minimumtax is abolished.  Right?(Laughter.)MR. SALMONS: I'm not sure entirely what you're referring to as the problem, but it is the case that --51111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 that --2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you don't think -- the3 Government doesn't think it's a problem. I'm talking4 about taking a huge percentage of the -- of the person's5 recovery. That -- that will happen even -- even in the6 case where there's no minimum tax -- alternative.7 MR. SALMONS: That is correct. That -- that is8 correct, Your Honor. Now, I mean -- and let me make two9 points about that.10 The first is that as a -- as a general matter,11 the tax code defines gross income expansively, and there's12 a number of this Court's cases that make that clear. Then13 -- then the question becomes are there deductions provided14 that allow for certain expenses to be deducted.15 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Don't some States such as16 Oregon require a plaintiff to remit a portion of punitive17 damages recovered to the State so they don't even go to18 the taxpayer? But is the taxpayer saddled with that too?19 MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I would think the20 answer to that question is no. It's not a question that I21 have examined in depth in -- in this case because it's not22 presented, but as a general matter --23 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what about attorney's24 fees in class actions? As I understand it, those are not25 regarded by the Government as attributable all to the61111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425taxpayer.MR. SALMONS: Your Honor --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  A plaintiff who's part of aclass in a class action suit where attorney's fees arepaid.          MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, we believe that thesame principles would apply to class action lawsuits as toother lawsuits in terms of the taxation of litigationproceeds.  It may very well be the case in a number ofclass action contexts that when applying those principles,the proper -- the proper analysis leads to the conclusionthat the taxpayer doesn't exert sufficient control andthat the payment of attorney's fees is not in response toa debt owed by the taxpayer.  And so there might be adifferent result.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, I -- I thought we were-- our attention was pointed to a number of instanceswhere the Internal Revenue Service did not require thetaxpayer to show all the attorney's fees as income inthose class action situations.          MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, that is correct.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Yes.          MR. SALMONS:  I want to be clear.  We think thesame principles apply across the board to defining grossincome.  In applying that in a number of class action71111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 contexts, the proper answer may be that it's not included2 in gross income because there wasn't sufficient control3 and because it wasn't paid in -- in lieu of a debt owed by4 the taxpayer. But here --5 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why -- why isn't there as much6 control in each case? I mean, the -- somebody goes to a7 lawyer with a claim and says, press the claim for me,8 recover if you can. What's the difference in -- in terms9 of control? So that if you win this case, why doesn't it10 apply to class action?11 MR. SALMONS: Again, the principles would apply12 and there may very well be class actions --13 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, and I -- I want to know14 why the result would be different.15 MR. SALMONS: Again, I'm -- I'm trying to be as16 specific as I can. There may be situations in which, even17 in the class action context, there's a fee agreement18 between the -- the class member and the lawyer so that the19 payment of attorney's fees is in satisfaction of a debt20 owed by the class member, and in that situation we think21 that it would be --22 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why -- why would -- why would23 that analysis appear? Certainly there's -- there's not24 going to be any fee paid in the -- in the paradigm example25 of the class action without a recovery.81111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. SALMONS: That's correct, Your Honor. There -- there are situations --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  So we're in the -- so we're inthe situation we're in right now, aren't we?          MR. SALMONS:  We are in the situation in whichthere's a need to apply the general principles fordefining gross income.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  All right.  But let me just --I'll just press the point one more time.  I don'tunderstand, based on what you've said, why the classaction result would be different from the result thatyou're arguing for here if you win this case.          MR. SALMONS:  And -- and what I'm trying topoint out, Your Honor, is that there may very well beclass actions where it's not different.  There may be somewhen -- where it is if it's the case that there's nocontractual obligations to pay the fee -- pay the feebetween the class member and the attorney, and if it's thecase that the class member really exerts no meaningfulcontrol over the -- over the attorney's fees portion --          JUSTICE BREYER:  I thought the class actiondistinction that the commissioner had was between opt inand opt out.          MR. SALMONS:  That is certainly one of thefactors that -- that the commissioner has looked to in91111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 those class --2 JUSTICE BREYER: So if you opt in, then you did3 exercise control. So all the money is yours. But if you4 opt out, you didn't have control over the suit because you5 didn't opt out. I mean, you just were lethargic.6 MR. SALMONS: Again, those are all facts --7 JUSTICE BREYER: That's the basic thing. I8 mean, I'm trying to understand what the principle is for9 the reason that it's pretty hard for me to reconcile the10 commissioner's view in the class action case with the11 punitive damage case because there the person has control12 over the lawsuit. So why doesn't all the punitive damage,13 attorney's fees that come out of that, and so forth belong14 to -- in other words, it sounds to me, as I read this,15 something16 principle1718 to be clear, I -- I don't think the commissioner has ever19 taken the position that all class actions don't present20 the -- the possibility of the attorney's fees portion of1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005of a mess, and I'd like to know what the clearis.MR. SALMONS:  Yes, Your Honor.  And -- and just21 the award22 income.2324 practical25 that. You can imagine a number of class actions --being included in -- in the class member's grossNow, there are real enforcement issues, as amatter, to trying to -- to trying to implement10￼1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: When you say the class2 member, do you -- you mean the named representative. The3 class may include thousands of people, but it would be4 income to the named representative? Is that --5 MR. SALMONS: Well, presumably, Your Honor, that6 -- only the portion of the attorney's fees that would be7 attributable to the -- the named representative's recovery8 would be included in the named representative's gross9 income. I don't think that the named representative would10 be on the hook, if you will, for all of the attorney's11 fees that would relate to other class members' recoveries.12 But I think what all this points out is that --13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then -- then would it14 be -- would the income then go to each class -- would each15 class member have a share of the income?16 MR. SALMONS: In a number of instances, yes,17 Your Honor. Again, the -- the way that we think that18 class action cases should be resolved is the same way that19 -- that these issues are approached in all cases, which is20 to look at the type of relationship that exists between21 the -- the client and the attorney to see whether the22 payment is made in -- in response to a debt owed by the23 client and also to look to the degree24 client has over the -- the underlying25 And in this context, it is --11of control that thesource of income.1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose -- suppose the same2 amount were paid, as was paid here, to the attorney, but3 it was not by way of a contingent fee, that the -- the4 client had committed to pay this dollar amount in a dollar5 amount.6 MR. SALMONS: As a flat fee?7 JUSTICE SCALIA: As a flat fee. What -- what8 would the tax treatment of that be?9 MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I think in fact it is10 undisputed in -- in the -- in these cases that if the11 payment of attorney's fees had either been under an hourly12 rate arrangement or a flat fee arrangement, that the13 entire amount of the litigation proceeds would be included14 in the -- in the respondent's gross income and nothing15 about the contingent fee arrangements here should --16 should alter that result. The respondents --17 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, let -- let me ask you18 about Professor Davenport's theory. He filed a -- an19 amicus brief here saying that the contingency fee or the20 attorney's fees should be capitalized as a transaction21 cost increasing the basis of the property which was the22 claim in the lawsuit.23 MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I'm trying to recall24 that amicus brief. I believe that -- was that an25 argument, I believe, about the application of section 83121111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425of the tax code when you have a transaction -- JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes.          MR. SALMONS:  -- in exchange for services andyou provide property?          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Yes.          MR. SALMONS:  We think that the better way toanalyze this is that in fact there was no transfer of theunderlying cause of action, and so we think that -- thatwe -- that gets into a very complicated area as to how youvalue the attorney's fees at the time.JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you -- you don't need a transfer of the -- I don't understand what you mean --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  No, I don't either.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- a transfer of the -- thecause of action.  Certainly if you buy a piece of realestate and -- and there's lawyer's business connected withit, you -- you don't -- you don't take an ordinarydeduction which is subject to the alternative minimum taxfor those lawyer's fees.  You just say that's part of thetransaction, and it goes onto the basis of your property.Right?          MR. SALMONS:  I believe that's correct, YourHonor.  But the point I was making --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why isn't -- why isn't thatvery similar to this?  I mean, what difference does it131111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425make whether there's a -- there's a transaction here,isn't there?  Isn't there a transaction?          MR. SALMONS:  Well, there is an agreement to paya fee for a service, and in that sense there is atransaction, yes.JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but a -- the service is connected to a transaction, namely the conversion of the chosen action into a money payment. You have this --          MR. SALMONS:  That -- that is correct.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- this unformed chosen action.You're entitled to it, but there's a transactionconverting it into a money payment.  Now, why shouldn'tyou attribute to that transaction all -- which isprofitable to you, all of the costs that go along with thetransaction?          MR. SALMONS:  Well, again, Your Honor, we thinkthat transaction is essentially identical to numeroustransactions that take place every day out in the realworld where -- where taxpayers retain professionalservices in exchange for a commission or a percentage ofthe income that's generated.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  That is a problem that occursto me.  I don't know where you draw the line.  And you sayyou can't draw a line.          MR. SALMONS:  That is absolutely correct.  I141111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 don't see 234 -- and an5 or a financial analyst.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- on that, that example,7 you gave the book contract with the author and you gave, I8 think, the investor. Would this problem arise in thoseany basis for distinguishing between --JUSTICE GINSBURG: How does it work?MR. SALMONS: -- the attorneys here and -- and a agent negotiating a book contract for an author9 cases or would the author get an above-the-line deduction?10 MR. SALMONS: No, Your Honor. I believe that11 the author in those -- in that situation would receive the12 same deduction that prior to the enactment of section 70313 of the American Jobs Creation Act where Congress just14 addressed in part the -- the issue raised in these15 cases --16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you say the author -- that17 these people are all in the same --18 MR. SALMONS: They would have an itemized --19 excuse me -- a miscellaneous itemized deduction for the20 cost incurred in -- in producing income that under the21 alternative minimum tax would not be allowed.22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there any argument -- you23 -- you said at the outset that it has to be an itemized24 deduction subject to the two percent rule even if we set25 aside the alternative minimum tax. Is that conceded by151111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 everyone, or does somebody -- do some people say this is2 an ordinary and necessary expense? I know it's not your3 business, but it seems to me an ordinary and necessary4 expense to recover the -- the -- for employment5 discrimination, which is really part of your work. I6 don't know why -- is it -- does everybody agree that this7 is subject to the 2 percent rule?8 MR. SALMONS: I will -- I will have to allow9 respondents to speak for themselves to that question, but10 as far as I'm aware, that is not in dispute in these cases11 or in any of the cases that have been litigated that --12 that but -- that but for the alternative minimum tax, the13 way this would have been handled is that there would have14 been a miscellaneous itemized deduction under section 21215 of the code for the cost incurred in producing income, and16 that the alternative minimum tax, along with, by the way,17 a large number of other perfectly valid deductions, get18 disallowed under the alternative minimum tax.19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I can't get out of my20 mind in this case that the mechanics of the particular21 case may control. I know we need a national rule and so22 forth. My recollection is that in some States when there23 is a settlement or a judgment paid under a case where24 there's a contingency fee contract, the check is made out25 both to the attorney and to the client and is put in the161111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425attorney's client's trust account.  So the client neverhas control over it.MR. SALMONS: Well --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Let's assume that that's truein most of the States.MR. SALMONS: That -- that -- I know that were -- that was the facts, Your Honor, in the -- in the Banks case, that there was a check made out to both. In fact -- in fact, there was --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So in a very real -- in -- ina very real sense, in a -- in the legal sense, the clientjust doesn't have control.MR. SALMONS: Well, Your Honor, we disagree with that for, it seems to me, at least three reasons. The first is that at the time the client entered into the fee agreement, he certainly had control then. He had complete control over his cause of action. He was --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, he -- he did or hedidn't, but there was no money there.  There was nothingthere.          MR. SALMONS:  Well, there was an entitlement torecover.  Now, there might have been a dispute as to theproper amount or whether that claim was valid, but he wasentitled to recover based on the injury he suffered thatwas cognizable at law and that gave raise to a cause of171111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 action.2 Now, in exchange for legal services, he promised3 to pay a portion of the recovery to the lawyer. That is a4 promise to pay a fee. That is not an assignment or any5 other transfer of the underlying cause of action. And it6 is undisputed, I think --7 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Salmons, doesn't the8 plausibility of your argument here rest on the assumption9 that what the -- that the cause of action at the time the10 -- that the plaintiff made the agreement with the lawyer11 is a cause of action which has the same value as the12 ultimate recovery that the lawyer gets? Whereas, in fact,13 the cause of action at the time of the agreement with the14 lawyer has an inchoate value. The -- the value that is15 actually realized is going to depend in part on the -- on16 the skill and -- and the -- the gumption of the lawyer.17 So that the -- what I'm getting at -- and -- and18 going to Justice Kennedy's question, it seems to me that19 the value realized as opposed to the right to sue are two20 different figures. And I don't see realistically how the21 client has complete control over the value realized, which22 we don't even know until the lawyer has done his work and23 gotten the check.24 MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, two responses to that25 question, if I may. The first is that, as a matter of181111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 law, it is the client that controls the cause of action2 and throughout the time period, even after they -- they3 enter into an -- a contingent fee agreement, it is the4 client that owns and controls the cause of action and he5 decides whether to settle. He decides whether to press6 forward or withdraw the case. He decides whether to fire7 the lawyer or not. He is a -- he controls the source of8 the income. Therefore --9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even -- even the potential10 lawyer's fee. I mean, suppose this client has a major11 dental repair and he's got a risk-taking dentist, and he12 says, dentist, I'm going to give you a deal. I know you13 like to take risks. I may win big in my lawsuit, in which14 case you get everything; and I may lose, in which case you15 get nothing. The dentist says, fine, I'll take it. Can16 the client in that agreement with his dentist give what17 will be the lawyer's fee, the part that will go to the18 lawyer under the contingency fee agreement?19 MR. SALMONS: Well, presumably, Your Honor, if20 he's already -- he's already promised that to the21 attorney, he would be in violation of his agreement with22 the attorney if he did so, and his attorney could sue him23 to recover or the dentist could sue him to recover.24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then he doesn't have -- then25 he doesn't have dominion over that portion.191111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. SALMONS: Well, because he's -- he's given2 it away. In that sense I think -- and -- and in answering3 this, if I may just go back to one point that Justice4 Souter made and that is that I don't think it's the case5 that our analysis turns at all on how you value the claim,6 either at the time of the fee agreement or afterwards.7 Our analysis says at all relevant times, regardless of8 whether the value changed or not, the client was at all9 times in control of the underlying source of income, and10 it's just as if in Helvering v. Horst the father assigns11 the -- the bond coupon to his son, but he controls the12 underlying source of income.13 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the bond coupon has a14 certain value at the time the father assigns it.15 MR. SALMONS: That's true.16 JUSTICE SOUTER: The only thing that has to be17 realized after the assignment of the coupon is the passage18 of time at which it will be payable. Here we do not have19 a definite value. We don't know -- there's no way to know20 for sure what that value will be until the lawsuit is over21 with. The -- the two are not comparable.22 MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, that would be equally23 true of an assignment of a stock dividend while I retain24 the stock. I may not know what the dividend payment is25 going to be, but if I control the underlying source of201111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 income, i.e., the stock, then the transfer to someone else2 of the dividend doesn't alter the incident of tax, even if3 it's unknown.4 And I would point out that in Lucas v. Earl, the5 husband and wife in that case entered into agreement to6 assign to each other 50 percent of their income in 1901,7 long before the income tax was even instituted, and the8 tax years at issue in that case were 1920 and 1921. If9 anything, it was much more speculative and uncertain what10 income would have been earned 20 years later in that case,11 and that did not stop the Court from --12 JUSTICE BREYER: So you're -- you're --13 MR. SALMONS: -- applying this principle that --14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I -- can I ask you a15 question relating to the Davenport -- what's been referred16 to as the Davenport theory? I had thought that -- that17 the service has used the -- the transaction theory with18 regard to legal fees payable for a lawsuit seeking19 increased compensation for the condemnation of real estate20 where the taxpayer had objected to the amount that the21 condemning entity was offering and brought suit in court22 and with a contingent fee to the lawyer and that the23 service treated that as -- as part of the transaction24 cost. Am I wrong about that?25 MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, to my knowledge, the211111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 -- the IRS has had a consistent position that the entire2 amount of litigation proceeds, including the amount that3 may be paid to a lawyer under a contingent fee agreement,4 even in the condemnation context, is tax -- is included in5 the gross income of -- of the taxpayer.6 And I would point Your Honor to the case out of7 the Federal Circuit, Baylin v. United States. That case8 involved a condemnation action, and the court of appeals9 in that case addressed the issue that's presented in these10 cases and concluded that it was includable in gross11 income.12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe my recollection is wrong.13 I'll look again.14 MR. SALMONS: And -- and I would point out, Your15 Honor -- and this has to do, I think, with the impact of16 the new legislation that's been pointed to in the17 supplemental briefs -- that at least six of the court of18 appeals cases addressing the issue presented in these19 cases involved claims that would not be covered under the20 new section 703 because they -- they don't involve claims21 for unlawful discrimination or -- or FCA claims or certain22 Medicare claims --23 JUSTICE BREYER: But can -- can I ask you to go24 back for a minute? I guess the IRS -- you're seeing the25 lawsuit as the income-generating asset.221111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. SALMONS: That's correct, Your Honor.2 JUSTICE BREYER: And you're looking at the3 control of the plaintiff, for example, over the lawsuit as4 something that determines whether it's his income. And5 he, of course, can't give away his income. But on that6 theory, to go back to Justice O'Connor's original7 question, then the punitive damages also must be his8 income because he has equal control over them and they9 grow out of the income-producing asset. And that, of10 course, is what's bothering me because it seems to me that11 your theory, which is a well-established theory, coupled12 with a Congress that seems to be willing to take away13 deductions for expenses that lead to the income, could14 produce an income tax that in many cases, not just a few,15 exceeds the income that an individual has. And I would16 like to know what in the law is there to guard against17 that result.18 MR. SALMONS: Well, Your Honor, I guess my19 response to that is that, first --20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Other -- other than the mercy21 of the Internal Revenue Service.22 (Laughter.)23 MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, the fact of the matter24 is, is that Congress has looked at -- at this issue, and25 in the new section that I just referred to, section 703 --231111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, but does that happen?You haven't answered the question.  Are there instanceswhere plaintiffs in lawsuits end up receiving tax bills,as a result of this scheme, for more money than theyreceived in the lawsuit?          MR. SALMONS:  That has occurred, Your Honor.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Yes.          MR. SALMONS:  And -- and Congress responded toconcerns about that very result --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but doesn't -- doesn'tthat indicate --          MR. SALMONS:  -- in the new section.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- something basically flawedabout your whole theory?          MR. SALMONS:  No, Your Honor.  It is --JUSTICE KENNEDY: This is not income in any -- in any real sense.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there any constitutionalprotection?  The Sixteenth Amendment refers to an incometax, and perhaps that doesn't include a tax that grosslyexceeds in many cases a person's income.  That would bequite a far-out theory at the moment.          MR. SALMONS:  I think it would be, Your Honor.          JUSTICE BREYER:  But I -- that's why I ask you.Is there any protection in the law whatsoever?  Or if241111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 Congress decides to tax a set of people who, let's see --2 say, earn $10,000 a year and because they're small3 business people, they happen to have $20,000 expenses. So4 it taxes them on $20,000, and the tax exceeds the income.5 There's no protection in your view against that result.6 And you just said, well, Congress decided to do it, it7 decided to do it.8 MR. SALMONS: But we do think, Your Honor, that9 the only limit on Congress' taxing authority would be the10 Constitution, and I don't see a constitutional violation11 in disallowing a deduction, but --12 JUSTICE BREYER: What about an assumption, for13 example, that when we read the code, we read it with a14 view towards thinking Congress did not want to produce15 such unfair results?16 MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, if I may. The way I17 would respond to that concern is that the proper way to18 address it is not as the courts below did and as19 respondents urge, to alter or distort the general20 definition for gross income under the -- under the tax21 code which may have broad ramifications in a number of22 areas outside of this one, but to go to Congress, as in23 fact people have done, and to get them to make -- make24 additional deductions or otherwise alter the alternative25 minimum tax, which generates the primary concern I think251111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425at issue in these cases.JUSTICE GINSBURG: What happened in the cases -- MR. SALMONS: That's the proper way to handlethat.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There were cases -- we don'thave to deal in hypotheticals.  There were cases wherethis happened, where people ended up liable for a taxgreater than what they took in.  What happened in thosecases?MR. SALMONS: They were -- they were liable for a tax greater than what they took in. Those were pointed to Congress --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I mean, there was one thatwas $99,000, if I remember right.MR. SALMONS: I believe that's correct. Those were pointed out to Congress and that was part of what motivated Congress --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Was there a private bill?MR. SALMONS: -- to enact section 703 to protect --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Or what happened?  Whatactually happened in that case, do you know?MR. SALMONS: I do not know, Your Honor. My -- my understanding is that the tax was assessed and I don't know whether --261111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Salmons, I -- I -- you've2 cited the -- the Baylin case to me and I -- I've looked at3 the description of it in the brief, which I had recalled,4 and what it says is that it did, indeed, involve a taking5 by the State, and when the State didn't offer what Baylin6 thought was -- was enough, he went to court, he prevailed,7 and recovered a much larger sum than the State had offered8 him. His legal fees were, by the IRS, subtracted from the9 award, and he was taxed only upon the proceeds reduced by10 the legal11 there?12 131415 apologize. My -- my recollection was that -- was that the16 court in that case had included the attorney's fees in17 gross income. But -- but --18 JUSTICE SCALIA: I doubt -- I doubt whether19 Professor Davenport has misdescribed the case in -- in his20 brief, but I --21 MR. SALMONS: But -- but again, Your Honor, if I22 may. I think the -- the basic point to recall here is23 that the definition of gross income cuts across the tax24 code. If there are concerns about application, then the25 proper result is to go to Congress, as has been done.271111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005fees.  Now, how do you explain that situationMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, if I --JUSTICE SCALIA: And how does that --MR. SALMONS: -- misremembered that case, I￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Congress has addressed the very concerns cited byrespondents and the amici in this case, and thatspecifically is the -- the application on civil rightsplaintiffs.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Does the Fifth AmendmentTakings Clause apply to a Government tax scheme that taxessomething beyond the income received?MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, it -- there may be -- there may be a takings issue at some point. Again, there may be constitutional limitations.JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, at the point where the Government charges more than the taxpayer received --MR. SALMONS: But I think, Your --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- in income?MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I think when -- whenwhat you're talking about is how to define --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I mean, this is an appallingsituation.          MR. SALMONS:  Again, Your Honor, I -- I think asa general matter, the -- the proper definition of gross income would include the attorney's fees portion of litigation awards. It's important to note that the when Congress --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  What -- what do you we make ofthe fact that two Senators apparently don't agree with281111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 that position? I mean, I -- I'm referring to the colloquy2 that was quoted in -- in one of the -- the briefs about3 the recent legislation, and the -- the substance of the4 colloquy was we're not making any change in the law, we're5 just clarifying it. Well, in fact, if there is no textual6 difference for tax purposes between the law, so far as it7 concerns these -- these so-called discrimination8 recoveries and non-discrimination recoveries that have the9 same problem that Justice O'Connor is talking about,10 shouldn't we infer that at least the Senate of the United11 States assumes that this does not get into gross?12 MR. SALMONS: No, Your Honor. In fact, what I13 would say is that the thing to focus on is what Congress14 actually enacted and it makes clear that all the15 litigation proceeds --16 JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm -- I'm talking about the17 colloquy. I'm talking about the colloquy.18 MR. SALMONS: I -- I understand that, Your19 Honor, and what I'm trying to answer is that the -- the20 legislation itself makes clear that it's included in gross21 income and an above-the-line deduction is provided, and22 that the colloquy was referring to a prior version of the23 bill that would have been retroactive in part. The new24 bill is not retroactive, and we think it's clear that it25 does work a change because from, among other reasons, it's291111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 undisputed that if these fees had been paid on an hourly2 fee basis, they would have been included in gross income3 and -- and the alternative minimum tax would apply.4 JUSTICE SCALIA: We don't really know who5 prepared that colloquy anyway, do we?6 MR. SALMONS: We do not.7 JUSTICE SCALIA: It might have been prepared by8 the respondents here.9MR. SALMONS:  We do not.(Laughter.)MR. SALMONS:  If I may reserve the remainder of101112 my time. 1314151617 it please 1819 that the assignment of income doctrine does not apply when20 unrelated persons combine their resources to jointly21 generate income.

JONES   ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT BANAITISMR. JONES:  Thank you, Justice Stevens, and maythe Court:My client and I are asking the Court to rule￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425of the executive's pay for the first 6 months? Where -- are all -- all these cases ones in which there -- there's no income to the -- to the principal, we'll call them?MR. JONES: You mentioned the -- the management agent and the -- I think you mentioned the talent agent, and there was also mentioned the literary agent. The -- the author is in the trade or business and gets to deduct all this off the top. There's no problem there.JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's the -- that's the question I asked Mr. Salmons --MR. JONES: Yes. The literary agent --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- and he gave me theopposite answer.          MR. JONES:  Yes.  The literary agent is in atrade or business.  That's off the top.  That's anordinary and necessary business deduction on Schedule C.          JUSTICE BREYER:  And that isn't the question.          MR. JONES:  Yes.          JUSTICE BREYER:  The -- the problem is you're --you're trying to get a theory in response to him that Ithink Justice Kennedy is asking about.          MR. JONES:  Yes.          JUSTICE BREYER:  And that theory, which is theproblem for your side of the case -- that theory has allkinds of implications.  I go out and I help the painter311111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 paint my office. We have a joint venture. I -- so2 there's no problem. I don't take it in -- you know, I get3 a -- this is great. And so that I think, if I'm right,4 was the thrust of Justice Kennedy's question.5 MR. JONES: Our first choice, our preference for6 this Court to rule is -- is not the partnership or joint7 venture theory. Our first choice is for this Court to8 simply look at the application of the assignment of income9 doctrine and ask it -- if it is being misapplied. The --10 the petitioner has not cited to the Court a single,11 solitary case in which unrelated persons combine their12 resources to jointly produce income, and that is the rule13 of law I'm suggesting to the Court today. That is apart14 and separate from the partnership theory, that two15 unrelated persons who join together to produce income --16 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a partnership theory when17 you talk about two persons joining together. I don't like18 this -- this gold mine view of litigation, that it's, you19 know, like two prospectors. You know, there's money to be20 obtained.21222324 view of a 251111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005(Laughter.)MR.

And I'm not about to adopta -- a legal theory that -- that views this as a -- as asearch for buried treasure --JUSTICE SCALIA: -- in -- in which the -- the lawyer and the person who has been wronged are -- are simply co-prospectors. I -- I just think that that's --MR. JONES: Well, the --JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe that's how you view the -- the enterprise --does.          MR.three avenuessuggested andone of those.JONES:  I would like to suggest to the Courtto reach this result that I have justthe partnership/joint venture theory is onlyMR.

JONES:  Okay.  I will move on to that, and Iwill not mention that again.          (Laughter.)          MR. JONES:  This Court created the assignment of331111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425income doctrine. Congress did not create it. This Court has every right and power to limit its -- its definition, to limit its scope to keep it from being misapplied. In every case cited by the petitioner, we have a -- a family situation, related people making gifts to each other with no commercial purpose. Apart from the partnership and joint venture theory, if we simply say that this case is dramatically outside of the scope of that doctrine, of good doctrine that has been applied properly in an inter- family situation, but when you have two unrelated persons joining forces to produce income --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Would you have a differentresult if they were related?  Supposing the lawyer is acousin of the client.MR. JONES: This Court has a long history of recognizing --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Or a good friend.          MR. JONES:  -- of recognizing sham transactions.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, it's not a shamtransaction.  You just happen to be related.          MR. JONES:  All right.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  And I'm just wondering ifthat --          MR. JONES:  I would like to focus on thegratuitous nature of the cases relied upon by the341111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425petitioner and the non-gratuitous aspects of our case.Let's talk about a personal injury case where this problemdoes not arise because there's no tax involved.  Thisrelationship of a contingent fee is entered into thousandsof times every week by people injured in automobileaccidents.  They are not entering into this contingent feeagreement for tax purposes.  They're not trying to avoidtax -- taxes.  The commissioner is confusing intentwith --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  All right.  On -- on thattheory, that there is a non-tax economic purpose, do youstill maintain that your theory should have as an elementunrelated people?MR. JONES: I --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why do we need the question ofthe relationship, which Justice Stevens's questionsraised, even to arise if -- if the principal criterion isgoing to be economic non-tax purpose?MR. JONES: I agree completely. I was trying to emphasize the -- the intrafamily gratuitous nature of those cases, but I agree --in the --JUSTICE SCALIA:  There was no avoidance motiveMR. JONES:  Yes.JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- granddaddy of all cases.351111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 The assignment there, although it was between family2 members, had been made before there was an income tax.3 MR. JONES: But we must --4 JUSTICE SCALIA: The income tax didn't exist.                                                  an avoidance                                                  based uponskip over5 There -- there couldn't conceivably have been6 motive. So -- so our holding could hardly be7 -- upon the existence of an avoidance motive.8 MR. JONES: I'm asking the Court to9 motive and look at result. The Court in thatcase was 10 attacking a result because that arrangement stayed in11 place after the income tax was -- was enacted. The12 Solicitor General is confusing intent with result. In13 every case, in every single case, without exception, this14 doctrine has been applied to the result.15 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but what if you had the16 same result but -- in terms of the sharing of the expense17 and the recovery, but it was computed on an hourly basis18 rather than a percentage basis? Would that produce a19 different result?20 MR. JONES: It would produce a different result.21 The commissioner's case is based on could have's. They say22 they could have tried the case himself. He couldn't. But23 -- but the main thing he --24 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but he could have made --25 I'm saying he could have said to the lawyer, I'll pay you361111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314151617181920212223242530 -- a -- a third of the recovery or I'll pay you $100 anhour.          MR. JONES:  Well, he --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  And they come out exactly thesame result, but you -- but do you treat them differentlyor the same?MR. JONES: We treat them differently simply because he didn't. I practice law in a partnership. I'm taxed accordingly. I could -- I could be -- set up my arrangement different ways and the tax results would be different. We must honor these relationships --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  What is different?          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, may I ask one --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  What is different?          JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask one otherhypothetical?  Supposing that the agreement on thecontingency is postponed until the middle of thepreparation, not made at the outset, but along the line,they say we'll figure out what a fair percentage will be,and when the recovery comes in, they then decide, okay,you take a third.  What -- what result do you do in thatcase?          MR. JONES:  I -- I have difficulty with thatquestion.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But I'm sure it arises fairly371111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 often.2 MR. JONES: My -- I believe that attorneys don't3 allow themselves to be placed in that position. They get4 the contingent fee agreement signed when the -- the --5 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I did very often.6 MR. JONES: But I don't know the answer to your7 question. I -- I don't know that.8 But an -- we -- the Internal Revenue Code9 respects people who enter into corporations, who enter10 into joint ventures, who enter into sole proprietorships,11 who hire employees or allow themselves to be hired by12 others. Those relationships are all respected and honored13 by the Internal Revenue Code, and the commissioner is14 asking you to dishonor this relationship because Mr.15 Banaitis could have handled the case himself or could --16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think probably what's --17 what's one of the problems here is that the reason this is18 income is it relates to employment. And I don't see why19 hiring the attorney to get that income is not an ordinary20 and necessary business expense under what used to be21 section 162. That may be part of the problem. Do you22 agree that it's not an ordinary and necessary business23 expense?24 MR.25 plaintiff has381111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005JONES:  I believe the problem is that a-- I wish I could say this plaintiff is in￼1 -- engaged in a trade or business and can deduct it or2 trade or -- as a trade or business expense.3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, I suppose that's the4 reason -- that's the reason why it's taxable to begin5 with, is it relates to employment. If I hire an attorney6 because I'm wrongfully discharged and I get -- I get my7 job back, it seems to me that's an ordinary and necessary8 business expense. That -- that's why -- one of the9 reasons I have problems with this.10 MR. JONES: I understand. But one of the -- the11 odd result here of a person having to pay more in taxes12 than they recover -- this actually comes up under a fee13 shifting statute that applies to the Internal Revenue14 Service where a person could be in litigation with the15 Internal Revenue Service, the Internal Revenue Service16 becomes obligated to pay fees because they acted17 unreasonably. They pay those fees, and then they18 simultaneously hand the taxpayer a bill for taxes on those19 fees.20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let me get -- get to a21 different point. It -- it does seem to me that we -- we22 have to be very careful in this case not to distort the23 revenue law for other transactions that are not before the24 Court. And the -- the natural extension of your25 position is that anytime when the taxpayer enters into an391111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 agreement with an agent to pay the agents an amount2 contingent on the success of the venture, that it's not3 income, that -- that the -- that the payment is not income4 to the principal. And I just can't accept it.5 MR. JONES: No. That is not my position. My6 position is that the assignment of income doctrine does7 not apply. Those relationships are all governed by8 existing law and there is a large body of law dealing with9 those cases and they can be found in a cite that is10 offered by the petitioner at page 3 of his reply brief.11 It talks about the literary agents. It talks about the --12 the management agents.13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what's the difference in14 principle. I don't understand the difference in principle15 when we're talking about who has the income. It's the16 first thing you ask in -- in a first-year -- in -- in your17 -- in your first class in tax. Where is the income? Who18 gets the income?19 MR. JONES: I -- I am not trying to avoid your20 question, but I'm trying to clarify that I am not asking21 this Court to determine who has the income in those cases22 because there is a large body of law and a large body of23 statutory law that answers the questions for each of those24 examples.

JONES: The Oregon question is part IV of beginning on page 31 which would not be a10 11 12 1314 our brief15 national uniform rule. But what we're asking this Court16 to do is simply, as narrowly as possible, to limit the17 assignment of income doctrine and do nothing more than18 that.19 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what do you make of20 Professor Davenport's proposal to capitalize the21 contingency fee as a transaction?22 MR. JONES: I believe Professor Davenport is23 completely correct. I support his theory wholeheartedly.24 We didn't make that argument because we believe the25 limitation on the assignment of income doctrine is the411111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 real issue and we believe that is the narrower issue.2 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if you took a settlement3 -- his theory, I take it, was seeing the lawsuit as a4 capital asset.

I'm not certain, and11 I'm --12 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sure it's not his theory.13 He -- he thinks it's -- it's attached to transactions, and14 -- and much of his argument is devoted to showing that15 capital transactions are no different from other16 transactions as far as the Internal Revenue Code's desire17 to match the -- the gain with the expenses concerned. And18 that's the part of his theory that I'm not so sure about19 because aside from the -- aside from the condemnation case20 that I mentioned, I -- I don't know of any other cases in21 which the Internal Revenue Service has treated transaction22 costs the way he would have it done.23 sense, but I --24 MR.

This Court decided as early as 1940 in4 the Higgins v. Smith case when the commissioner made the5 exact same argument, and this Court said -- and I quote --6 that does not follow. The statutory language says that to7 the extent this income is -- this -- this money is8 included in income, to the extent it is included in income9 -- it doesn't say whether it is or not -- then a deduction10 will be allowed. And that as neutral a statement as I can11 think of. There is nothing in the statutory language that12 implies one answer or the other.13 But I emphasize to the Court that the -- the14 commissioner is confusing intent with result when he15 discusses the cases upon which he is relying. Those16 reached a result and they corrected that result. We17 have an abuse in this situation. And the assignment18 income doctrine should not be stretched beyond its bounds19 by this Court. It should be limited to its historical20 use. This is a misuse.21 Thank you very much.22 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Jones.23 Mr. Carty.24 251111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. CARTY ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT BANKS43casesdon'tof￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. CARTY:  Thank you, Justice Stevens.          Neither section 61(a) nor any other provision ofthe Internal Revenue Code expressly requires that aFederal civil rights litigant, such as Mr. Banks, includein his gross income the portion of a litigation recoverythat was earned by, retained by, and already taxed to hisattorney as a contingent fee.          The commissioner's position in this case reliesexclusively on the misapplication of a judicial doctrineknown as the assignment of income doctrine.  That doctrineoriginated and developed as a judicial anti-abuse rule,designed to prevent high-bracket taxpayers --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, it didn't.          MR. CARTY:  I respectfully --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  It -- it originated in a casewhere there could not possibly have been an intent -- anintent to abuse because the -- the transfer had occurredbefore there was any income tax.MR. CARTY: Justice --JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, just -- just don't -- maybe you think that that's what it ought to be, but -- but please don't tell us that that is how it originated. It plainly did not originate that way.          MR.disagree.  ItCARTY:  Justice Scalia, I respectfullyis true, as the commissioner and you point441111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 out, that at the time of the agreement between the husband2 and wife, the income tax was not in existence. However,3 the agreement certainly was in existence after the income4 tax was passed. So that could have been a reason why the5 agreement was never rescinded.6 In addition, in another landmark case from 1937,7 Blair, this Court expressly looked to whether there was a8 tax avoidance motive. And this is how this principle is9 taught in first-year tax class. That's the whole purpose10 behind this. As a matter of fact, the commissioner in a11 -- in a different context actually looked to the fact,12 with respect to a particular transaction, whether there13 was a tax avoidance purpose.14 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a different argument.15 I'm -- I'm just quarreling over whether it originated that16 way. If you want to say --17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under -- under your view --18 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that's fine.19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- suppose that the attorney20 is -- is waiting for payment of -- of his, say, one-third21 contingent fee, and the client just absconds with the money.22 How is -- what -- what happens from a tax standpoint under23 your theory? I take it the attorney has to declare the24 income on his return and then declare a loss?25 MR. CARTY: Well, certainly the attorney has a451111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425legal right to those funds.  He has a contractual rightand under most --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm asking you about the taxconsequences.          MR. CARTY:  Well, at -- at that point the incomewouldn't have inured to the benefit of the attorney.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but I -- I thought underyour view the moment the client gets the check for thefull amount, one-third of it is taxable to the attorney.And I have some problems, incidentally, with respect to tax years if it -- if you -- if the client receives the check December 30 and is on vacation and doesn't get around to remitting to the attorney until January 5th, I'm -- I'm not quite sure how your theory works, but --MR. CARTY: Justice Kennedy, I -- I think the --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But on the absconding theory,how -- how is it handled from a tax standpoint?          MR. CARTY:  I believe that for tax purposes theattorney's right to the funds -- that's at the moment hereceives it.  So if he doesn't have the funds in hand, hewouldn't be liable for Federal tax.  It would be at thepoint he either receives the funds --JUSTICE SOUTER: Aren't -- aren't you -- JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is an academic question461111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 because he would have an offsetting theft loss.2 MR. CARTY: I -- I think that is an alternative3 way to -- to view it. There would be a --4 JUSTICE SOUTER: If -- if you view it as the5 theft loss, you -- you maintain your theory. If you6 argue, as you were arguing a second ago, I think what, in7 fact, you're doing is adopting the mere lien theory.8 MR. CARTY: Justice Souter, I -- I --9 JUSTICE SOUTER: I think you better go with10 Justice Ginsburg.111213 out of my 141516 precisely? A, an assignment of income, what would17 otherwise count of A giving an assignment of income to B,18 and therefore still be A's income because the asset19 remains with A, the work, or whatever. Now, your theory20 is but not in the case that. Now fill in the blank for21 me.22232425 funds are471111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005(Laughter.)JUSTICE BREYER:  Like somebody stealing a checkmailbox from my employer.  Right?  Okay.MR. CARTY:  Yes.JUSTICE BREYER:  So what is your theory, I mean,MR. CARTY: Justice --JUSTICE BREYER: Precisely, please.MR. notCARTY:  It would not be in the case that theunder the control of the attorney.￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: Not in the case -- it is an2 assignment of income to B, but not in the case where the3 funds are not in -- when B -- when B get -- when B, the4 attorney, gets the funds, he controls them. What's --5 what do you mean? I don't get it.6 MR. CARTY: I thought your hypothetical --7 JUSTICE BREYER: I want to know. You have three8 -- your problem on your side for me is that maybe all the9 equities are there, but I'd like to know the proposition10 of law that you want us to write in this opinion. And now11 we had three theories, and one, the one that you seem to12 be adopting, is this exception to the assignment of income13 doctrine. If that is what you're adopting, I'd like to14 know the precise form of words that create the exception.15 If that's16 know what1718 assignment of income doctrine simply does not apply when19 the -- the client has no control or power of disposition20 over the income that was subject to the assignment. There21 are at least five reasons why this type of contract --1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005not the theory you're adopting, I would like tothe theory you're adopting is.MR. CARTY:  I would state, Your Honor, that the22 JUSTICE BREYER: But he did have control. He23 could have settled the lawsuit or not settled the lawsuit.24 He controlled when the income was generated, and moreover,25 he could have stopped it from being generated by settling the48￼1 suit or dismissing it. Moreover, if he had not entered2 into this assignment of income, it would have been paid3 right into his bank account at the end. It sounds an4 awful lot like the Lucases or like the Horsts or whoever,5 Old Colony Trust. It sounds an awful lot like those6 cases.7 MR. CARTY: Justice Breyer, I -- I think it's8 helpful to make a conceptual distinction between the9 claim, the underlying litigation claim, and the right to10 receive the funds. Now, certainly Mr. Banks in this case11 had a right to enter into settlement or not. He had a12 right to fire his attorney. But once he assigned the13 contingent fee portion of the recovery, he, as a practical14 matter, had no ability, he had no control over that15 portion of the recovery.16 Another fundamental difference between --17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That -- that would be the same18 with the theater agent or the commission agent.19 MR. CARTY: We submit, Justice Kennedy, that the20 nature of the attorney-client relationship is21 fundamentally different from the types of relationships22 you cited, and that's because an attorney here is the one23 who's earning the income. It's the attorney who is making24 the critical decisions.25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you could say the same491111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425thing for the talent scout.MR. CARTY: I would respectfully disagree. I --I think there's a -- there's a fundamental difference. Presumably a -- a actor or an entertainer -- their -- their market value is -- already has some type of tangible value. The -- the agent might --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Your client, in effect, earned the money by having this -- undergo this -- this discrimination. That -- that's --MR. CARTY: Well, Your Honor --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  This is not the plumberhypothetical, which is I think quite misleading.  No.  No,I don't think that even the Government will defend that.          MR. CARTY:  Again, Your Honor, I think withrespect to an entertainer, an entertainer necessarilydoesn't need an agent.  Neither does an athlete.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Take an investment advisorand the client is not at all -- doesn't know anythingabout the market, and he's got this whiz-bang advisor whomakes millions for him that he never could have made onhis own.          MR. CARTY:  I -- I think that might be moresimilar to the attorney-client relationship.  But Mr.Banks, unlike the athlete or unlike the entertainer, hadno -- no ability to -- to recover these funds himself.  He501111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425essentially had two options. He could have either done nothing and collected nothing --JUSTICE BREYER: Your -- your -- you want to fill in the blank, in other words, and say where the assignment of income is such, such that B was in effect the person who really earned the income, unlike Mrs. Lucas' -- what Mr. Lucas' or maybe Mr. Earl -- I don't know --          MR. CARTY:  That's correct.          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- husband -- the wife didn'tearn the income.          MR. CARTY:  Right.          JUSTICE BREYER:  The husband did.  So you wantto say where the -- and then your answer, I guess -- don'tsay I'm right if I'm not right, please, because I'll justfind out later.(Laughter.)          JUSTICE BREYER:  The -- the answer to thehypothetical about the agent and so forth is, well, so beit.  If a person wants to go to the trouble of carving outsome of his income and assigning that over to the agent,let him.  Except for perhaps provisions of the code whichwe cannot now envisage -- I can't because I'm not anexpert -- it doesn't matter since, after all, it would bedeductible anyway.  Is that -- is that what you're saying?511111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. CARTY: Well, Your Honor --2 JUSTICE BREYER: Tell me if I'm wrong, please,3 on this.4 MR. CARTY: Again, I -- what we're saying is the5 unique situation of an attorney and a client, it is the6 attorney who's taking the laboring, or unlike the7 entertainer example where the -- where -- or the athlete8 example --9 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, I see. You say double.10 Both the income is earned by the attorney, and at that11 stage the client does virtually nothing. So it's the12 reverse of the Earls or the Lucases where the husband was13 doing the work and the wife is getting the income. It14 would be as if the wife was doing all the work and the15 husband just sat there and clipped coupons or whatever.16 MR. CARTY: That's correct, Your Honor, and in17 Lucas v. Earl, it was the assignor who earned the income18 that was subject to disposition. Here --19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm not so sure about that20 because why doesn't the theory that -- that applies to the21 lawyer equally apply to the wife? I mean, she took care22 of everything going on at home, and that enabled him to go23 out there24 services,25and make all that money. So without her just like without the lawyer's services -- MR. CARTY: That is an excellent point, Your521111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Honor.JUSTICE SCALIA: You should agree with that. You should --          (Laughter.)          JUSTICE BREYER:  Those were less enlightenedtimes.          MR. CARTY:  Nevertheless -- nevertheless, I -- Ithink there may be some -- some difference in degree thatyou might even recognize between the two cases.          Another issue I'd like to address is the impactof the fee shifting statutes, if I could get to thatquickly.  It is a bedrock principle of taxation thatsettlements of a claim are taxed the same as a judgmentwould have been taxed.  Mr. Banks' settlement was achievedin lieu of his claims under title VII and 42 U.S.C.,sections 1981 and 1983.          Now, each of these statutes contains a feeshifting provision which enables a court to awardattorney's fees to a prevailing plaintiff.  The defendantin Mr. Banks' case, the California Department of Education-- they therefore settled Mr. Banks' claim in lieu oftheir exposure under these fee shifting statutes.          An award pursuant to these fee shifting statutesis separate and distinct from a damages recovery andtherefore should not be taxable to a plaintiff.  And the531111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Federal tax consequences to Mr. Banks, the litigant whosettles, shouldn't be any different as well.  Otherwise,this Court would be discouraging settlement.  Therefore, ajudicial anti-abuse rule should not be misused toundermine the statutory scheme devised by Congress toencourage civil rights litigants to bring meritoriousclaims and vindicate national policy.          Unless the Court has any further questions?          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The Government says on thatbranch of it, well, the fees -- the lodestar fee, that'sone thing.  A court awards it, but that's quite differentfrom the one-third/one-half even contingent fee.  Thecourt has control over the fee shifting, but we're notdealing with any court award here.          MR. CARTY:  That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.Mr. Banks settled his claims.  Yet, we are pressing thepoint that Mr. Banks shouldn't be treated any differentlyfor tax purposes than a litigant who recovers pursuant toa fee shifting statute.  Otherwise, the Court would bediscouraging settlement.          If there's any other questions.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Mr. Carty.          MR. CARTY:  Thank you.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Salmons, you have a littleover 2 minutes.1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 2000554￼1 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS2 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER3 MR. SALMONS: Thank you, Your Honor.4 It is clear that the only thing that5 respondents' attorneys earned under the fee agreements was6 the right to be paid a fee for their services. In7 petitioner's view, those agreements don't even give rise8 to an assignment of income in the ordinary sense. If you9 look at the text of the fee agreement in the Banaitis case10 -- the Banks' fee agreement is not in the record -- among11 other things, it makes clear that if there is a12 termination -- and it provides lots of grounds on which13 the attorney-client relationship can be terminated -- that14 the attorney will be paid a reasonable fee, calculated at15 the sum of $175 per hour. That doesn't sound like an16 assignment of any income or even an assignment of the17 underlying cause of action. Even if it did, it is clear18 that in every assignment of income case, the assignor19 loses control over that income that he assigned. That20 doesn't stop the application of the proper tax principles,21 however.22 The -- the respondents in these cases suffered a23 legally cognizable injury. They had a claim. That claim24 entitled them to a recovery. They retained services to25 pursued that claim. If they had paid their lawyers on an551111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 hourly basis, those lawyers may have been just as2 necessary to the actual outcome of the case as their3 contingent fee attorneys. Both the -- an hourly fee4 attorney and a contingent fee attorney in both of the5 States at issue here -- and in fact, in all States of6 which I'm aware -- received precisely the same attorney's7 lien. That lien makes clear that the relationship between8 attorney and client starts out as that between a master9 and an agent and then is converted through the fee10 agreement to that between a creditor and a debtor, and the11 lien secures the debt and ensures its payment. When the12 proceeds from the litigation are paid to the attorney, it13 satisfies the respondent's debt and is therefore income to14 the attorney. Under the separate and alternative ground15 of this Court's Old Colony decision, it goes far and16 beyond even the holding with regard to an assignment of17 income.18 To address just a couple of questions that came19 up, I would point out that in the class action context,20 again, as I indicated, there are a number of differences.21 And just to be a little more specific about some of them,22 generally speaking there's no unilateral right to settle a23 -- a case by class members. There's no unilateral right24 to dismiss the case, and there's no right to a determined25 fee.561111 14th Street NW, Suite 400Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112131415161718192021222324          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Mr. Salmons.          MR.
