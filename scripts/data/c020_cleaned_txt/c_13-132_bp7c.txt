California.      Mr. Fisher?     ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHERON BEHALF OF PETITIONERMR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      This case involves applying the coreprotection of the Fourth Amendment to a new factualcircumstance.  It has always been the case that anoccasion of an arrest did not give the police officersauthority to search through the private papers and thedrawers and bureaus and cabinets of somebody's house,and that protection should not evaporate more than 200years after the founding because we have thetechnological development of smartphones that haveresulted in people carrying that information in theirpockets.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just ­­ just to test the principle for why the police can search and seizesome ­­ some objects. Consider a gun. The arrestee has a gun on his person and the police take the gun. Is part of the reason for that seizure to obtain evidence3￼16 building the case, of ­­17 MR. FISHER:18 every day. Once the gun19 department's lawful possession, I think Edwards says20 that they can do all that.￼1 of the crime or is it just for the safety of the officer2 and the safety of the community?3 MR. FISHER: Well, what this Court said in4 Robinson at Page 235 is the reason supporting the5 authority for a search incident to arrest are the two6 Chimel factors, which are gathering evidence to prevent7 its destruction, and officer's safety. Now ­­8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about gathering9 evidence in order to make the case? For instance, with10 the gun, could they take fingerprints? The ­­ the gun11 is in the police station where the arrestee is being12 booked. A, could they take fingerprints? B, could they13 copy the serial number? C, could they see how many14 shells were left in the chamber? They obviously have to15 empty it for safety purposes. All for the purpose ofof obtaining evidence?Yes, of course that's doneis in the police ­­ the police21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So ­­ so if ­­ if the22 proposition then, if the principle then is that some23 objects that are obtained from the arrestee can be24 examined in order to build the State's case, is that at25 least a beginning premise that we can accept in your417 might 181920 where 21say, well, that's limited to automobiles ­­MR. FISHER:JUSTICE KENNEDY:Right.     ­­ and then we're backwe started.MR. FISHER:￼1 case, although, obviously, there are problems of the2 extent and intrusiveness3 in your case, but not in4 MR. FISHER:5 Court has never described that as one of the things. If6 you want to think about this case the way you thoughtof the search that are ­­ arethe gun hypothetical.Well, Justice Kennedy, the7 about the automobile search in Gant, it would be a8 beginning premise; but I think you're right, that even9 if that were a beginning premise, it would be only that,10 a beginning. In Footnote 9 in Edwards, this Court said11 that any search incident to arrest still has to satisfy12 the Fourth Amendment's general ­­ general13 reasonableness.14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think you're right that15 Gant is probably the best statement in support of the16 principle that I've ­­ I've suggested, and then youRight. And there's important 22 things to understand if you want to start thinking about23 Gant, because both in terms of its history and its24 modern application, it's dramatically different from25 what we have here.5￼1 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, Mr. Fisher, before we2 do that, have you been accurate in what you said about3 Robinson and about the Court's cases? In Weeks, which4 was quoted in Robinson, the Court said: "The right,5 always recognized under English and American law, to6 search the person of the accused when legally arrested7 to discover and seize the fruits or evidences of crime."8 Is that historically inaccurate? Do you want us to9 repudiate that?10 MR. FISHER: No, Your Honor. What Weeks11 said, you quoted it, fruits and instrumentalities of the12 crime have always been something that could be seized13 from a person. Now, Weeks, of course, as this Court14 said in Robinson itself, was dicta. And there was that15 historical authority to take fruits and evidence ­­ I'm16 sorry ­­ fruits and instrumentalities of the crime.17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did it say18 instrumentalities or evidence? Which did it say?19 MR. FISHER: Weeks used ­­20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Because Justice Alito said21 evidence. You ­­ you changed it to instrumentality. Is22 one of you wrong?23 MR. FISHER: Weeks uses the word "evidence,"24 but, Justice Scalia, because it was not at issue in that25 case, the ­­ the Bishop treatise that you cited in your619 to him in the billfold. He had that at the time20 arrest. Do you dispute the proposition that the21 could examine the photos in his billfold and use22 as evidence against him?ofpolicethose￼1 Thornton concurrence talks about tools and2 instrumentalities.3 Now, I don't think we have to debate that4 here, because even if we're in a world where the police5 can seize some evidence and keep it and use it for the6 prosecution simply for that reason, even if they don't7 fear destruction, there are still very, very profound8 problems with searching a smartphone without a warrant,9 because even under the Robinson rule, this Court has10 recognized, for example, when it comes to blood draws,11 search ­­ something like a strip search that might occur12 at the scene, there are limits even to the Robinson13 rule. So it brings us ­­14 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, smartphones ­­15 smartphones do present difficult problems. But let me16 ask you this: Suppose your client were an old­school17 guy and he didn't have ­­ he didn't have a cell phone.18 He had a billfold and he had photos that were important23 MR. FISHER: No. That's the rule of24 Robinson, that any physical item on an arrestee can be25 seized and inspected and then used as evidence if it's7￼1 useful evidence. We draw a2 JUSTICE ALITO:3 between looking at hardcopy4 looking at photos that are saved in the memory of a cell5 phone?6 MR. FISHER: The difference is digital7 information versus physical items. Physical items at8 the scene can pose a safety threat and have destruction9 possibilities that aren't present with digital evidence.10 What is more, once you get into the digital world, you11 have the framers' concern of general warrants and the ­­12 the writs of assistance.13 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, how does that apply ­­14 how does that apply to these hardcopy photos in the15 billfold? They don't present a threat to anybody. And16 I don't see that there's much of a difference between ­­17 the government argues there's a greater risk of the18 destruction of digital evidence in a cell phone than ­­19 than there is in the photos. So I don't quite20 understand how ­­ how that applies to that situation.21 MR. FISHER: Well, let me take those one22 thing at a time. I take it the theory of Robinson, this23 is the theory the government itself propounded, is that24 any physical item, because it contained a razor blade or25 a pin or anything, needs to be inspected to be sure.8line.  ­­Yes.  What is the differencephotos in a billfold and￼1 And so you have a categorical rule because of the ad hoc2 nature of arrests that police don't have to distinguish3 physical items one from the other.4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but the ­­ but in5 the wallet ­­ we'll just stick with Justice Alito's6 hypothetical ­­ they find a business card or something7 which shows a car rental service. Can they turn the8 card over and read it? They're not looking for a pin or9 an explosive. They're trying to read what's on the10 card. Can they do that?11 MR. FISHER: I think they can, if nothing12 else, under plain view once it's in their hand, Justice13 Kennedy. But I really don't want to fight ­­14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, they turn ­­ they turn15 the card over.16 MR. FISHER: I think that is fine under the17 categorical rule. I think what you have in Robinson is18 a categorical rule that obviates these exact difficult19 case­by­case determinations. You can make an argument,20 and if I needed to, if it were a diary case or a21 billfold case, you might be able to make an argument,22 but I think the Court wisely decided under Robinson that23 we need a categorical rule that's easily administrable24 in the field.25 Now, when you have digital evidence, the916 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I guess17 question would be: Could you have a rule that18 police are entitled to search those apps that,19 don't have an air of privacy about them?mythein fact,￼1 categorical rule, we submit, cuts exactly in the2 opposite direction. Because digital information ­­ even3 the notion of flipping through photos in a smartphone4 implicates vast amounts of information, not just the5 photos themselves, but the GPS locational data that's6 linked in with it, all kinds of other information that7 is intrinsically intertwined in smartphones.8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Including9 information that is specifically designed to be made10 public. I mean, what about something like Facebook or a11 Twitter account? There's no real ­­ there's no ­­ any12 privacy interest in a Facebook account is at least13 diminished because the point is you want these things to14 be public and seen widely.15 MR. FISHER: Well, Mr. Chief Justice ­­20 MR. FISHER: I think that would be21 extraordinarily difficult to administer that rule. And22 let me tell you why. Because most of the information on23 smartphones is private. Much of it is just, like the24 photos in this case, just kept on somebody's phone and25 not shared with anybody. Even a Facebook account is a10￼1 limited universe of people who have access to it.2 You're right that ­­3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: More ­­ more or less4 limited. I mean, you know, maybe it's 20 people; maybe5 it's a hundred people. But it's certainly not private6 in the sense that many of the other applications are.7 MR. FISHER: I think it's fair to say you8 have a sliding scale and there's some stuff on a phone9 that might be posted on the Internet, for example. The10 difficulty with that case, if you wanted to address it11 in a future case, would be the intertwined nature of12 information on a phone. So looking at those photos in a13 smartphone account will be linked to the contacts inside14 the phone; it will be linked to GPS information inside15 the phone. All of this information is intertwined and I16 think you'd have a difficult administrability problem if17 you wanted to create some sort of rule like that.18 Now, remember, the government might try to19 deal with that problem differently by saying information20 in the cloud, so to speak, is not accessible to21 officers. We submit that just further would compound22 the difficulty of applying a rule in this circumstance.23 JUSTICE ALITO: But do you think in this24 case we have to decide whether all the information that25 may be available in a smartphone can be examined by the11￼1 police when the owner of the phone is arrested or can we2 just focus on the particular evidence that was admitted3 in your client's trial?4 MR. FISHER: Well, the way you've phrased5 the question, I think that's what ­­ that's the first6 cut at this, is looking at the particular pieces of7 evidence here, which are photos and videos. But we8 don't think you can write an opinion that would9 distinguish those from anything else on a ­­ almost10 anything else on a smartphone. I mean, the State's11 argument here is that those are not, quote,12 "fundamentally different" from other things that people13 would carry around.14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think you could15 have obtained a warrant ­­ or that the police could have16 obtained a warrant in this case?17 MR. FISHER:18 Kennedy.19 JUSTICE KENNEDY:20 MR. FISHER:21 so.22 JUSTICE KENNEDY:23 that's seizable under the warrant is ­­ is reasonable,24 and Justice Alito points out the fact that some of this25 evidence is ­­ is reasonable. If there's a ­­ there's a12In all likelihood, yes, Justice     All right.And they had plenty of time to doWell, then the evidence￼1 limitation with reference to the way the police behaved,2 as Justice Alito points out, it's limited just to this3 evidence.4 MR. FISHER: Well, let me say a couple5 important things about the warrant requirement and then6 return to Justice Alito's question. This Court has said7 time and again that the mere fact the police could have8 gotten a warrant but didn't does not excuse a Fourth9 Amendment violation. Let me say a couple things about10 the warrant requirement and then return to Justice11 Alito.12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but it ­­ it just13 goes to the fact that this ­­ that this is searchable14 under Fourth Amendment standards.15 MR. FISHER: With a warrant, Justice16 Kennedy. And let me talk about why a warrant is so17 important. First of all, it interposes a neutral18 observer in between the citizen and the police officer.19 Perhaps more importantly, it does two very big things.20 One is it can trigger the Fourth Amendment's21 particularity requirement so that the magistrate can22 say: This is what you can look at and what didn't.23 Remember, in this case the prosecution ultimately24 introduced photos and videos, but that's not what the25 detective testified to at trial as to the scope of his13￼1 search. He said, at JA­11, we looked at a whole lot of2 stuff on the phone and that's just what, in his words,3 "caught his eye."4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So how ­­ how would it5 work with a magistrate? You recognize ­­ you just told6 Justice Kennedy ­­ that a warrant could be obtained. A7 warrant for what? What would the police have to show?8 And let's take your very case. So they ­­ they have9 seized, which is proper, seized the phone, they've10 secured it, and now they want to search it. So they11 apply for a warrant. And what would the warrant have to12 say?13 MR. FISHER: We give an example of a warrant14 in the footnote in our reply brief. I believe it's15 footnote 3, Justice Ginsburg. And there are many more16 available on the web from States that already require17 warrants. What they do is they say ­­ the police18 officer testifies, perhaps somewhat like he testified19 here at the suppression hearing, I suspected this fellow20 was in a gang and ­­ and I believe gang members keep21 certain kinds of things on their phone, this is the kind22 of crime that we're investigating, and therefore these23 particular files within the phone are likely to obtain24 evidence. And then what happens is the warrants say25 with particularity: Here's the things you can look at;141 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425here's what you can't.  More importantly, JusticeGinsburg, a warrant requirement ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I thought you say that's very ­­ you've told us that that's ­­ that's hard to figure out, what you can and what you can't. But it's easy for a magistrate, but ­­ but impossible fora ­­ for an arresting officer?MR. FISHER: I think much easier for a magistrate at some remove than an officer under the ­­ under the stresses in the field. Now, Justice Scalia ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but ­­MR. FISCHER: ­­ I agree, it's not going to be perfect. And so let's look at what happens under our world ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If I could just ­­ MR. FISHER: Yes.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: ­­ on the same linesas ­­ as Justice Scalia.  The point you make elsewherein your brief and argument is that the cell phone orthe ­­ the smartphone has everything.MR. FISHER: Right.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's got the person's whole life. Well, if you're arresting somebody on the grounds of suspicion that he's a gang member and you have evidence to support that, what part of the15￼￼1 smartphone is not likely to have pertinent evidence?2 What application is not? I mean, here you've got3 pictures, you've got videos, you've got calls. I just4 ­­ I guess it's similar to what other issues have been5 raised. I don't know what a magistrate is supposed to6 put in the warrant.7 MR. FISHER: I would say his banking app,8 his online dating app ­­9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't think his10 banking app ­­ his banking app is going to say on this11 day he deposited $10,00012 that's going to coincide13 MR. FISHER:14 arguments can be made on15 happens is ­­ this is the benefit of our rule as opposed16 to the government's. What the government says is letinto his account, and thenwith a particular drug deal.Well, Mr. Chief Justice, thosean app­by­app basis.  But what17 the officer look and then have a back­end hearing where18 you just suppress all the stuff that he wasn't supposed19 to look at once you apply particularity requirements.20 Under our rule, once the officer has the21 warrant, Leon kicks in and so you don't have to have all22 these hearings in district courts, because once an23 officer does a proper search according to the corners of24 a warrant, you don't have to have the kind of25 suppression hearing.168 the information and looking at it for the crimeof￼1 And there's one other very important thing2 that goes into a warrant which might have been glossed3 over too quickly in the briefs. It's not just what can4 be looked at; it's how it can be kept. The retention of5 information raises extraordinary Fourth Amendment6 concerns. My understanding in California is, at least7 for some crimes, it's not just that they're downloading9 arrest, but they're keeping this information in10 databases, ever­growing databases of every cell11 that they've ever seized.12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if you13 device that doesn't have the broad information that a14 smartphone has, but only a very limited, like a Fitbit15 that tells you how many steps you've taken, and the16 defendant says, I've been in my house all afternoon, and17 they want to check and see if he's walked 4 miles. It's18 not his whole life, which is a big part of your19 objection. Is that something they can look at?20 MR. FISHER: I think probably not. And I21 think this is the way the categorical rule in Robinson,22 where it sweeps in the kind of hypotheticals we were23 talking about in one direction. I think a categorical24 rule in the other direction for digital information25 would sweep in the Fitbit. I mean, obviously, I don't17phonehave a￼1 have to win that argument today, but I think that's how2 you would approach that question.3 Remember, the Fitbit ­­ and this is true4 even more so of smartphones ­­ tells you just the kind5 of information the Court was very concerned about in6 Kyllo. It tells you ­­ modern smartphones work the7 inside of people's house. They work the appliances8 and ­­ and they have cameras. They also monitor the9 inside of people's bodies.10 JUSTICE ALITO: What if the phone in this11 case was an old­fashioned flip­phone? So it had the12 capacity to take pictures, but a much more limited13 memory. Would it ­­ would it be a different case?14 MR. FISHER: Well, I think you may want to15 ­­ that will be part of your conversation in the next16 case perhaps. I think the easiest way to decide the17 case right now in 2014 is simply say: Digital evidence18 kept on modern cell phones are different than physical19 items. I don't think it's really worth going back in20 time to the most rudimentary device and having that21 argument.22 JUSTICE ALITO: What if the person had on23 his person a compact disk with photos saved on that?24 MR. FISHER: I think that might be the same25 kind of case as you have now. Remember, the ­­ the18￼1 phone in this case had a removable memory card, as many2 still do, which by the way we were going to talk about3 the destruction of evidence. That's one answer to the4 destruction of evidence problem. It couldn't possibly5 have arisen with respect to the evidence at issue6 because it was on a removable memory card that couldn't7 be erased remotely or password protected.8 Now, we've given lots of arguments in the9 brief that explain why the government's arguments as to10 wiping simply don't stand up. And ­­11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Fisher, would you ­­12 an earlier question, you didn't finish the answer. You13 were describing a difference between the downloading by14 police into databases that they keep forever. What15 happens with materials that are returned pursuant to a16 search warrant? Are they precluded from doing that?17 MR. FISHER:18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:19 understood your ­­20 MR. FISHER:21 ordinary rule is if the police lawfully seize evidence22 in the physical world, if it's a ­­ if it's a physical23 item, it might at some point have to be returned to the24 owner of it. But if it's something that can be made a25 photocopy of or a photo, it remains in police files as19No.I wasn't sure IRight.  So I take it that theMR. FISHER: I'm sorry. Maybe I understand it.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which ­­ can same thing once a search warrant is ­­didn'tthey do the￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425lawfully obtained information they can use indefinitelyinto the future.      You have real problems, however, when youapply that typical rule to digital information, becausenow ­­ again, what I understand ­­ and the governmentitself ­­ the Federal Government in Footnote 3 of itsreply brief in Wurie acknowledges that it's keeping inan ever­growing Federal database at least some of theinformation seized from smartphones.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. I don't know that you've answered my question.MR. FISHER: Oh. No. Well, not necessarily, because the beauty of a search warrant is it can delineate retention rules. It can say here's ­­ here's how long you're allowed to keep the information, here's who's allowed to look at it and who's not. And it can ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Frankly, I have to tell you, I don't ever remember a prosecutor coming to me with that kind of delineation.MR. FISHER: Well, I think that, Justice20￼1 Sotomayor, that is what is starting to now happen in the2 digital world, because we just have new and different3 concerns that had arisen ­­4 JUSTICE KAGAN:5 exigencies that would allow6 phones? And if so, what would those exigencies be?7 MR. FISHER: Absolutely. There ­­ there8 would be times at the scene where exigencies would allow9 it. First of all, the two officer safety arguments the10 other side makes about a hypothetical bomb or a11 confederate ambush, as this Court already recognized in12 Chadwick, would give exigent circumstances. The concern13 about remote wiping we think, and as the experts have14 described in the amicus brief filed by EPIC and many15 others, we don't think16 a situation where that17 a very odd world, yes.18 JUSTICE SCALIA:19 first exigent circumstances.20 you can't ­­ you don't know whether there's a bomb until21 you look in the phone. Whether ­­ whether his22 associates are on the way to, you know, to kill the23 officer and ­­ and release their confederate, you don't24 know until you look into the phone.

FISHER: Well, I think surrounding facts and circumstances ­­ in Footnote 9 in Chadwick, what the Court said, dealing with a locked briefcase where you'd have the same problem, Justice Scalia, surrounding facts and circumstances might indicate.      There's a hypothetical, I believe it's onpage 1 of the amicus brief filed by the Stateinvestigative agencies, that I think gives a classictextbook example of how exigent circumstances mightapply.JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me it would almost never ­­ you would never be able to say, you know, surrounding circumstances give me reason to suspect that there's a bomb in the phone.MR.

FISHER: There are cases on that,Mr. Chief Justice.  Obviously, this Court hasn'taddressed them.  All the cases we've found are caseswhere the police already had a warrant in hand andthey've been held that, yes, the police officers cananswer the phone in that circumstance.  Unquestionably,the police officers could look at the screen.JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. A warrant for what? A warrant for examining the phone?MR. FISHER: For somebody's arrest.JUSTICE SCALIA: For somebody's arrest. Well, how does that extend to your ability to answer his phone?24￼1 MR. FISHER: No, I'm sorry, Mr. Justice2 Scalia. I think also in ­­ to ­­ to effectuate an3 arrest and ­­ and an immediate search of the area.4 Now, certainly you could look at the caller5 ID coming through because that would be in plain view.6 But if I can return to Justice Kennedy's question about7 the diary. Because there's a couple of important8 aspects to that I hope to be able to draw out.9 The reason I think that you don't find diary10 cases when you look for them is because people hardly11 ever carry a diary outside the home with them. It was12 kept in a private drawer in the bedroom or wherever it13 might be kept, and in the highly, highly unusual14 circumstance where somebody did, you might have a hard15 case.16 This is an ­­ this is the opposite world.17 The modern reality of smartphones is that it is an18 indispensable item for everyday life of a modern19 professional and, indeed, most anyone. You can't leave20 the house without it and be ­­ consider yourself to be21 responsible and safe. And so you take ­­ to take a22 world where the police might try to say, we can get the23 stray diary because of the importance of the categorical24 rule under Robinson and try to apply that into a world25 where everybody has everything with them at all times ­­25￼1 JUSTICE KENNEDY:2 criminals who are more dangerous, more sophisticated,3 more ­­ more elusive with cell phones. That's the ­­4 that's the other side of this.5 MR. FISHER: Well, Justice Kennedy, the6 Fourth Amendment has ­­ has a balance already built in7 in that respect. We're not saying they can't look at8 digital information. We're just saying that when they9 seize it, they can freeze the contents and then go get a10 warrant and search what they're allowed to search and11 keep it under the rules of that warrant.12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it significant13 in ­­ in this case that the information was not14 protected by a password?15 MR. FISHER: No, I don't think either16 side ­­17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That doesn't ­­ that18 doesn't affect the expectation of privacy?19 MR. FISHER: If the other side were making20 an argument that this wasn't even a search, then I think21 that might be an argument they would deploy. But I22 think, and I don't want to speak for the government, but23 I think that they also agree that password protection24 doesn't matter. And it certainly doesn't matter under25 their argument as to what information they get. I mean,26Well, including the￼1 their position is if we seize a corporate executive's2 smartphone at the scene that is locked and protected3 under password, if we can get that information out back4 at our lab, we get it all and we don't have to ask for a5 warrant and we can keep it as long as we want.6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. I know they7 argue that it doesn't matter, but I'm just wondering if8 your position is weakened by the fact that the9 individual did not seek the greater protection of a10 password.11 MR. FISHER: No, I don't think so. People12 don't lock their homes, they don't lock their13 briefcases. Simply having it inside the smartphone14 protected on the person is enough to trigger the Fourth15 Amendment, and I think to sustain the arguments I've16 advanced.17 If I could reserve the rest of my time.18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.19 Mr. Dumont.20 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD C. DUMONT21 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT22 MR. DUMONT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,23 and may it please the Court:24 As Mr. Fisher has said, if Mr. Riley had25 been carrying physical photographs in his pocket at the27￼1 time of his arrest, there's no dispute that arresting2 officers could have looked at those photographs to see3 whether they contained evidence of crime. Now, what4 would have been reasonable in that situation does not5 become constitutionally unreasonable simply because6 Mr. Riley instead carried his photographs in digital7 form on a smartphone. The shifted digital format does8 not make the photographs any less his papers or9 effects ­­10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, in one of our11 Court decisions in the past, a series of justices12 asked ­­ or noted that many of our rules were based on13 practical considerations. Practically speaking, a14 person can only carry so much on their person. That is15 different because carrying a billfold of photographs is16 a billfold of photographs. It's, you know, anywhere17 from one to five generally and not much more. But now18 we're talking about potentially thousands, because with19 digital cameras people take endless photos and it spans20 their entire life.21 You don't see a difference between the two22 things? What ­­ what has now become impractical. A GPS23 can follow people in a way that prior following by24 police officers in cars didn't permit.25 MR. DUMONT: We certainly see a distinction,28￼1 and we certainly see the possibility that in some cases2 there could potentially be a constitutional difference.3 What we don't see is that in this case ­­ on the facts4 of this case or anything like it, like the ordinary5 case, there is a constitutional difference from those6 phenomenon. The theory ­­7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: By the way ­­8 MR. DUMONT: The theory, even if I'm9 carrying only five photographs or if I'm carrying two10 letters as was the case in the Chiagles case, for11 instance, that Judge Cardozo decided in the '20s, they12 are likely to be very personal, very private13 photographs. So I'm not sure that the expansion of14 volume increases the invasion of privacy.15 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Dumont, on your argument16 and on the government's ­­ the Solicitor General's17 principal argument, too, a person can be arrested for18 anything. A person can be arrested for driving without19 a seat belt. And the police could take that phone and20 could look at every single e­mail that person has21 written, including work e­mails, including e­mails to22 family members, very intimate communications, could look23 at all that person's bank records, could look at all24 that person's medical data, could look at that person's25 calendar, could look at that person's GPS and find out29￼1 every place that person had been recently because that2 person was arrested for driving without a seat belt.3 Now, that strikes me as a very different4 kind of world than the kind of world that you were5 describing where somebody has pictures of their family6 in a billfold. Doesn't it strike you that way?7 MR. DUMONT: I think the answer there ­­ one can8 always think of marginal cases where there might be9 concern. It is not the core case, it is not the10 typical ­­11 JUSTICE KAGAN:12 marginal case.13 MR. DUMONT:14 JUSTICE KAGAN:15 Solicitor General's principal argument applies to16 arrest. And it applies to everything on a cell phone.17 People carry their entire lives on cell phones. That's18 not a marginal case. That's the world we live in, isn't19 it?20 MR. DUMONT: We hear that repeatedly. The21 facts of this case are not somebody's entire life on a22 cell phone. This cell phone had a handful of contacts.23 I don't think this is in the record, but what we understand24 is there were 250­some odd contacts, there were about 5925 photos and there were perhaps 42 videos that ranged from30I don't know why thisis aanyIt is not the ­­   Your argument and the￼1 30 to 45 seconds. Maybe a minute each.2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Court is to make a3 rule not for this particular case, but for this category4 of cases. And I think what Justice Kagan pointed out is5 very nervous concern. That is, take an offense like6 failing to buckle up, even driving under the influence,7 not gang crimes, which is what we have in this case.8 It's your rule, then, that the cell phone is fair game9 no matter what the crime, no matter how relatively10 unimportant the crime. Is it all misdemeanors, all11 misdemeanors and that opens the world to the police.12 MR. DUMONT: It is true that the Court13 typically and properly, in this area, draws categorical14 lines and that is what the Court said in Robinson it was15 doing. Now, it also is true the Court has repeatedly16 said that those lines are drawn based on the generality17 of cases. They are not drawn based on the marginal case18 where the hypothetical potential problematic ­­ and this19 case is in the heartland. It's a violent crime.20 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Dumont, I guess21 what I'm trying to suggest to you is that you call it22 marginal, but, in fact, most people now do carry their23 lives on cell phones, and that will only grow every24 single year as, you know, young people take over the25 world.3116 if that's so, then we'll17 MR. DUMONT:18 are trying to draw lines19 officer in the field and20 get a warrant either because there's a need to know the21 information now or because ­­￼1 (Laughter.)2 JUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, that's not a3 marginal case.

And ­­ and everybody under a certain6 age, let's say under 40, has everything on them.7 MR. DUMONT: I think you need to look at the8 generality of cases. And in the generality of cases,9 first of all, you will not be dealing with minor crimes.10 You'll be dealing with serious crimes. And second,11 you'll be dealing with police who are trying to do their job12 by looking ­­13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you saying we're just14 resting on the discretion of the officer? Because if15 that's so, then that leads to the next question. Well,get a warrant.I'm saying that you're ­­ youthat can be applied by theoften when there's not time to22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let's leave ­­ let's23 leave exigent circumstances out of it. That ­­ that's24 an easy case. You're not arguing for exigent25 circumstances here.32￼1 MR. DUMONT:2 back to Justice Scalia's3 the same things that Mr.4 interests that Mr. Fisher, I think, concedes justify the5 search of the person and the seizure of the phone, which6 are the exigent circumstances type arguments. In other7 words, they are the need to protect officer safety and8 the need to preserve evidence. And the fact is you9 don't know with a phone. The officer doesn't know with10 a phone whether there's a safety concern or whether11 there's an evidentiary concern without looking at the12 phone.13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Have there ever14 been ­­ is there any basis for the generality that15 there's a safety concern? Do you have a case where the16 ­­ certainly not where the phone exploded, but when the17 phone was used to trigger a device or anything like18 that?19 MR. DUMONT: We don't have a specific case.20 What I can point you to ­­21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have a22 general case?23 MR. DUMONT: What I can point you to,24 here's a case from California. I don't think it's cited25 in the briefs. It's called Natoli. There's one where33What I'd say is that ­­ to gopoint ­­ our argument is thatFisher concedes, the same￼1 there's a late night arrest. It ­­ it starts with a2 speeding ticket, and it ­­ off the highway late at3 night. It develops that, you know, maybe there's more4 going on and the person looks to be under the influence.5 Taken out of the car. Then it looks like there might be6 a gun. The officer looks at the cell phone. The first7 thing he sees when he turns the phone on is a picture of8 what appears to be the driver standing with two assault9 rifles, arms akimbo like this, posing with his assault10 rifles. Now, I would say that that changes the11 situational awareness of the officer in that situation12 and provides valuable information that was necessary at13 the time and could not have been gotten later at the14 station house with a warrant.15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What does that have16 to do with my question about a bomb?17 MR. DUMONT: I'm merely saying that it has18 to do with safety. So no, I can't point you to a case19 where they stopped Timothy McVeigh, looked at his phone20 and saw some notes about bomb making. I can't give you21 that case.22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I would assume you need23 to operate the phone to set off the bomb, so that once24 the police have the phone the bomb is not going to be25 set off.3425 JUSTICE GINSBURG:Well, how would you?￼1 MR. DUMONT: That is true. But it's also true2 of all the objects in all the Court's prior cases. In3 other words, once in Robinson the police had secured the4 cigarette pack, there was no question, whether there was5 a razor blade in it or just heroin ­­6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I just ask you ­­7 MR. DUMONT: ­­ that neither the evidence ­­8 the evidence was not going to be destroyed and the9 weapon was not going to be used.10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I ask you a11 question about the extent of your theory? We're talking12 about smartphones, which are minicomputers. But your13 theory would apply to iPads, computers, anything that's,14 for example, sitting next to a person in a car, at their15 desk if they are arrested at their desk, anywhere if16 they are carrying it in their hand because you see a lot17 of people carrying the iPad or something comparable, a18 tablet of some sort. Your theory would permit a search19 of all of those things.20 MR. DUMONT: Our theory extends to objects21 that are on the person or immediately associated with,22 for instance in a purse. It doesn't necessarily extend23 to things that are sitting nearby. The Court has drawn24 a clear line there. It's a line, like any other line­­35￼1 What is the rule? You're saying on the person. Suppose2 it's in the car in a holder or suppose it's in the3 passenger's seat? Are you saying that's ­­ you don't4 want to express an opinion about that? You only want to5 talk about what's in somebody's pocket?6 MR. DUMONT: I'll say I think the Court has7 drawn different rules for that situation. If it's on8 the car seat and if the person's been removed from the9 car, then under Gant if there's reason to think there10 might be evidence of the crime of arrest on the phone11 they can search it and if there's not they can't.12 That's the rule the Court drew, but it's a different13 rule Under Robinson.14 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose I'm carrying15 my laptop in my backpack.16 MR. DUMONT: And if your backpack is on your17 back when you're arrested, yes, we think that's ­­ we18 think that's included.19 So let me go back to this volume question,20 because there are two things about a cell phone that21 might justify some sort of a special rule. There's the22 volume question and then there's the connectivity and23 networking question.24 Now, as to the volume question, first of all25 we don't really have it here, but I concede that we3622 MR. DUMONT: Our23 is that the core information24 contacts, photographs ­­25 JUSTICE BREYER:possibility ­­ our positionlike this ­­ that isNo, no, I mean of my three￼1 could have it in other cases. And what they seem to be2 really concerned about is the idea that if you have3 enough information of enough different kinds on this4 device and the police spend enough time looking at it,5 they could build the kind of near­remarkable portrait6 that some of the Justices alluded to in Gant, or, sorry,7 in Jones, that ­­ that really would be qualitatively8 different from what has ever been done before.9 Now, there are differences from Jones. That10 was government surveillance and this is some choice the11 person has made to keep a certain amount of information12 on a phone and then to have it in his pocket. We think13 there's a possibility you could get to that kind of14 qualitatively different search, but it is miles away15 from this kind of case and from the heartland case.16 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, so what’s your rule? So there are three17 possibilities: Possibility one, smartphone, no, get a18 warrant, unless exigent circumstances. Possibility two,19 yes, it's just like a piece of paper that you find in20 his pocket. Or possibility three, sometimes yes,21 sometimes no. All right, which of those three is yours?37JUSTICE KAGAN:Mr. Dumont ­­￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425choices.

I don't12 think that exists in our jurisprudence. Correct me if13 I'm wrong.14 MR. DUMONT: I think that's correct. The15 Court has previously declined to draw that line. Now,16 another ­­17 JUSTICE BREYER: By the way, GPS18 information, I don't want to admit it, but my wife might19 put a little note in my pocket". Steven, remember, turn20 right at the third stoplight, proceed three blocks21 forward. Of course you could have looked at information22 that showed where you had been and where you were going23 as long as it was on paper. Now it's in a GPS. So how24 does your rule help?25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The GPS would see if417 JUSTICE ALITO:8 and it's ­­ the answers are9 you could amend your answerYou could amend your answerfor you, not for us.

We think that it ­­10 that somebody could have had. The person could have had11 a diary that records every place the person has ever12 gone in the last year, it's theoretically possible. But13 you could say something that has a realistic analogue in14 the predigital era. We have a similar ­­ a problem here15 that's similar to the problem in the Jones GPS case.16 You have a rule of law that was established in the17 predigital era and now you have to apply it in the18 digital era or you're asked to apply it in the digital19 era where the technology changes a lot of things. But20 if there is a close analogue in the digital era to21 something that would have been allowed in the predigital22 era, that may be a different story.23 MR. DUMONT: We certainly think that's right24 and we think that that covers, you know, the information25 that was at issue here, the photographs, the short42￼1 videos. It certainly covers address information,2 contact information, messages, text messages.3 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you're not willing to4 limit ­­ you're not willing to limit your position to5 searches that either are in order to protect the officer6 or in order to preserve evidence or, number three, in7 order to find evidence of the crime of arrest. You're8 not willing to limit it that way? You would say9 whatever is on the person, you can ­­ you can search.10 MR. DUMONT: We think of the available11 limits that is by far the best historically based and12 the most plausible one. So to say that ­­ and because13 the cases, the old cases, you pointed out that ­­14 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that gets you into the15 arrest for, you know, for not wearing a seat belt, and16 it seems absurd that you should be able to search that17 person's iPhone. And you can avoid that if you ­­ if18 you say, look, in the vast majority of cases, this is19 not going to be a problem, unless the officer can20 reasonably be looking for evidence of the crime of21 arrest. That will cover the bad cases, but it won't22 cover the ­­ you know, the seat belt arrest.23 MR. DUMONT: We think that that could be a24 perfectly reasonable ruling, and there's precedent in43￼1 the Court, obviously, for that rule. There's two things2 we would say about that. First, it ought to be an3 objective standard in line with all of this Court's4 Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. It shouldn't depend on5 what exactly was written down on the ­­ on the booking6 sheet. It should be was there probable cause to arrest7 or what crimes was there probable cause to arrest for,8 and it also should include a plain view concept ­­9 JUSTICE BREYER: Or how ­­ there's an10 analogue with photos. The arrested person has photos,11 pre­digital age. Of course you can look at them. On12 the phone there are photos. Absolutely analogous,13 except there are 10,000. It's indeed his entire life14 history in photos.15 MR. DUMONT: All right.16 JUSTICE BREYER: On your rule, can the17 policeman look at the photos by analogue or not, because18 there are 10,000. Okay? What's the answer?19 MR. DUMONT: In theory, yes, the police can20 look. In practice ­­21 JUSTICE BREYER: What we have is, by the22 way ­­ you understand where I'm going. I think there23 are very, very few things that you cannot find in24 analogue to in pre­digital age searches. And the25 problem in almost all instances is quantity and how far44￼1 afield you're likely to be going. Do I accept your2 rule?3 MR. DUMONT: The fundamental doctrinal4 basis, rational basis of the Robinson rule, I think, is5 that the fact that arrests ­­ this is what Justice6 Powell said and Justice ­­ well, the fact of the arrest7 necessarily and legitimately largely abates the privacy8 interest of the individual and his person and anything9 he or she has chosen to carry on the person.10 Now, modern technology makes it possible for11 people to choose to carry a great deal of information.12 But that doesn't change the fact that the reasonable13 expectation, if a person is subject to custodial arrest,14 is that the police will search the person and look at15 things that they find ­­16 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Dumont, is ­­ are you17 saying, essentially, that nobody has any expectation of18 privacy, or that somebody has a dramatically reduced19 expectation of privacy in anything that the person20 actually wants to keep on them at all times? In other21 words, one has to keep one's cell phone at home to have22 an expectation of privacy in it?23 MR. DUMONT: No, we're not saying that at24 all. But what we are saying is that people do make25 choices, and those choices have consequences.

DREEBEN     FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAESUPPORTING RESPONDENTMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      I think that it may be helpful to the Court,before exploring possible alternatives to a categoricalRobinson rule, to at least briefly understand why thereis a categorical Robinson rule and how cell phonesimplicate many of those concerns.  The categoricalRobinson rule responded to the fact that when a personis carrying something on their person and they aresubject to a legitimate probable cause arrest, theirexpectations of privacy are considerably reduced.  Noteliminated, but considerably reduced.      And the government, on the other hand, hasseveral very compelling interests at the moment ofarrest that are vindicated by conducting a thoroughsearch of the person and the things he has.  It avoidsthe destruction of evidence.  It protects officer46￼￼1 safety. And it allows the discovery of evidence that's2 relevant to the crime of arrest to enable prosecution.3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Dreeben, if4 the ­­ the understanding was, when there's time, get a5 warrant. So here, you can seize the phone and you can6 secure the phone, and you could go to a magistrate and7 within an hour get permission to search. But what is8 the reason for cutting out the magistrate here? It's9 not ­­ the instrument itself is not going to be in any10 danger because the police have taken it and they've11 disabled it. So I don't understand why we cut the12 warrant out of this picture.13 MR. DREEBEN: So several answers to that,14 Justice Ginsburg. The first is that you could probably15 say the same thing about almost everything that is16 seized under Robinson and Edwards. Once it's in the17 police's hands, they can throw it in the back of the18 patrol car in the trunk, and it would be safe and they19 could go get a warrant. But the balance has always been20 struck at the moment of arrest to allow the officers to21 fulfill the compelling interests in the matters that22 I've previously described.23 The second, and I think very critical thing24 about cell phones is they do differ in the amount of25 information that a person can carry on them and the47￼1 amount of revelation about a person's life. That is2 true. They also differ in that they greatly facilitate3 criminal activity. They contain a great deal of4 evidence, and most critically, they are subject to5 destruction in a way that ordinary physical items are6 not. Even if an officer has a cell phone in his hand,7 he cannot guarantee, unless it's disconnected from the8 network or somehow protected from the network, that9 there won't be a remote wipe signal sent to the phone10 that will wipe its data.11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have cases12 where that has happened?13 MR. DREEBEN: I have anecdotal reports from14 the F.B.I. that that has happened, that they have looked15 into the question of to what extent can you protect a16 phone through the use of things like Faraday bags. I17 think one of the important things to notice, if you18 throw a phone into a Faraday bag, which is supposedly19 going to be able to block network signals, when you open20 it up, it has to be similarly shielded or it will pick21 up a signal from a cell tower, and that will wipe the22 phone. And the F.B.I. tried to build a Faraday room in23 a building that they later discovered Verizon had put up24 a cell tower on it, and that cell tower put out a strong25 enough signal to go right through the Faraday room.48￼1 JUSTICE BREYER:2 States where this has been so, where they've had a rule3 that you can't search, for Michigan, I think, and4 Vermont. And are there any instance out of those States5 where these scenarios have taken place?6 MR. DREEBEN: I can't speak, Justice Breyer,7 for the experience in those States.8 JUSTICE BREYER:9 take it you don't know.10 MR. DREEBEN:11 information about that.12 JUSTICE BREYER:13 problem that might be postponed because we have warring14 technologies, et cetera? And is it ­­ you're saying now15 we should allow searches of all cell phones because16 there might be a technology that hasn't yet in fact been17 used in any of the States that have this rule. That18 sounds a little hypothetical. I'm not quite sure how to19 handle it.20 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I think that there is21 clearly the technology available and growing technology22 to wipe phones remotely. But the other critical problem23 that comes back to Justice Ginsburg's point about24 getting a warrant is encryption technology is25 increasingly being deployed in cell phones. That is49We've had a couple ofYou don't know of any.  II don't have any access to theAll right.  So isn't this a1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425something that clearly is on the rise.  And when a phoneis turned off or the lock kicks in and the phoneencrypts, it can be almost impossible to get into it.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How about putting ­­ let me stop you, because you were making that argument in your brief, and I have three related questions. Okay?      Why can't you just put the phone on airplanemode?JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:I'm a little confused￼      MR. DREEBEN:      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:      MR. DREEBEN:possible to find airplanemodels of phones that arelot of things to do when he arrests suspects.  Say hearrests five suspects in a car and they each have threecell phones.  Trying to find and put each one of theminto airplane mode and then go the further step and ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're ­­ you're confusing me, because if you haven't searched on the scene, then the wipe is going to happen. If you've had enough time at the precinct to put it on airplane mode, the wipe hasn't happened.MR. DREEBEN: Well, that's not necessarily true, Justice Sotomayor.Can I answer that one first?      Yes.First of all, it is not alwaysmode on all the 500, 600out there.  The officer has a50￼1 about what this argument is. Either you do it at the2 scene and you protect the phone ­­3 MR. DREEBEN: Yes.4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:­­ or you do at the5 station, and you have enough time to get the warrant by6 putting it on airplane mode.7 MR. DREEBEN: Well, you don't necessarily8 have enough time to get the warrant if you do it at the9 scene. That ­­ that's certainly true. I think even ­­10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't disagree. Put11 it on airplane mode.12 MR. DREEBEN: Even if you bring it back ­­13 the assumption that we're going to have airplane mode14 and that the Court should craft a constitutional rule15 around airplane mode assumes that cell phones are not16 going to be able to be used in airplanes in the next17 five years and that manufacturers will continue to make18 an easily available button for airplane mode. I don't19 think the Court should found a constitutional ruling on20 that assumption.21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I ­­ I don't disagree22 with you, but you're asking us for constitutional23 principle based on technology that might or might not do24 something in one or more cases, but not in the25 general ­­51MR.

DREEBEN: I ­­ I was referring ­­ I was referring to the5225 JUSTICE KAGAN:Can I ask you a question￼1 it; this Court has not. Lower courts that have looked2 at the question have said that if a person is arrested3 holding a briefcase, the police can open the briefcase,4 whether locked or unlocked, and look at its contents.5 They can't just go through the contents for prurient6 interest.7 They can look, however, for evidence that's8 relevant to criminal activity, and they do that in a way9 that is minimally invasive of privacy. They're not just10 doing it for the sake of doing it. They're looking for11 evidence.12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the tax return13 that's on ­­ some ­­ some cell phones have tax returns,14 so you have the tax return of the jaywalker, looking for15 a crime.16 MR. DREEBEN: Yes, and I ­­ and I ­­ I would17 acknowledge, Justice Kennedy, that if the Court is18 looking for a rule that limits the ability of police to19 search cell phones, because cell phones are different20 from paper items in some respects, but not all, that the21 most reasonable rule to apply would be one that says22 when there is reason to believe that there's evidence of23 the crime of arrest on the phone, the officers can look24 for that. When there is not, they can't. That will ­­53￼1 about that, Mr. Dreeben, because given the variety of2 things that these cell phones have in them, it seems as3 though that's ­­ you know, it sounds good as a limiting4 principle, but it ends up you can imagine in every case5 that the police could really look at everything.6 So I'll give you an example. It's sort of7 like this case. Somebody is arrested for a gun crime8 and now we're going to look at all the various things9 that might be related to a gun crime. So whether he's10 bought guns, whether ­­ you know, what ­­ what ­­11 whether he's done searches for gun stores. His e­mails12 might something say something about gun possession or13 gun purchase. He might have photographs of him with a14 gun. You know, the whole range of things could relate15 to that crime, couldn't it?16 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Kagan, I would17 acknowledge that your reasoning is correct in certain18 circumstances and for certain crimes. It would not be19 the case for a jaywalking crime or a bar fight or many20 other of the minor crimes, seat belt violations, that21 are posited on the other side of the equation for22 Respondent's or Petitioner's narrower approach to cell23 phone searches.24 But I do think that a couple of things are25 worth thinking about. First, in a serious offense like54MR. DREEBEN:JUSTICE KAGAN:MR. DREEBEN:Well, I ­­  ­­ and that's a protection.￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425a firearms offense in this case, a drug offense inWurie, if the police didn't ­­ went, got a warrant, theywould be looking at all the same things, because theonly way to execute the warrant on the phone would be toengage in at least a cursory search of everything on thephone to see whether it related.JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, they would be looking at the same things, but the whole idea of a warrant is that a neutral magistrate tells you that you can look at those things and has an opportunity to limit it in whatever way the neutral magistrate feels isappropriate ­­                          I ­­ I'm not sure that I wouldgo so far as to say the neutral magistrate can narrowthe warrant in any way that he sees appropriate.  ThisCourt's decisions in Grubbs and Dalia say that it's notappropriate for the magistrate to prescribe the mannerof executing the search.      But I think the more fundamental point, andthis is why I tried to start with the basic bedrock ofRobinson, is that there is a different balance ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead, please. MR. DREEBEN: There is a different balance551 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425at the moment of the arrest.  At that moment society'sinterests are at their apogee in locating evidencerelating to the crime of arrest and apprehending relatedsuspects, and the suspect has a highly reduced privacyinterest.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.      4 minutes, Mr. Fisher.    REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHERON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. FISHER: Thank you.I think I heard about four or five differentproposed rules that I want to just go through, each ofthem, one at a time.      First, the State talked about a, quote,"fundamentally different rule," and I think Justiceshave already figured out what we say at page 17­18 ofour reply brief, which is that would sweep in virtuallyeverything on the phone.      To the extent it wouldn't, you'd have areally difficult struggle on a case­by­case basis toanswer the very difficult question whether anyparticular app had fundamentally different informationthat existed in the nondigital world.      I also heard a suggestion, that, well, if alaptop or a smartphone is on somebody's person, that's56￼￼1 different than if it's sitting next to them. That's not2 correct if what the government says about its Chimel ­­3 about passwords and wiping satisfies Chimel. Remember,4 Chimel gives authority to search and seize without a5 warrant anything in the grab area if there's a6 destruction argument. So the person who's arrested7 sitting at his desk at the office, in reaching area from8 his computer would be open to a full search under the9 government's rule.10 There was also discussion about the11 exigencies at the scene of an arrest, needing to prevent12 a remote wipe, preventing a password from kicking in.13 The first thing to make sure you understand is those14 arguments can apply only at the scene. They don't apply15 in this case, where an officer takes the phone back to16 the police station and 2 hours later searches through it17 as his ­­ at his leisure. So all the arguments about at18 the scene and what the officer needs to be able to do at19 the scene can be left for another case.20 And I think Justice Breyer is exactly right.21 At the very best what the government has shown is that22 there may be certain tightly limited circumstances where23 exigent circumstances would apply.24 And I want to say a just quick thing on the25 password question in particular, which we didn't talk57￼1 about but may come up in the next argument. Pages 12 to2 14 of our reply brief, we outline how highly unusual as3 a factual matter it would be for a smartphone to be4 seized while it's still unlocked and for an officer not5 to be able to address concern at the scene that it might6 lock later. And it's also worth noting that in a7 footnote we attach, the government is arguing in lower8 courts that even if it does lock, that the Fifth9 Amendment does not give the person the opportunity to10 refuse to divulge the password in ­­ in response to a11 warrant.12 So the password argument doesn't have any13 play if the government wins the argument its making in14 the lower courts.15 Justice Kennedy, you suggested the16 possibility of distinguishing between serious and17 nonserious offenses. I think, with all due respect,18 this Court's decisions in Robinson and Atwater, where19 that issues was squarely presented, preclude that kind20 of a ­­ a determination for all the reasons the21 government argued in those cases.22 And then finally, Justice Scalia, you, I23 think, had mentioned a couple times the Gant principle24 as applied to this case, evidence that you think you25 might find on a phone. Well, there's two profound58￼1 problems with that. The first is, as the Court2 recognized in Kyllo, you need to be sure to protect the3 amount of privacy people had at the founding.4 And as I said in my opening, the fact that5 somebody might incidentally have an item on his person,6 even in the rare case, diary or address book, are7 leagues away from the kind of information people have8 now that were stored in the home and that were9 sacrosanct at an arrest, and that's what the thread10 throughout history says is an arrest cannot be an11 occasion to do that kind of a search.12 And, Justice Kagan, you're exactly right.13 If you run the Gant test through the world of crimes,14 the government might be able to identify a crime here or15 there that would be difficult to make an argument about.16 But lots of minor crimes, like speeding, as we point out17 in our brief, DUI, littering, all kinds of minor crimes,18 the person can make a fairly convincing argument19 sometimes that evidence on the phone would be relevant20 to that crime of arrest.21 And so I think that brings me to where I22 want to end, which is understanding what the rule the23 government propounds would do in terms of just ordinary24 police work. Remember, this case starts with a traffic25 stop for an expired license plate. It is everyday59￼1 police work that traffic stops are the beginning of2 criminal investigations and a leverage point into3 searches.4 If you adopt a rule that says, even a Gant5 rule, that says if you can make an argument that6 evidence on the phone would be relevant to the crime of7 arrest, take the suspended license, you may have an8 e­mail from the DMV telling you you better come in and9 renew. If that opens up every American's entire life to10 the police department, not just at the scene but later11 at the station house and downloaded into their computer12 forever, I think you will fundamentally have changed the13 nature of privacy that Americans fought for at the14 founding of the Republic and that we've enjoyed ever15 since.16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.17
