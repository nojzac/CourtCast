Allcare Health Management Systems.      Mr. Katyal.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYALON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:      The Federal Circuit applied a de novowithout­deference standard to objective baselessness inSection 285 cases.  That was wrong for three reasons.      First, this Court has already held that aunitary abuse­of­discretion standard should be appliedin closely analogous cases in the Pierce and Cootercases.  Those cases, like this one, were ancillaryappeals over attorneys' fees concerning the supervisionof litigation, which is precisely what Section 285addresses.      Second, the text of the Act, and inparticular its key words, "may" and "exceptionalcases," imbued district courts with discretion.  Indeed,up until this case, that was the way the Act applied for60 years.3￼￼1 And, third, the other factors this Court has2 looked to, such as a lack of law clarifying benefits,3 the positioning of the decision­maker, efficiency in4 avoiding distortion, cut in favor of unitary5 abuse­of­discretion review.6 For those reasons, the case for such review7 even stronger here than it was in Pierce and Cooter. In8 Pierce and Cooter, this Court looked to ­­ for ­­ in9 Pierce, for example, this Court looked to EAJA and10 determined that, even though the text of the statute11 didn't compel a result, nonetheless, unitary12 abuse of discretion review was the appropriate standard.13 And here ­­14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How ­­ how does15 abuse of discretion work with respect to a pure legal16 question?17 MR. KATYAL: I think this Court answered18 that both in Pierce and Cooter. It said if it's a truly19 pure legal question, then it is a ­­ that it is a ­­20 that ­­ that there isn't deference given to that in that21 circumstance.22 Now, here the question presented is23 objective baselessness. And in the context of24 Section 285 determinations, that kind of retrospective25 look ­­ was the attorney acting reasonably or not ­­41 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Pierce and Cooter both say that's something that isalways context­dependent.  It always depends on thefacts.JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, would you explain that to me a little bit, Mr. Katyal. In a case in which the district court just uses an erroneous claim construction, you would concede that that's a pure legal question, so that would be an abuse of discretion?MR. KATYAL: We would not, Your Honor. So certainly on the merits, if the question of claim construction went up to the Federal Circuit ­­ as it did here, for example, in 2009 ­­ the question there would be there would be no deference under the Federal Circuit's precedent in a ­­ most recently, Friday in the Lighting Ballast case.      But when the question is a 285 question, theretrospective look at objective baselessness of whichclaim construction forms a part ­­JUSTICE KAGAN: No, but I ­­ I guess my first question was just if what ­­ if the district court says, Here's the appropriate claim construction, andin saying that, it's wrong.MR. KATYAL:JUSTICE KAGAN:MR. KATYAL:Yes.Is thatAs it goes5a legal question?up to the Federal￼￼1 Circuit under existing precedent, they treat that as a2 legal question. We think this Court's decision in3 Markman suggests otherwise. It said it was a mixed4 question, a mongrel question of law and fact. And so5 when ­­ if the Court were ever to get into that ultimate6 question on the merits, we think that ­­ that the7 Markman analysis would control.8 But here the question is a 285 question.9 JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. So let's just assume10 for a moment that an erroneous claim construction would11 be a mistake of law. Let's just assume that. And I12 understand you say that there's a question.13 But if that's right, why is it not also true14 that a judge's statement that a litigant ­­ that a15 litigant's claim construction was unreasonable is not a16 similar mistake of law?17 MR. KATYAL: For ­­ for exactly the reason18 that I think Pierce says, which is the question in a19 retrospective attorneys' fees case is not what the ­­ is20 not what was the law; it's rather, was the position that21 the party took reasonable.22 And so, for example, in Pierce the question23 was under a certain statute, EAJA, do the words "shall"24 and "authorized" ­­ do they mean mandatory? And Justice25 White in dissent said that's a pure legal question.6￼1 That's something courts of appeals deal with all the2 time, district courts don't deal with it; we should give3 no deference to that. And Justice Scalia's opinion for4 the Court said, No, even there, that is something we're5 looking at that legal claim as situated within the6 particular contours of the case overall in deciding was7 that a reasonable argument or not.8 JUSTICE KAGAN: But isn't the main thing the9 judge doing when it says that a claim construction is10 unreasonable is essentially measuring the delta between11 the actual ­­ the correct claim construction and the12 mistaken claim construction? And doesn't that seem to13 be, again, assuming that the claim construction itself14 is a question of law? Doesn't that itself seem to be a15 question of law?16 MR. KATYAL: We agree that's one of the17 things the judge is doing there, but it's not the only18 thing. Just as in Pierce, certainly the Court was19 interpreting the meaning of the statute, but they were20 doing it within the context of litigation. This case I21 think is a helpful example and ­­ to remove it from the22 abstract and just bring it down to here.23 You've heard and you've read the brief on24 the other side saying this is a claim construction25 dispute. It's not a claim construction dispute. What7￼1 the district court found seven different times when it2 imposed fees is that this is actually a dispute about3 infringement and their inability to come up with any4 theory whatsoever for why ­­ why there was a5 infringement violation.6 And what I think the logic of Pierce and7 Cooter is, is that if you give clever appellate lawyers8 like my friend the ability to go to the ­­ to go to a9 court of appeals and repackage what were essentially10 factual claims and claim they're legal ­­ here, claim11 construction ­­ then you're going to ­­ you're going to12 waste an enormous time of ­­ time and resources of the13 Federal Circuit as they seek to disaggregate, is this14 really, truly factual or is this really legal.15 And you wouldn't want to have that, I think,16 for the reasons that this Court has said repeatedly,17 which is the whole goal in attorney fees cases is to18 avoid a second major litigation. And that's precisely19 what the Federal Circuit did here. It minted a whole20 new theory under this de novo without­deference21 standard. And that's the harm. That's the evil that I22 think all of the attorney fees cases are trying to23 address.24 I'd also say that, you know, even if ­­25 beyond Pierce, beyond Pierce, we do think this is8￼1 essentially Pierce­plus; that this is a case in which2 the text of the statute and its key words, "may in3 exceptional cases," give the Court, I think, further4 reason to return the standard to the way it has always5 been interpreted for 60 years.6 And for 60 years: From 1946 to 1952,7 Abuse of discretion deferential review was used in8 objective baselessness cases; in 1952, the ­­ the9 Congress codified, essentially, those ­­ that10 interpretation; from 1952 to 1982, the regional circuits11 used it, like the D.C. Circuit in the Oetiker case;12 after 1982, the Federal Circuit used it time and again13 in cases such as Eon­Net.14 It's this case that really is a dramatic15 departure from the way Section 285 has been interpreted,16 and indeed the way all attorney fee litigation has been17 interpreted.18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we undo ­­19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: On your reading,20 Mr. Katyal, I take it that if the district court denies21 fees, there would be slim to no chance of getting that22 overturned on appeal if you're dealing with the abuse23 of ­­ abuse of discretion.24 MR. KATYAL: We think that it is hard in25 that circumstance, and that's the one­way ratchet. We9￼1 don't place a lot of emphasis on that in our brief.2 It's our last argument. But we do think, essentially,3 it is hard to overturn a district court's decision not4 to award fees, whereas under the Federal Circuit's5 interpretation, it's really quite easy for the Federal6 Circuit to mint some new theory as to why the position7 was reasonable that ­­ that the attorney took.8 And, Justice Breyer, you said in the last9 argument, you said clever patent attorneys can always10 come up with a colorable argument, and you were11 referring at the district court stage ­­12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you leave it to the13 district court that way and the district court denies14 fees, isn't there a ­­ a risk of large disparities from15 district judge to district judge. One will say, yes, I16 think that this was uncommon, not run of the mine, so17 I'm going to award fees, and another one of them will18 say, no, I think it's pretty standard, so I won't award19 fees.20 MR. KATYAL: We do think implicit in an21 abuse of discretion standard or Congress committing this22 to district court discretion will be some variation. We23 think this Court answered that problem in Koon, I think24 most particularly, in a case where the stakes were ­­25 you know, not to belittle this case ­­ but the stakes10￼1 were even higher there, criminal sentencing.2 And what the Court said is, yes, there will3 be some disuniformity, but district court judges are4 better able to determine the mine­run case than will the5 court of appeals because they're able to assess the6 entirety of the litigation, rather than ­­ than one7 piece of it.8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Katyal, if we were9 to overrule the Brooks Furniture standard ­­ you've just10 heard the argument where that issue is being presented11 to us in Octane. If we were to do that, how would that12 affect this case? Wouldn't it essentially moot the13 question because you wouldn't have this objective14 reasonableness test controlling the outcome?15 MR. KATYAL: Well, it would certainly depend16 on how ­­ on how you did it, but our brief at pages 3417 to 37 say that if you adopt any variant of the18 petitioner's theory in Octane, the case here only gets19 stronger.20 You have to, I think, ultimately reverse21 what the Federal Circuit said at page 9a of the petition22 appendix, which is objective baselessness must be23 determined de novo. We think that that's wrong for all24 the reasons we've been talking about. And even were you25 to change the standard in Octane, so long as objective11￼1 baselessness formed any part of the Section 2852 inquiry ­­3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So when does that become4 a pure question of law?5 MR. KATYAL: We think it never becomes a6 pure question of law. There ­­ there are ­­ we don't7 doubt that ­­ to answer the Chief Justice's question8 from before ­­ we don't doubt that there are some9 circumstances in which there are pure questions of law10 in Section 285 cases. For example, what does the Patent11 Act ­­ the Patent Clause in the Constitution mean, or12 what does a particular statute mean?13 But when you're dealing with, for example,14 claim construction, that looks very much like the EAJA15 question that the Court was dealing with in Justice16 Scalia's opinion in Pierce. It's a retrospective17 collateral question about how reasonable was this18 argument at this particular time, in this particular19 case, with these particular parties, with this20 particular patent.21 And what Justice Scalia's opinion in Pierce22 says is that's not the type of question that we should23 be spending a lot of court of appeals' resources on.24 That's something that is dealt with on the merits, as it25 was here. The Federal Circuit dealt with the question121 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425on the merits in 2009 ­­ but not something that youshould have a second major litigation over.If there are no further questions.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fletcher.ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN H. FLETCHER     FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,        SUPPORTING PETITIONERMR. FLETCHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      In this morning's first case, you willdecide what principles should guide a district court'saward of attorneys' fees under Section 285.  Whateverstandard you choose to adopt in that case, we believethat a district court's application to the particularfacts of a case before it ought to be reviewed under aunitary abuse of discretion standard.      That approach is consistent with thisCourt's repeated statements that decisions about thesupervision of litigation ought to be reviewed under adeferential standard.  And in this particular context,it's also supported by the text and history ofSection 285, by 60 years of consistent appellatepractice, and by the same sorts of practicalconsiderations that led this Court to adopt a similar13￼￼1 approach to very similar questions in Pierce and in2 Cooter & Gell.3 I'd like to start, if I could, by focusing4 on a point that hasn't come up so far in the argument,5 which is we've heard a lot about why district courts are6 best situated to make the determination in a particular7 case that they've lived with, often for years at a time,8 of whether or not a particular litigating position is9 unreasonable. And we think that's true and a very good10 reason to accord deference here.11 But we think another good reason to accord12 deference in this context is that applying de novo13 review requires a substantial expenditure of appellate14 resources. I think this case is a good example.15 The Federal Circuit affirmed the district16 court's decision on the merits in an unpublished17 decision and, in fact, without written opinion. But18 when it reviewed the district court's award of fees19 under a de novo standard, it was required to engage in a20 lengthy analysis that produced a lengthy written21 opinion. And we think applying a de novo standard and22 requiring appellate courts, and the Federal Circuit in23 particular, to engage in that kind of review encourages24 collateral appeals and encourages the expenditure of25 resources on decisions that don't actually produce the14￼1 law ­­2 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, you can make ­­ you3 can make that argument with respect to every legal issue4 that's raised on appeal. Well, if you have to decide5 whether the lower court was right, that's a lot of work.6 But if all you have to decide is whether the lower court7 abused its discretion in deciding if the law means what8 the lower court said it means, that's a lot less work.9 MR. FLETCHER: Well, that ­­10 JUSTICE ALITO: So that argument is a11 strange argument, unless there's something really12 special about the attorneys' fees context. And I guess13 that's your argument, there's something really14 But why should it? I mean, you've15 of money involved. Why should we say, this is16 collateral litigation, even though it involves17 of dollars more than the claim in many other types of18 cases?19 MR. FLETCHER: So let me say a couple of20 things about that, and one is, I think ordinarily when21 an appellate court applies a de novo standard and22 determines what the right answer is, that has benefits23 not just for the particular litigants before it, but24 also in clarifying the law for everyone going forward.25 But what the Court said in Pierce and in15special.got a lotmillions￼1 Cooter & Gell and what's also true here is that when the2 question that the appellate court is answering is not3 what is the law actually, but rather what could a party,4 when it initiated this case and continued to litigate it5 several years ago, could that party have a ­­ reasonably6 believed the law to be, that doesn't yield the same sort7 of law­clarifying benefit. In fact, in Pierce, this8 Court said those sorts of determinations are never going9 to be made clear under any sort of review standard.10 JUSTICE ALITO: It can clarify what the11 law is. What's the difference between that situation12 and, let's say, deciding an issue of qualified immunity13 in a civil rights case or applying the ­­ applying AEDPA14 in a habeas case? The court can say this is what the15 law is, and then after that, as the second step,16 determine whether a particular interpretation of the law17 was reasonable. You could do the same thing here.18 MR. FLETCHER: A court could do that here,19 and I suppose the Federal Circuit, if the case came to20 it on the ­­ the question was the District Court ­­ did21 it abuse its discretion or did it get it right in22 deciding that the party's position was unreasonable, the23 could ­­ the court ­­ Federal Circuit could decide the24 underlying question itself and then decide whether or25 not the district court was correct in concluding that a16￼1 party's position was reasonable or unreasonable.2 But we think there's ­­ there's good reason3 not to do that here, and we think that, in these4 contexts, unlike in qualified immunity, unlike in AEDPA,5 the district court has particular expertise in the case6 and a long experience with the case, and ­­ and that7 requiring the Federal Circuit to engage in a thorough8 review of the entire record of the litigation and the9 entire proceedings of the litigation imposes a burden10 that just isn't justified.11 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I'm just wondering, if12 you put together your two arguments about what the13 standard should be and what the standard of review14 should be, whether there really is going to be any15 meaningful review of what district courts do in this16 situation.17 Maybe you could just describe for me what an18 appellate decision would look like, saying that applying19 the totality of the circumstances, the district court20 abused its discretion in awarding or not awarding fees.21 What would an appellate court say.22 MR. FLETCHER: So I think one thing that an23 appellate court might say, as Justice Kagan alluded to24 earlier, is that if the district court has based its fee25 award on a misunderstanding of the law, if it got the17￼1 claim construction wrong, if it misinterpreted the2 relevant patent statutes, that would obviously be an3 abuse of discretion.4 But I think even if the district court5 correctly conceived of the law, abuse of discretion6 review still leaves room for an appellate court to say7 that, although the district court had a wide range of8 options and has flexibility, this particular decision on9 these particular facts strays too far from that range.10 I think courts of appeals do that in the sentencing11 context, they do that in other contexts where they12 review district court decisions for abuse of discretion,13 and we think that performing that role, which14 abuse of discretion review comfortably accommodates,15 leaves plenty of room for the Federal Circuit to rein in16 any outlier district court decisions.17 I think another point that's useful to keep18 in mind is the extent to which applying a de novo19 standard of review encourages collateral appeals. I20 think a theme of this Court's decisions about attorneys'21 fees has been that a dispute over fees should not give22 rise to a second major litigation, and I think applying23 a de novo standard encourages that, both in encouraging24 parties to take marginal appeals and also in leading to25 fights about which parts of the district court's18￼1 decision are factual, which parts are legal, which2 standard of review applies to different parts of a3 district court's decision.4 I think all of those things are ­­ add to5 the burden of the collateral fee litigation in a way6 that does ­­ isn't justified by the benefit that de novo7 review provides.8 The last point that I think I'd like to9 leave you with is the notion that I think there ­­10 Justice Alito, earlier you suggested that the Federal11 Circuit has expertise in patent law and special12 expertise in patent law. And I frankly think that's the13 strongest argument that the other side has.14 But I'd urge you to look at Judge Moore's15 dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc in this16 case, where she and four of her colleagues on the17 Federal Circuit explained that when you're asking18 whether or not a party's litigating position was19 objectively reasonable, the Federal Circuit's expertise20 in patent law actually isn't the relevant expertise.21 And she explains at length and she cites a number of22 prior Federal Circuit decisions, recognizing as well23 that the district court who's lived with the case and24 who's decided on the merits and who's seen the parties25 and has spent sometimes years with the parties is really19￼1 in a better position to decide whether or not the2 party's litigating position was reasonable.3 For that reason, if the Court has no further4 questions, we'd urge it to vacate the judgment below and5 remand the case to the court of appeals, with6 instructions to consider the district court's award of7 fees under the correct standard.8 Thank you.9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.10 Mr. Dunner.11 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD R. DUNNER12 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT13 MR. DUNNER: May it please the Court, and14 Mr. Chief Justice ­­ I've got that reversed. My15 apologies.16 Allcare agrees that Pierce and Cooter are17 highly relevant to this case, but we feel that those18 cases support Allcare and not Highmark, and let me19 explain.20 The Pierce case starts out by talking about21 the ­­ the traditional rule. The traditional rule is22 that legal issues are reviewed de novo. And this23 Court's opinion in the Ornelas case reinforces that for24 probable cause cases.25 So the question is why ­­ why didn't the20￼1 Federal ­­ why didn't the Supreme Court apply the2 traditional rule in Pierce and in Cooter? And the3 answer certainly is not that they were fee cases,4 because the Pierce case makes absolutely clear that it5 was not enunciating a general rule for fee cases. It6 said it couldn't enunciate a general rule.7 On the other hand, what the ­­ what the8 Court did was, it looked at the specifics involved,9 which was the tribunal best qualified or best situated10 to decide the issues in the case. And it dealt11 specifically with three different points.12 One, in the Pierce case, the EAJA statute13 was involved and the text of that statute had been14 changed from 1946 to 1952. It originally used the word15 "discretion." It changed it to "exceptional case." My16 colleagues on the other side argue that the word "may"17 suggests discretion. Well, the word "may" is not18 tethered to "exceptional"; it's tethered to award of19 fees. And everybody agrees that the district court has20 discretion in terms of what fees are ­­ are awarded.21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Even if I assumed that22 ultimately the claim that you made might have been ­­23 might have had a basis, like the court below agreed, as24 I read the district court's decision, it wasn't basing25 its decision merely on that. What it was basing it on,21￼1 and it goes through a whole laundry list of things that2 it thought constituted abusive litigation ­­ very little3 prefiling investigation, continuous switch of claims4 because of the lack of that investigation, pursuing a5 theory that your expert didn't even agree with ­­ that6 all sounds to me like a factual basis, basically saying7 this litigation was abusive.8 And I don't understand how that doesn't feed9 into the objective unreasonableness, meaning that if you10 had done the investigation you should have, you may have11 had a claim or thought you had a claim, but you would12 have learned much earlier that even your expert disputed13 things and you're likely not to have brought the suit.14 That's how I read the district court's decision.15 MR. DUNNER: Your Honor, with due deference,16 there were four issues ­­ actually five because Allcare17 lost on one of the issues, the 102 claim. There were18 four issues that went up to the Federal Circuit, plus19 the one we lost on. None of them involved prefiling20 investigation.21 What happened was the district court wrote a22 long opinion based on Rule 11. We asked for23 reconsideration. The district court dropped all the24 charges against the lawyers, left the charges against25 Allcare, and if you read the Federal Circuit opinion22￼1 starting at the appendix 19A and going through the2 pages, you'll see there were four issues, one of which3 was not prefiling investigation, none of which involved4 the points you're making.5 There were four issues. Two of them6 involved claim construction, and the third one involved7 claim construction ­­ the one we lost on. The fourth8 one was whether or not the ­­ the ­­ Allcare had a right9 to rely on what happened in the Eastern District of10 Virginia in which we had the same claim against a11 different party and the two courts reached different12 conclusions on the same issue on the same claim, which13 alone should have ­­ should have found that it was14 objectively reasonable but was not.15 And the ­­ the last one was whether or not16 alleged misconduct, misrepresentation to the Western17 District of Pennsylvania before the case was18 transferred, whether that was sanctionable, and the case19 law made clear that was a legal question. The case law20 made absolutely clear that you cannot look at conduct21 before another tribunal to decide whether a different22 tribunal should sanction you.23 Every one of those issues ­­ the three claim24 construction issues were legal issues; and the ­­25 whether the ­­ whether they could rely on res judicata23￼1 or collateral estoppel based on the Eastern District of2 Virginia case was a legal issue; and the question of3 whether the alleged misconduct in Pennsylvania could be4 sanctionable was also a legal issue. We had no factual5 issues in this case.6 And I suggest you look at the pages starting7 with 19A and read the Court's opinion and they basically8 said, contrary to Mr. Katyal's comment, the issue was9 one of claim construction, it was not one of10 infringement. There was a special master in the case,11 and the special master first gave a claim construction12 favorable to Allcare. And then in a summary judgment13 hearing, he changed his opinion, and Judge Dyk's opinion14 for the majority of the court basically notes this, that15 he changed his view and he came out with a different16 view.17 But the issue was, is, and always a claim18 construction issue. And even they concede that claim19 construction issues are reviewed de novo.20 Now, a point has been made about pure issues21 of law and impure issues of law. They don't use22 "impure," but I assume that's the converse of a pure23 issue of law. And they say that only certain kinds of24 things are pure issues of law, and it does not include25 objective baselessness.24￼1 Well, I suggest that the Court look at2 Scott v. Harris. Scott v. Harris says expressly that3 objective reasonableness is a pure issue of law reviewed4 de novo when it's separated from its factual components.5 And it is our position that the factual components are6 reviewed deferentially. We're not arguing to the7 contrary. All we're saying is when you've got a legal8 issue, the best court situated to deal with the legal9 issue and to avoid problems like we had with the Eastern10 District of Virginia on the same claim, same issue,11 going a different way from the Northern District of12 Texas will be avoided.13 The whole purpose of the formation ­­ this14 was discussed in the Octane case. The whole purpose of15 the formation was ­­ of the Federal Circuit was to16 provide uniformity, to provide predictability. When17 you've got 94 district courts and hundreds of district18 court judges going different ways, some of which are19 friendly to patents, some of which are hostile to20 patents, the best tribunal to rule on the patent ­­ on21 the legal issues, the patent issues, is the Federal22 Circuit.23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but then it24 reads four to three on one issue, then it has, as in25 this case, conflicting cases within its own docket. So25￼ 1   I'm not sure it's succeeding in bringing about 2   uniformity.3 MR. DUNNER: Your Honor, I ­­ I apologize. 4   I missed that point.5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm just 6   saying, the point ­­ you're quite correct, the Federal 7   Circuit was established to bring about uniformity in 8   patent law, but they seem to have a great deal of 9   disagreement among themselves and are going back and10   forth in particular cases, in this area specifically,11   about what the appropriate approach is.12 MR. DUNNER: Your Honor, they do have13   disagreement.  This was a six­five case, and there are14   other cases.  The case, Lighting Ballast that was just15   decided, was a six­four case, and the Akamai case which is coming in16   April was a six­to­five case.  The fact is, that you17   still have a single tribunal.  That's the way a court18   should operate.  When they go en banc, you get a19   divergence of views.  It's like the Supreme Court.  You20   have lots of dissenting opinions, concurring opinions,21   but it's a single body, and a single body that has22   jurisdiction over all the 285 cases is better situated23   than to have lots of district court judges ruling on24   questions of law.  We're only talking about questions of25   law.26      JUSTICE BREYER:mean ­­Well, they do sometimes.  IMR. DUNNER:JUSTICE BREYER:Pardon?    There are a lot of areas of￼ 1 2 3 4 5   the law where they do.  I mean, Holmes thought 6   reasonableness, given undisputed facts, is really a 7   question of law.  Probable cause matters are really 8   questions of law, if the facts are undisputed.  Cases 9   all over the law, there was a case we had ­­ I had, I10   saw once, it said, is an Eclectus Parrot a wild bird for11   purposes of a statute that says wild birds cannot be12   imported, and the judges there said, Well, is this13   characteristic factual?  Da, da, da.  And is this14   characteristic really ­­ if you really put your mind to it,15   you'd have to say that was legal; does "wild" mean in16   the country of origin or in the country of import?17 You know, so you could separate it. But18   there are many, many areas of the law where judges don't19   bother to separate the two things.  And isn't claim20   construction like that?  I mean, you have a case and the21   claim constructionist always has in mind what this22   infringing item might be in respect to the claim, and so23   the judge is always looking at that and doesn't often24   separate law and fact.  I mean, am I ­­ you know this25   area better than I do.27￼1 MR. DUNNER:2 JUSTICE BREYER:3 (Laughter.)4 JUSTICE BREYER:5 claim construction is like that very often. Factual6 matters are there, legal matters are there, and judges7 cannot always separate the one from the other, or even8 if they could, they don't feel it's worth the effort.9 MR. DUNNER: Your Honor, there are times10 when it may be difficult to separate facts from law, and11 in the Markman case, the Court talked about it as being12 a mongrel type of situation. But the fact is that in13 many cases you can separate them, and moreover, the fact14 that it is a mixed question of fact and law, which has15 been bandied around in the briefs, does not itself16 determine whether it's de novo or discretionary as ­­ as17 has been ­­ as was mentioned specifically in the Pierce18 case.19 So the fact is you're still better off;20 which is the best tribunal to deal with the question?21 I'm not saying we have a perfect answer because there's22 not a perfect answer on our side, there's not a perfect23 answer on their side. But there's a best answer, and I24 suggest that the best answer is to let the legal issues25 decided by the court that gets tons of patent issues,28I'm not sure, Your Honor.    Oh, I guarantee.So I'm thinking that maybe￼1 that has a lot more experience, as Justice Alito2 mentioned in one of the points that he made, rather than3 district court judges who may get a few cases, may get a4 lot of cases, depending what district you're in.5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what about6 Judge Moore's point that when you're talking about pure7 issues of patent law maybe you're right, but when you're8 talking about baselessness, that's something that the9 district courts actually have more experience with,10 whether it's under EAJA, whether it's under AEDPA,11 whether it's under qualified immunity. That's an issue12 they see all the time, so maybe they are more expert13 than the Federal Circuit.14 MR. DUNNER: Your Honor, on the question15 broadly of objective baselessness, one might say that is16 so. But on the question of objective baselessness in a17 patent context, in a 285 context, where you've got legal18 issues, where you've got claim construction issues, they19 are certainly not better situated than the Federal20 Circuit.21 And I submit that certainly claim22 construction is a perfect example, and the government,23 in this case, acknowledges that claim construction, as24 it calls it pure claim construct ­­ pure legal issues,25 claim construction is reviewed de novo. So that is a291 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425perfect example of how district courts can disagree.And this case is poster child for that because we hadtwo different courts going two different ways on exactlythe same point, exactly the same issue.      And the Pierce case raised, there are otherconsiderations involved, there are a lot ofconsiderations involved, but others in terms of whichtribunal is better situated.  And the Pierce casepointed out that the size of the fee involved can bevery important.  And I'd like to address that just verybriefly.      The size of the fee involved in patentcases, as my daughters would say, humongous.  Some of ­­I've been in two cases where the legal fees were$30 million, and when you've got legal fees like that ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you've got to stop charging such outrageous fees.(Laughter.)MR. DUNNER: That's the way it used to be with you, Your Honor.(Laughter.)CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no.MR. DUNNER: The fact is, when you've gotfees like that, there is going to be an appeal.Typically, the appeal will be consolidated with the30￼￼1 merits appeal. Typically, the Court will be dealing2 with the issues, both of them in the same case. And as3 Judge Dyk pointed out, having reviewed the merits4 decision, the 285 decision often involves the same kind5 of questions, and it is not an enormous burden on the6 courts to do that.7 And given the amount of the fee, there's8 going to be an appeal when you've got large legal fees9 regardless of the standard of review. So you're not ­­10 I don't think you're going to get a meaningful number of11 additional appeals that you otherwise would not get.12 And the fact is that the size of the fees13 was independently noted in Pierce as a factor. On the14 Rule 11 issue in Cooter the ­­ this Court talked about15 the fact that the district courts were best suited to16 deal with those cases because they were familiar with17 the local practices. The whole purpose of the Federal18 Circuit is not to be concerned with local practices but19 to be concerned with national practices.20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Two of the items that you21 mentioned, one was venue, and the other was claim22 preclusion, issue preclusion, the Federal Circuit is no23 more expert in those areas than a district court would24 be.25MR. DUNNER: On what kind of issues, Your311 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Honor?      JUSTICE GINSBURG:venue question.MR. DUNNER: Yes. JUSTICE GINSBURG:The ­­ you mentioned thesanction.MR. DUNNER: Yes. JUSTICE GINSBURG:￼                               And I was surprised.  TheCourt said, well, that's for the Pennsylvania court to                               But you, I'm sure, haveread Noxell case in the D.C. Circuit ­­MR. DUNNER: Written by you, Your Honor.      JUSTICE GINSBURG: ­­ one of the problemsthere, one of the conduct that was consideredunreasonable was suing in ­­ in a distant forum, veryfar from where the defendants operated.  And claimpreclusion and issue preclusion come up in all kinds ofcases, so there's nothing expert about the FederalCircuit on those issues.MR. DUNNER: Your Honor, I have to acknowledge that on an issue of whether or not a conduct in a different circuit should be sanctionable in another circuit, the Federal Circuit is certainly not more expert on that kind of an issue than another court.That ­­ that is merely an example of what happened in this particular case.3218 went to 13 circuits, the 28519 So it is much better to have20 those questions than to have21 JUSTICE SCALIA:issues go to one circuit.a single court ruling onmultiple district courts.Well, you know, once you ­­confers discretion on a￼1 I will note that the Federal Circuit cited a2 number of cases which held exactly that. And, moreover,3 what happened in this case was that even the district4 court ­­ Judge Means in the Northern District of5 Texas ­­ noted that the Pennsylvania district court6 itself did not seem to place very great reliance on it.7 It probably was the least significant of all the factors8 in the case.9 And so I would say it is merely an example10 of a legal issue. And there will be some legal issues11 in which the Federal Circuit may not be more expert than12 others, but there will be a lot of legal issues, since13 we're dealing with conduct in patent cases, on which the14 Federal Circuit is the most expert court.15 And, in any event, we're talking about how16 can we get uniformity of decision­making in the 28517 area, and you've got both Rule 11 and the EAJA cases22 once you have a statute that23 district court, you don't expect uniformity of24 decision­making. It gives the district judge a broad ­­25 broad discretion, and some will come out at the top and33MR. DUNNER:      JUSTICE SCALIA:district courts?MR. DUNNER:      JUSTICE SCALIA:clearly doesn't.      MR. DUNNER:Honor.Let me ­­    ­­ on the part of theLet me ­­    It seems to me it quiteLet me address that, Your￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425some will come out at the bottom.  And they will allbe ­­ be affirmed by the court of appeals.      So what makes you think that ­­ that thisstatute, which clearly confers discretion, envisionsuniformity ­­      The ­­ there's a lot of argument in theopposing briefs on the textual issue and the legislativehistory, and they cite the legislative history ofSection 70, the predecessor statute in 285, and theytalk about the reviser's note and P.J.

And the newword ­­ the new words meant that they were focusing onSection 70 as it had been interpreted by the courts.      So what do you see when you look at thecourts?  We have ­­ I have examined every appellatedecision from 1946 to 1952 dealing with Section 70.There are 19 of them.  And not a single one said legal341 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425issues are reviewed with deference.  Not a single one.A lot of them use discretionary language, but none saidlegal issues are reviewed with deference.  Andmoreover ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Well ­­ well, you ­­ you acknowledged that a lot of these cases ­­ probably most of these cases do not involve exclusively legal issues. Right?MR. DUNNER: Exactly, Your Honor.JUSTICE SCALIA: And so in ­­ in all of those cases you're not going to get uniformity, because their ­­ you acknowledge that in ­­ in the nonlegal issues, there is discretion in the district court. So you're going to have some district courts coming out some ways, other district courts coming out the other way, and they will all be affirmed.      So the ­­ it seems to me ­­ this does notstrike me as an area where Congress expected uniformity.MR. DUNNER: Your Honor ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: You're ­­ you're creating uniformity in one narrow aspect of ­­ of this decision, that involving legal claims, but there are many otheraspects of the decisionsuniformity you're tryingMR. DUNNER:that will destroy whateverto achieve.Your Honor, I hadn't finished35￼￼1 my point, so let me just finish it, which is a response2 to your point. And that is these 19 cases between 19463 and 1952, many of them gave ­­ gave a test, and they4 said the issue is abuse of discretion or ­­ the5 disjunctive or ­­ a legal error. And so all of these6 cases, none of them said legal issues are reviewed7 deferentially. And all I'm saying is that if you look8 at the legislative history, if you look at the textual9 change of the statute, those cases in between were10 concerned that the district courts were ­­ were11 construing "with deference" too loosely, and they12 tightened it up with the "exceptional case" language.13 But they also said that it ­­ that legal14 questions are reviewed de novo. And all I'm saying is15 if you look at the statute, we want the district courts16 to rule on the facts. We want the Federal Circuit to17 give deference to their ruling on the facts. But when18 they get into the legal area, when they make legal19 decisions, we think it should be reviewed de novo ­­20 JUSTICE BREYER: The problem with ­­ the21 problem is ­­ the one I think that ­­ that really seems22 to me at the heart of what you have to decide, is it23 worth saying to the court of appeals start24 distinguishing between which of the two categories it25 falls into. Because the statement that you read, most3625 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:I'm sorry.  I'm ­­ I'm a￼1 lawyers would agree with that statement as a general2 principle.3 And then the question becomes, well, it's4 work to decide whether this is purely legal or whether5 it's legal/factual mixed and sometimes it's one and6 sometimes the other and they are really no key to it7 exactly.8 So what you're doing is saying, in an area9 where there are a lot of the deferential kind and some10 of the nondeferential kind, we want to say the Federal11 Circuit and all the district courts have to stop and12 figure that thing out, while the other side says, look,13 just leave it to the district court and tell them to14 review.15 Theirs is simpler. What do you say?16 MR. DUNNER: Justice Breyer, my response is17 that in many cases, there won't be a problem18 distinguishing between law and fact. When there is a19 problem ­­ there will be some cases where there may be20 difficulty distinguishing between law and fact, and what21 Pierce says and what Cooter says and what a lot of cases22 say is which is the best tribunal, the district court or23 the appellate court, to deal with it? And all I'm24 saying is there are all these factors ­­37￼1 little confused. With respect to winning or losing the2 case, you're going to get de novo review because the3 Federal Circuit here looked at the claim construction,4 under de novo review agreed with the district court that5 it had construed the claim properly and that you lost.6 So you got de novo review.7 The issue on a reasonable ground to pursue8 the litigation, whether it was objectively reasonable or9 not, I think that's Justice Breyer's point, which it10 generally has factors that are independent of winning or11 losing, and that's why I kept going back to what the12 district court said in this case, which you seem to13 ignore. It, at one point, recognizes that your claim14 was a difficult one, but it says that doesn't excuse the15 fact that you maintained the 52(c) claim, the one at16 issue here, even after both the master ­­ special master17 and your expert had said a particular claim wasn't18 sustainable. And it continued with a long example of19 behavior ­­ examples, multiple ones, that it found20 unreasonable, having nothing to do with the ultimate21 reasonableness of your last argument before the22 appellate court.23 So, again I ask the question: Why should24 this objective reasonableness be considered a pure25 question of law? Because it's not about right or wrong38￼1 and legal answer; it's about behavior during litigation.2 MR. DUNNER: Your Honor, there are ­­ there3 are two facets to the answer I would give to that4 question.5 One is that all of the points you made about6 what the district court found were not issues on appeal.7 The district court found lots of things, but the four8 issues that went up on appeal did not deal with all the9 facts you're talking about. They dealt with legal10 issues.11 There was no prefiling investigation issue.12 The Federal Circuit expressly found that, in a footnote13 in its opinion, there was no prefiling investigation14 issue in the final decision on appeal. Because the15 district court made multiple decisions. One was a16 Rule 11 decision in which he didn't provide a safe17 harbor for anybody, and we went in and we asked them to18 reconsider it, and he changed his opinion and dropped19 everything against the attorneys.20 The ­­ what went up to the court were four21 issues, and they were four legal issues. And all I'm22 saying is that ­­ that Scott v. ­­ v. Harris, and23 Justice Souter, in a concurring opinion in the PRE24 case, said the same thing, that objective reasonableness25 is a legal issue, reviewed de novo, and if you want391 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425uniformity, if you want predictability, the best way toavoid chilling ­­ avoid chilling not only patentees butaccused infringers from being willing to go to court forfear that they may have to pay 30 or 20 or $10 million,and the accused infringer from defending against it, isto have predictability, to have uniformity indecision­making, which you get from having a singlecourt reviewing those cases.  And that single court isthe Federal Circuit.      And I ­­ I submit that those are the twoanswers to your questions.  I hope I've satisfied you.If there are no further questions, I rest.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Katyal, you have nine minutes remaining.     REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL        ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERMR. KATYAL: Thank you.      I ­­ I'd like to pick up on JusticeSotomayor's question about the facts of this case,because I think what you heard from Mr. Dunnerilluminates our position on why the Federal Circuit's denovo standard is so problematic.      We warned, of course, that the de novostandard would become a magnet for litigation andencourage 285 losers to roll the dice, hoping that they40￼￼1 can repackage a factual dispute as a legal one in the2 court of appeals. And Pierce and Cooter warn against3 that and say that's a waste of resources as, Justice4 Breyer, you're picking up on.5 And, Justice Sotomayor, they say, you've6 already had a merits determination, as their one here.7 This case proves that. You heard Mr. Dunner8 say, quote, There were no factual issues in this case,9 and he talks about the Trigon ruling from the Eastern10 District of Virginia. As the district court here found,11 Petition Appendix 63A, Trigon was irrelevant because the12 question was infringement, not claim construction. And13 that was why sanctions were imposed. And if there's any14 doubt, here's what Allcare's own lawyer told the Federal15 Circuit in 2009. These are his opening words, quote:16 Summary judgment was granted at the district court in17 this case for two reasons. First, it was held there was18 a lack of evidence from which a reasonable finder of19 fact could determine the step of 52(c); and secondly,20 the district court held even if there was evidence that21 step 52(c) was performed, there was insufficient22 evidence of direction or control.23 Question from the Court: This really seems24 like it's a claim construction issue for us as to the25 meaning of this claim.41￼1 Answer from Allcare's lawyer: I would2 disagree that claim construction ought to be revisited3 at this level. In 1999, this court expressly stated it4 was inappropriate to sua sponte revisit it.5 Now, I'm sorry to belabor the facts here,6 but I think they illustrate the wisdom of Justice7 Scalia's opinion in Pierce, as followed by Cooter and8 Koon, which is clever lawyers can always make arguments9 on appeal, make them look ­­ make them look legal when10 they were factual. This case is example A of that.11 Now, my friend on the other side has said12 that ­­ that there wasn't history from 1946 to 1952. We13 encourage the Court to look to the ­­ to the cases cited14 at pages 11 to 13 of our brief, and in particular to15 look at Orrison v. Hoffberger, a Fourth Circuit case,16 which says that in evaluating whether there's, quote, no17 reasonable ground for the prosecution of a motion, the18 court says it, quote, cannot be said there was abuse of19 discretion.20 In many of these cases, they refer to the21 Abuse of discretion standard. And, of course,22 Mr. Dunner is right, that if it's a pure issue of law,23 that is something as to which there isn't deference.24 But when the question looks, as it does here, as it does25 in 285 cases about objective baselessness, whether a42￼1 litigating position was reasonable after the fact in2 collateral attorney fee litigation, this Court has3 always said in all of these cases that4 abuse­of­discretion deferential review is appropriate.5 Now, Justice Alito, you had referred to the6 size of the award here, and to be sure, it is different7 than Pierce. It's not different, of course, than Cooter8 because in Cooter we're talking about Rule 11 sanctions9 which can devastate an attorney's livelihood. And10 nonetheless, the Court in Cooter said they would11 apply ­­ apply deferential abuse of discretion review12 there.13 I think the best answer to that is Koon14 itself. In Koon, the stakes were really high, jail15 time, and what the Court said is defer to the district16 court because the district court has the best17 perspective, the kind of bird's eye view, a front seat18 on litigation.19 And that's why this case is different, than20 for example, Scott v. Harris or, Justice Alito, the21 qualified immunity cases. Because in both of those,22 those questions involved things as to which the district23 court doesn't have a courtside or ringside, whatever24 term we want to use, seat. They are not present. They25 are not there at the scene of the crime. They are not431 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425there when law enforcement is conducting whateveroperation or something like that.      Scott v. Harris, same thing, it's not aqualified immunity case; it's a summary judgment case.And the words, as our brief points out at page 24, say,If there is no factual dispute, then you evaluate it onthe law.  We ­­ we agree with that.      The question is here, where there arefactual disputes, as there are in all objectivebaselessness cases, what is the appropriate standard.This Court's answered it several times in Pierce,Cooter, and Koon, unitary abuse of discretion review.If there are no further questions.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
