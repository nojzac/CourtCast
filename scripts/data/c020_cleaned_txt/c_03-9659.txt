WAXMAN                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Stevens, and may it pleasethe Court:          In Hernandez v. New York, this Court explainedthat there are exceptional cases in which the totality ofevidence surrounding jury selection is so strong that afinding of no discrimination is simply too incredible tobe accepted by this Court.  This is that exceptional case,a case in which even on collateral review, the sheerweight of the mutually reinforcing evidence rendersobjectively unreasonable the State court's conclusion thatrace did not motivate even one of the prosecution'speremptory strikes.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Do we have to find that thestrike of at least one African American prospective jurorwas race-based for you to prevail?          MR. WAXMAN:  I believe so.  You have to find,Justice O'Connor, that race was the but-for factor or thetipping factor, not the only factor, but the but-for31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 factor for at least one to come within the four corners of2 Batson.3 Now, I could argue I think, if I needed to in4 this case, that the jury shuffle evidence alone, which is5 an unexplained, blatantly race-based means of racially6 excluding jurors from the venire, comes within Batson, the7 Batson proscription itself, or I could argue that case8 too.9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Were there any -- were there10 any State decisions, or Federal court decisions for that11 matter, justifying the shuffle on the grounds of -- I12 don't know -- professional class versus working class or13 something like that?14 MR. WAXMAN: The State has in its brief in this15 case, on this trip to the Court -- the State has cited the16 Court to one other case in which the Court of Criminal17 Appeals acknowledged the State's justification in that18 case, that it shuffled because there was a member of the19 probation office in the front row that they didn't want to20 embarrass and that jurors in the front had tended more to21 have ties than jurors in the back. That is -- that was22 never claimed in this case. We have, from the very --23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Were there -- were there any24 State court cases said that -- or even in that case you're25 referring to -- that the shuffle usually is race-based?41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. WAXMAN: You know, I can't -- the case is2 called Ladd v. State. There is -- there's some -- now3 some reasonably substantial Law Review commentary in the4 State of Texas. I cited the Court to -- to one in the5 Houston Law Review or the Houston Bar Review when I was6 here last time, and there has since been one in the St.7 Mary's Law Review that says this is a procedure that is8 used to discriminate on the basis of visual preference.9 And what's particularly interesting about it in10 this case is there was a contemporaneous objection in week11 2 and week 3 and week 4 that the State was doing this12 based on race, and the State offered no defense at the13 time. It offered no defense in the subsequent Batson14 hearing. It had no explanation before the magistrate, the15 district judge, the Fifth Circuit, in this Court or below,16 and now in this Court this time it says, well, there's17 this other case in which the reason given was that we18 didn't want to embarrass the probation officer and we19 didn't -- and we had people who had ties in the front row.20 There is no evidence whatsoever in the record that would21 justify those excuses here.22 And the evidence in the -- the only evidence in23 the record that seems to me compels the conclusion that24 this was done for the deliberate purpose of minimizing the25 number of African Americans on the jury. And it was done51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 by prosecutors, each of whom -- there were two prosecutors2 in this case, each of whom was found to have violated3 Batson in criminal -- other criminal trials4 contemporaneous with this one. And --5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the6 Circuit's answer to the jury shuffle7 defense shuffled more times, as I --8 MR. WAXMAN: The Fifth --9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- as I-- and the Fifthwas, well, therecall.10 MR. WAXMAN: The -- the Fifth Circuit said that11 we -- that they shuffled twice and we shuffled five times.12 Now, that is both factually wrong and legally irrelevant.13 They shuffled three times and they tried to shuffle a four14 times -- a fourth time because, the Court will perhaps15 recall -- this was discussed in the Court's last opinion16 -- because they waived in the fourth week. The defense17 shuffled -- the defense then shuffled and they tried to18 come in and back -- back and shuffle again when a number19 of African Americans were advanced in the order.20 There -- under this Court's Batson21 jurisprudence, the proscription against using peremptory22 strikes for a racial purpose or a gender-based purpose is23 proscribed to the defense, as well as the prosecution, but24 there -- the one doesn't excuse the other, and there has25 never been a claim, nor is there a factual predicate laid61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 in this case for a claim, that Mr. Miller-El's trial2 lawyers were doing the same. Even if it were true, it3 would not justify what they did.4 Now --5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If -- if we find or if there6 is a finding that the -- that the attempted shuffle on7 this fifth try was race-based, does that win your case,8 even though the shuffle didn't take place?9MR. WAXMAN:  Well, it was the --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, does it show theanimus so that it carries through the whole1011 necessary12 case?1314 we -- we've argued that the shuffle, just like the race15 coding of the cards in the pre-Batson era, the disparate16 questioning on minimum punishment and the graphic script,17 all reinforce what we think the record shows with respect18 to each of the six peremptory strikes that we challenge19 But if we didn't have that, Justice Kennedy, I20 would be here arguing that if I could show a single strike21 that was made for the purpose of eliminating African22 Americans from being considered for jury service, that23 that ought to come within this Court's proscription of24 Batson. Now, we haven't made that freestanding claim25 because I don't think we need that freestanding claim.71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-MR. WAXMAN:  I think, if I needed to -- I mean,￼1 The jury shuffle is a practice that exists only2 in the State of Texas and, to my understanding, has ever3 existed only in the State of Texas. So it's a -- it's a4 very peculiar phenomenon, but I think I could make the5 argument that, look, even if there weren't any of these6 six -- let's say they shuffled it so successfully that no7 African Americans came up. There simply were no African8 Americans out of the 108 who were questioned. It seems to9 me that that in and of itself would violate at least a10 generous reading of Batson.11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Waxman, we really have to12 examine your -- you know, your allegations, I suppose, one13 at a time. It makes it a very complicated case.14 The -- the State's response to -- to your15 argument that two of -- of the State's attorneys involved16 in this case had been found to have made racially based17 strikes in the past -- the State's response to that is18 that that was not part of the evidence presented in State19 court, and therefore, it -- it is not a proper20 consideration in reviewing the State court decision. What21 -- what is your response to that?22 MR. WAXMAN: I think that's wrong. I think it's23 wrong, first of all, because those two cases had been24 decided by the Court of Criminal Appeals at the time it25 considered the Batson claim in this case.81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Was it brought to the attentionof the court?          MR. WAXMAN:  I -- I am not sure.  I don't havethe -- neither the transcript nor the briefs are availablefor that argument.  But it's -- the court -- they arejudicial decisions of that court.  The Court can takejudicial notice of them and they are evidence.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, my.  You mean anything outthere that -- that a court could take judicial notice ofcan be -- can be charged to the court?  My goodness, no.I think it was the burden of the -- of the defendantchallenging the -- the strikes to bring -- bring that tothe attention of the court.  My goodness.          MR. WAXMAN:  Even -- I understand your argument.I can't tell you for sure -- and I don't believe anybodycan -- whether those cases were or weren't argued beforethe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals because myunderstanding is -- I don't -- I have not seen the briefsthat were filed in the Batson appeal, and I don't have thetranscript of the argument.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Were -- were both of the casescases of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals?          MR. WAXMAN:  Yes, yes.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Decided by the court -- theTexas Court of Criminal Appeals.91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. WAXMAN: Yes. The -- the very same court.2 And in any event --3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, now, Nelson -- there's4 Macaluso?                                              Nelson.  Nelson                                              this case, was1011 after the 1213 chickenpox, so the jury was -- the -- the voir dire took14 place. Mr. Macaluso and Mr. Nelson alternated the voir15 dire examination in the case, and those were the two16 prosecutors, Mr. Macaluso in the other Miller-El -- in the17 Chambers case and Mr. Nelson in Mrs. Miller-El's case.18 And interestingly, what the Texas Court of19 Criminal Appeals said with respect to Mr. Macaluso in the20 Chambers case is not only that he removed five out of five21 African Americans for reasons that violate Batson, but the22 Texas Court of Criminal Appeals also noted that he was23 using the same minimum punishment ploy that he used in24 this case in order to disqualify African American jurors.25 He -- the court actually goes and says, you know, with101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-5 MR. WAXMAN: Macaluso.6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Macaluso and7 wasn't involved in the jury selection in8 he? He came in --9MR. WAXMAN:  He certainly was.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I thought hejury had been selected.MR. WAXMAN:  No.  That was Mr.came in after --Kinne had the￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425three of these people, the State tried to disqualify themby asking them an open-ended question about what theythought the minimum punishment should be even thoughthat's usually what the defense is concerned about.Precisely what happened in this case.          Now, I'm not suggesting, Justice Scalia, thatour case depends upon the -- this 404(b) evidence or not,and I think it's quite --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, that's the problem.We've got to go through each one of them one by one.          MR. WAXMAN:  Well, I --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And -- and I'm -- you know, Idon't remember the names of people involved in -- in priorcases in this Court.  I -- I -- you know, if we said --          MR. WAXMAN:  Justice --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- you had this same officerbefore you, my goodness, I -- I wouldn't remember it.          MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Scalia, a -- first of all,these -- each of these cases was tried within months ofMr. Miller-El's case, and a finding by a -- the State'shighest court that a prosecutor has engaged inintentional, deliberate, race discrimination in theselection of a jury I respectfully submit -- I certainlyhope is not the kind of everyday finding that is easilyforgotten.111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          But in any event, you -- yes.  You have to gothrough all of the evidence in the case, and what theevidence in the case shows is that, first of all, as thisCourt observed the last time it was here, the State'sproper race-neutral rationales for striking AfricanAmerican jurors pertains just as well to white jurors whowere not challenged and who did serve.          It's -- you also have to look at the race-codingof the cards, race-coding that was done by prosecutorswhom this Court observed last time were trained in anoffice culture suffused with bias against AfricanAmericans in jury selection.          And you also have to look at, with respect, theremarkable disparity in the way in which African Americanand white venire members were questioned, both withrespect to minimum punishment --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I --          MR. WAXMAN:  -- and with respect to the graphicscript.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask on the minimumpunishment ploy?  Did that ever work in this case or didany of -- of the trial judges ever grant a -- a challengefor cause on the basis of the use of the minimumpunishment ploy?MR. WAXMAN: Well, I can't speak to other cases. 121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          But what's truly remarkable about this case -- Imean, there are many things that are truly remarkableabout this case -- the State not only used this minimumpunishment ploy with 90 -- 7 out of 8 of the AfricanAmericans, as opposed to only 2 out of 36 of the whites,but it actually tried to remove 2 of the African Americansin this case:  Rand and Kennedy.  It submitted them forcause based on their answers to those questions.  And theninterestingly, when that was denied and the State had tojustify its -- to provide its race-neutral reasons forstriking them, it didn't even mention it.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Their response --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But you -- you haven't reallyanswered my question yet.          MR. WAXMAN:  Oh, I'm sorry.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Does any -- did any Texastrial judge, to your knowledge, ever fall for this ploy,ever grant him a -- a challenge for cause based on answersto the minimum punishment harangue?          MR. WAXMAN:  I -- I would defer to Ms. Bunnabout that because I don't know about other cases, but --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  I didn't see any in this case.          MR. WAXMAN:  Well, what happened in this casewas there was an effort to rehabilitate.  The trial judgeactually became quite energetic in trying to explain to131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 the juror that, well, it's 5 years and you're not saying2 that you couldn't possibly consider 5 years. But -- and3 that was true with respect to white jurors as well as4 African American jurors.5 JUSTICE SCALIA: The respondent's reply to this6 -- this minimal punishment argument is that in fact the --7 the two white prospective jurors who had -- who had8 expressed antagonism towards the death penalty were9 subjected to the same questioning, and that the seven out10 of eight black prospective jurors were seven who had11 expressed antagonism to the death penalty. Now, is that12 not true?13 MR. WAXMAN: I think that if I -- I believe that14 with respect to minimum punishment, as opposed to the15 graphic script, what the State is saying is last time we16 said there were 10 whites and 10 blacks who expressed17 hesitation. And this Court observed that, well, yes, but18 only two of the whites got it. Now, they filed a brief19 that says, well, the other eight were all either struck20 for cause21 least two2223 below, we24 hesitation about the death penalty, and they have still25 not accounted for them. Number one.or by consent.  Now, that's -- that fails for atreasons.One, they identified 10.  In this Court andidentified 19 jurors who absolutely expressed141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 Number two, with respect to the eight who they2 have accounted for in their brief, the fact that at the3 very end of voir dire, they were struck for cause, or4 there was an agreement at the end of voir dire to remove5 them hardly provides a reason not to give the minimum6 punishment ploy to jurors who fit the categorization that7 the State has described.8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we have to go through9 each one of them and see if the degree of hostility10 expressed by the white jurors was the same as the degree11 of hostility expressed by the black jurors. And in fact,12 the degree of hostility by the black jurors was quite13 high.14 1516 in it. I17 involving18 another one said, well, right now maybe I do, but who19 knows later?20 MR. WAXMAN: I --21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, if -- if there happens to22 be a different attitude towards the death penalty among23 the black jurors than there is among the white jurors, you24 cannot fault the -- the attorneys for -- for striking more25 of the black jurors.151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-MR. WAXMAN:  Well --JUSTICE SCALIA:  One said I really don't believesupport it only in extreme cases, such as thosemass killings or mutilation.  And another one --￼1 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Scalia, in the context of2 all of this other evidence, which is the context in which3 you need to weigh it and determine whether we have4 satisfied the stringent standard for review that applies,5 I respectfully submit that if you go through the -- the6 voir dire questioning of Mr. Fields and Mr. Warren and Mr.7 Rand and the others that we've mentioned, and compare it,8 even leaving aside all of the other evidence,9 contemporaneous evidence, of race discrimination in the10 jury selection in this case, I think you will have to come11 to the12 cases.1314 our --15 is a man whom -- I mean, forget the -- the State on its16 questionnaire at the time, on page 14 of the joint17 lodging, wrote, quote, no reservations against the death18 penalty.19 Mr. Rand, who we've compared and -- and your20 concurring opinion, Justice Scalia, the last time it was21 here said, well, yes, Rand and Mazza are very close, but22 it's a high burden you have to -- you have to overcome23 here. It's a burden we can overcome here not only because24 of all of this other evidence, but because of what the25 State wrote on the questionnaire when Mr. Rand was being 161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-conclusion that race was a but-for factor in these   In Mr. Fields -- we've -- we've mentioned him inwe've described him at length in our brief.  This￼1 examined, page 30 of the joint lodging. This is the2 State's notes, Quote: "could be enforced depending on the3 circumstances -- Murder/robbery, type of offense -- Think4 proper for death penalty -- Yes, I can serve." This is a --5 this is a6 would set7 8venireman who said that if he were Governor, hethe minimum punishment for murder at 99 years.Mr. Fields was --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, now, wait.  He also said9 -- when asked whether he could vote to impose the death10 penalty, he said, right now I say I can, but tomorrow I11 might not.12 MR. WAXMAN: He said --13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think that's a strong --14 MR. WAXMAN: I'm -- I'm not sure whether that's15 Rand or Warren, but I'm saying that if you compare Mr.16 Rand who thought that the death penalty might be17 applicable for all murder, who repeatedly -- in our reply18 brief, we include the -- the recitation -- repeatedly said19 over and over and over and over again that he would answer20 the three questions yes, depending on the evidence,21 without any regard for his view about the death penalty,22 who testified that -- I'm not saying that this is somebody23 whom, if this were a case in which there was nothing in24 this -- we were just before this Court saying there's Rand25 and Mazza or there's Rand and Hearn and that's enough to171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425satisfy our burden, I would be up here arguing it but itwould be a much more difficult argument.  Here, those --that comparison has to be taken in the context of not one,not two, but six jurors who are similarly situated whowere treated to this questioning by people who engaged inracially disparate shuffling, racially disparatequestioning --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, that's the question.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  We have to deal with each ofthe six one by one, and -- and they have arguments withrespect to each of them.  I don't care what Rand said.Those things that you said sounded very good.  But if hefinishes it off by saying, right now I say that, buttomorrow I might not --          MR. WAXMAN:  Well, I --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that doesn't strike me --and that -- that's what respondent says Rand said, not --not one of the other ones.  And you have to go down eachof the other six, and they have a response for each one.          MR. WAXMAN:  And if this --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, and -- and, you know, abuckshot attack on it has to be examined pellet by pellet.          MR. WAXMAN:  Justice -- let me -- let me switchyour metaphor a little.  The problem with the State'sapproach to this case -- and it was the problem that -- of181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 the Fifth Circuit's analysis -- is it is pointillistic.2 It is an analysis. It's like walking up close to a Seurat3 painting and looking at each dot and saying, well, it's4 red, but that might not necessarily be the handbag. Yes,5 you have -- I mean, he had to paint with the dots, but as6 a reviewing court, you need to step back and look at this7 and ask yourself, with respect to, for example, Mr.8 Fields, who said not only would he have no hesitation9 about putting the death penalty in place, but he actually10 testified that he thought that in capital cases, the State11 was God's embodiment on earth.12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose that you have 10 white13 jurors and 10 black jurors. The 10 black jurors are all14 questioned much more extensively by the State, and in each15 of those cases, there is a plausible reason for excusing.16 A relative was -- served time and so forth. Violation?17 MR. WAXMAN: All in and of itself? I would say18 definitely not. I -- I mean --19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So -- so then you admit that20 you have to go one by one. I had thought you would --21 would have said that if the black jurors are questioned in22 a different way and more intensively, that alone suffices23 even though the questioning in each case disclosed the24 basis, plausible, non-racial basis --25 MR. WAXMAN: No, I would give --191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- for excusing them.2 MR. WAXMAN: I would give you a different3 answer, Justice Kennedy, if it's the jury shuffle because4 there's no plausible explanation available on the evidence5 in this case. If there is a plausible explanation for6 disparate questioning, which there is not in the7 statistics in this case, I wouldn't be arguing that that8 in and of itself, leaving aside individual, you know,9 side-by-side juror comparisons, would suffice.10 But here, we have, in addition to the disparate11 questioning that is not susceptible to a race-neutral12 explanation -- we have things like the prosecutor's own13 notations in the -- in the questionnaires.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, you were dealing15 with Fields, and the answer in Fields' case that the16 prosecution gives is he had a strong feeling about17 rehabilitation, and so he was -- he thought that everyone18 could be rehabilitated -- rehabilitated. So that shows he --19 he wasn't like others who didn't entertain those doubts20 about rehabilitation.21 MR. WAXMAN: Yes, Justice -- Justice Ginsburg.22 He -- he expressed an opinion that he thought that people23 could be rehabilitated, not as strong as those opinions by24 juror -- white25 But in Fields'1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400Juror Hearn and white Juror Duke who sat.case, he was absolutely unequivocal --  I'm20 Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 -- I'm referring the Court to page 185 of the joint2 appendix -- absolutely unequivocal that the ability or3 propensity for rehabilitation would not affect his4 willingness to -- to put in the death penalty. I believe5 in the dissenting and concurring opinions in this case6 last time with respect to Mr. Fields, it was pointed out7 that he was a supporter of the death penalty who could put8 in the death penalty.9 And what's interesting about Fields is if you10 look at the transcript pages where the prosecutor11 justifies the strike, on page 197 of the joint appendix,12 the prosecutor says, well, he was -- he -- he -- I -- he13 -- he said something about rehabilitation, and it goes on.14 And then two pages later -- they have a discussion about15 something -- a discussion about which questionnaires will16 or won't go into evidence. Two pages later, Mr. Nelson17 comes in and says, oh, yes, and he also had a brother who18 had had some involvement with law enforcement. Well, to19 say that that's an afterthought is really saying20 something. He wasn't questioned about it, as -- as21 neither were -- by the State, as neither were any of the22 four white jurors who sat who had family members who had23 been arrested24 questions.25 May1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400or prosecuted.

WAXMAN:  Oh, absolutely.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Where do we find thatevidence?          MR. WAXMAN:  The -- the juror cards are in thejoint lodging beginning on page 82, and every single cardlists the gender and race, even the cards as to jurorsthat they never questioned.  So we know that these werenotations that were placed on the cards by the prosecutorsat the time the venires were called.          And the interesting thing about these is it'snot just race and gender, it's were they fat, did theyhave a beard, did they have a mustache.  If you map upwhat's noted on these cards with the Sparling trainingmanual that said don't take minorities, don't take Jews,don't take women, don't take fat people -- people who havemustaches and beards don't make good jurors.  It's --these prosecutors were not only trained by that manual,they learned their lesson very well.          May --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  All of those things are okay,right, except          MR.the race one.WAXMAN:  Well, I --22 Washington, DC 20005 1-1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, maybe their right aboutbeards and mustaches.          MR. WAXMAN:  We know that --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know.  If they'reright, good for them.  Right?  You -- you -- they ought tostrike them.          MR. WAXMAN:  I -- we're not here -- if this weregender or race, this Court has said that can't be the but-for reason.  Mustaches, overweight, you know, go with God.          May I -- may I reserve the balance of my time?          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes, by all means.          MR. WAXMAN:  Thank you.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Ms. Bunn.                ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENA BUNN                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MS. BUNN:  Justice Stevens, and may it pleasethe Court:          The big picture.  The majority of AfricanAmericans summoned for jury duty in this case were eitheropposed to the death penalty generally or unwilling toimpose it, while the majority of white jurors had noqualms about the death penalty.  Striking prospectivejurors based on their case-related views which, after thefact, correlate with race is not unconstitutional.Essentially, though Miller-El has presented this 231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 case as one of disparate treatment, it is actually one of2 disparate impact. I will discuss first --3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would -- would the statement4 that you gave -- let's assume there was a -- a working5 premise that blacks were more -- were less inclined to6 impose the death penalty. Would that alone justify more7 intensive questioning of every black juror?8 MS. BUNN: No, Your Honor, it would not. And9 the record in this case actually does not support that10 that -- does not support a proposition that black jurors11 were questioned differently. Most significantly, the12 minimum -- the questioning on the graphic script. Of the13 six challenged jurors in this case, only two received the14 graphic -- graphic script at the outset of their voir15 dire, Carrol Boggess and -- and Wayman Kennedy, both of16 whom had answered the questions in their juror17 questionnaire indicating ambiguity regarding their views18 on the death penalty regarding their support for the death19 penalty. This fact --20 JUSTICE BREYER: Now -- now, as I understand it,21 this case was here before. We all read this and we went22 through it, and as a result of that, I -- if I read the23 opinion -- not the dissent, but the majority opinion --24 and it might be in my interest if people followed dissents25 more, but I think the law is we follow the majority241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 opinion.2 So when I read the majority opinion, I read,3 number one, there was4 years earlier though,5 which said let's keep6 here's how you do it.7 Then you had jury shuffling, which were two8 instances. In one of them, there are like 40 people. In9 my mind, you know, we have rows. In row 1 there are four10 black jurors and six white; row 2, three black and seven11 white; row 3, two black and in the last row one black, and12 the prosecution says, hey, let's shuffle it. All right?13 And the other time he did it, the only other time -- it14 wasn't quite that bad -- the same idea.15 Then the third thing that comes up is you find16 instances here -- not everyone, absolutely right -- but17 instances where black people who seemed really for the18 death penalty, say, like Mr. Fields manages to get knocked19 off, but Mrs. Mazza who seems quite uncertain is kept on.20 And then we have this disparate questioning that21 you're about to mention where it just turns out that22 almost every black is given this really -- you know, bring23 them in a gurney, put -- put -- you know, real graphic24 description of the death penalty, and white people who25 also expressed hesitation aren't. Okay?251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-history in this county, at least 7where they actually had a bookletall the African Americans out,￼1 So on the basis of that, the majority writes2 there is, indeed, a strong suspicion here that this was3 discrimination. So I want to ask you -- and if I were to4 write something like that -- I didn't write the words, but5 I would mean, well, I think that's what it is unless6 there's something later on that comes out to the contrary.7 So I'm asking you what was to the contrary. What came out8 in this Fifth Circuit that we didn't have in front of us9 the last time?10 MS. BUNN: Your Honor, the first time before11 this Court, the issue was whether, based on a threshold12 examination of the record --13 JUSTICE BREYER: I know that was the issue, but14 I'm saying if I read the opinion to say -- now, maybe15 you'll tell me I shouldn't. We should just go back and16 redo what we did. But I'm reading the opinion to say,17 well, unless something changes here, this is bad. It's18 discriminatory. Now, you can tell me, one, I'm wrong to19 read the opinion that way. I got that argument. But I20 want to be sure that that's what's in front of me. So I21 want to know is there something different in the Fifth22 Circuit that wasn't here the first time.23 MS. BUNN: Your Honor, I believe the most -- the24 most important difference in the review of this Court the25 last time and the review of this -- of the Court this time261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425is that the Court did take a big-picture look at all ofthe pieces of evidence, but at this point, as the court ofappeals did and as this -- as this Court must do now, itmust go, as Justice Scalia mentioned, juror by juror, thejurors who were challenged.  Miller-El --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  We only speak to the issuesbefore us, don't we?  And the issue before us last timewas not the issue before us here.  It was simply whetherthere was enough evidence to require the issuance of aCOA.  Isn't that right?          MS. BUNN:  That is correct.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Right.  That's why I asked.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that's a good dealdifferent.  Whatever the majority might have saidother issues, it certainly was not binding on theappeals, was it?aboutcourt of          MS. BUNN:  No, Your Honor.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  I hate to say this --          JUSTICE BREYER:  So that must be a differentquestion --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- to my colleagues, but I'mvery much interested in hearing what Ms. Bunn has to say.          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- because that wasn't the oneI asked.  The one I wanted answered was the question of Iunderstand that point, which we could say it was 271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 definitely not definite the last time. I'm asking you --2 it's a serious question -- as whether there was something3 new or different that came up when the Fifth Circuit wrote4 this. Now, I gathered from your answer, it might be yes,5 and if the answer is yes, I want you to say what it is6 because I'm interested.7 MS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor, there was additional8 analysis, particularly of the six jurors Miller-El claims9 were discriminated against, which this Court did not10 review the first -- in its first opinion specifically.11 And a review of Miller-El's purposeful discrimination12 claim must focus on these six jurors.13 And given the -- the views expressed by these14 six veniremen, it is no surprise that prosecutors struck15 them. Each venire member peremptorily struck by the State16 had voiced views unfavorable to the State but were not17 subject to a challenge for cause. These reasons are race-18 neutral, case-related, and supported by the record, in19 fact, supported by the very words that the jurors uttered.20 Carrol Boggess indicated that her beliefs -- on21 the questionnaire indicated her beliefs would impair --22 would impair her ability to impose the death penalty as a23 juror. She referred to her -- an execution as a murder24 during her voir dire and other comments evincing hesitance25 regarding her ability to impose the death penalty.281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask you this?  There aretwo questions just generally.  One, I'm curious about theanswer to my question to -- to Mr. Waxman.  Did theminimum punishment ploy ever work?  Did it ever succeed ingetting a challenge for cause granted?          MS. BUNN:  Your Honor, there are other casesthat I'm aware of in Texas where the State did challengejurors on this basis.  Whether there was any questioning-- any difference in questioning, I don't know.  It's notapparent from the records.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But have -- and the challengeswere granted?          MS. BUNN:  Yes, Your Honor.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Of course, none of them weregranted in this case.  Is that right?          MS. BUNN:  That's correct.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  So it -- it was true that thiswas -- was a ploy adopted for the purpose of trying tomake it unnecessary to use a -- a peremptory challenge.          MS. BUNN:  Yes, Your Honor.  Yes, Your Honor,that is right.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  And do you defend thatpractice?          MS.recognized --BUNN:  Yes, if it is a legitimate tactic,as an attorney, if there is a -- some means29 Washington, DC 20005 1-1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that is available to use so that you do not have to use aperemptory strike --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  If you -- if you can get thevenire person to make a mistake in his answer, then you --you get -- get him off easy.          MS. BUNN:  That's what -- that's what voir direis all about, and the defense counsel did it in manyoccasions --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And suppose -- suppose youhave a system in which that attempt to find cause isapplied much more rigorously to black prospective jurorsthan to white prospective jurors.          MS. BUNN:  If it's not -- the record shows thatthere's no difference in the views expressed by thejurors, yes.  In this case that --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No.  The -- the white jurorsdon't express the views at all because they're notquestioned intensively, so you don't know if there's causefor them or not.  But the black jurors are questionedintensively, and you find cause or -- or a -- a race-neutral reason for the dismissal.  Is there a Batsonviolation in -- in that instance?          MS. BUNN:  No, Your Honor, not a Batsonviolation.  Now, whether it's evidence of -- of --JUSTICE KENNEDY: So -- so you say that in any 301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425case you can question black jurors more intensively thanwhite jurors and still succeed in excusing them if theresult of that voir dire shows some race-neutral basis.          MS. BUNN:  Your Honor, if the questioning itselfresults in the views that are the basis of the strike,that would present a problem.  That is not the case here,however, where the -- the disparate questioning on minimumsentencing, for instance, was based on the views that wereexpressed.manual ofall blackwhite jurors.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose -- suppose you have a-- from the district attorney's office that saysjurors shall be questioned more intensively than          MS. BUNN:  That would certainly be evidence thatblack jurors and white jurors were treated differently.          JUSTICE SCALIA:what happened here.          MS. BUNN:  Yes.          JUSTICE SCALIA:questionnaires expressingYou're saying that that is not                           It was on the basis of the                          hostility to the death penaltythat more intensive questioning was given to some peoplethan to others, and that the mere fact that a largernumber of those people was black is not a violation.          MS. BUNN:  Yes, Your Honor, that is correct.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  So the hypothetical, assuming311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that you -- you just have blacks and whites with no2 difference in -- in what they -- in what they had said on3 the questionnaire, is a hypothetical that you say does not4 exist in this case.5 MS. BUNN: Yes.6 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but you don't know what7 the questionnaire showed as to most of the white venire8 persons, do you?9 MS. BUNN: No, we don't, Your Honor.10 JUSTICE STEVENS: And how many white venire11 persons were there?12 MS. BUNN: 48.13 JUSTICE STEVENS: 48. And how many were given14 this questioning? Two?15 16 17 1819 all 46 of20 the death212223 other 46, 2425MS. BUNN:  On the graphic script?JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes.MS. BUNN:  Two -- three.JUSTICE STEVENS:  And so are we to assume thatthe other white venire persons were as tough onpenalty as you'd like everybody to be?MS. BUNN:  No, Your Honor.JUSTICE STEVENS:  We just don't know about thosedo we?MS. BUNN:  We do not know.  We do not --JUSTICE STEVENS:  But is it not a reasonable321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 inference2 about the34 even though we do not know -- 5that some of them might have expressed doubtdeath penalty?MS. BUNN:  That is -- we do not know.  There --JUSTICE BREYER:  You don't know.  If you don't-- there's an excellent way to know.  Somebodyknow, Mr. Prosecutor, you gave this terribly6 know, you7 says, you8 graphic script to all the black people and you really9 didn't give it to hardly any of the white people. Now,10 it's also possible -- possible -- that the reason he11 didn't was because from the answer to their12 questionnaires, which we've not seen, you didn't need to.13 That's possible. But if that were the case, wouldn't he14 have said to the judge, Judge, that's why I did it. I15 didn't ask them because I read the questionnaires.16 Wouldn't that be what you would do or any prosecutor would17 do if that were the reason?18 MS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor, I would.19 JUSTICE BREYER: And did the prosecutor ever do20 that here?21 MS. BUNN: No, but significantly in this case,22 the arguments regarding disparate questioning were never23 raised until Federal habeas corpus proceedings. They were24 not raised at trial when the jury questionnaires still25 existed.331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE BREYER:  Did the prosecutor not -- washe there?there whoMS. BUNN:  No, Your Honor.  He was not --JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  And did -- was anyonehad ever talked to the prosecutors?MS. BUNN:  The prosecutors were contacted duringthat period, but the questionnaires --          JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So could then --          MS. BUNN:  -- no longer existed at that point.          JUSTICE BREYER:  But couldn't you have asked theprosecutors if that was the reason?          MS. BUNN:  20 -- 15 years after a case istried --          JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, what are we supposed todo?  I mean, what you've done is say -- of course, I couldthink of reasons that could have been their reason, butunless there's some reason for thinking that was theirreason --          MS. BUNN:  Well, Your Honor, in this case, the-- the inmate Miller-El has the burden.  He had the burdenin the trial court.  He had the burden to prove purposefuldiscrimination, and he could have put -- he did put thequestionnaires of the 10 challenged jurors in the record.He did not --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, on -- on that point, 341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 this is not exactly like McDonnell Douglas, Burdine where2 you have some prima facie case, the person was equally3 qualified, but was of a different gender than the one that4 got the job, and then the -- you go back to square one.5 Here, the prima facie case is immensely powerful6 because of the culture of discrimination in the manuals7 and so forth, and that -- that, it seems to me, stays in8 this case.9 MS. BUNN: Your Honor, this evidence, however10 compelling a picture it draws of past injustice, simply11 cannot trump the State court's finding of no purposeful12 discrimination. It does not address --13 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, don't we at some point14 have to have some reason to believe that the evidence of15 past practices become irrelevant? And if we -- if that is16 so, do we have any such evidence here?17 MS. BUNN: There -- there was evidence in the18 Swain hearing, and that -- in fact, the cross examination19 by the prosecutors did indicate that practices that were20 in the past had been -- had been vitiated, at least closer21 to the time of trial. But regardless of that --22 JUSTICE SOUTER: These are the same two23 prosecutors who in other cases had been found, in effect,24 guilty of -- of racial discrimination and the same two25 prosecutors who were calling for the shuffle in these351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425cases.  Is it plausible to think that there had been thischange of heart?          MS. BUNN:  Even assuming the evidence, thehistorical evidence -- assuming its relevance, as theFifth Circuit did --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, I mean, I -- I amassuming it is relevant, and I am asking the question, isthere a reasonable basis to think that these particularindividuals, engaging in the practice that theydemonstrably engaged in, had had a change in heart in thiscase?          MS. BUNN:  Yes, Your Honor.  The record in thiscase indicates that -- for instance, with the use ofgraphic script questioning, the -- of the six -- again, ofthe six challenged jurors, four did not receive thegraphic script at the outset of voir dire.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Is that why they engaged in theshuffle twice --          MS. BUNN:  Your Honor --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- on -- on a record that showsthere were black jurors down front each time they engagedin it?          MS. BUNN:  The record shows that of 5 weeks ofvoir dire, the State requested shuffles three times.  Twoof those times, the defense counsel put on the record that361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 there were a greater number of African American jurors in2 the front of the panel. They --3 JUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and that evidence was4 not refuted. It was not denied, as I understand it.5 MS. BUNN: Your Honor, there was no response6 from the prosecutors. There was no objection made, no7 specific objection made as to -- as to the State's8 exercise of a jury shuffle. But in this case to ask this9 -- what -- what Miller-El is asking this Court is to10 assume that the only discernible trait that could have11 been the basis for the State's exercise of a jury shuffle12 is race, and that is not -- that is not the case.13 JUSTICE SOUTER: The -- I -- I don't think14 that's his argument at all. He is not arguing that there15 might not be other bases for making challenges or making16 peremptory strikes. What he is saying is those challenges17 exist for lots and lots of jurors. And what in fact there18 is is very strong circumstantial evidence that what tipped19 the prosecutors to make the peremptory challenges here --20 what he was referring to earlier in this argument as the21 but-for cause was racial. He's not saying nothing else22 could have been involved. He was saying race tipped it.23 And it's the circumstantial evidence, among other things,24 that indicates that race does.25 And that's the reason for my question. Is there371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 some reason to believe that there had been a change of2 heart on the issue of race so that his argument is3 unsound?4 MS. BUNN: Your Honor, again, Miller-El's claim5 of purposeful discrimination must focus on these six6 jurors, and in answer to your question, a review of these7 six jurors does show that these strikes were not based on8 race. This was not the tipping --9 JUSTICE BREYER: You think they're based, for10 example, on capital punishment. But now, let me give you11 two of them, and this is why -- this is actually why I get12 somewhat concerned about this.13 Here is the answer of the white woman who served14 on the jury about capital punishment. Could you put15 Miller-El to death? Mrs. Mazza: It's difficult. I've16 had 2 days to think about it, and given my religious17 upbringing, et cetera, going on for a few sentences, I18 think I could. She serves on the jury. Okay?19 Here's Mr. Fields who is black and whom they got20 off. What I think, according to the Old Testament, people21 were killed if they violated His law. In its extended22 service, the State represents Him. I feel the State is23 God's extended person. In other words, the State24 represents God in today's time. Therefore, if the State25 exacts death, that's what it should be. Okay?381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 That's the man they feel has the qualm, and the2 woman I told you who was white they feel has no qualm.3 Now, I look at that, and I say, you know, I4 mean, my goodness, it's pretty hard to see how you get5 yourself in that frame of mind.6 MS. BUNN: Your Honor, the -- that was not the7 prosecutor's argument at trial and it's -- it is not our8 position now that --9 JUSTICE BREYER: No. I know. They then said10 that oh, you see, Mr. Fields was -- is it a woman or a11 man? I'm not sure. Yes, he's a man I think. He -- he's12 kept off, the black man, because of his views on13 rehabilitation. So I looked up what those views were, and14 that consists of his saying -- my -- my interpretation --15 well, I think any person, if he really believes in God,16 really believes in God, could be rehabilitated. At which17 point the prosecutor says to him, well, suppose you came18 to the conclusion that Miller-El really was touched by19 God, could you put him to death? Answer: Yes. Why?20 Because, well, it seems to me my job here is to follow the21 law.22 That's the man whom they think they are -- they23 are kicking off because of his views of possibly not24 applying the death penalty, and the other woman, who is25 white, they keep on. Now, I think that's the whole story391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 there. There was also the brother who was a drug -- who2 was the drug -- you know, he had had drug convictions, but3 that's scarcely mentioned. So -- so I look at those two4 people and I think, gee, put that in context. My5 goodness.6 What -- what's your response to that?7 MS. BUNN: Your Honor, as to Juror Billy Jean8 Fields, he did not express qualms about the death penalty9 in general, but he did state that it was his belief that10 no one -- no one -- no matter their background or what11 they've done, is beyond rehabilitation. Everyone can be12 rehabilitated. And this was a view regarding13 rehabilitation that no one, white or black, had expressed.14 It was a unique view, and in this case where jurors are15 asked to -- to -- the question, is this person going to be16 a continuing threat to society, is -- is something that's17 going to go into their punishment inquiry. And if this18 person is one who the prosecutor believed could tend -- if19 there's a repentant criminal defendant on the stand who20 testifies, that they would tend to believe that person and21 answer the question no.22 And -- and again, this was not the only basis23 for the State's strike as well. The fact that his brother24 had been prosecuted in Dallas County numerous times, the25 same prosecuting authority, contemporaneous with the401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 trial, numerous occasions, had served time, and contrary2 to Miller-El's assertions, the State did question Mr.3 Fields on this issue during voir dire, and it was a basis4 for the strike. There --5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Bunn, before you finish,6 there -- there are two pieces of this I hope you can give7 me an answer to. The race-coding. Is there any neutral8 reason for that? And when was that stopped, if it was?9 MS. BUNN: I -- I don't -- I don't have any10 information. There's no information on -- in the record11 about exercising it in other cases, and I just -- I just12 don't know.13 But the first part of the question, there could14 -- as Mr. Waxman mentioned, there -- there were other15 visual cues noted on the cards. Attorneys, especially --16 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is it not a fair inference17 that each of the cues noted on the cards was something18 that the prosecutors thought relevant to whether or not to19 challenge the juror? And if so, is it not -- does -- is20 that not uncontradicted evidence that the race of the21 venire person was a factor in the decision?22 MS. BUNN: Not necessarily. I mean, there were23 other -- there was other --24 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, why else would it be25 noted?411111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MS. BUNN:  There was -- just to familiarize anattorney getting ready for voir dire of an extensivenumber of people --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is -- is there any --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Maybe the prosecutors didn'twant to come up with an all-white jury for fear it wouldbe challenged.          MS. BUNN:  That's certainly --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  That may be, but is it not --is it not clear that this is one of the factors that wasused to decide whether or not to exercise a challenge,just as the beard and the other things that are mentionedin the -- in the manual were?          MS. BUNN:  No, Your Honor.  The fact that it wasnoted on the race -- on the -- on the juror card does --does not necessarily indicate that.  Again, it could be acue forcues onmanual?a -- a litigant preparing for voir dire.  JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, were the -- were thethe card similar to the instructions in the          MS. BUNN:  There were some that could -- thatwould correlate, but there were others that aren't notedon the juror cards --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can you quantify thecorrelation or lack of correlation for me?421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MS. BUNN: The -- for instance, occupations were2 -- or addresses -- perhaps not occupations, but I know3 addresses were -- were noted. There could have been other4 things at that point that were not noted. There was a lot5 -- information available at that point, whether visual or6 from the juror information cards.7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I had asked you if they were8 still race- and gender-coded. You hadn't gotten to that9 part of the question. These cards were race-coded and for10 other things too. Right now in the11 prosecutors code cards -- cards for12 MS. BUNN: I do not know.13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The other question I had, are14 these two prosecutors the same ones who were involved in15 other cases where it was determined that they had used16 tactics that violated Batson? Were those cases17 contemporaneous with Miller-El's or were they earlier in18 time?19 MS. BUNN: The record indicates that Prosecutor20 Macaluso was involved in jury selection in the Chambers21 case, and22 late 198523 24that case was tried shortly -- I believe it waswhen Chambers was tried.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Wasn't that 2 months?MS. BUNN:  2 months?  This was March, so it25 would have been probably 4 or 5 months, within a year 431111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-State, do therace and gender?I do not --￼1 certainly.2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it -- is it unlawful to take3 sex into account in jury selection?45 certainly6 consisted78 as far as9 be particularly surprised if it were. A conscientiousMS. BUNN:  Yes.  Yes, Your Honor, it is.  That'snot alleged in this case.  The jury actuallyof seven women.But again, to -- the -- the race-coding issue --whether it's exercised now, I mean, I wouldn't10 litigant -- it's really necessary to keep track of the11 race of prospective jurors, as Justice Scalia noted, to be12 certain that you don't run afoul of Batson. But --1314 to weight 151617 notations18 they didn't have to worry about Batson there. But there19 does seem to be a correlation with the manual.20 JUSTICE STEVENS: And Batson hadn't been decided21 yet.22 MS. BUNN: Yes, that's true. I was referring to23 Justice Ginsburg's question about the -- the practice,24 whether it continues.25 But again, regarding its use in this case, I441111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-JUSTICE SOUTER:  Is -- is that true with respectand mustaches and things like that?MS. BUNN:  That -- that doesn't --JUSTICE SOUTER:  They were -- they were makingof things like that, as I understand it, and￼1 would -- I would say that it -- it's not -- does not2 necessarily lead to the conclusion that it was noted3 basically to treat African American venire members4 differently because the record actually --5 JUSTICE SOUTER: But I -- I don't -- I mean, I'd6 just like to go back to my question. I don't know why7 else? It's true if -- if all they noted, if they had been8 prescient and had said, you know, Swain is going to give9 way to Batson and we're going to note Batson issues, you'd10 have an argument. But they were noting a lot of non-11 Batson issues too, and the one common characteristic of12 the Batson issues and the non-Batson issues were they were13 all correlated to a manual that says keep these people off14 the jury. And -- and isn't that a sound train of15 reasoning that that's what they were trying to do?16 MS. BUNN: Your Honor, the -- the notations,17 though, correlate as well to simply visual cues that a18 litigant will use just simply to familiarize himself with19 the panel.20 JUSTICE SOUTER: The manual had said there are21 certain visual cues that indicate jurors you don't want on22 the jury. You don't want black jurors. You don't want23 women jurors. You don't want Jewish jurors. You don't24 want fat ones. You don't want bearded ones. And these25 are the things that they were noting. Isn't the451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 reasonable inference that that's what they were noting2 them for?3 MS. BUNN: Your Honor, there are other4 explainable reasons, there are other plausible reasons for5 noting those things. But even that aside, again, we must6 look at these six jurors and they all expressed views7 unfavorable to the State. And Miller-El has failed to8 identify a similarly situated white juror.910 said that11 line with12 that those two were closely comparable.13 MS. BUNN: Justice Ginsburg, they recognized, as14 Justice Scalia had in his concurring opinion, that that15 was basically as close as it got. But at most, Mazza16 acknowledged that the decision whether to impose a death17 sentence would be difficult, not an easy one, kind of18 hard, but she simultaneously stated that it was a decision19 that she believed that she could make. She never20 questioned her ability to assess a death sentence in an21 appropriate case. She merely acknowledged that it was a22 decision that she would not take lightly. She also had23 served on another criminal jury in the last couple of24 years, a jury which had returned a guilty verdict.25 In contrast, Rand explicitly questioned his461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the Fifth Circuitcomparing Rand's testimony -- that that was inMazza's.  The Fifth Circuit seems to recognize￼1 ability to assess a death sentence in any case. When2 asked whether he could impose the death penalty, he told3 prosecutors right now I say I can, but tomorrow I might4 not. He declined to describe himself as someone who5 believes in the death penalty and can serve as a jury --6 juror and assess the death penalty if warranted, stating7 that he was probably in between the first two categories8 described by the prosecutor.9 Notably, Mr. Waxman referred to the prosecutors'10 notes on the questionnaires. What he didn't mention was11 also noted on the -- by the State at -- at the joint12 lodging, page 30, is that Juror Rand had referred to the13 death penalty as a touchy subject and that he had14 described himself as a person falling somewhere in between15 the two categories described by the prosecutor, the first16 being someone who believes in the death penalty and can17 assess it, the second being someone who believes in the18 death penalty generally but cannot personally assess it as19 a juror. So the State did take note of the -- of the20 expressions of ambivalence by Rand during his voir dire.21 Juror Mazza, again, never expressed this level22 of ambivalence. These are not similarly situated jurors.23 And the same is true of Miller-El's attempted24 comparison of Rand and -- and Juror Sandra Hearn. She25 expressed hesitance on assessing the death penalty in a471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 very particular circumstance, the -- a first offense, and2 certainly this is not the case here. On the other hand,3 Rand had questioned his ability to assess a death penalty4 in any case and, against Hearn's State-friendly views, led5 to a defense challenge that was overruled. And the fact6 that the defense vehemently objected to her on direct7 appeal is further evidence that she's not similarly8 situated.9 Under Batson, Miller-El has the ultimate burden10 of proving purposeful discrimination. He has failed to11 satisfy that burden, and the State trial judge found that12 prosecutors in this case did not act with a discriminatory13 purpose. As this Court acknowledged in its earlier14 opinion, Miller-El is not entitled to habeas relief unless15 he can -- he can show that the State court's rejection of16 his Batson claim was objectively unreasonable. He must17 produce clear and convincing evidence and he has failed to18 do that.19202122232425 before it481111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Ms. -- Ms. Bunn.Mr. Waxman, you have about 3 minutes left.REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. WAXMAN:  I have just three points.The Fifth Circuit had precisely the same recordthat this Court had and the State submitted very￼1 nearly precisely the same brief that it presented to the2 Fifth Circuit the time before.3 Disparate questioning on the minimum punishment4 ploy was objected to by the defense during the voir dire5 and it was acknowledged. If you look at the Batson6 argument, it's either Mr. Macaluso or Mr. Nelson said some7 of the jurors were questioned disparately, but -- and they8 gave the explanation that it had to do with views on the9 death penalty. So it was before the State courts.10 Now, on the graphic script, which is the11 disparate questioning that Ms. Bunn has focused the12 Court's attention on, the State now says, okay, we can't13 speculate about what we don't know about the14 questionnaires. Let's just look at the questionnaires15 that we do know about. Justice Stevens, it is -- you are16 quite right that that tells you nothing about the dozens17 of other white jurors whose questionnaires we don't have,18 but we don't need to indulge in that speculation in this19 case because what we know from the questionnaire answers20 that we have is that every black who expressed anything21 that could be called hesitation on their juror22 questionnaire, including just not filling in either23 question -- answering question 56 or 58, got it. Five24 whites who expressed hesitation did not. That is Juror25 Mazza, Juror Hearn, Juror Duke, Ms. Girard, who testified491111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that she didn't -- who acknowledged in her voir dire thatshe hadn't filled out one of those questions which gotsimilarly situated African American jurors the graphicscript, and Juror Whaley who -- or Venireman Whaley whotestified that her questionnaire expressed greathesitation about the death penalty.          And what we also know is that the three jurorswho got the graphic script, Troy Woods, the black juror;Mr. Gutierrez, the Hispanic juror; and Marie Sztybel, theonly Jewish juror.          If the Court has no further questions.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 11:58 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)1111 14th Street, NW Suite 40050 1-Washington, DC 20005
