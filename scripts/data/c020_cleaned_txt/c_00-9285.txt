John Taylor,          Mr. Wagner.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT J. WAGNER                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. WAGNER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          On April 3rd of 1992, Judge Foster dismissedcriminal charges against Timothy Hall.  She noted on thedocket, case removed from docket, defendant deceased, andthen signed her name.  3 inches above that reference onthat docket sheet was the name, Bryan Saunders, in bigletters, court appointed counsel for Timothy Hall.          On April 6th of 1992, warrants charging WalterMickens with the capital murder of Timothy Hall camebefore Judge Foster.  Judge Foster telephoned BryanSaunders and asked if he would receive the appointment onthat case.  He accepted that appointment.          This case presents this Court with theextraordinary circumstances of a judge appointing a lawyerto a death penalty case when that judge knew or reasonablyshould have known that the lawyer represented the victim3                                                                                            12345    Warden.67 8 910111213141516171819202122232425 1    at the time of the victim's death.  As a consequence, 2    Walter Mickens has been deprived his constitutional rights 3    under the Sixth Amendment to conflict-free representation. 4              QUESTION:  In the U.S. -- in the Public 5    Defender's Office, couldn't this situation arise fairly 6    frequently?  Sometimes in a small office, somebody in the 7    office would have represented a victim many years before 8    on a totally different matter. 9              MR. WAGNER:  Yes, it could.10              QUESTION:  All right.  Well, if it arises fairly11    often, then what kind of a rule would you suggest?  I12    mean, does it mean that they have to -- public defenders13    have a hard time.  I mean, they -- they can't -- you know,14    they -- they can't have a thousand people in their office,15    and sure enough, some members of the people -- sometimes16    this will happen.  So, what kind of rule would you17 suggest?18              MR. WAGNER:  Well, the rule that's in place19    here, the rule from Holloway v. Arkansas, the rule from20    Cuyler v. Sullivan, the rule from Wood v. Georgia, is an21    appropriate rule, and it's appropriate because it requires22    that the trial judge or the -- or the judge in the case23    knows or reasonably should know that there is, in fact, a24    particular conflict.  So --25              QUESTION:  But, Mr. Wagner, what difference4                                                                                                                                 1    should it make from the point of view of the defendant 2    whether the judge knew or the judge didn't know?  You make 3    a sharp distinction between this case where the judge 4    knew.  But suppose Mickens didn't know and the judge 5    didn't know.  Why should Mickens be worse off?  In both 6    cases he doesn't know. 7              MR. WAGNER:  Well, in Holloway v. Arkansas, this 8    Court announced a rule which if a defense attorney 9    presents to the court an objection on the basis of a10    conflict of interest, and the court fails to inquire into11    that conflict, then prejudice is presumed.  And the focus12    of the Holloway decision was on the court's responsibility13    to inquire into that conflict.14              QUESTION:  But I was asking you what the rule15    should be, not the rule -- I probably wasn't specific16    enough.  I can't necessarily reconcile all the cases.  So,17    if we were starting from scratch and you had a lawyer in a18    -- in a public defender's office who many years before had19    represented a victim, what should the rule be about20    whether he can represent this person before him?21              MR. WAGNER:  Well, the rule should be, first of22    all, if the -- if the court knows or reasonably should23 know --24              QUESTION:  Forget whether the court knows or25    doesn't know.5                                                                                                                                 1 2    actual -- 3 4    be. 5 6    Honor, as opposed to a particular -- 7              QUESTION:  That doesn't help me.  If the facts 8    are that many years before the person represented the 9    victim on a different matter.  Now, what kind of a10    standard is the judge supposed to apply?11              MR. WAGNER:  If the -- the attorney is compelled12    to refrain from doing something because of his ethical13    obligations to the victim, if there's that compulsion by14    that defense attorney where he can't do certain things for15 his --16              QUESTION:  Fine.  I got it.  That's helpful.17              Then why not just say, and that's what you have18    to do here?  The judge should look into whether or not19    your client was significantly harmed in the way you just20    said because his lawyer couldn't do a proper job given the21    preceding representation.  Why isn't that just -- that22    would take care of all these cases just as you say.23              MR. WAGNER:  Well, and if -- if the -- the judge24    in this case had conducted that inquiry properly and had25    determined whether or not Mr. Saunders had that -- that --6                                                                                                                                MR. WAGNER:  Then it should be if there's anQUESTION:  I want to know what the rule shouldMR. WAGNER:  If there's an actual conflict, Your1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9the compulsion to refrain from doing something on behalfof Mr. Mickens, then in fact that would have been curedright away and we wouldn't --          QUESTION:  Fine.  So, now he didn't do it.  Whynot just send it back and tell him, do it?          MR. WAGNER:  Send it back and tell him to -- todo the inquiry?          QUESTION:  Say where there's that prejudice, youlose; if there isn't that prejudice, you don't.1011121314151617181920212223    Honor.2425          MR. WAGNER:  Well, because this Court has -- hasprovided that there's a fundamental right to conflict-free representation.          QUESTION:  Didn't -- didn't the district courtfind against you on the -- on the point of whether therewas an adverse effect?          MR. WAGNER:  They did in fact, Your Honor.          But that's not what the question before theCourt is.  According to Wood v. Georgia --          QUESTION:  The question before the Court iswhether, in addition to a Sixth Amendment violation, youhave to show an adverse effect.          MR. WAGNER:  That's right.  That's right, Your          And we -- we would suggest to the Court thatunder Wood v. Georgia, we aren't compelled to show an7                                                                                             1    adverse effect.  All we need to show here is an actual 2    conflict. 3              QUESTION:  But your answer to Justice Breyer -- 4    correct me if I'm wrong -- was that there had to be some, 5    at least strong possibility of adverse effect in the 6    instance where he represented the victim years before. 7              MR. WAGNER:  And that's exactly what 8    distinguishes actual conflict from adverse effect.  With 9    an actual conflict, there's a compulsion to refrain from10    doing something.  With adverse effect, there's an actual11    lapse in representation, and -- and that's a significant12    difference --13              QUESTION:  Well, but here it seems to me that14    two inquiries tend to become conflated in a case like15    this.  If there's no adverse effect, that shows that there16    was no conflict.17              MR. WAGNER:  Well, I would suggest --18              QUESTION:  And -- and that's quite different19    from a case where there's multiple representation over the20    defendant's -- over the counsel's objection.  I mean, we21    could say that in that line of cases, prejudice is22    apparent from the record.  It -- it -- a burden on counsel23    inheres intrinsically in the representation to which he24    objects.25But that's not -- there -- there are hundreds of                   8                                       1    different kinds of conflicts.  The -- the defense attorney 2    is a candidate for the prosecuting attorney in an upcoming 3    election.  One attorney has been interviewed -- the 4    defense attorney has been interviewed for a position in 5    the DA's office 4 weeks before. 6              All of these things you say there's an absolute 7    requirement of a new trial without any inquiry into 8    whether there's an adverse effect?  This is an astounding 9    proposition.10              MR. WAGNER:  Your Honor, I would suggest,11    though, that the key issue here is in the trial court's12    duty to -- to inquire into a conflict that it knew or13    reasonably should have known.  And that was the focus of14    Holloway v. Arkansas.15              QUESTION:  Yes, but Holloway and Cuyler were16    both multiple representation cases where the trial court17    could see the whole thing right before him at that time.18    This was not a multiple representation case.19              MR. WAGNER:  Your Honor, I agree.  But I would20    suggest that in this type of case, it's even more21    dangerous for the defendant that the court doesn't22    initiate the inquiry.  In that case, at least the court23    knows and the defendant knows that the co-defendant is24    being represented by the same attorney.  In this case, Mr.25    Mickens never knew that his -- that his attorney had a9                                                                                                                                1 conflict. 2              QUESTION:  May I ask if -- if in your view would 3    everything have been satisfactory, as a constitutional law 4    matter, if the judge had said, go ask your client if the 5    client has any objection, and the client had said, no, I 6    have no objection?  Would that have taken care of it? 7              MR. WAGNER:  Well, I believe that the court 8    should have indulged in some inquiry of the client 9    himself.  The court should have asked the client if he10    understood everything that was involved in waiving that11    conflict.  And in this situation --12              QUESTION:  Excuse me.  You're -- you're13    presuming a conflict.  I -- I really don't follow your14    argument for that -- whether the judge had an obligation15    to inquire into a conflict about which he knew or should16    have known.  What he should have known was -- was not the17    existence of a conflict, but simply that this defendant --18    that the deceased had previously been represented by19    counsel who's representing this defendant.  That does not20    constitute a conflict.21              The -- what follows from that -- from that22    relationship?  Does anything follow other than the fact23    that the lawyer cannot, in -- in a subsequent24    representation, disclose any confidential information25    which he learned in the prior representation.  Right?10                                                                                                                                 1    Isn't that the only thing that follows? 2              MR. WAGNER:  Well, it is that, but there's also 3    ethical consideration 4-5 of the Virginia Code of 4    Professional Responsibility which states that anything 5    obtained by Mr. Saunders through his representation of 6    Hall could not be used to Hall's disadvantage. 7              QUESTION:  That's fine, but that doesn't show a 8    conflict.  That shows at most the potential of a conflict, 9    and -- and you're representing it here as though there is10    a conflict and -- and the judge had an obligation to11    inquire into it.  But the whole issue is -- is whether12    there was a conflict.  That hasn't been established at13 all.14              MR. WAGNER:  Well, I believe it has, Your Honor,15    and it's been established because Mr. Saunders in this16    case obtained confidential information from Mr. Hall.17    That's clear from the record.  The district court found18    that.  And in preserving those confidences of Mr. Hall, he19    was precluded from doing certain things.20              QUESTION:  Would you -- would you say what they21    were?  Because it seemed to me that some of the things you22    listed were just matters of record and not at all -- there23    was one conversation between this lawyer and the client.24    We know it took place for 15 to 30 minutes, and that was25    it.  And a number of your recitations do involve matters11                                                                                                                                 1    of public record that would not involve betraying any 2    client confidence if Saunders brought them out.  So, what 3    was it that Saunders knew that was not available to the4 public? 5              MR. WAGNER:  First of all, all of this happened 6    in -- in juvenile domestic relations court, and under 7    Virginia law, all of those files, all of that information 8    from that case was confidential and couldn't be revealed 9    to the public.10              But nonetheless, even if it was public, under11    ethical consideration 4-4 of the Virginia Code of12    Professional Responsibility, which governed Mr. Saunders13    at that time, he was absolutely required to preserve the14    confidences and secrets of Mr. Hall regardless of the15    source or nature of those confidences --16              QUESTION:  So what?  So what?  Why does that17    constitute a conflict?  Unless you connect up that18    confidential information which he knew with something that19    was relevant to the defense of his new client, there's no20 conflict.21              MR. WAGNER:  I want to get to that point, and22    the point is that in death penalty cases, it's absolutely23    essential that the attorney looks into the background of24    the client.  In this case --25              QUESTION:  You're asking for a special rule in12                                                                                                                                 1    death penalty cases? 2              MR. WAGNER:  I'm not, Your Honor.  I believe -- 3              QUESTION:  Well, they why do you -- why do you 4    stress the fact this a death penalty case? 5              MR. WAGNER:  Well, I also stress the fact that 6    this is a sex case, Judge.  This is a case of forcible 7    sodomy, and also in that type of case, it's absolutely 8    essential for the attorney to look into the background of 9    the defendant --10              QUESTION:  Well, isn't -- wouldn't that be true11    in most criminal cases?12              MR. WAGNER:  It would be true that the -- the13    attorney should look into the -- the background of the14    victim.  Absolutely, Judge.  But I think it's particularly15    true because of the sentencing phase in a death penalty16    case.  In the sentencing phase of the death penalty case,17    the attorney needs to -- or the team of attorneys need to18    look into the background of the victim, need to engage in19    a -- in brainstorming about the background and an20    investigation about the background.  And Mr. Saunders21    couldn't engage in that brainstorming, couldn't engage in22    that investigation because he had to preserve those23    confidences, and he had a duty of loyalty to Mr. Hall.24              QUESTION:  Well, this may not get us very far so25    far as a general rule is concerned, but isn't your13                                                                                                                                 1    argument, insofar as this case is concerned, pretty much 2    undercut by the fact, number one -- let's take an example. 3    Let's take the issue that you -- you rightly stress about 4    the response to the victim impact evidence, the -- the 5    mother's testimony.  Isn't your case pretty much undercut 6    here by the fact that the information, on the basis of 7    which defense counsel could have responded to the mother's 8    testimony, had already been published in a newspaper? 9              And isn't it also undercut by the fact that10    there was co-counsel here and there is no claim that co­11    counsel had any conflict, actual or potential.  So, if we12    -- even if we accept your -- your premise that proof of13    conflict would be enough in this situation, don't you lose14 anyway?1516171819202122232425          MR. WAGNER:  Well, as to the newspaper issue,Your Honor, under ethical consideration 4-4, it doesn'tmatter where the information is in the public.  Thatattorney has an absolute responsibility to maintain thoseconfidences and secrets.          QUESTION:  But there's no confidence --          QUESTION:  It's no longer a secret.  How can youkeep a secret that is no longer secret?          MR. WAGNER:  Well, because the ethicalconsiderations in the Virginia Code of ProfessionalResponsibility required Mr. Saunders to do that.14                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  Require somebody to keep a secretthat is something that is no longer a secret?  I don'tthink that's what they require.          MR. WAGNER:  Well, I don't believe that -- thatan attorney under those circumstances can pursue anythingfrom the confidences and secrets that he --          QUESTION:  All right.  But I -- I don't --          MR. WAGNER:  I would simply suggest, Your Honor,that that's contrary to what is -- is provided in theVirginia Code of Professional Responsibility.          QUESTION:  He can pursue it from the newspaper.He doesn't have to pursue it from his confidentialknowledge.  He can pursue it from -- from the newspaper.10111213141516    argument.17              MR. WAGNER:  As far as --18              QUESTION:  And that gets us to co-counsel.19              MR. WAGNER:  Absolutely, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  All right.  I find that -- I findthat hard to accept, but I'll accept it for the sake of20              QUESTION:  Co-counsel wasn't bound by that21    because co-counsel hadn't represented the victim.22              MR. WAGNER:  That's right.  That's right.  But23    the fundamental right to conflict-free representation is24    not that you -- you have unconflicted counsel.  It's that25    you have conflict-free representation.  The fact that he15                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9      may have had 10 unconflicted attorneys makes no difference      in this case.  The fact that he has one conflicted      attorney is enough to poison the well.                QUESTION:  One apple spoils the whole barrel?  I      mean, is --                MR. WAGNER:  I'm sorry?                QUESTION:  I mean, one bad apple spoils the      whole barrel?                MR. WAGNER:  That's what we're suggesting.  If      that one bad apple was, in effect, trying to sabbotage the      defense in that case --                QUESTION:  Well, is there -- is there anything      close to that sort of a showing here, that this -- the      lawyer was trying to sabbotage the defense?                MR. WAGNER:  No.                QUESTION:  Then why -- why do you make that                MR. WAGNER:  Well, because if a rule of law is19    to be promulgated in this case, I think that needs to be20    anticipated.1011121314151617    statement?1821 22 23 24 25          QUESTION:  Well, but you're saying that if -- ifa person, say, has a team of six lawyers, if there's onewith a conflict of interest, the whole case has to betried over.          MR. WAGNER:  If you can show, under Holloway v.                            16                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Arkansas, under Cuyler v. Sullivan, under Wood v. Georgia,that there was, in fact, either an actual conflict andadverse effect or in the event where the judge failed toinquire into a conflict that that judge --          QUESTION:  But I thought you were telling us youdon't inquire about an adverse effect.  I thought that'syour whole point.  Correct me, please, if I'm wrong.  Ithought you were arguing --          MR. WAGNER:  I may have misspoken.          QUESTION:  I thought you were arguing to us theproposition that it is wrong to inquire into adverseeffect.  Once there has been a failure on the part of thetrial court to inquire, that's the end.          MR. WAGNER:  That -- that's right, but in the --          QUESTION:  So then -- so then your argumentwhether there's an adverse effect is completely contraryto your own proposition.          MR. WAGNER:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.  I wasspeaking more generally about general conflict of interestcases where an attorney may be there to -- to sabbotagethe defendant.  In that situation, if there was no duty ofthe trial court to inquire, then you would have to go theactual conflict/adverse effect analysis, and that questionwill have to be addressed.          But if you're just dealing with a situation in                            17                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425which the -- the judge knew or reasonably should haveknown of the conflict and failed to inquire, then ofcourse, you're absolutely right.  There would be no --          QUESTION:  This is the -- this is the secondtime, Mr. Wagner, you've referred to an attorney beingthere to sabbotage the defendant.  You feel that'ssomething that fairly frequently happens?          MR. WAGNER:  Well, I'm not saying that it fairlyfrequently happens.          QUESTION:  I would think you would be verycareful about making a statement like that.          MR. WAGNER:  Absolutely, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Then why did you make it?          MR. WAGNER:  I made it because I think it's acompelling point.  I believe that -- that it can happen.          QUESTION:  Why is it a compelling point if ithardly ever happens?          MR. WAGNER:  Well, it may very well be in thiscase that Mr. Saunders was trying to sabbotage.  We don'tknow all of the confidences and secrets that he obtained.We don't know everything about his reasons for acceptingthis case knowing that he had represented the victim inthis case and performing in this case in the way he did,failing to look into a consent defense in this case,failing to investigate critical information in this case.18                                                                                            1 We -- 23 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  All right.  So, if you're right thenon this point, then there was loads of prejudice.          MR. WAGNER:  Well, there would be if we had --          QUESTION:  All right.  So, what are we supposedto do then in your view?          MR. WAGNER:  What -- what --          QUESTION:  I mean, use -- send it back?  Ithought they found no prejudice.  So --          MR. WAGNER:  The district court, in fact, foundno prejudice, Your Honor.          And -- and what we're saying in this case is,first of all, to adopt the rule of Wood v. Georgia, therule where if we show an actual conflict --          QUESTION:  Mr. Wagner, may I stop you there?Because it seems to me, reading the Wood v. Georgia caseand those facts, in those -- in that case the actualconflict and the adverse effect coincided.  If the lawyerwere loyal to the employer and the employer was interestedin setting up a test case, then that very conflict would,at one and the same time, establish the adverse effect.Therefore, I could not take from the Wood case what youare urging this Court to take.          And if that's so, then the Wood case is in nodifferent category.  It's a case where adverse effect has19                                                                                             1    been claimed and the two are not distinguishable. 2              MR. WAGNER:  I understand, Your Honor.  And -- 3    and if you look to the Cuyler v. Sullivan case, Cuyler v. 4    Sullivan very specifically draws out a test in which you 5    must show both actual conflict and adverse effect.  If you 6    then look to the dispositional paragraph of Wood v. 7    Georgia, that speaks only of actual conflict, and it 8    speaks of it three times.  In Wood v. Georgia, the only 9    requirement upon a showing that the defense attorney had10    not inquired into the conflict but that the judge knew or11    reasonably should have known of the conflict is that there12    be an actual conflict showing.  And again, it's three13    times in the dispositional paragraph.14              QUESTION:  But if, on the facts of that case,15    those two are opposite sides of the same coin -- there's16    no -- if you show one, then you inevitably show the other17    -- then how can we extract the words of the decision from18    the fact background against which Justice Powell was19 writing?20              MR. WAGNER:  I don't believe that you21    necessarily show one by showing the other.  In an actual22    conflict situation, it's really the potential of a lapse23    in representation that the Court focuses on.  When you get24    to the actual -- the adverse effect, then it is the actual25    lapse of -- of -- in representation.  So, it's the20                                                                                                                                 1    potential in the actual conflict versus the actual lapse 2    in the -- in the adverse effect, the impeded 3    representation in that case.  So -- 4              QUESTION:  Well, you are making a nice statement 5    in the abstract.  I'm trying to bring it down to earth in 6    the Wood case, and I said, well -- you answered both 7    questions if the employer has a conflict -- if the lawyer 8    has a conflict because the employer's interest diverges 9    from the employee's.10              MR. WAGNER:  Yes.  And in that case, the Court11    did actually find -- in Wood v. Georgia, did find an12    actual conflict, found that there were competing13    interests, and sent it back to the trial court to14    determine whether or not there was an adverse effect.15              QUESTION:  I thought the Court found nothing16    because it raised this question on its own.  It was never17    briefed and argued.18              MR. WAGNER:  I'm sorry.19              QUESTION:  And we said you find out about this,20    lower court.  We were supposed to hear another question21    entirely.  We found that there is this lurking issue that22    should be decided first.  There was no briefing.  How can23    you use that as establishing a whole new category, a case24    like that where the -- the Court didn't even have the25    benefit of briefing on the issue?21                                                                                                                                1              MR. WAGNER:  Well, again, I would point to the2    dispositional paragraph and the very language, the precise3    language of the case of Wood v. Georgia that said, we --4    you know, if -- if the defendant fails to inquire and if5    the judge knew or reasonably should have known or if the6    defendant fails to advise the court of a conflict and if7    the -- the court knew or reasonably should have known of a8    conflict and failed to inquire, all that needs to be shown9    is an actual conflict, and didn't mention adverse effect.10    That -- that's as specific as I can get in -- in that11    specific case.12              And you're right, Your Honor.  I misspoke.  They13    did not find an actual conflict but sent it back to the14    court to determine if there was an actual conflict, back15    to the -- to the court that -- that did the probation16    revocation hearing in that case to see if there was, in17    fact, an actual conflict.  And -- and that's what the18    Court found, just that the court had to find an actual19    conflict, and if it did find an actual conflict, then that20    case appropriate for reversal.  And that's what we're21    asking.2223242522                                                                                                                                          QUESTION:  I take it in any case at this pointyou're not claiming the benefit of the Holloway rule.MR. WAGNER:  Well, we are, Your Honor.  We --QUESTION:  Well, but as I -- you correct me if 1    I'm wrong, but I thought if -- if you had the benefit of 2    the Holloway rule, you wouldn't have to show even an 3    actual conflict. 4              MR. WAGNER:  That's correct, but -- but it is5 the part -- 6              QUESTION:  Are you -- are you arguing that we 7    should adopt that rule?  I mean, if we did, that would -- 8    that would answer the point that has just been raised. 9              MR. WAGNER:  No.  I -- I believe that the10    Holloway rule was extended in Cuyler v. Sullivan, but the11    Holloway rule focuses on the court's failure to inquire.12              QUESTION:  No.  But you started -- at least, as13    I recall back in your brief, you started out by arguing14    that what puts the court on notice doesn't matter so long15    as the court is on notice.  You said in Holloway counsel16    raised it before the court, and you're saying in this17    case, under the -- at least the rule that the court should18    have known of the -- of the potential conflict, that was19    the functional equivalent to counsel's raising it in20    Holloway, and therefore the result should be the same.21              As I understand Holloway, if the result were to22    be the same, we would not even look any further into the23    question of actual conflict.  We would say if there was24    enough to put the court on notice, reverse.  And I take it25    you're not arguing for that now, or are you?23                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. WAGNER:  We are not, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Okay.          MR. WAGNER:  And the reason we're not is becauseof the component of Holloway v. Arkansas that deals withthe defense attorney's advisement of the court of theconflict and -- and the importance that that --          QUESTION:  So, you're -- you're -- maybe I -- Imisunderstood your position when I was running through thebriefs, but you're not taking the position that Holloway'scounsel's advice to the court should be equated with thecourt's kind of obligation under the should have knownstandard that you argue for here.  You're not equatingthose two.          MR. WAGNER:  I'm sorry.  I don't understand --          QUESTION:  I thought in your original argumentyou were saying, look, in Holloway defense counsel said,there's a problem, judge.  Here the judge knew or shouldhave known about the problem.  Those two facts areequivalent, and I take it now you're not saying those twofacts are equivalent.          MR. WAGNER:  They're equivalent to a certainextent, but the fact that the defense attorney raised itto the court has a certain significance.  As the SolicitorGeneral indicates in their -- in their brief, there issome significance to the defense attorney raising that24                                                                                             1    issue to the court and the court's compulsion to inquire 2    into it at that point.  It's not as significant as the 3    trial court's role in inquiring into that conflict, but it 4    is significant.  And Wood v. Georgia takes that 5    significance, that component into effect when it requires 6    an actual conflict, a showing of an actual conflict -- 7              QUESTION:  But, counsel, I'm a little puzzled at 8    this point too.  It seemed to me that you would have no 9    case if the judge were not on notice of the potential10 conflict.111213141516171819202122232425          MR. WAGNER:  Well, I believe --          QUESTION:  You're not -- you're not arguing thata lawyer could have this relationship and keep it secretfor 5 years and then come around and say, now set asidethe conviction.          MR. WAGNER:  Well, Your Honor, we would say thatthe adverse effect prong would not be required under thecircumstances where the judge knew, but we're notconceding that we can't satisfy the adverse effect prong.But you're right, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Well, but we're taking the case onthe assumption there's been a hearing and there's beenevidence that established an absence of adverse effect.At least I thought that's the way the case comes to.          MR. WAGNER:  That-- that's what the district                            25                                                                                            12345678    case.9court found.          QUESTION:  So, I thought the key to your casewas the fact that the judge had a duty, when advised or onnotice of a potential conflict of interest, of making aninquiry as to find out whether in fact there was such aconflict.  I thought that's your whole case.                MR. WAGNER:  That -- that is the focus of our11    you've put it that if the judge knew or should have known12    of the conflict.  Now, is that it?  Which is it?  You've13    said this morning if he knew or should have known of the14    conflict.  Is that he should have known of the conflict or15    should have known of the potential conflict?16              MR. WAGNER:  Well, in Cuyler v. Sullivan, it17    talks to a particular conflict.18              QUESTION:  No.  I'm -- I'm asking you what your19    position is.20              MR. WAGNER:  My position is --21              QUESTION:  -- you look at the question22    presented --                QUESTION:  Is that -- is that your -- see, I10    don't -- you -- you haven't put it that way.  You --232425    conflict.QUESTION:  No.MR. WAGNER:  Knew or should have known of a26                                      1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  That's not your question presented byyour blue brief.  It's potential conflict.  That's whatyou put in your brief.  Now you're changing your position?          MR. WAGNER:  Well, I don't mean to change myposition, Your Honor, but a potential conflict in thecontext of where we have it in the brief would -- wouldessentially equal a particular conflict.  So, it is apotential conflict --          QUESTION:  Well, but -- a very differentquestion.  You mean whenever there's a potential conflict,if the -- if defense counsel had -- had represented thevictim 20 years ago on a totally unrelated matter, there-- there's always some confidential information he mighthave obtained.  The judge always has to inquire into that?          MR. WAGNER:  That's true, Your Honor.          No.  If -- but if the judge knows --          QUESTION:  Well, how potential does potentialhave to be then?          MR. WAGNER:  Potential has to be, as Cuylerdescribes, a particular conflict.  If -- if the judgeknows that there's some information that that attorney mayhave obtained from a previous client, that there's somekind of conflicting interest that needs to be probed.          QUESTION:  No, no.  That may be conflicting.          MR. WAGNER:  That may be conflicting.  That's27                                                                                            1    right.  There is the potential for damage to the2    defendant.  It's that potential that the -- the judge3    needs to inquire.  It's the peril that the defendant finds4    himself in by being represented by a conflicted attorney5    that the judge has a responsibility to --67 peril? 89QUESTION:  20 years ago.  Is that enough of a10111213141516171819202122232425          MR. WAGNER:  In that case, it's very difficultto -- to imagine how the judge would have known of thatconflict.  So --          QUESTION:  But he knew about it.          MR. WAGNER:  If he knew about it, then -- then Iwould suggest that that judge should at least inquire,just take the very -- the very reasonable measure, thevery simple measure of inquiring into the conflict.  Ittakes a very short amount of time, and you -- youalleviate the problem of all the litigation that we've hadin this case.          If I may reserve the remainder of my time, Mr.Chief Justice.          QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Wagner.          Mr. Harris, we'll hear from you.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT Q. HARRIS                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MR.

There is a rule.  The Court hasestablished a rule and the general application fordeciding conflict of interest claims, and it was decidedin Sullivan.  It's consistent with the repeated admonitionof this Court, that in order to claim an interference withthe right to counsel, you have to show that it had someeffect on the representation.  Sullivan states the SixthAmendment standard.  Justice Breyer, the rule that you'relooking for is in Sullivan.          QUESTION:  Well, Holloway doesn't stand for thatproposition, does it?  Holloway is consistent with whatyou said?          MR. HARRIS:  Well, Sullivan explicitly --          QUESTION:  I'm asking you about Holloway.          MR. HARRIS:  Well, Sullivan explicitly carvesout Holloway.          QUESTION:  Do you think Holloway is good law or101112131415161718192021    not?2223 24 25          MR. HARRIS:  Holloway is -- is not beenoverruled.  It is perfectly good law.          QUESTION:  Well, that didn't require any showingof adverse effect.29                                                                                            1              MR. HARRIS:  What the Court said in Holloway is2    that relying on the representations of counsel that there3    was a conflict of interest and that he would be unable to4    examine his multiple clients, the failure to inquire into5    that was itself error.6              And I think if you -- you can put Holloway into7    the exact same terms of the Sullivan over-arching8    standard.  The fact that counsel has taken these steps of9    advising the court that he sees a conflict of interest,10    the fact that counsel tells the court, when they get to11    trial, that he is not able to examine his several clients12    because of the confidences he knows, that is, as -- as13    Holloway said, relying on counsel being in the best14    position to know.  That is persuasive evidence that, in15    fact, the conflict existed.  And obviously, the impact on16    the representation in that circumstance is evident.17              The -- the --18              QUESTION:  May I ask you this question?  Do you19    think the lawyer in this case had a duty to tell his20    client that he had represented the victim?  Just an21    ethical -- not a constitutional duty, as an ethical22    matter.23242530                                                                                                                                          MR. HARRIS:  The district court found that heshould have -- under the rules of ethics, he should haveadvised his client of the fact that he had previously 1    represented Tim Hall. 2              QUESTION:  And then the next question I have is 3    do you think -- again, not necessarily a matter of 4    constitutional law, but that it would have been good 5    practice for the judge to inquire of the lawyer whether he 6    thought there had been any -- any difficulty in the 7    representation? 8              MR. HARRIS:  I -- I certainly agree that it 9    would have been good practice both for defense counsel and10    for trial -- the trial -- well, in this case it wasn't a11    trial court.  It was a juvenile court that -- that made12    the appointment.  Certainly it would be a good practice.13    I think that is part and parcel of what Sullivan was14    saying when it is encouraging trial courts to make those15    inquiries even on facts that may not be based on the16    objection of counsel or the defendant.17              QUESTION:  Would you say it was unethical for18    the lawyer not to have revealed to the court and his19    client not what is the better practice, but that it was,20    in fact, a violation of the ethical constraints for the21    lawyer, knowing that he had represented the victim, not to22    tell his client so his client could make the choice23    whether to keep the lawyer or not?24              MR. HARRIS:  I cannot make the final call on25    whether it was ethical or not.  We have an independent31                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425body in Virginia that is -- is there to do that verything, the Virginia State Bar.          I would agree, as the district court said, thatthe obligations, the ethical obligations, of counsel wouldbe to provide disclosure of such information to his -- tohis client.          The -- it is the next step that you are, Iguess, deliberately not taking that -- that I would haveto say that that is not the type of conflicting interestthat would -- that was being addressed in the Sullivanstandard for finding a Sixth Amendment violation.          QUESTION:  In other words --          QUESTION:  And I wasn't -- I wasn't asking youany question about the Constitution.  I was asking youabout the ethical canons that govern lawyers.          MR. HARRIS:  I --          QUESTION:  Does the lawyer have a duty to advisethe client of a potential conflict?          MR. HARRIS:  There is a general duty of counselto advise his client of any circumstances which the clientwould want to know, as far as matters that may affect theloyalty of counsel to client.  That is the general andaccepted ethical statement.  Certainly that is anobligation that was Mr. Saunders' obligation at the timeof this case.32                                                                                             1              QUESTION:  May I ask -- take it one step further 2    and turn away from the ethics to the Constitution?  What 3    -- what would you say about a case of the same facts, but 4    the -- the client tells the -- the client finds out about 5    it and asks the judge to relieve the lawyer because the 6    client doesn't want a lawyer who represented the -- the 7    victim?  Would the judge have a constitutional duty to -- 8    to discharge counsel? 9              MR. HARRIS:  Well, the -- I think Holloway I10    think doesn't make a distinction between the defendant11    himself or his client.  So, in that very circumstance, the12    judge would have a duty to inquire.  That much I think is13    clear from Holloway.14              QUESTION:  No.  I've given you the facts.  The15    -- the client -- all the client says is, I don't trust a16    lawyer who's represented the man that I'm accused of17    killing.  I would like a different lawyer.  Would the --18    would the judge have a duty to give him a different lawyer19    as a constitutional matter?20              MR. HARRIS:  No.  I would say this, as this21    Court pointed out in Wheat, the judge certainly has the22    discretion, a very broad discretion at that point in time,23    to anticipate the possibility of conflicts and to24    substitute counsel on the risk, on the possible danger of25    a conflict appearing later on.33                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  What -- what if the lawyer says that?What -- what if the lawyer says that?  I don't feelcomfortable representing this -- this defendant because --because I represented the decedent that he's accused ofmurdering.  The same question as -- as --          MR. HARRIS:  I understand.          QUESTION:  -- Justice Stevens, only it's -- it'scounsel who --          MR. HARRIS:  And the answer is -- is essentiallythe same as well.  If counsel is representing to the -- ifthat can be interpreted as representing to the court thathe is objecting to representing this man because of hisprior representation, the court has to inquire.          Now, of course, the duty that Sullivan andHolloway set out, as far as the duty to inquire, is not aduty to grant relief.  It's a duty to inquire to determinewhether or not there is a risk that the Sixth Amendmentrights will be jeopardized.          QUESTION:  Well, except in Holloway exactly thathappened.  The -- the lawyer said, judge, I can'trepresent these three defendants, and the judge said, yougo ahead and do it.          MR. HARRIS:  Well, that's --          QUESTION:  And -- and this Court reversed.          I read the opinion as saying that in this case34                                                                                             1    the conflict is apparent on the face of the record.  The 2    -- the attorney is -- is -- has such a burden that it -- 3    the conflict inheres in the very objection the attorney 4    makes.  You don't even need to look any further.  That's 5    the way I read that opinion. 6              MR. HARRIS:  I think that is exactly what 7    Holloway gets to.  The point is when counsel makes the 8    effort of telling the judge that he sees a conflict of 9    interest and that he cannot do his job effectively, that10    essentially makes out the Sixth Amendment violation.11              QUESTION:  Going back to the earlier questions12    about the counsel's ethical duty, as you understand it,13    quite apart from the Constitution, is there a duty of14    loyalty to the former client or just a duty of maintaining15    confidentiality?16              MR. HARRIS:  After the close of the17    representation of a former client, I -- I believe that the18    general duty of loyalty devolves down to that duty of19    maintaining the confidences of your former client.  That20    is how the duty of loyalty is represented.  I -- I don't21    think we can impose a -- even an ethical obligation on22    counsel to continue to have good feelings about a former23    client or -- or this general notion of having once24    represented an individual, he is forever subject to the25    attorney's care.35                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  The trouble I'm having with thestandard is not whether the judge happens to know heshould have looked in or shouldn't have looked into it,which were unusual circumstances.  If a lawyer is under areal conflict -- a real one, a very serious one, aterrible one -- his client cannot get effectiveassistance.  So, I would have thought that's the standard.          MR. HARRIS:  I believe that is --          QUESTION:  Did the client get effectiveassistance or not?          MR. HARRIS:  I believe it is.          QUESTION:  Now, the difficulty comes up becausethe lawyer doesn't normally tell him, just like any otherineffective case, and now the judge has to decide what isand what is not ineffective assistance.  So, to do that inthe conflict category, do we just look to the ABA rules?They're often quite attenuated.          What do we use to decide whether the conflict isserious enough so the client couldn't get effectiveassistance?  Once he didn't, I guess you do presumeprejudice because you can't go back and second guess everysecond of what the lawyer was doing.  But what's the1011121314151617181920212223    standard?2425          MR. HARRIS:  Well, again, Sullivan addresses thevery concern.  It indicates that counsel must be actively36                                                                                             1    representing conflicting interests before we have a 2    presumed prejudice.  He must have an actual conflict 3    adversely affecting -- 4              QUESTION:  And what is that -- so, that's -- 5    it's exactly at the time you say the words actual 6    conflict, that I think have gotten me mixed up in these7 cases. 8              MR. HARRIS:  Well, of course -- 9              QUESTION:  And sometimes they mean one thing,10    sometimes another.11              MR. HARRIS:  Well, I don't think there's any12    inconsistency in this Court's cases on --13              QUESTION:  No, maybe not.  But whether there is14    or not, can we do better than saying actual conflict?15    Should we say actual conflict creating ineffective16    assistance?  Should we say look at the ABA rules?  What17    should we say in your opinion?18              MR. HARRIS:  Well, I would take us back to19    Sullivan because what Sullivan was doing was identifying20    what the lower courts had already been doing prior to the21    time of its decision, which was finding something called22    an actual conflict.  And what that involved was23    identifying diverging interests, inconsistent interests,24    essentially potentially conflicting interests, and then25    looking to see whether or not that existence of diverging37                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9interests actually had any effect on the representation.          Now, the lower court decisions often spoke --          QUESTION:  This is what confuses me about thisdiscussion.  I'm -- I'm not -- sometimes it seems to methat -- that we're equating the existence of an actualconflict with prejudice.  Is that what you're saying, that-- that when you show an actual conflict, there isautomatically prejudice?  I -- I didn't understand that tobe the law.          MR. HARRIS:  No, and that's not what I'm          QUESTION:  I understood it to be the law that nomatter how actual and apparent the conflict is, if it hadnot effect on the trial, there's no foul.          MR. HARRIS:  I would argue that it is theadverse effect that makes a potential conflict actual.          QUESTION:  Then how do you explain Holloway?          MR. HARRIS:  Holloway I think can easily beexplained as the -- the adverse effect and actualimpairment of defense counsel's ability to conduct therepresentation --          QUESTION:  But that -- all --          MR. HARRIS:  -- was provided by his own          QUESTION:  I think all you can say for sure in                            38                                                                                            1011    arguing.12131415161718192021222324    statement.251    Holloway was that there was an actual conflict.  There was2    no showing of what effect that conflict had upon the3    representation.4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. HARRIS:  Again, what Sullivan said aboutHolloway was that Holloway did not find an actualconflict.  So, I will stop short as well.          QUESTION:  Well, there was no finding in thesense that the Court made a formal finding.  I think whatJustice Scalia was -- in any case, what I've been assumingis what Justice Kennedy said a moment ago, that whencounsel in a multiple representation situation says,judge, I can't go on representing all of these people,that the conflict is so obvious that we'll take it as agiven.  And -- and I'm -- I'm inclined to read Hollowaythat way.          MR. HARRIS:  Well, perhaps --          QUESTION:  The conflict is so obvious or theprejudice is so obvious?          QUESTION:  Well, the conflict is -- is soobvious because it seems to me -- and this was going toget to my next -- my -- my question to you.          Isn't the difference -- reading Holloway the wayI am reading it, isn't the difference between Holloway and-- and Sullivan something like this?  We realize that if,through no fault of anybody, through the -- the client was39                                                                                             1    not asleep, the judge was not asleep -- it nonetheless 2    turns out later that there was a conflict, we want to make 3    sure that that conflict actually had an effect on 4    representation before we -- we start reversing 5    convictions.  But if there was reason to believe in 6    advance, if somebody told the judge like the lawyer in 7    Holloway, that there is a problem here, we want to have an 8    inducement on the trial court to pursue that problem right 9    then and there.  And in order to get that inducement,10    we're going to have a rule that says, you don't have to11    prove effect.  All you have to prove is conflict.  In12    other words, in order to induce the trial courts to be on13    their toes, the defendants later on have a lesser burden.14              Do you think that's the way to read Holloway and15    Sullivan together?  And do you think that is a sensible16 rule?17              MR. HARRIS:  I substantially agree with that,18    with the following caveat.  I don't think that Holloway19    necessarily is saying the actual conflict as a separate20    concept, actual conflict.  It's so evident that we will21    presume prejudice.  I think they are saying that in those22    particular circumstances where the matter is objected to23    and brought to the trial court's attention, both the24    actual conflict and the expected prejudice from the25    attorney telling the judge he cannot represent all of the40                                                                                                                                 1    people are so obvious that -- 2              QUESTION:  Well, isn't that what Holloway is 3    talking about?  Expected prejudice basically.  If the 4    attorney says I can't represent these people, instead of 5    letting it go ahead and prove that he's right, which you 6    have every reason to think he's right, you simply say, 7    we'll have to stop right now. 8              MR. HARRIS:  Well, we are giving a great deal of 9    weight to trial counsel's ability to know because he is10    the only person that has the access to the confidences of11    multiple clients who will know for certain, or at least12    with a high degree of certainty, that there is going to be13    a conflict and that it will affect the representations of14    the various clients.15              But to -- if I could get back to your question,16    there is a difference, I think, in the circumstance where17    the attorney has made that representation to the trial18    court, which I think is the same as saying I see an actual19    conflict that will affect my representation.20              QUESTION:  If we want -- you know, I realize21    that, but if -- if we want to keep the trial judges on22    their toes -- and having been a trial judge, I can tell23    you that inducements do matter -- doesn't it make sense to24    treat the -- the knowledge that the appointing judge has,25    in a case like this, as being the equivalent of the -- of41                                                                                                                                 1    the objection by counsel? 2              MR. HARRIS:  No. 3              QUESTION:  Why -- why not equate them? 4              MR. HARRIS:  I think it is -- it is fair to say 5    that the trial judge's notice of facts that would cause 6    him to -- to perceive a -- the language that the Court 7    used was a particular conflict.  But the notice of that 8    certainly imposes an obligation upon him to inquire into 9    it.  But I don't think you can then say that having10    knowledge of facts that would suggest an actual conflict11    or even suggest a particular conflict can be equated with12    the attorney's representation that it exists.13              QUESTION:  Okay.  The trouble -- the trouble is14    if you follow -- I mean, I think I follow your -- your15    argument.  But if I -- if I understand you correctly, then16    nothing is really added to the law by saying the trial17    judge has an obligation to inquire into it because when we18    -- when we come at the -- at the question after the fact,19    the trial judge hasn't inquired, there's been a trial,20    there's been a conviction, then the issue of conflict gets21    litigated.22 23 24 25          MR. HARRIS:  Well, that is --          QUESTION:  On your -- on your rule we proceedunder the same standards whether or not the trial judgeshould have known.  Isn't that right?42                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. HARRIS:  It is not so much my rule.  It isthis Court's rule.  That's what Sullivan said.          QUESTION:  No, but I mean, regardless of who itbelongs to, on the -- on the argument that you are making,the -- the standards are exactly the same whether thejudge should have known or should -- need notnecessarily --          MR. HARRIS:  As far as ultimately finding --          QUESTION:  But -- but the world changes.  I -- Iassume that trial judges generally do what we say they'resupposed to do.          MR. HARRIS:  That -- that is correct.          QUESTION:  Now, it may mean it may well be thatif they don't, nothing happens afterwards, but usuallythey'll do what we suggest.  Won't they?          MR. HARRIS:  Well, it -- it is true that theState judges and Federal judges -- lower Federal judgesall are sworn to uphold the same Constitution.          QUESTION:  It didn't seem to happen here,though, did it?          QUESTION:  May I suggest that the -- the problemis not the bright line distinction between potentialconflict and actual conflict, but rather the serious --the potentially serious character of the conflict.          And your point is that the lawyers in Holloway                            43                                                                                             1    made it clear to the judge it was a serious problem. 2    Whereas, here it's not all that apparent because it may 3    have been just a routine appointment of the public 4    defender's office that just happens.  But if this lawyer 5    had been the family attorney for the victim for the last 6    30 years and knew them intimately and so forth, I think 7    you would agree then the judge had a greater duty of 8    inquiry than he might have had here. 9              MR. HARRIS:  I would say to the extent that you10    make the two relationships, the between representations11    more connected -- and you can certainly do that by virtue12    of a personal relationship -- you inch your way along --13              QUESTION:  It was more likely to be prejudicial14    would be the point.  If it's reasonably likely to the15    judge to know -- I mean, if it's reasonably apparent on16    the face of the matter, whether said by the lawyer or just17    from the facts, that there's a real danger of prejudice18    here, you would agree the judge has a duty of inquiry, I19    would think.20              MR. HARRIS:  I -- I certainly agree that the21    judge's duty of inquiry is -- is presented at a much22    lesser level than actual prejudice to the defendant.  And23    it's obvious these things should be taken care of --24              QUESTION:  Okay.  But does that -- does that25    duty of inquiry have any consequence later in the44                                                                                                                                 1    standards by which the case will be judged on, say, 2    collateral attack? 3              MR. HARRIS:  No, and for a very simple reason. 4    You do not have the one ingredient that you have in 5    Holloway v. Arkansas.  You do not have the representation 6    of counsel, the person in the best position to know, that 7    in fact he sees a conflict and he sees the impairment.  In 8    fact, you have the opposite.  The fact that counsel has 9    not raised any matter to the trial court when he is in the10    best position to know and when he does not see that there11    is a conflict sufficient enough to call to the court's12    attention over -- for an objection to be resolved, we have13    a different record.  In that case --14              QUESTION:  Why does it -- from the defendant's15    vantage point, why should it make a difference?  He's got16    a counsel who has betrayed his obligation.  He doesn't17    know anything.  The client doesn't know anything.  Why is18    Mickens, who has a lawyer who doesn't tell the court --19    why is -- would he be better off if the -- the judge knew20    or should have known than when nobody knows and he's21    totally in the dark?  From the defendant's point of view,22    the judge's knowledge isn't significant.  It's that he has23    a lawyer who is not totally able to represent him with24    undivided loyalty.25              MR. HARRIS:  Again, that is included within the                                  45                                                                                                                                 1    notion that we have one Sixth Amendment standard for 2    conflicts of interest regardless of whether or not the 3    trial judge was on notice of some facts that could have 4    prompted the inquiry, that we will go beyond that standard 5    in the circumstances such as Holloway where the attorney 6    himself has made it an essential fact of the case that he 7    has identified a conflict and impairment in his case. 8              The difference is not so much that the -- I 9    mean, I guess the -- the answer is the defendant is not10    entitled to a different or more lenient standard of review11    of his conflict claim, you know, because of the judge's12    failure to act on notice of additional facts.  It doesn't13    get us any closer to determining whether or not there14    actually was an infringement of his Sixth Amendment15    rights.  To assume it on the basis of a judge's failure to16    act on notice, it simply --17              QUESTION:  And what is -- what is the test for18    determining whether there was an impairment?  You're not19    saying you have to be able to show that the defendant20    might have been acquitted --212223    penalty.2425 MR. HARRIS:  No. QUESTION:  -- or might not have gotten the death MR. HARRIS:  No.  The -- QUESTION:  So, what is -- what is the nature of46                                      1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the impairment?          MR. HARRIS:  Well, the Court is using theadverse effect to -- as a -- as a lesser showing ofprejudice.  As an example, it is not so much that adefendant would have to show Strickland prejudice, areasonable probability of a different outcome, but hecertainly has to show the likelihood that trial counsel'sconduct or assessment of different defenses in the casewas affected, not --          QUESTION:  Thank -- thank you, Mr. Harris.          Mr. Gornstein, we'll hear from you.           ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN     ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,                 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT          MR. GORNSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          When a district court has reason to know about apotential conflict and fails to initiate inquiry, theSixth Amendment is violated only when there is a showingof an actual conflict and an adverse effect on the qualityof performance.  And we say that for three reasons.          First, it is a central tenet of this Court'sSixth Amendment jurisprudence that a Sixth Amendmentviolation does not occur unless there has been prejudiceto the defense.  It would be inconsistent with that basic47                                                                                            1    principle to set aside a jury verdict and order a new2    trial with all the societal costs that entails when --3              QUESTION:  I must interrupt you here, though.4    The prejudice standard under -- under Strickland is not5    the standard we're talking about here, is it?6              MR. GORNSTEIN:  It is not.  Under Sullivan,7    there has to be an adverse effect on the quality of8    performance, but it is still -- from that, there is9    inferred prejudice.  It would be inconsistent with the10    central thrust of showing some kind of prejudice to11    reverse a conviction, set aside it, and -- and order a new12    trial when there has been no showing that the quality of13    representation has been affected.14              And in Sullivan, the Court held --15              QUESTION:  Well, let me just push that all the16    way.  Supposing in -- in Holloway itself the judge said,17    well, I -- I really think you -- he thought it through and18    said, I think you could represent both.  Could he have19    just gone ahead and insisted on the lawyer representing20    them?21              MR. GORNSTEIN:  In -- in Holloway, if there's no22    inquiry conducted by the judge, there's automatic23    reversal.242548                                                                                                                                          QUESTION:  The question here is when does thejudge have a duty of inquiry. 1              MR. GORNSTEIN:  The judge -- 2              QUESTION:  Are you saying he never has a duty of 3    inquiry unless there's going to be actual prejudice? 4              MR. GORNSTEIN:  No.  I -- I think that what the 5    Court said in Wood about the duty of inquiry and -- and -- 6    this is somewhat vague, I will agree, but it said there 7    has to be a clear possibility of a conflict. 8              QUESTION:  All right.  Supposing there's a clear 9    possibility of prejudice, but no actual proof of10    prejudice, is that enough to impose a duty of -- of11    inquiry on the judge?12              MR. GORNSTEIN:  There's a duty of inquiry, but13    if the duty is not fulfilled and a trial is held and a --14    there's a conviction and the defendant is seeking to15    overturn his conviction, at that point the defendant still16    must show an actual conflict and an adverse effect on the17    quality of his representation.18              QUESTION:  We've been trying to find a way to19    distinguish Holloway from this case.  One way is to say20    that multiple representation is so fraught with21    difficulties that it's simply a separate category.22    Another is to say that the likelihood of an adverse effect23    is so significant, so serious that we'll presume it.24    Another is to say that the conflict itself is much more25    serious in most cases than -- how would you --49                                                                                                                                 1              MR. GORNSTEIN:  I would say that there would -- 2              QUESTION:  How would -- how would you have us 3    deal with Holloway? 4              MR. GORNSTEIN:  I would say that Holloway is a 5    special case where prejudice was presumed conclusively 6    based on two factors.  The first is that deference to the 7    contemporaneous judgment of counsel that he was operating 8    under a disabling conflict, and when he's representing 9    that he's operating under a disabling conflict, it's not10    just a representation that he has a conflict, but that11    this is going to affect his performance.  He's not going12    to be able to represent the defendant adequately.13              And the second is that prejudice inheres in the14    situation in which a judge orders a defense counsel, over15    his objection, to continue representation even though the16    attorney believes he is not going to be able to perform17    adequately.1819202122232425          And those two circumstances together create aper se rule of prejudice, and it's a carve-out from theSullivan rule.          QUESTION:  Does Wood stand for a similarproposition, or is Wood different?          MR. GORNSTEIN:  Now, Wood is a situation wherethe Sullivan rule was applied in a case in which there wasreason to know a clear possibility of an actual conflict.50                                                                                            1    And what the Court said in that circumstance is that the2    Constitution would be violated if it was found that the3    lawyer had a -- a conflict that influenced his basic4    strategic decisions.  And that is the same exact test as5    the Sullivan test.  There not only has to be a showing of6    an actual conflict but an effect on performance for there7    to be a Sixth Amendment violation.89 case. 10QUESTION:  Are you saying Wood is an effect111213141516171819202122232425          MR. GORNSTEIN:  It is both an actual conflictand effect.  That's what it directs when it says the wordsactual conflict --          QUESTION:  So, you're saying in this case if thelawyer had said to the judge, my client doesn't trust mebecause I -- I represented the decedent and he won't becandid with me, then the judge would have had a duty todischarge counsel.          MR. GORNSTEIN:  I'm not saying that they -- hewould have had a duty to discharge counsel.  He caninquire --          QUESTION:  Why would that case have beendifferent from Holloway?          MR. GORNSTEIN:  He can -- first of all, Hollowayis a situation where the lawyer himself is representingthat he cannot adequately represent --51                                                                                             1              QUESTION:  Correct.  It's because my client 2    doesn't trust me. 3              MR. GORNSTEIN:  Well, if he represents that he 4    cannot adequately represent the -- the defendant, and then 5    the district court has to conduct an inquiry.  And if the 6    inquiry reveals that in fact representation can be 7    adequately given, then the judge need not dismiss.  But if 8    the judge concludes that adequate representation cannot be 9    given, then the judge should dismiss.10              QUESTION:  No matter how severe the conflict.  I11    mean, no matter how -- in your view, no matter how severe12    the conflict, still unless you can show that it actually13    affected the lawyer's representation, it is not a14    constitutional error.15              MR. GORNSTEIN:  After a trial has been held and16    the defendant is seeking to overturn his conviction,17    that's correct.18              QUESTION:  Well, Strickland doesn't say that.19    Strickland says that it's important to maintain a fairly20    rigid rule of presumed prejudice for conflicts of21    interest.22232425MR. GORNSTEIN:  Yes, but Strickland goes on --QUESTION:  Should we change Strickland?MR. GORNSTEIN:  No.  No, because Strickland goeson to say that in that situation, prejudice is presumed                            52                                       1    only where there's been an actual effect on -- on 2    performance, both an actual conflict and an adverse effect 3    on performance.  What Strickland says is the defendant 4    doesn't have to show the additional burden that is -- that 5    is present in most Strickland cases of showing there's a 6    reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would 7    change.  But what -- Strickland reaffirms Cuyler v. 8    Sullivan, which requires both an actual conflict and an 9    effect -- an adverse effect on performance.10              QUESTION:  Suppose the victim were the fiance of11    the lawyer's niece and the lawyer was very close to the12    niece, and he says, I can't do this, judge.  I -- I can't13    represent this murderer.14              MR. GORNSTEIN:  Well, then you have a Holloway15    situation if the -- if the defendant -- defense counsel is16    representing that he's operating under a disabling17    conflict and the judge doesn't conduct an inquiry, then18    there's automatic reversal at that point.  That's the19    Holloway carve-out.20              QUESTION:  In the worst case, when the lawyer21    says nothing, you end up not getting rid of him -- I mean,22    or not -- assuming prejudice --23              MR. GORNSTEIN:  Well, there's a -- there's a --24              QUESTION:  But in the case where he's more25    honest about it and comes straightforward, then you're53                                                                                                                                 1    going to presume the prejudice. 2              MR. GORNSTEIN:  But that's because of the 3    reasons for Holloway have to do with the deferring to the 4    contemporaneous representation of a counsel that he is 5    operating under a disabling conflict and that is given 6    deference, together with the fact that when somebody is 7    ordered to -- to provide representation over his 8    objection, that a certain amount of prejudice inheres in 9    that.  And that's why the Holloway rule is as it is.10              And in this situation where that's not there and11    the defendant is seeking to obtain a new trial with all12    the societal costs that that entails, it is not too much13    of a burden for him to be able to identify a particular14    way in which --15              QUESTION:  Of course, the irony of the rule is16    that it gives greater protection when the lawyer is --17    conceals -- unethically conceals a known conflict than18    when he's candid with the court.19              MR. GORNSTEIN:  There's a certain amount --20              QUESTION:  And the argument -- that's the21    argument here, that in order to get the higher rate of --22    of fees for representing a defendant in a capital case, he23    didn't want it to be known that -- that he represented --24    you know, had this prior --25              MR. GORNSTEIN:  That -- that was the argument,54                                                                                                                                 1 2 3 4 5 6 7    inquiries. 8              And the argument that's being made here is that 9    you can skip the second step, and it's our submission that10    under Cuyler against Sullivan and under Wood and under11    this Court's general Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, there12    has to be a showing of an adverse effect on the quality of13    representation.14              If the Court has nothing further.15              QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Gornstein.16              Mr. Wagner, you have 3 minutes left.17               REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT J. WAGNER18                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER19              MR. WAGNER:  Thank you, Your Honor.20              The thrust of the respondent's argument here is21    that Holloway stands for the proposition that if a defense22    attorney raises an objection to the court and the court23    compels that representation over that objection, then that24    is where the prejudice is presumed.25              If you take this argument to its logical55                                                                                                                                but the district court found against the --          QUESTION:  I understand that.          MR. GORNSTEIN:  -- against the defendant on bothof those points.  The district court carefully examinedthe questions of whether there was a conflict and whetherthere was an adverse effect.  Those were the correct 1    conclusion, then anytime a defense attorney raises an 2    objection on the basis of a conflict to a court and the 3    court compels that representation over that objection, 4    then prejudice should be presumed.  In other words, when 5    you have a situation where a defense attorney raises an 6    objection to the court, the court properly inquires of 7    that defense attorney about that conflict and properly 8    finds that there is no debilitating conflict here and then 9    requires that -- that defense attorney to proceed with the10    representation, then under what the respondents say here,11    prejudice should be presumed.12              That's not what Holloway stands for.  Holloway13    stands for the proposition that the trial court has the14    duty of protecting the essential rights of the defendant.15    The trial court has the duty of seeing that the Sixth16    Amendment rights of a defendant are protected.  And in17    this case, the trial court failed in that responsibility.18    It knew or should have known of that conflict, failed to19    inquire into that conflict and that's where the prejudice20 lies here.21              I thank the Court.22              CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Wagner.23              The case is submitted.24              (Whereupon, at 11:00 a.m., the case in the25    above-entitled matter was submitted.)56
