Raymond Levi          I have misplaced my -- here we go.  Mr. Coleman.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY S. COLEMAN                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. COLEMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          Before Raymond Cobb confessed to murderingMaggie and Korie Rae Owens, he was more than oncemeticulously informed of his right to counsel and theconsequences of his choice to waive that right.  Hisconfession was properly admitted at trial and should  nothave been rejected under Jackson, because Sixth Amendmentright to counsel had never attached to the murders andtherefore did not need to be waived, or, alternatively,because Cobb validly waived whatever Sixth Amendment rightto counsel had attached.          Applying McNeil's rule of offense specificity toexclude factually related but uncharged crimes from thescope of Sixth Amendment attachment is true to and, wethink, required by both the text and the purposes of theSixth Amendment.3 1              In evaluating attachment, the court is 2    interpreting the Sixth Amendment terms, criminal 3    prosecutions and the accused, and for decades this Court 4    has consistently interpreted that text to limit attachment 5    of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel to the formal 6    initiation of judicial criminal proceedings.  Indeed, 7    setting aside Escobido -- 8              QUESTION:  Mr. Coleman, do I understand from 9    what you just said that if everything had occurred in10    Walker County, if there had been no moving of Cobb to11    Odessa, no bail, everything happens in Walker County, and12    it really is a point that you represent Cobb, the Walker13    County law enforcement personnel never consult Ridley14    before interrogating Cobb repeatedly, it would still be,15    in your view, no violation of any Sixth Amendment right;16    is that correct?17              MR. COLEMAN:  The fact that the interrogation18    occurred in Odessa makes no difference, you're exactly19    right.  If Ridley had been appointed on the burglary and20    had not yet been appointed on the murders because there21    had been no indictment, the police were free to22    interrogate Mr. Cobb.23              QUESTION:  So what the police did was something24    they didn't need to do.  In other words, the police did25    twice call Ridley while he, while Cobb was still in Walker41 County. 2              MR. COLEMAN:  That is correct. 3              QUESTION:  Twice called him and said, is it okay 4    if we question your client, and Ridley said yes both 5    times, but that was something extra the police did they 6    were not required to do, in your view? 7              MR. COLEMAN:  That's correct.  I don't think 8    that they were obligated to do it.  I don't think that 9    they called.  I think the record indicated that, in fact,10    he was in court with Ridley when they asked if they could11    talk, and so he was there.12              QUESTION:  But in any event, they did tell him,13    we're going to talk to your client, is it okay, and he14 said yes?15              MR. COLEMAN:  Yes.16              QUESTION:  Taking Justice Ginsburg's question a17    little bit further, suppose you have this situation:  the18    counsel is there, they begin questioning him on the19    break-in.  The police then say, counsel, we'd like to see20    you outside a minute, and they go outside of the21    interrogation room and they say, counsel, you know, we're22    not interested in the stereo, we're interested in the23    murder.  Could a responsible attorney say, oh, well, I'm24    not representing him on that, go back in the room, ask him25    all the questions you want?  I would be amazed if an5 1    attorney could do that. 2              MR. COLEMAN:  I don't know if it would be a 3    responsible thing to do, but the Court made clear in Davis 4    that until there's been an initiation of criminal 5    proceedings the Sixth Amendment constitutional right to 6    counsel doesn't attach, so it would be poor practice, 7    perhaps malpractice, but not a Sixth Amendment violation. 8              QUESTION:  Well, a number of courts have come to 9    the conclusion that where the two crimes arise out of the10    same conduct and are closely related, that you're going to11    go ahead and apply the Sixth Amendment requirement to the12    related but yet-uncharged crime.  Is that the majority13    view of lower courts today?14              MR. COLEMAN:  I don't think that courts have15    established any kind of consistent test, but yes, most of16    the courts that have addressed this issue have said there17    is this test, although most of them have found that there18    is, in fact, no violation.  It's a relatively small19    number that have found a violation.20              But we would go back and say that they're21    erroneous in applying that test at all, and as I was22    saying, Escobido aside, this Court has never, ever held23    that the Sixth Amendment attached prior to the initiation24    of formal judicial proceedings, prior to indictment or25    arraignment.6 1              QUESTION:  Well, under the hypothetical we were 2    just discussing and the answer you gave to Justice 3    O'Connor, I suppose the police could say, and we're now 4    going to question him about that murder so we want you out 5    of the room.  You can't go back in that room. 6              MR. COLEMAN:  Under Moran that might be 7    constitutionally permissible, but remember, the important 8    aspect of the analysis is what happens in the room, 9    because the defendant does have a Fifth Amendment right to10    counsel that he needs to be informed about, and he has an11    opportunity to waive that, so that would only happen if12    the defendant or suspect has actually waived his Fifth13    Amendment right to counsel.14              QUESTION:  That's true.  What I'm concerned15    about is the possibility for some manipulation, if the16    police hold and charge on the lesser offense merely to17    bide their time until they begin questioning about the18    more serious offense.19              MR. COLEMAN:  I'm actually very anxious, Justice20    Kennedy, to debunk this idea of abuse or manipulation,21    because when the police are doing an investigation, and22    they might be investigating a number of related crimes,23    once they have enough evidence to convict, admissible24    evidence to convict on one of them, there's certainly no25    problem with them bringing that charge.7 1              They have a serious societal interest in 2    continuing to investigate other crimes, but if you compare 3    that defendant who has had one crime charged against the 4    defendant where they haven't brought any of the charges, 5    once you charge that defendant he has the right to counsel 6    that has now attached not only to the Fifth Amendment but 7    also the Sixth Amendment, and our system ensures that that 8    person will not only have a right to counsel but will 9    relatively quickly actually be represented by counsel, who10    will then, of course, advise the client as to the charged11    offense and almost certainly as to the uncharged offenses12    and will say, don't talk to the police about this charged13    offense or anything else and, in fact, Mr. Ridley had14    given that counsel to Mr. Cobb.  He simply didn't follow15    it.  But I don't think --16              QUESTION:  Well, that -- that isn't the --17              MR. COLEMAN:  -- there's a real serious risk of18    manipulation.19              QUESTION:  As I understand it, that isn't the20    advice that he gave him.  He -- there's no indication that21    I know of that he gave him any advice that he should not22    talk to the police about anything else.  He in fact said23    to the police sure, go ahead and talk with him about the24    murder.25              MR. COLEMAN:  In September 1995 --8 1              QUESTION:  Is -- just as a matter of fact, isn't 2    that correct? 3              MR. COLEMAN:  Yes. 4              QUESTION:  Okay. 5              MR. COLEMAN:  On two occasions he told the 6    police to go ahead and talk to them.  In September 1995, 7    when Cobb was returning to Odessa, Ridley said, here's my 8    card and my number. If the police try to contact you, call9 me.10              QUESTION:  Well, the obvious problem is the11    person is accused, or the police think he kidnapped,12    murdered and raped a person, or they think he distributed13    drugs, you know, and my first example could involve three14    separate crimes, my second example could involve15    possession, a telephone count, a distribution count, and16    if there was more than one person a conspiracy, all right?17    So the police indict the person for one of those four, or18    two of them, and he gets a lawyer, and the next minute19    they turn around and start asking him questions.  They20    say, oh, we were asking him about the other two.  It's all21    the same event.22              So I mean, what could a Constitution mean that23    creates that situation?  That's why every court has24    decided that it doesn't mean that.25              MR. COLEMAN:  Not every court, Justice Breyer.91 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  Well, I mean most.          MR. COLEMAN:  But that --          QUESTION:  What's the answer?  I mean, that -- Ithink my problem is what has led almost all the courts toadopt this fuzzier test, and what is the response to thatrather direct problem?          MR. COLEMAN:  I think if you can establishtrickery then you create a Fifth Amendment issue, becauseit is the Fifth Amendment and not the Sixth Amendment thatgoes primarily to the issue of coercion.          QUESTION:  It won't be trickery.  If the rule isyou cannot -- you know, the counsel relates only to theoffense charged, there's no trick involved.  The police,in total good faith, go and ask the same set of questionsrelating to the kidnapping without telling the counsel.There's no trick, and that seems not a trick, it seems1011121314151617    absurd.18              MR. COLEMAN:  I don't believe that it is.  I19    believe that the police have a strong societal interest in20    continuing to investigate crimes that have not yet been21    solved, just as the police were trying to solve two22    murders in this case.  They suspected Cobb but they had no23    evidence, and I don't think that the Constitution,24    particularly the Sixth Amendment, prevents the police from25    going back in and interrogating  --1012345678    offense-specific?9              MR. COLEMAN:  McNeil specifically does say that          QUESTION:  And the lower courts have all agreedwith you.  They've all agreed with you, if it's actually aseparate crime.          MR. COLEMAN:  I don't believe that the fact thatthere is a factual connection between the crimes makes anyconstitutional difference, distinction.QUESTION:  Well, doesn't McNeil say that it's10    it's offense-specific and that should be interpreted, as I11    was arguing, to exclude factually related crimes, because12    factually related crimes are in no better position to13    receive those kinds of constitutional protections that the14    Sixth Amendment gives than are unrelated crimes.15              This Court has said that the purpose of the16    Sixth Amendment is to protect the unaided layman at17    critical confrontations with his expert adversary, the18    Government, after the adverse positions of the Government19    and the defendant have solidified with respect to a20    particular alleged crime.21              There are three parts of that statement that22    this Court has given in several cases that can't be23    satisfied by a factually related crime.  Certainly the24    particular alleged crime doesn't meet it.  We don't think25    that there's a solidification of the adverse positions11 1    with respect to factually related crimes.  The police are 2    stili investigating a related crime.  They don't know if 3    the defendant did it or not.  Generally speaking they 4    won't have sufficient evidence to bring that charge, 5    certainly there was not sufficient evidence in this case, 6    and so there's no solidification, and there is not a 7    critical confrontation, which has been defined to be a 8    critical stage, which is a very well-established part of 9    this Court's Sixth Amendment jurisprudence.  There's10    simply no critical stage because it is pre-indictment.11              QUESTION:  Mr. Coleman, would it make any12    difference to you if the other crime about which he's13    being interrogated is not only factually related but,14    under the Blockburger test, would be a greater offense of15    which the offense on which he's indicted is a lesser-16    included offense?  That is to say, he has an attorney on a17    burglary charge, and he's interrogated concerning the18    offense of murder in the course of burglary.19              MR. COLEMAN:  We have argued, and it is our20    position, that if it is not simply a factually related21    crime, but the argument is that it is the same crime, then22    we think that there's a strong argument the Sixth23    Amendment would, in fact --24              QUESTION:  Well, it's not quite the same crime,25    but if he got acquitted on the burglary he'd have to be12 1    acquitted on murder in the course of burglary.  I mean, 2    Blockburger would cover it and it would be double 3    jeopardy.  So in that case you'd say he could not be 4    interrogated without consulting his lawyer concerning 5    murder in the course of burglary? 6              MR. COLEMAN:  We would say that this Court's 7    rule would prohibit the introduction of evidence relating 8    to that interrogation. 9              QUESTION:  Why?  Now, why is that, because it10    satisfies the, or doesn't satisfy the Blockburger test?11    That's quite a burden to put on a police officer.  I mean,12    we have a hard enough time applying that test ourselves,13    and to say that the police officer would be responsible14    for a Blockburger analysis really is quite demanding.15              MR. COLEMAN:  We think that the Court recognized16    in Moulton that when the police interrogate suspects17    they're frequently trying to get evidence about any number18    of crimes, and one of those might be a previously charged19    crime, and that is why the Court has very consistently20    said that the remedy we're going to impose is simply that21    if you get evidence as to a charged crime for which the22    Sixth Amendment has attached and been asserted, then we23    will not allow you admitted at trial but if you have24    evidence related to other, uncharged crimes, and we would25    say also factually related uncharged crimes, then you may131 admit it. 2              So it's not the police that are really having to 3    make a hard determination at the time that they do the 4    interrogation.  That is made later, when you try to 5    introduce the evidence at trial. 6              QUESTION:  Well, I think it's become even 7    harder.  I assume the police officer ought to know that if 8    he has a constitutional right to interrogate or not, and 9    you say well, maybe he does, maybe he doesn't, depending10    on what the defendant says.  That -- we've never given11    that insufficient guidance to the police.12              MR. COLEMAN:  Well, Clanky is the only case we13    think in which there was actually the same offense, and we14    think that if the police are still investigating, or they15 believe --16              QUESTION:  What was the name of the case you17    said, Clanky?18              MR. COLEMAN:  Clanky v. Illinois.  I'm sorry.19    It's an Illinois Supreme Court case applying the factual20    relation test.21              The police are still investigating other crimes22    for which no charge has been made.  We think that they23    have at that point -- and that's all they need to know.24    They can then interrogate the suspect, give them their25    Fifth Amendment rights, and do what they can to protect14 1    those, and then if they end up getting information about a 2    charge that has been -- a crime that has been charged and 3    for which the Sixth Amendment has both attached and been 4    asserted, then they can't use it at trial, but they can 5    use it, under Moulton and under this Court's precedents, 6    for any uncharged crime, a crime for which the Sixth 7    Amendment had not yet attached at the time of the 8    interrogation. 9              But what respondent would have the court do is10    make the court, make the police apply a test that asks the11    police to know ahead of time if the crime for which they12    are going to interrogate the suspect relates to something13    that the suspect has previously been charged, or with14    respect to something that the suspect and his counsel may15    feel that there is an attorney-client relationship, and we16    don't think that that can be the test.17              QUESTION:  Mr. Coleman, there are -- there's18    quite a range.  There's one, the McNeil case itself, where19    the uncharged offenses were wholly unrelated, different20    time, different place, and here you have one continuous21    episode.  Don't most courts, if I understand them22    correctly, think that if there is a close relationship23    between the offenses, if they're all part of one series of24    events, that the Sixth Amendment right would attach?25              MR. COLEMAN:  The fact that there is a close15 1    relationship cannot overcome the fact that that closely 2    related crime cannot fit within the stated purposes of the 3    Sixth Amendment, and the fact that it would improperly and 4    unnaturally hamstring the police's legitimate efforts to 5    investigate and solve a crime for which no one has been 6    brought to justice. 7              QUESTION:  Mr. Coleman, as I understand your 8    argument on why the permissibility of this kind of 9    interrogation for related offenses is not likely to cut10    back, in effect, on the Sixth Amendment right which has11    attached, your best argument seems to be that you don't12    have to recognize a Sixth Amendment right here because13    there's going to be, as there was in this case, an14    adequate warning that one doesn't have to speak, and an15    adequate Fifth Amendment opportunity to get a lawyer,16    probably the same one, but in any case to get a lawyer17    prior to the commencement or continuation of any18    interrogation.19              Do you agree that's probably your strongest20    response to the concerns expressed by people like Justice21    Breyer?2223242516          MR. COLEMAN:  I believe so, and I believe that'sexactly what the Court said in Patterson when itindicated --QUESTION:  Right.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. COLEMAN:  -- that the reason to have counselat a custodial interrogation for Sixth Amendment purposesis not any stronger than it is for Fifth Amendment, andthe Fifth Amendment --          QUESTION:  What about --          MR. COLEMAN:  -- test protects them.          QUESTION:  I'm sorry.  What about, then, theconcern for noncustodial interrogations?  If the personwho has been charged with the first offense is out onbail, and the police want to go and interrogate, simplysee if they can strike up a conversation with a guy at hisapartment, we're not going to get -- I presume we're notgoing to get into any Miranda rights.          Isn't the opportunity for abuse there, so thaton your best argument, if the police are subtle about whatthey do, and they have a defendant who's not in custody,they will, in fact, raise the, I think the specter ofcutting back on the Sixth Amendment right with respect tothe crime that has already been charged.          MR. COLEMAN:  The Court in Patterson made itclear that, as to the charged offense for which the SixthAmendment has attached, there must be an express waiver,so that is why --          QUESTION:  So that there would be an exclusionif anything were said about that offense?171 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. COLEMAN:  If there was no valid waiver forthe charged offense.  I think that's the meaning of thisCourt's decision in Patterson and Moulton.          QUESTION:  And that would be enforceable by theexclusionary rule?          MR. COLEMAN:  Yes.          QUESTION:  Okay.          MR. COLEMAN:  If I may, I'd reserve the rest ofmy time for rebuttal.          QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Coleman.          Ms. Blatt, we'll hear from you.              ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT     ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,                SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER          MS. BLATT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleasethe Court:          Police have a compelling interest ininvestigating uncharged crimes and in obtaining voluntaryconfessions from suspects who have been advised of theirright to counsel under Miranda and are willing to speak tothe police about those uncharged crimes.  That questioningdoes not violate the Sixth Amendment right to counselbecause that right is offense-specific.          Under that rule, the statements may not be usedto prove the charged offense, but the statements are18 1    admissible in a trial for the uncharged offenses.  It does 2    not matter, under this rule, whether the two crimes are 3    factually related.  The test is rather whether the two 4    crimes constitute the same offense. 5              QUESTION:  Why?  Why?  I mean, you see my 6    problem from what I said before, don't you?  I mean, crime 7    is ambiguous as to whether you're describing a set of 8    events in the world, or a legal concept. 9              Look at the set of events in the world.  It10    would have all been over in 15 seconds, and it could11    constitute any one of 15 crimes, and the police charge on12    the basis of that 15 seconds of real-world behavior three13    crimes, and he gets a lawyer for those three.  Why should14    the police be able, without a lawyer, to interrogate him15    about what happened in the real world because there are16    eight other things that weren't charged?17              MS. BLATT:  Because the Sixth Amendment, the18    text of the Sixth Amendment only applies to someone who19    has been accused in a pending prosecution, and the20    prosecution is limited by the actual offenses that are21    charged by the State, and it is only at that time that the22    right to counsel attaches under the Sixth Amendment.23              QUESTION:  So it's purely formal.  Your argument24    is purely formal.25              MS. BLATT:  No.  This Court has repeatedly191    recognized that the requirement that there must be a shift2    from investigation to accusation is more than just a3    formalism, because the purpose and the essence of the4    Sixth Amendment is to make sure the defendant has an5    opportunity to consult with counsel and prepare for a6    defense against the pending charges.7              A suspect has no Sixth Amendment right to8    counsel, to have a lawyer appointed or assist him in9    connection with charges that have not been brought by the10    State, that may never be brought by the State.  The11    suspect has never indicated any unwillingness to talk to12    the police about those uncharged offenses.13              QUESTION:  Ms. Blatt, you gave the example, or I14    think your brief indicates that you would support the15    example that if the crime for which the person is already16    charged is burglary, and they can't ask him about the17    homicide at the time of burglary because that would be a18    greater -- that would be the same crime, yes, in that19    legal sense that we understand for double jeopardy20    purposes.2122232425          But this has got to be administered by policeofficers, and a police officer will say gee, homicide is alot different from burglary.  I don't understand when it'sokay and when it isn't.MS. BLATT:  The same elements test under                  20 1    Blockburger leads to consistent and predictable results, 2    and can be ascertained ahead of time by the police 3    officer, and if he needs to consult with the prosecutor, 4    he can do that. 5              By contrast, pegging the Sixth Amendment right 6    to a transaction test leaves police officers in the 7    untenable position of not knowing before they question the 8    suspect what -- 9              QUESTION:  Well, I would think the lay person10    would understand, it all happened in the same episode,11    more readily than would understand Blockburger.12              MS. BLATT:  He may not know that.  It may be13    that they know that there's been a burglary and that there14    are missing bodies, but have no idea whether those victims15    were murdered by someone else 2 weeks from then, whether16    there had been a kidnapping, whether it was in a different17 location.18              I mean, he can't possibly know ahead of time,19    without talking to the suspect, nor can a court ask at the20    time of appointment of counsel, would you mind telling me21    everything you did as part of the same transaction so I22    can make sure you're appointed counsel with respect to all23    possible offenses that may be brought against you.  They24    just -- they don't know that.  They're in a phase of25    investigation, and this case is a perfect illustration of211 that. 2              There's no contention in this case the State 3    manipulated the charges when they indicted him for 4    burglary and 15 months later questioned him about the 5    murder, nor is there any suggestion that they had enough 6    proof at the time that they charged him with burglary to 7    charge him with murder, and there's a hypothetical 8    assertion that there might be incentives for selective 9    manipulation, but we don't believe that those incentives10    necessarily exist.11              Once the State initiates a prosecution, the12    suspect will not only be afforded the right to counsel,13    but at the time that he's approached, if he's in custody,14    he will be given his Fifth Amendment Miranda warnings and,15    under this Court's decision in --16              QUESTION:  May I ask this question?  It seems to17    me it's not the question of when the lawyer was appointed,18    but what is the scope of the representation by the lawyer19    who has been appointed.20              Assume a lawyer is paid $20 an hour by the State21    for representing a defendant.  He's appointed then to22    represent him in the robbery charge, then he talks to the23    client, the client says, there's a lot of other stuff I24    think you ought to know in order to represent me well, and25    then he goes and interviews him at great length about all22 1    these things that happened in the same transaction, but 2    they've never been indicted.  Would that lawyer be 3    entitled to be paid for the time he spent on questioning 4    about the related crimes? 5              MS. BLATT:  I think to the extent that the -- 6    yes, and to the extent that the defense relates to the 7    pending charge. 8              QUESTION:  It has no relation to the pending 9    charge, except it was part of the same bunch of10    transactions.11              MS. BLATT:  If he said to his lawyer, I also12    murdered these two people, I think it would be perfectly13    clear that the -- if the defendant went off and started14    researching capital sentencing procedures under Texas law15    he very well might not get paid for that.  He was16    appointed to represent his client on the burglary charge.17    He certainly can take on a scope of representation that's18    greater than that, and can work out an arrangement with19    his client to get paid for that.20              QUESTION:  So he's -- the lawyer, the good,21    conscientious lawyer would say, well, don't talk to me22    about that because I'm not going to get paid for any23    advice I give to you on that, on those matters?24              MS. BLATT:  No, he certainly will want to talk25    to his client with respect to the conduct that constituted23 1    the offense for which he's been charged, and there might 2    be other things he needs to know about. 3              QUESTION:  But if it doesn't survive the 4    Blockburger test, the fact that it happened at the same 5    time, that wouldn't justify the lawyer spending any time6 on it? 7              MS. BLATT:  He will need to spend whatever time 8    is necessary to defend him on the pending charge ,but he's 9    certainly free to tell his client, I'm not competent to10    represent you in a death penalty case and you ought to11    retain separate counsel for that offense, and moreover,12    you haven't even been charged with that offense.13              In all these cases where there is a pending14    charge, the court in McNeil and in Moulton represented --15    excuse me, recognized the compelling interest that the16    police have in investigating and solving uncharged17    offenses, and if the suspect never indicates any18    unwillingness to talk to the police about those offenses,19    there's no basis for excluding what is concededly a20    voluntary confession to those crimes that might otherwise21    go unsolved.22              The other thing I wanted to say, just about the23    Blockburger test, is that this Court, in the context of24    double jeopardy and the lesser-included offenses context,25    has recognized that that test is workable, and is24 1    predictable, and can lead to consistent results. 2              QUESTION:  Workable in court from double 3    jeopardy determinations; workable when you're talking 4    about the police officer, I'm less certain. 5              MS. BLATT:  I think the police officer can 6    certainly ascertain immediately what the pending charge 7    was against the suspect, and if he has any questions about 8    the elements test he can certainly ask a prosecutor, but 9    generally the police can be advised, as this Court10    recognized in Moulton, that it's okay to approach a11    suspect that's under indictment about additional crimes,12    and so the question just simply becomes, what's a separate13    offense, and that's a lot easier question than, is it14    possible that the suspect may say something that's so -- a15    court may or may not later deem inextricably intertwined,16    such that the statements can't be used.17              If there are no other questions --18              QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Blatt.19              Mr. Greenwood, we'll hear from you.20                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY E. GREENWOOD21                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT22              MR. GREENWOOD:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it23    please the Court:24              We are asking only that this Court follow its25    prior precedents in Brewer and Maine v. Moulton.  We don't25123456789    offense?want to expand any constitutional application.          QUESTION:  Well, but we've said in McNeil thatit's offense-specific --          MR. GREENWOOD:  Yes, ma'am.          QUESTION:  -- this Sixth Amendment right, andhere there was at the time of the burglary charge noevidence of the murder -- the murders, or the defendant'sconnection with them, so why isn't that a separate10              MR. GREENWOOD:  Your Honor, in looking at the11    Court's, initially the Fifth Amendment cases on the right12    of counsel and then the stair-stepping and the filling in13    of the blanks of the various phases where counsel has come14    in, as we've all had to do in the research for these15    cases, and we get to McNeil -- and we have no problem with16    McNeil.  McNeil makes sense in the context in which it was17    written.1819202122    you?23242526          QUESTION:  Well, how about its statement thatSixth Amendment right is offense-specific?MR. GREENWOOD:  Your Honor, in --QUESTION:  You have to go beyond that, don't          MR. GREENWOOD:  Your Honor, I can -- under -- inthe context of the way, the facts of McNeil, I can seethat statement being legitimately and perfectly 1    reasonable, but McNeil -- 2              QUESTION:  But it's a categorical statement. 3              MR. GREENWOOD:  Yes, Your Honor, it is. 4              QUESTION:  So you are asking us to go beyond our 5    cases.  You're asking us to distinguish McNeil and very 6    sharply limit it. 7              MR. GREENWOOD:  No, Your Honor.  That statement, 8    taken in separation with the facts of McNeil and the 9    issues presented I think are really different, and I10    recognize -- we've reviewed you all's decisions,11    concurring and dissenting opinions here, and we understand12    you all's concerns about that, but in our view, in13    starting with McNeil, the Wisconsin Supreme Court, the14    question before them was unrelated offenses, and this15    Court granted cert on unrelated offenses, and during the16    argument of counsel the Government on at least three17    separate occasions in McNeil, and we've got their18    transcripts, said this is -- the situation here is19    completely separate and distinct offenses, different20    counties, different victims, different facts.21              QUESTION:  Yes, but you can limit any one of our22    opinions in that respect to say, you know, this happened23    on a Tuesday and not on a Wednesday, but we employ24    statements as to what we think the law is and so on in25    deciding these cases, and it isn't always limited just to271 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the particular facts.          MR. GREENWOOD:  That's true, Your Honor, and --but it just, from our viewpoint, even though McNeil makessense as to separate and distinct offenses, when you lookat Brewer, and Moulton, and the interrelated, intertwineddefenses, to us you just simply cannot say, well, the lineof Brewer just stopped, because --          QUESTION:  What is your definition of, quote,intertwined, close quote, or interrelated, close quote?          MR. GREENWOOD:  In looking at all of thesethings and trying to make a decision, the simplest andeasiest definition we got to is just the related offenses,where those that occur in one single immediate transactionand incident.          QUESTION:  Well, okay.  What is a -- you know,this doesn't make it any easier.  What's a transaction?What's an incident?          MR. GREENWOOD:  Okay.  Well, transaction isdefined -- is not even defined under Texas joinder law, soyou get a dictionary out, but at the same immediatetemporal time and place.          QUESTION:  And you think this case meets thatdefinition --          MR. GREENWOOD:  Yes, sir.          QUESTION:  -- of the same time?28MR. GREENWOOD:  Absolutely.12345678    it.9              Mr. Coleman has essentially two responses to          QUESTION:  Mr. Greenwood, I think your, sort ofyour strongest argument is that, if you don't recognizethe scope of the right as you argue for it, that the riskthat the Sixth Amendment right in the -- with respect tothe first offense will be infringed is simply too great,and you cannot run that risk, and this is the way to avoid10    that, and I'd like you to comment on them.  The first11    response is that if the subsequent interrogation is a12    custodial one, the Miranda warnings are going to be there,13    and they functionally will assuage your concern and that14    in any event, even in a noncustodial case and, a fortiori,15    in the custodial case, if, in fact, there is a violation16    of Sixth Amendment right with respect to the first17    offense, any evidence so given will be excluded with18    respect to the first offense.  And he in effect says,19    these two avenues of warning or relief are sufficient to20    reduce the concern about the risk that you raise.  How do21    you respond?22              MR. GREENWOOD:  Initially, Your Honor, one of23    the concerns that I have is, as the Chief Justice wrote in24    one of his dissenting opinions, I think in Moulton,25    correct me if I'm wrong, that there has not been in the291    past wholesale violation of Sixth Amendment problems by2    law enforcement.  I think to allow -- but over the years3    in this, these more than two decades of cases that dealt4    with this related offense concept have generally kept the5    police away from the defendant in these related contacts,6    so you haven't had wholesale --7              QUESTION:  Right, but let's assume we no longer8    have that regime, but we have the regime that your brother9    argues for and he says the two safeguards are Miranda in10    custodial cases, exclusion in noncustodial cases if the11    interrogation strays into the evidence on the first12    offense.13141516171819202122232425          MR. GREENWOOD:  The immediate, most immediateconcern I have is that a statement by this Court that thatis permissible will encourage police officers to makethose contacts.          QUESTION:  Let's assume that it does.  Let'sassume that no, this relatedness test is not the propertest, there's going to be more interrogation.          MR. GREENWOOD:  Absolutely.          QUESTION:  We're all assuming that.  Now, whyare his two safeguards going to be insufficient?          MR. GREENWOOD:  Under the facts of this case,and because the -- and I must preface this just briefly.This can be a complicated situation, with regard to Sixth301 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Amendment and the related offenses, and that's why most ofthe courts of appeals, Fifth Circuit and Third Circuit,have devised a list of factors, totality of thecircumstances, which we think are necessary.          Having said that, in this case, for example, youhave a long-term, 17 months or more, attorney-clientrelationship.  Counsel has been dealing with the courts,actively filing motions.  He has been dealing with thedistrict attorney, theoretically, with law enforcementconcerning this immediate burglary, but everybody knowsthere's these other potential crimes out there.  They'restill investigating them.          QUESTION:  What about the circumstance of, Ididn't know that the word, offense-specific, in McNeil,whether it referred to something on paper --          MR. GREENWOOD:  Right.          QUESTION:  -- namely, the definition of a crime,or something in the world, such as the robber entering thebank, hitting the teller and taking the money, which, ofcourse, could be one of several crimes.          MR. GREENWOOD:  Yes, sir.  Thank you for fillingin the --          QUESTION:  Well, I don't want you just to acceptit because maybe what I've just said is wrong.          QUESTION:  Well, take it, Mr. Greenwood.  Take                            311 it. 2345 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425(Laughter.)          MR. GREENWOOD:  Youur Honor, in dealing with allthis, we have looked at the term transaction, becausethat's a series of acts of conduct which can have oneoffense or dozens.  The term crimes means different thingsin this context.  The term --          QUESTION:  Mr. --          MR. GREENWOOD:  -- offenses does, and I don'twant to get into a semantic battle with you all.  You allare the experts in that, and need to write this thing.          QUESTION:  It's what we do.          MR. GREENWOOD:  Right.          QUESTION:  Can I get back to your description ofwhat was going on here?  The man had a lawyer, the policehad dealt with him over many cases.  What I can'tunderstand about your case, or about the rule that you'reurging upon us, is why it makes a difference that theother offense was factually related, was simultaneous.          I mean, I can understand the position that,look, once a man has a lawyer -- I have a lawyer forembezzlement.  I'm a stockbroker, and I'm charged withhaving embezzled on May 13th.  I'm charged with anentirely separate embezzlement -- or, I'm interrogatedabout an entirely separate embezzlement on May 14th.  I32 1    would feel just as strongly as you do about, well, it's 2    only fair they know the man has a lawyer, they shouldn't 3    go to him without going to his lawyer. 4              They know the man has a lawyer to represent him 5    vis-a-vis the police.  What difference does it make 6    whether it's factually related or not, if you're going to 7    appeal to that, I don't know, that feeling once you know a 8    guy has a lawyer, you ought to deal with his lawyer?  I 9    don't see that the factual relationship makes me feel any10    worse about it.11              MR. GREENWOOD:  Your Honor, I agree with that,12    but since --13              QUESTION:  Okay, well --14              MR. GREENWOOD:  Since McNeil, it does make a15    difference, and --16              QUESTION:  Well, I think unless we're going to17    go all the way down to the bottom of that slippery slope18    it makes sense to say what you have a lawyer for is for19    the charge, and that the choice is between saying you have20    a lawyer for that charge, and the police can deal with you21    separately on any matter that is apart from that charge,22    and if you're not going to adopt that rule you really23    ought to jump all the way over to the rule that once24    you're represented by a lawyer with regard to this police25    department, with regard to matters that -- concerning this331 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425defendant, they ought to contact that lawyer foreverything they have to do with that defendant.          MR. GREENWOOD:  Well, and that's part --          QUESTION:  And that's a big extension of whatwe've said up to now.          MR. GREENWOOD:  In the decisions of the courtsof appeals on this issue dealing with the totality of thecircumstances, one of the important things in making surethat the concerns of the court with regard to reallyhamstringing law enforcement are not overdone, is limitingit to a single criminal investigation in a jurisdiction bythe same type of law enforcement, and we'll go along withthat, because we can think of hypotheticals --          QUESTION:  What do you mean, you'll go alongwith it if we do that?  You don't have much choice.          MR. GREENWOOD:  No, I understand.          (Laughter.)          MR. GREENWOOD:  We will take that, Your Honor,as to a limitation.  There are limitations on this.McNeil, obviously, Koolman v. Wilson.  We concede in ourbrief that ongoing and future crimes should be exemptedfrom this related offense rule.          QUESTION:  It's not just an exemption.  You'vesaid that, I think, the law enforcement would be seriouslyhamstrung --341 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. GREENWOOD:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.          QUESTION:  -- if the simple fact that a personhad a lawyer stopped policemen from asking him questions.          MR. GREENWOOD:  Right.          QUESTION:  All right.  But that isn't true whereyou're talking about a single offense defined in terms ofwhat happens in the world, I take it.          MR. GREENWOOD:  That's correct.  That's correct,and we are afraid that if the Court follows thepetitioner's argument that, because of the ability of lawenforcement and prosecutors to charge in a matter ofdiscretion at their will, they can, in fact pick differentcrimes and then make dozens of confrontations with the1011121314    defendant.1516171819202122232425          For example, in this case --          QUESTION:  But to stop to ask a less friendlyquestion, I think what's worrying the department andothers is that once you depart from the definition ofoffense in terms of some words on paper, i.e., once youstart looking to what happened in the world, there's nogood way to define what is the same offense, and thereforethey get into a mess, and therefore we have six differentcircuits trying to do different things.          MR. GREENWOOD:  Right.          QUESTION:  And you say in response to that, no,35 1    there is a good way, and what is it? 2              MR. GREENWOOD:  I -- in the brief before the 3    Court of Criminal Appeals we followed the Third and Fifth 4    Circuits' totality of circumstances test, and followed it 5    right down the line with regard to that.  Any one of those 6    factors could have totally thrown off the analysis of this7 case. 8              QUESTION:  Of course, the problem that the law 9    enforcement has is not only that they don't know how to10    define what is a related offense, but that they also don't11    know whether the offense that they're inquiring about12    meets that definition or not.  That is a totally separate13    second problem which existed here.  They did not know14    whether the kidnapping was done at the same time as the15    murder, whether the two were related or not.16              It's a real problem, not just figuring out a17    definition, but also figuring out whether what they're18    asking about falls within that definition or not.  They19    won't know that until the facts are fully known.20              MR. GREENWOOD:  That is true, and in our attempt21    at definition to limit expansion of this concept any22    longer, is the transaction or incident in a temporal time23    and place seems to be the least expansive you can get, and24    most police officers --25              QUESTION:  What if the police here thought that                                  361    the kidnapping had occurred on a different day from the2    burglary, that he had done the kidnapping and the murder3    and then he'd gone back the next day and burglarized the4 place?5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. GREENWOOD:  I don't think under the factsyou could have gotten there, but assuming that --          QUESTION:  Is it enough that they thought thatand it turns out not to be the case, they're nonethelessnot violating the Sixth Amendment rights?          MR. GREENWOOD:  You would have -- if you hadsomething like that, you would have two separate crimes --          QUESTION:  I understand that.          MR. GREENWOOD:  -- really, as opposed to thesame transaction.          QUESTION:  No, but it didn't turn out that way.It turned out that they were both done on the same day.Now, but you're going to let the police off because theythought it was on separate days, right?          MR. GREENWOOD:  Oh, well, thought, but you see,if the facts show otherwise, then you have a set of factsthat can be analyzed.          QUESTION:  So they can't talk at all then,because even though they think it happened on a separateday and therefore, believing they're in full compliancewith the Sixth Amendment they interrogate the person371 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9without his lawyer, it turns out that they happened on thesame day, and all this evidence has to be thrown out.          MR. GREENWOOD:  I may have missed some of that,Your Honor, but law enforcement officers deal withtransactions and incidents daily --          QUESTION:  I understand.          MR. GREENWOOD:  -- and that, it seems to me,would be the easiest definition.          QUESTION:  Are you suggesting that what mattersis the reality, or what matters is what the interrogatorbelieves when he conducts the interrogation?          MR. GREENWOOD:  I will concede that at the timewhat he legitimately believes.          QUESTION:  Okay.          MR. GREENWOOD:  Yes.  That makes sense, under --in considering all this, because you could have a bizarrecircumstance when no one would know when certain crimes101112131415161718    occurred.19202122232425          QUESTION:   -- just not sure.  I mean, does hehave to know that it was at the same time, or suppose he'sin a state of complete agnosticism.  He doesn't know whenit occurred.          MR. GREENWOOD:  In --          QUESTION:  Is he violating the Sixth Amendment?          MR. GREENWOOD:  A police officer in a -- I38 1    cannot answer the question.  That -- I do not think of 2    that concept -- 3              QUESTION:  I can't, either. 4              MR. GREENWOOD:  But -- but, if I knew a police 5    officer who had no knowledge or intent, really -- I'm 6    trying to separate it from this case.  That's my 7    difficulty -- had really no knowledge that an 8    investigation was going on and that we want to interrogate 9    him about this serious crime, then I could see a judge10    under the totality-of-the-circumstances test saying,11    there's no either bad faith or negligence or intentional12    or even accidental violation of the Sixth Amendment.  I13    haven't been able to work out your factual question far14    enough down the line, sorry.15              But I do believe -- in this case, for example,16    in the Texas statutory scheme, this defendant could have17    been charged, well, with nine different capital crimes,18    and three of them, at least three of them are under19    statutorily different offenses which would have allowed20    prosecution under Blockburger, even though it's the same21    offenses, same exact conduct, and where -- we are22    concerned that under a circumstance where an attorney has23    been representing a defendant for a substantial length of24    time, and he consults and investigates on this limited,25    immediate transaction about various crimes, and he tells,39 1    and he consults the attorney about what we're going to do 2    -- for example, in the example it was asked if he was 3    arrested on one offense, he said, by the way, I killed two 4    other people. 5              Well, I know what I would do if I was his 6    counsel, and take all possible avenues to try to protect 7    him under my responsibility.  I give a lot of credence in 8    this whole issue here with the responsibility of the scope9 of counsel.10              In the McNeil argument one of the attorney --11              QUESTION:  Well, I know what you'd do, too.12    You'd say, take the Miranda advice seriously, refuse to13    answer any questions now, later, a week from now, a month14    from now, and then you're protected.  That's it.15              MR. GREENWOOD:  That, of course, is what their16    position is, Your Honor, and --17              QUESTION:  Isn't that implied by what you were18    just saying?  I mean, any prudent lawyer is going to say19    to his client, don't talk to them about anything, no20    matter what, unless I'm there, and why isn't that one of21    the answers to the concerns that you're raising?22              MR. GREENWOOD:  We believe that if the Court23    allows this continuous conduct where law enforcement can24    come in on a regular basis, in this case, literally dozens25    of times could have come back at Mr. Cobb to interrogate401 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425him about all the potential offenses, that it givescertain rise to complete abuse.          QUESTION:  But Mr. Greenwood --          QUESTION:  He can say no any time.  He canrefuse to talk to them.  His lawyer has advised him.          MR. GREENWOOD:  And we say they -- once he hascounsel, in these facts they know he has counsel, theyought to stay away from him.          QUESTION:  They -- first, the Odessa peopledidn't know he had counsel.          MR. GREENWOOD:  They didn't know.          QUESTION:  But there's another aspect to thisthat I hope you will address.  In this -- it seems to methat this case may not be a strong case for your position,even if we were to take a related-offense view of it.          As I understand Jackson, the purpose was to keepthe police from badgering a defendant, keep coming back athim and back at him, and even though he's been givenMiranda warnings, to wear down his will.  In this casethere was a considerable interval of time.  Defendant wasout of custody, he was living with his father, and in thatinterval he could have talked to his lawyer many times.When he has that interval why, in that case, isn't Mirandaenough, when he's not in custody where he's --          MR. GREENWOOD:  I still maintain that as long as                            41 1    that formal charge was pending, and the counsel 2    relationship continued, that when you throw law 3    enforcement into talking to the defendant without his 4    counsel, that you're still subjecting the defendant to 5    abuses because, primarily, of the Moran v. Burbine 6    decision that allows police officers to lie to the 7    defendants, and you're getting a conflict, more than 8    likely, which will encourage a conflict of statements 9    between what the lawyer's telling him and what the police10    officers are telling him.11              QUESTION:  I suppose, Mr. Greenwood, that your12    response to the contention that it ought to be enough that13    his lawyer tells him at the very beginning, look it, I'm14    only representing you on this crime, but you shouldn't15    talk to them about any other crime, you got that?  Yes.16    Yes.  Don't talk to them at all.  Yes, yes, I understand.17              The argument that that suffices, what's wrong18    with that is that if it suffices here it would have19    sufficed or ought to have sufficed in Michigan v. Jackson20    as well.  I mean, doesn't Michigan v. Jackson assume that21    that's not enough?  The lawyer's going to tell him, look22    it, I'm your lawyer now, don't talk to the police without23    me, and yet Michigan v. Jackson still says, even though24    the lawyer's told him that, if the police try to talk to25    him without him, it's a constitutional violation.421 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. GREENWOOD:  Right.          QUESTION:  So maybe Michigan v. Jackson iswrong.  I mean, if --          MR. GREENWOOD:  No, Your Honor.  We stillmaintain that Jackson is a proper continuation of SixthAmendment jurisprudence.          QUESTION:  And I suppose the same answer thatJustice Scalia just outlined for you is your answer to thequestion that I raised earlier about your brother'sargument.  If Miranda is good enough to protect him here,why wasn't Miranda good enough to protect him there?          MR. GREENWOOD:  We just believe that if you relyon this, the invocation of the Fifth Amendment on theserelated offenses, you're going to have officers, encouragethem to make more and more contact with the defendant andinvade that attorney-client relationship with falseinformation, which I think will lead to more abuses.          That's all the questions?          QUESTION:  Maybe -- well, this is just toclarify something that I had trouble understanding.          MR. GREENWOOD:  Yes.          QUESTION:  Suppose that a person is -- what'sthe law in the following situation?  The person, adefendant is put into custody, a suspect, he'sinterrogated.  He's told about his Miranda rights.  He43 1    gets a lawyer, and then he's not charged, all right?  He's 2    not charged. 3              The next day, although the police know he got a 4    lawyer, he has a lawyer, they call him back to question 5    him again without telling the lawyer.  Can they do that? 6              MR. GREENWOOD:  I think they could, Your Honor. 7              QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Greenwood. 8              MR. GREENWOOD:  Thank you, Your Honor. 9              QUESTION:  Mr. Coleman, you have 1 minute10    remaining.111213141516171819202122232425          REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY S. COLEMAN                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. COLEMAN:  I'd like to very quickly addressJustice Stevens' question about the scope ofrepresentation and real-world fact scenarios that areuncharged, and I think in both of those instances I can goback beyond the cases of this Court and say, those are notcriminal prosecutions, and that person has not beenaccused of those factually-related crimes, and the SixthAmendment by its own text simply does not apply in thosetypes of circumstances.          When -- and also, in both of thosecircumstances, if the defendant or the suspect isquestioned he can say, at the advice of his counsel, Idon't want to talk to you, in other words cuts him off.441              CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.2    Coleman.3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 1:52 p.m., the case in the above-entitled matter was submitted.)45
