Pamela Hood. Mr. Brand.ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL J. BRAND ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. BRAND: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:This Court's decisions recognize that even in subject areas where Article I grants Congress complete and exclusive authority to make laws, unconsenting States are still immune from suits by private parties.QUESTION: Well, let's talk a little bit about the notion that's raised in one or more of the amicus briefs, that a bankruptcy proceeding is akin to an in rem proceeding or is an in rem proceeding, such as might be the case in an admiralty suit where we would think the State would be bound. Now, would you address that argument, which I found possibly persuasive?MR. BRAND: Certainly, Your Honor. We would submit that there -- there is no authority from this Court supporting the view that there is an in rem exception from sovereign immunity in the bankruptcy context. The3, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 argument2 referred,3 Research,4 admiralty5 admiralty6 certainly78 bankruptcy context9 assembled in kind10 creditors share in11 consequences certainly if -- if your position were upheld.12 MR. BRAND: Well, Your Honor, although there13 certainly are in rem aspects to bankruptcy jurisdiction in14 the context of dealing with the property of the estate15 that is before the court and that is in the custody of the16 court, bankruptcy jurisdiction also embraces other --17 other aspects of in personam jurisdiction involving the18 parties and -- and personal relationships.19 QUESTION: Well, could we just stick with the in20 rem for a moment? Suppose there's a $100,000 on the usual21 free-for-all because there are more -- the -- the debts22 exceed that amount. The State gets notice. It decides23 it's not going to appear. The bankrupt is -- is24 discharged. At the very least, if the State then later25 sues on the debt, is the -- can the discharge be set up as4, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005instead is made by analogy, as Your Honor to the -- the admiralty case of Deep Sea but the Deep Sea Research case is limited to thecontext. law that 200 years QUESTION:It's limited to the special aspects of had developed over hundreds of years, of -- of our Nation's experience.Well, why doesn't it fit in the too where the debtor's assets are of an in rem proceeding and theit? It could have very unfortunate￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425a defense?MR. BRAND: Well, Your Honor, there -- there isauthority from -- from the lower courts that -- that it could in fact, and that in -- in that situation, the -­ the State might be bound by a general discharge order.QUESTION: Well, what -- what happened here was something where -- where a summons was issued to the State, wasn't it? It was -- the State didn't just remain outside and do nothing.MR. BRAND: Well, that's -- that's exactly right, Your Honor, and it also is a situation in which the State was not making a claim against the -- the property of the bankrupt estate.QUESTION: Yes. It's hard to think of a debt as partofares. I--Ican'tquite-­MR. BRAND: And that -­QUESTION: -- get that.And I understand, but just on the basic point ofwhether or not just for a discharge of a debt, the State can be bound, you say you think it might be plausible, but the State would be bound by the judgment if it later sues on the debt.MR. BRAND: I don't want to concede that point, Your Honor. I think there is authority certainly that would -- that could support that, and there are decisions5, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 from the -- from the circuit courts, particularly the2 Fourth, the Fifth, and the Ninth, which have held that a3 discharge order under those circumstances would be binding4 against the State. But each of those courts has also5 upheld sovereign immunity as a bar to a suit against a6 State as the State asserts in this case.7 QUESTION: But this is not a normal suit against8 the State. This is a suit in which the debtor seeks9 authority to get a discharge, isn't it?10 MR. BRAND: That's right, Your Honor, except11 that -­12 QUESTION: So the proceeding itself is to13 determine whether or not she's entitled to a discharge on14 the debt at issue.15 MR. BRAND: Yes. She is -- she has already16 received a bankruptcy discharge, a blanket discharge from17 debt. This is a proceeding to determine if this18 particular debt qualifies under that. And the way the19 statute is written, the way -- the way Congress has set20 this up is that the debt is presumptively21 nondischargeable. It is an exception from discharge until22 such point as the debtor establishes undue hardship, at23 which point the debt would be absolved and she would -­24 she would, in effect, have a discharge. But again, the -­25 by -- by the nature of the way the -­6, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: If she -- if she prevails in that disputed factual matter, then it will be just like any other discharge case. If -- if the hearing goes forward and she prevails as a matter of fact, then it would be just like any other discharge case, wouldn't it?MR. BRAND: No, it wouldn't, Your Honor. A normal discharge case would essentially not involve at all the adjudication of individual debts. The discharge is -­QUESTION: No. I'm saying if she prevails on the disputed issues of fact, thereafter it would be just like a normal discharge case.MR. BRAND: It --it--yes,ifI'm understanding, Your Honor. Yes, she would have, in effect, a discharge from that debt. Yes.QUESTION: Moreover, the -- the fact that this proceeding had to be brought against the State was purely a result of congressional disposition. Congress could have treated these debts to the State like all other debts, in which case they would have been automatically discharged.MR. BRAND: That's exactly right, Your Honor.QUESTION: So -- so that the -- the argument that the bankruptcy -- the in rem nature of the bankruptcy procedure gives -- gives her all the protection that the Constitution at least requires, vis-a-vis the State, it7, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 seems to me is a strong one. It's only because of the2 statute that -- that this action had to be brought. If3 Congress really wants to discharge her from debts to the4 State, it could have done so by simply treating the State5 like all other debtors.6 MR. BRAND: I think that's exactly right, Your7 Honor. The debt could be treated as a discharged debt, in8 which case the State would certainly be bound by the9 operation1011 objecting12 okay, we'll make it dischargeable, you will be worse off?13 In other words, Congress is trying to ameliorate the14 ordinary effect of the bankruptcy law to give the State an15 advantage. And your argument is to the effect of,16 Congress, you can treat us just like all the others, and17 we'll be worse off than we are now, but once you give us18 this favor, then you -- the -- the law is19 unconstitutional. You can't give us a favor. That seems20 to be the essence of your argument.21 MR. BRAND: No, Your Honor. I -- I would submit22 our argument -- our argument is not that the State is23 immune from the effect of the statute that would allow24 discharge upon showing of undue hardship. We would25 recognize that that is -- that is an appropriate part of8, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005of that law, but that is not -­QUESTION: Isn't it -- isn't it odd that you are to this proceeding where, if Congress then said,￼1 the -- of the exercise of Congress' bankruptcy power.2 Our issue is with the provisions which are there3 by virtue of the nature of the way that -- that exception4 is written and also by virtue of the bankruptcy rules that5 require that it be raised in the form of an adversary6 proceeding in which the State could be summoned into7 court, in bankruptcy court, anywhere in the country.8 MR. BRAND: Well, could it be adjudicated9 without an adversary proceeding, just say the debtor comes10 in and says, I'm giving notice to the State? If they want11 to come in, they can, but it's not -- it's -- I'm not12 going to call it or the statute doesn't call it a summons13 and complaint, doesn't14 just a proceeding to15 obligation.16 MR. BRAND:17 Scalia suggested, Congress could write a statute that18 would make a student loan dischargeable, more or less by19 operation of law, but we would submit that the way this20 statute is written -- and again, if we look -­21 QUESTION: I'm not asking about making it22 totally dischargeable, but Congress wants to achieve this23 result and sensitive to your concern. So it says, fine,24 we're going to make it nondischargeable unless the student25 shows undue hardship, but because the State doesn't want9, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005call it an adversary proceeding, establish the status of this￼Your Honor, I think as Justice1 to receive a summons and complaint, we're going to do it2 in a nonadversary proceeding. The student will establish3 it to the satisfaction of the bankruptcy court or not, and4 the State will be given notice but not a summons and5 complaint. Would that be satisfactory?6 MR. BRAND: Your Honor, I don't believe it7 would. I think that in substance that would be8 essentially the same as the adversary complaint that --9 that we're talking about here. And -- and under -- under10 Coeur d'Alene and -- and the discussion in other similar11 cases, the question here can't turn on the mechanics of12 the pleading or on the -- the style of the caption.13 QUESTION: So you -- you would have no problem14 with Congress' amending this statute so that it reads if15 the State chooses to waive its sovereign immunity, the16 debtor has to proceed in this manner. However, if the17 State refuses to waive its sovereign immunity by appearing18 in the proceeding, the debt will be automatically19 discharged. You -- you would have no problem with that, I20 take it.21 MR. BRAND: I'm not -- I'm not certain that that22 would not be the same type of statute that I -- I objected23 to a moment ago.24 QUESTION: No. I thought you accepted that a25 moment ago. I thought you accepted a moment ago that10, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Congress didn't have to provide this special treatment of2 the States at all. If Congress didn't have to provide it3 at all, certainly Congress could say if the State chooses4 not to -- not to take it, not to appear in the proceeding,5 we'll dispense with it. I -- it seems to me the greater6 includes the lesser.7 MR. BRAND: Well, I -- I agreed, Your Honor, and8 I still agree that -- that Congress could fashion a9 statute that would make student loans dischargeable in the10 same manner as -- as any other debt. And in -- in that11 case, it -- it would take place the same as any other12 debt. And of course, if -- if the State were to waive its13 sovereign immunity and enter into a bankruptcy proceeding14 and -- and voluntarily participate, then -- then it could15 do so and -- and the court could act accordingly without16 any special enabling legislation by Congress.17 QUESTION: I -- I don't understand what the18 statute has -- how the statute is involved in this. I19 mean, the statute just sets a standard for discharging a20 -- a student who has an educational loan. It says it has21 to be undue hardship. What's wrong with that? I mean,22 why can't -- there are dozens of statutes -- dozens of23 statutes that say -- I guess dozens. I'm not a bankruptcy24 expert, but statutes that say you get this kind of a25 discharge if there hasn't been a fraudulent conveyance,11, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425but if there has been, you don't get it, and if it's this, you don't get it, and if it's that, you do get it. All these may involve debts owed to or -- the State. Are -­ are you saying -- what has the statute to do with this? The statute just sets a standard for getting a discharge.MR. BRAND: Well, Your Honor, I -- I believe that this statute -- this particular subsection affecting student loan discharge is really unique within the exceptions to discharge.QUESTION: All right. Let's assume it's unique. MR. BRAND: There -­QUESTION: What is it in the Constitution or theEleventh Amendment that says Congress cannot set a special standard for discharging a bankrupt from a certain kind of debt?MR. BRAND: Congress -­QUESTION: What -- what in -- what in the Constitution says that if that kind of debt happens to be one that is owed to the State, Congress is forbidden to do that? I don't -- I just don't understand it.MR. BRAND: Your Honor, we -- we do not dispute that Congress has the power to set a separate standard for this type of debt -­QUESTION: I know and so why is the State, if it happens to be owed that kind of money, in any sort of a12, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 different position?2 MR. BRAND: Well, the -- the question is not the3 effectiveness of the congressional determination regarding4 how to handle that debt, but rather the constitutionality5 of the means by which Congress --6 QUESTION: Now, then what you're quarreling with7 is, of course, not the statute. You are quarreling, as8 Justice Ginsburg pointed out, with a bankruptcy rule that9 happen to use the word adversary proceeding. But suppose10 the rulemakers had simply said, this need not be done in11 an adversary proceeding. It can be done in exactly the12 same kind of proceeding as discharging any other kind of13 debt. I, the bankruptcy judge, will follow the14 congressional mandate as to when it is discharged. You15 will notify all debtors, Mr. Bankrupt, including the16 State, and if they want to come in and protest it, they17 can. Now, why -- what would be unconstitutional about18 such a provision that never uses the word adversary19 proceeding?20 MR. BRAND: Well, Your Honor, our objection is21 not merely to the bankruptcy rules. I would -- I would22 repeat that -- that --23 QUESTION: I read your position to be that the24 State isn't bound at all, for instance, that the25 bankruptcy court cannot discharge property liens held by13, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 the State. I mean, I -- I read your position as being2 that the State cannot be forced into any aspect of the3 bankruptcy proceeding.4 QUESTION: And so did I.5 QUESTION: I guess -- I guess the -- you would6 say the State doesn't have to abide by the automatic stay.7 MR. BRAND: Oh, certainly not, Your Honor.8 Certainly not. And I thought that we were clear in our9 briefing that we -- we recognize that the -- the State10 would be bound by the automatic stay because it's11 automatic. It is by operation of law and by operation of12 the Supremacy Clause -­13 QUESTION: I'd rather like to get the answer to14 the question which is I understand what position you took15 in the brief. I want to know why. I want to know what16 the logic is. I can't find anything in the Constitution17 that says that Congress cannot impose the same standard in18 respect to discharging a debt owed to the State as it19 applies to a debt owed to anybody else. Now, either you20 agree with that proposition or you don't. And if you21 don't -- and I think you don't -- I'd like to know what22 the theory is.23 MR. BRAND: Your Honor, I agree that Congress24 can make those distinctions. I -­￼25 QUESTION: Fine., Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 2000514Once you agree with the1 proposition, then all your objecting to is the word2 adversary in the word adversary proceeding, and it takes 33 minutes or less for a good expert simply to get rid of4 that adversary proceeding and have the same thing done in5 an ordinary proceeding.6 Now, I want to know the answer to what I say,7 not that you disagree with it. I know you disagree with8 it. I want to know why you disagree with it.9 MR. BRAND: I disagree with it because the --10 the legislative reports as to that subsection, section11 5239(a)(8), strongly point out that the statute -- that12 that subsection is intended to be self-executing and that13 the creditor, the lender, the guaranteer, the -- the14 guarantee institution, are not required to initiate action15 but instead can rely on the nondischarge, on the exception16 from discharge.17 So by -- by structuring the -- the exception18 that way, we would submit that Congress, as this Court has19 recognized in other situations, has given elevated status20 to that creditor's position, has recognized that creditors21 of those kinds of debts have interests in the payment of22 those debts that outweigh the normal fresh-start policy23 that -- that underlies bankruptcy. So our position is24 that it does turn on the nature of the statute and not25 merely those bankruptcy rules that require -­15, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

BRAND: Certainly not by express terms, Your Honor, but -- but again, the rules -- rules made consistent with that statute, together with that legislative purpose, would certainly indicate that -- that -­QUESTION: And I suppose you're saying this is an adversary proceeding. Regardless of whether -­MR. BRAND: Oh -­QUESTION: -- regardless of how -- how it got to be so, whether it got to be so through rule or through anything else, it's an adversary proceeding and the State cannot be hailed in in this fashion.MR. BRAND: That's exactly right, Your Honor. There's no dispute about that. I mean, this -­QUESTION: No, but there is a dispute about whether you could, in fact, call this kind of adversary proceeding, given the underlying standard that all it is is a way of getting to the same result, really not an adversary proceeding for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment, since it has no functional difference whatsoever from a proceeding that isn't labeled adversary but simply gives the State notice of what's going on and16, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 permits the State to come in, just as if it worked, which2 is ordinary proceedings.3 MR. BRAND: Except that ordinary proceedings in4 bankruptcy, as I mentioned earlier, do not involve the5 individualized adjudication of debts. They involve other6 issues. They involve martialing the assets. They involve7 assessing8 910 1112 understand you correctly to say that you did not contest13 the fact that if -- if -- that if they had a blanket rule14 that all student loans are automatically dischargeable,15 that would be true even if the creditor was a State?16 MR. BRAND: Certainly, Your Honor, and the -­17 QUESTION: And does that mean you also would18 agree that any ordinary commercial obligation to the State19 such as paying rent for an -- an office suite or something20 like that could also be dischargeable and there would be21 no sovereign immunity problem there?22 MR. BRAND: Yes, Your Honor, and the reason -­23 the reason I agree to that is because that does not24 require an adjudication. It -- it would occur by25 operation of law by which -­17, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005the -­QUESTION: That's a good answer.QUESTION: Mr. Brand, can I ask you -­QUESTION: Now, what about -­QUESTION: May I ask one question? Did I￼1 QUESTION: Well, but there has to be -- there2 has to be a final order in the bankruptcy proceeding3 discharging -- you know, giving the -- the debtor a4 discharge.5 MR. BRAND: But we would submit in a -- in a6 very real sense that would be surplusage.7 QUESTION: But the -- but the net result is I8 thought your position in your brief was somewhat different9 from that. That's why I wanted to be sure about it. You10 do agree that -- that the sovereign immunity is not a11 valid objection to a discharge of a bankrupt estate.1213 discharge14 analogize15 provision16 that operates automatically when the -­17 QUESTION: So, but the difference in the18 automatic stay if the -- if the debtor had to go in and19 prove his name, serial number, and rank or something20 first, so it wasn't completely automatic, then you would21 say you have a sovereign immunity objection.22 MR. BRAND: Possibly, possibly not. Again, I23 would submit that there's authority from lower courts that24 would -- would possibly -­25 QUESTION: Well, I'm really not so much18, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MR. BRAND: That's -- that's right when the is by operation of law. And again, I would to the -- the situation of the automatic stay that -- that Justice O'Connor raised. Again,￼1 interested in the authority from the lower courts as I am2 curious about your position. What exactly does the3 sovereign immunity defense protect for you?4 MR. BRAND: In this case the sovereign immunity5 defense protects the State from being made a defendant and6 from having compulsory process issued against it to appear7 in a bankruptcy court that could be in any State of the8 union in this case.9 Now, the -- the reason I was referring to10 authority from other courts is to -- is to remind the11 Court that all of the courts that have -- that have made12 the type of holding that Your Honor is referring to have13 also recognized the applicability of Eleventh Amendment14 immunity in adversary settings.15 QUESTION: I know, but it seems to me somewhat16 anomalous to say that if you want to do it without giving17 us a hearing, you can go ahead and do it, but if you give18 us notice and a hearing and an opportunity to respond,19 then you're protected by the Eleventh Amendment.20 MR. BRAND: Well, again -­21 QUESTION: A rather strange position.22 MR. BRAND: -- again, Your Honor, I think -- I23 think we're talking about very different things there.24 There is -- there is quite a difference between the25 general discharge, which again occurs without19, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

BRAND: -- such as we have here.QUESTION: -- it could well be that the Statefiled a claim and proved up its claim and then there's not enough money to pay it, the claim, but there would be some kind of proceeding to establish the claim. Would that be different then?MR. BRAND: Well, in -- in a case where the State had filed a claim, the State would have voluntarily appeared in the -- in the proceeding as relates to the subject matter of that claim. So there would not be any sovereign immunity situation there at all.QUESTION: So that if the State voluntarily appears, it would automatically waive its sovereign immunity defense.MR. BRAND: As to that claim, yes.QUESTION: Well, that's the Gardner case, isn't it?The--MR. BRAND: Yes, I believe so. Yes, Gardner v. New Jersey.QUESTION: Tell me how bankruptcy works. Is the20, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 United States trustee potentially part of any proceeding2 that the trustee wants to be involved in? Can the trustee3 have come into this proceeding voluntarily if -- if he or4 she chose?5 MR. BRAND: I -- I believe so, Your Honor, but6 I'm not certain if that is applicable in every -- in every7 district. And I'm not -- I apologize. I'm not certain as8 to that. I know the U.S. trustees have -- have those9 powers and responsibilities in at least -- at least a good10 number of bankruptcy -­1112 action is brought by a U.S. trustee, that's an officer -­13 that's the Federal Government.QUESTION: Because it does seem that if an1415 different 1617 problem. 1819 that's conceivable. Certainly the State would have no20 sovereign immunity from -- from an action by the United21 States.22 QUESTION: In -- in a world of limited23 resources, especially for the U.S. trustee -- this is a24 no-asset bankruptcy.

BRAND: Well, certainly that would be a situation and certainly the State -­QUESTION: Which is another way of solving this￼MR. BRAND: That's right, Your Honor. That's -­1 impractical.2 I was curious about the credit -- the creditor3 class for these student loans. It's not just States that4 are creditors when a student tries to get out from under5 the student's debts. What -- what other entities would be6 in this situation, not with respect to sovereign immunity,7 but as someone who has loaned money to a student?8 MR. BRAND: Well, certainly any lending9 institution could -- could be involved as a -- as a10 creditor in a student loan. The -- the Federal and -- and11 I guess there are State programs as well, but involve12 fairly complicated relationships between lending13 institutions and secondary holders and guarantors at -- at14 various levels.15 QUESTION: Do you know what part of the business16 the States have, to what extent, compared to other17 creditors, other lenders?18 MR. BRAND: Well, the -- I -- I can speak for19 the State of Tennessee. The State of Tennessee is20 involved as a guarantor, not as a lender, but merely as a21 guarantor in conjunction mainly with these -- these22 Federal loan programs. And the -- the State of Tennessee23 is participating not as a -- a business actor, but as a24 means of -- of pursuing the public policy of making it25 simpler and easier for Tennessee residents to obtain a22, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

So the -- the State as a guarantor is2 -- is not in this -- in the position at all of an ordinary3 creditor, really, as far as its -- as far as its purpose4 and -- and even as far as its -- probably its financial5 calculations in -- in how to deal with that. Again, it's6 -- it's a matter of pursuing the public policy of making7 it easier for -- for the students, for these debtors to8 obtain their college education.9 QUESTION: So for -- for the primary lender,10 this procedure would be fine. The -- so the debt wouldn't11 be dischargeable to the initial creditor, the one who12 loans -­13 MR.

There would17 undue hardship showing.18 QUESTION: But if you -- if you -- Congress was19 to say, well, too bad, we tried to give them a break, we-- the initial creditor could would have no sovereign immunity still be the requirement of the￼20 can't do21 just like22 effect on23 not State24it, so we're going to make them dischargeable any other debt, that would have a very adverse all the other creditors in the picture who are actors.MR. BRAND: It certainly would, Your Honor, but 25 it also could create complications as far as -- as far as23, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 whether States would choose to participate in -- in2 student loan programs. Again, it's a policy determination3 made State by State. There's no requirement that the4 States participate in -- in such programs.5 It -- it's part of the balancing of those6 interests I think that has resulted in this statute and in7 this statute being written the way it is. At one point in8 time not too long ago, student loans were discharged in an9 ordinary bankruptcy, and then it was -- it was cut back to10 only loans that had been in -- in payment more than -­11 more than 5 -- more than 7 years and more than 5 years,12 and now, of course, it's cut back all the way to where13 it's only subject to discharge upon a showing of undue14 hardship. So there's -- there's definitely a policy of15 wanting to make student loan repayment more certain and16 make that a -- a different relationship from other17 debtor/creditor relationships.18 If there are no further questions from the Court19 at this time, I would like to reserve the remainder of our20 time. I would ask that the judgment of the Sixth Circuit21 be reversed.22 QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Brand.23 Mr. Gerson, we'll hear from you.24 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD H. GERSON25 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT24, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. GERSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it2 please the Court:3 The questioning of the petitioner reflected the4 fact that there is an inherent conflict between the5 requirements of the operation of the bankruptcy system and6 the State's sovereign immunity. This conflict has been7 recognized in this Court's past opinions. For example, in8 Van Huffel v. Harkelrode, a 1931 decision of this Court,9 it was claimed that the sale of a debtor's property free10 and clear of -- of the State's tax lien was not effective11 because the State lacked jurisdiction. This --12 QUESTION: The State lacked?13 MR. GERSON: Jurisdiction over the -­14 QUESTION: The State lacked?15 QUESTION: The Supreme Court.16 MR. GERSON: I'm -- I'm sorry, Your Honor. The17 Court lacked jurisdiction over the State. And this Court18 denied that -- the State's position.19 Subsequent to that in Gardner/New Jersey, which20 is a case that -- that which is noted for waiver, the21 State also took the position that not -- that the property22 that was a part of the debtor's estate was limited to the23 debtor's equity and did not include that portion of the24 property of the debtor that was subject to the State's tax25 lien. Again, this Court said, no, all property of the25, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 debtor is part of the estate, including that part that's2 subject to a State's tax lien.3 QUESTION: Of course, in that case the State had4 come into bankruptcy -- the bankruptcy court voluntarily.5 MR. GERSON: That's correct, Your Honor. But6 the opinion -- that portion of the opinion in Gardner that7 addresses that issue does not rely upon the fact that the8 State filed a proof of claim.9 QUESTION: If -- if we were to analogize10 bankruptcy proceedings to in rem proceedings in general,11 nevertheless this dischargeability proceeding is set up12 under the rules as an adversary one where a notice and a13 summons is filed on the State. That's a product of how14 the rules are constructed. Now, presumably in time they15 could be changed, but what about this case?16 MR. GERSON: To allow this case to be determined17 on the basis that an adversary proceeding had been filed18 would be elevating form over substance because the19 jurisdiction of the court with respect to the claim arises20 from the court's jurisdiction over the property of the21 estate and claims made against it and the -- and the22 debtor. They're all part of the res. So the filing of an23 adversary proceeding was merely a manner -- merely24 allowing the State to -- to be provided with an elevated25 form of notice rather than being jurisdictional.26, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425In addition, 28 U.S.C. 2075 states that the rules, bankruptcy rules, should not in any way abridge or modify the substantive rights that are granted under the code, and I believe in these circumstances to allow this decision to be based upon the fact that an adversary proceeding had been filed would have the effect ofabridgingMs. Hood's rights -­QUESTION: Well -­MR. GERSON: -- by denying here an opportunityfor hardship.QUESTION: What happens when you don't show upin an adversary proceeding?MR. GERSON: A default judgment is entered. QUESTION: A default judgment.MR. GERSON: Yes.QUESTION: So how can you say -- I mean, had itnot been set up this way, I would assume that the bankruptcy judge would have to make his or her own determination about whether the condition of the statute had been met, but once you have this adversary system set up, I assume the bankruptcy judge is entirely within his or her rights by just saying, hey, the State hasn't shown up, the State loses.MR. GERSON: I would -- I'd like -­QUESTION: Now, that -- that doesn't seem to me27, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425to be elevating form over substance. That -- that's a big difference.MR. GERSON: Yes, and I -- I believe I incorrectly stated what would happen, Your Honor. It's -­ even -- even in an adversary proceeding, the court would still have to find that Ms. Hood had demonstrated a right to a -- to an undue hardship discharge.QUESTION: So it wouldn't just go by default then if the State didn't show up?MR. GERSON: That's correct, Your Honor.QUESTION: Do you know any other adversary proceedings that work that way? I mean, I suppose that depends on what the -- what the rule means, but when the rule describes it as an adversary proceeding, I -- I would take it to mean that if the other side doesn't show up, it loses.QUESTION: Well, in a -- in a -- in an ordinary suit for money judgment, if the defendant fails to show up, he can be defaulted as to liability, but he still has to show the money damages. He just doesn't get the amount that he says in his complaint.￼here?MR. GERSON: That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice. QUESTION: Well, is -- is the amount at issueMR. GERSON: The amount is at issue only to the28, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 extent that in order to show undue hardship, Ms. Hood has2 to demonstrate that3 QUESTION:4 amount, how much it5 isit?she can't repay it.Yes, but the -- but the -- theis, is not -- is not in controversy,6 MR. GERSON: No, it's not.7 QUESTION: I thought -­8 QUESTION: So what is the situation there? I9 mean, I don't want you just to drop this. That is, is an10 adversary proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code -- and11 there are quite a few. You've said two opposite things12 now. Your first time you said, well, if the other party13 doesn't show up, the bankruptcy judge can just say,14 debtor, you win. Okay? Without looking at the merits.15 And the second time you said, no, that's not really so.16 The bankruptcy judge has to satisfy himself that the￼17 statutory 1819 there's a20 it? Isitlike an--andhowdo Ifindout? If you're21 uncertain, what do I look up to try to find out the answer22 to that question?standard is met.Now, I guess this isn't the only place where adversary proceeding in the code. So which is23 MR. GERSON: Well, Justice Breyer, very often24 adversary proceedings are commenced in bankruptcy court25 and they're necessary when the kind of action that dispute29, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425-- in dispute is the equivalent of an action that could have been commenced prior to the establishment of the bankruptcy. It's just --QUESTION: Yes, I -­MR. GERSON: -- prior, you know, action now brought into the bankruptcy court. And then the bankruptcy court could issue a default judgment because -­QUESTION: No, I got that.MR. GERSON: -- it would be a traditionalaction.QUESTION: So maybe there are no others. Are there -- are there any adversary proceedings, other than this, one which isn't like what you just described?QUESTION: Well, certainly an action by a trustee for -- of voidable preference would be quite different, would it not?MR. GERSON: With respect to a voidable preference, if -- if the defendant did not demonstrate it had any defense, a judgment would be issued in favor of the -- the State because there is a presumption for a voidable preference once certain factors are met.QUESTION: And there you're getting money from outside the estate too. You're getting a money judgment against somebody that would increase the assets of the estate.30, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. GERSON: That's correct, Your Honor, but it2 is not Ms. Hood's position in this case that a preference3 action would fall within the traditional in rem4 jurisdiction of a bankruptcy court and thus the State5 sovereign immunity would be abrogated.6 QUESTION: So you would -- you would say that if7 the -- if there were a suit for a voidable preference8 against the State, the Eleventh Amendment rule would9 prevail?10 MR. GERSON: I -- that issue is unclear, Your11 Honor. It's certainly not Ms. Hood's position that the12 Eleventh Amendment would not prevail. And there's13 actually a case pending before this Court right now,14 Massachusetts v. H.J. Wilson, where at issue is the15 debtor's demand for an income tax refund. So the16 opportunity to visit the issue of affirmative monetary17 relief against a State and its -- and the ramifications of18 the Eleventh Amendment can be addressed in that case.19 It's -­20 QUESTION: We're trying to get -- I'm trying to21 get the answer still to Justice Scalia's question. Take22 the question the Chief Justice asked. It's a preference23 action. It's a kind of bankruptcy action. It's in an24 adversary proceeding. Is that right?25 MR. GERSON: Yes.31, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Okay. Now, the other side doesn't show up. Okay, forget this Eleventh Amendment business. I just want to know the normal thing in bankruptcy. What's the answer? If he doesn't show up, is he defaulted like a regular case outside the court, or does the trustee -- I mean, does the judge, the bankruptcy judge, look at the matter and make up his own mind independently about whether it was a preference or not? How does it work in bankruptcy?MR. GERSON: It would -- it would not be a default judgment, Your Honor. It would be a judgment on the merits.QUESTION: I have one other technical question. Suppose we were to say -­QUESTION: Excuse me. I didn't understand that answer. It would not be a default judgment. It would be a judgment on the merits. Is there a distinction?MR. GERSON: It would be a judgment -­QUESTION: I thought default judgments are, for all purposes, considered judgments on the merits. For what purpose is a default judgment not a judgment on the merits?MR. GERSON: Oh, to -- to the extent it is -­ there's greater flexibility of a defendant to come back and ask for reconsideration, I believe, under normal32, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425procedures.QUESTION: That doesn't make it not a decisionon the merits. It may be subject to reopening, but a default judgment is a judgment.MR. GERSON: That's correct.QUESTION: I thought that the question we -- we were talking about before -- that there was a clear and certain answer to the question, that -- that if the claim is made that there's undue hardship, even if the State doesn't show up -- well, let's take the -- because this is written for all creditors and not particularly with States in mind. If the creditor doesn't show up, the bankruptcy judge still has to find that there's undue hardship in order to make this dischargeable.MR. GERSON: That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.QUESTION: And where does that come from? I -­ that was my understanding about the way it works, but is that a statute, a rule? Where does -- where does that come from?MR. GERSON: I think it comes from the natural reading of the statute that such a finding has to be made that there would be an undue hardship for the debtor to have to repay that -- that loan.QUESTION: You -- you could say the same about any default judgment in a case -- in a tort action where33, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 the tort statute, you know, only imposes liability where2 the defendant has been negligent. The defendant doesn't3 show up. The court doesn't -- doesn't enter into its own4 independent inquiry as to whether the defendant was5 negligent. It enters default judgment. And the statute,6 just as clearly, requires negligence there as this statute7 requires undue hardship here.8 MR. GERSON: The difference -- the difference is9 -- Your Honor, is that all of the property of a debtor and10 claims against that property -- they're -- they're all11 under the bankruptcy court's jurisdiction. So a12 bankruptcy court has a special obligation to -- to protect13 the interests of all creditors and the estate, and I14 believe because of that, it would have a heightened15 responsibility to determine whether there was a basis for16 an undue hardship discharge because the decision is not17 solely -- is -- is affecting everyone.18 QUESTION: In the voidable preference case, it's19 -- it's as if we're -- the suggestion is is that the20 bankruptcy court has the authority to order the res21 brought before it, commanding the State to deliver the22 res, i.e., the voidable preference.23 MR. GERSON: I -- there is a question that -­24 QUESTION: And -- please.25 MR. GERSON: -- with -- with regard to a34, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 voidable preference action whether the funds the debtor2 would be seeking would be part of the res because it's not3 in the possession of the estate.4 QUESTION: Right.5 MR. GERSON: And certainly that distinction can6 be made as made in California v. -- v. Deep Sea Research,7 that if the property is in the possession of the -- of the8 State, rather than the debtor, a different result is9 required with respect to the Eleventh Amendment.10 QUESTION: Well, before the Bankruptcy Act in11 1978, bankruptcy courts couldn't try voidable preferences.12 That had to be in the district court I believe.13 MR. GERSON: That's correct, Justice Rehnquist.14 QUESTION: If in fact we assume -- let's suppose15 when we look into this -- suppose I was to come to the16 conclusion that an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy is17 identical to a case that has nothing to do with bankruptcy18 in a court. You say isn't, and maybe that's so and we'll19 find out. All right.20 Now, if that were so and if that meant under the21 Court's case law that this particular adversary proceeding22 were invalid under the Eleventh Amendment, would the23 bankruptcy judge under section 105 or some other section24 or would the Rules Committee have the power without going25 back to Congress to devise a different procedure that35, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 would get to exactly the same place, say, a procedure that2 had the bankruptcy judge adjudicate this under the same3 standard4 creditor,56 and the7 requirements of 28 U.S.C. 2075 and the requirement for the8 bankruptcy rules because under 105, a court could rule9 that it would be inappropriate to enforce the requirementwhile notifying the State, like any other that it could intervene at is choice.MR. GERSON: Yes, it could, Your Honor. And -­ basis for that would be to reconciling the10 of Bankruptcy Rule 7001, which requires an adversary11 proceeding. So 105 would give a bankruptcy court that12 power and I believe it would be an appropriate exercise of13 that power.1415 Committee 161718 depends heavily on the characterization of bankruptcy19 proceedings as in rem, and one can understand that about20 the bankrupt estate, it collects whatever assets there are21 and distributes them. But this is a no-asset bankruptcy.22 So how does the in rem characterization fit a case where23 there are no assets?24 MR. GERSON: Because the debtor itself, at least25 the pre-petition debtor, is also considered part of the36, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005QUESTION: And even without 105, could the Rules then devise a different rule?MR. GERSON: Certainly, Your Honor.QUESTION: Mr. Gerson, you -- your position￼1 res, part of the bankruptcy court's in rem jurisdiction.2 That was reflected in Hanover National Bank v. Moyses3 where the creditor complained that its debt had been4 discharged, but it had never received -- no summons or5 complaint had ever been filed. In fact, it complained it6 had never received notice. And this Court's response was,7 no, bankruptcy is a form of in rem jurisdiction, and on8 that basis the -- the claim of that creditor could be9 discharged even though no adversary -- no summons and10 complaint was filed. Notice as a motion was sufficient,11 and it based -­12 QUESTION: So what you're saying is the -- is13 the debtor is not a thing, is not a res, but a debtor -­14 this is an adjudication over a status which traditionally15 is also in rem.16 MR. GERSON: That's correct, Your Honor. I know17 it doesn't entirely fit our traditional notions of what a18 res is, but it's consistent with how this Court has19 traditionally understood the in rem jurisdiction of a20 bankruptcy court and the needs of a bankruptcy court to21 satisfy its essential functions.22 The kinds of contradictions that are being23 raised in the questioning are reflective of what's24 happened in the circuit courts of appeal where the Fourth25 Circuit, the Fifth Circuit, the Ninth Circuit all have37, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 recognized and have stated in -- in earlier opinions that2 the Seminole Tribe doctrine applied in bankruptcy but3 later recognized an in rem exception to allow for the4 discharge of debts with respect to the Fifth Circuit and5 the Ninth Circuit and -- and the Fourth Circuit, and the6 Fourth Circuit also recognized that principle with respect7 to the confirmation of a plan and its binding effect upon8 a State. So right now bankruptcy law is in an9 inconsistent muddle with respect to the applicability of10 the Eleventh Amendment, and this case allows this Court an11 opportunity to reconcile that inconsistency as -­12 QUESTION: Only a small piece of it, according13 to what you told us earlier, because you said this doesn't14 involve the preference question.15 MR. GERSON: That's -- that's correct, Your16 Honor. Of course, this Court could rule that given the17 traditional in rem nature of a bankruptcy and the fact18 that, particularly under the Bankruptcy Act a preference,19 as Chief Justice Rehnquist pointed out, was not part of20 the bankruptcy summary jurisdiction but required a plenary21 action, that in fact actions requiring any affirmative22 monetary relief against a State are not part of a debtor's23 -- are not part of a bankruptcy court's in rem24 jurisdiction, if it chose.25 If there are no more questions, thank you.38, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

BRAND ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. BRAND: Thank you, Your Honor. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:The State's position in this case is that a proceeding under the law which requires the State to make a choice between voluntarily entering the proceeding or sitting back and suffering a loss of its -- of its rights is every bit as coercive whether it's styled as a motion or an adversary proceeding or -- or anything else, is every bit as coercive as a lawsuit similar to the -- the situation with the administrative proceedings in the Federal Maritime Commission case.QUESTION: Is that loss of its right automatic? What is your answer to the question of whether, if you don't show up, a default judgment is entered automatically against you, or does the bankruptcy judge have to make the assessment of whether there's an undue hardship?MR. BRAND: I am not certain, Your Honor, but I believe that an undue hardship showing would still be necessary.But in either -- in either situation, the State would suffer the consequences of losing its rights subject39, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 to an adjudication, not subject to the mere operation of2 law as with the general discharge at the conclusion of a3 -- of an ordinary bankruptcy proceeding.4 As -- as far as the preference actions go, this5 case -- I'm sorry -- this Court decided in Hoffman v.6 Connecticut which involved a preference action and even7 more than that, a turnover action where there actually was8 property of the estate that the -- that the bankrupt9 trustee was -- was entitled to recover, that in either of10 those types of situations, the Eleventh Amendment applied.11 Now, of course, that case turned on whether Congress had12 -- had made a clear statement in the statute, but in any13 event, the Court, having found that the -- that the14 Congress did not make a clear statement of intent to15 override sovereign immunity, applied the Eleventh16 Amendment to that preference action, that turnover action17 in that case.18 Now, in this case we have no property. The --19 the debtor is not seeking to -- to get property. The -­20 the creditor is not seeking to make a claim out of the21 property of the estate. So we would submit that -- that22 the Court can decide this case, which involves a simple23 adversary proceeding on its face, the issuance of24 compulsory process without even reaching the question of25 whether a similar effect would -- would occur in -- in a40, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 preference action or in any other type of bankruptcy2 action.3 So I'd like to emphasize to the Court that this4 is an unusual statute, and the question in this case is,5 does the Eleventh Amendment apply in the bankruptcy6 context? But the precise circumstances of this case can7 well limit a court's holding to the question of whether8 sovereign immunity protects the State in an adversary9 proceeding on this particular type of statute for a10 particular exception from discharge.11 If there are no further questions -­12 QUESTION: I do have.
