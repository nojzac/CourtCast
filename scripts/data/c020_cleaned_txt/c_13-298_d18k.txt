PHILLIPSON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:      It is common ground between the parties inthis case that Section 101, by its terms, and with thesweeping interpretation this Court adopted in Bilskiapplies directly to the patents here.  These are systemand process patents that speak directly to Section 101.      The only issue, then, is whether theJudicially­recognized exception that this Court adoptedmany, many years ago applies under these circumstances.JUSTICE KENNEDY: And just repeat, it is common ground between the parties that ­­MR. PHILLIPS: That ­­ that our ­­ our patents speak directly to the language of Section 101, that is, they are a process, and they are machines, and they are ­­ and they are improvements to the process and the machines. They don't ­­ they don't dispute that by4￼1 its terms 101 applies. The only argument between the2 parties is the abstract idea exception that exists and3 whether that bars us from otherwise satisfying4 Section 101.5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips, on the6 abstract idea, you know that the Bilski case held that7 hedging qualified as an abstract idea. So how is8 intermediate settlement a less abstract than hedging?9 MR. PHILLIPS: If our ­­ if our patent10 merely claimed intermediated settlements, although I11 have to say I don't really know exactly what that means12 because I don't think that's the same kind of13 economics ­­ basic economics concept that a hedge risk14 treatment is. But if it claimed that, we wouldn't ­­ we15 wouldn't have a distinction from Bilski.16 What we claim is a very specific way of17 dealing with a problem that came into being in the early18 1970s of how to try to eliminate the risk of19 non­settlement in these very massive multiparty problems20 in which you need to deal with difficulties that exist21 at different time zones simultaneously and to do it with22 a computer so that you not only take them on23 chronologically, deal with them sequentially, based on24 the kind software analysis that the patent specifically25 describes by function.5￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      And it goes even further than that, and doessomething that no escrow agent and ­­ and nointermediated settlement that I know of ­­ settler thatI know of.  It actually blocks specific transactionsthat, in the shadow account, would violate the terms ofthe settlement that would ultimately be implemented.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let me put it this way. If you describe that to a second­year college class in engineering and said here's ­­ here's my idea, now you go home and you program over this weekend, my guess is ­­ my guess is that that would be fairly easy to program.MR. PHILLIPS: I don't disagree with it, Justice ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: So the fact that the computer is involved, it ­­ it seems to me, is necessary to make it work. But the ­­ but the innovative aspect is certainly not in the creation of the program to make that work. All you're talking about is ­­ if I can use the word ­­ an "idea."MR. PHILLIPS: I prefer not to use that word for obvious reasons.(Laughter.)MR. PHILLIPS: But ­­ but if you ­­ but if you look at the Solicitor ­­JUSTICE BREYER:MR. PHILLIPS:JUSTICE BREYER:  Why is that less abstract?I'm sorry?                             Why is that less abstract?I mean, imagine King Tut sitting in front of the pyramidwhere all his gold is stored, and he has the habit ofgiving chits away.  Good for the gold, which is given atthe end of the day.  And he hires a man with an abacus,and when the abacus keeping track sees that he's givenaway more gold than he is in storage, he says, stop.You see?      Or my mother, who used to look at mycheckbook, when she saw that, in fact, I had writtenmore checks than I had in the account, she would grabit.  Stop.  You see?      So what is it here that's less abstract thatthe computer says, stop?MR. PHILLIPS: It is ­­JUSTICE BREYER: How is that less abstract than King Tut, if we had the same thing with a grain elevator, if we had the same thing with a reservoir of6￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or ­­ or a method or a process.MR. PHILLIPS: Right. But ­­ and ­­ and obviously, methods and processes are precisely what Section 101 permits ­­71 water, if we had the same thing with my checkbook? You2 see the point.3 MR. PHILLIPS: I do see the point, Justice4 Breyer, and it seems to me that it goes to the question5 of the methodology you're going to employ.￼6 JUSTICE BREYER:7 you said, stop.8 MR. PHILLIPS:9 JUSTICE BREYER:  Methodology is just asWell, we could ­­  So what we have different10 here is the computer stops rather than the abacus man11 stopping or my mother stopping or the guy that the grain12 elevator has that says stop. So just saying, what ­­ is13 that it? In other words, if you say, computer stop, you14 have an invention. Useful add ­­ but if you say, mother15 stop, 1617 seems18 there19you don't?MR. PHILLIPS: No. Well, I mean, again, itto me that in some ways what ­­ what you describedis a caricature of what this invention is. JUSTICE BREYER: Of course it's a20 caricature. It's a caricature designed to suggest that21 there is an abstract idea here. It's called solvency.22 MR. PHILLIPS: But ­­23 JUSTICE BREYER: And what you do is you take24 the idea of solvency and you say apply it. And you say25 apply it through the computer.      Is that enough to make it not just theabstract idea?  And now we're at the heart of why I usedmy exaggerated examples ­­MR PHILLIPS:JUSTICE BREYER:MR. PHILLIPS:JUSTICE BREYER:MR. PHILLIPS:Right.   ­­ because you will tell me Right.   ­­ this is enough.                           Right.  Because, JusticeBreyer, the ­­ the ­­ the concept here is not simply tosay stop.  Stop is obviously part of the element of it.      But it's also designed to ensure that at theend of the day, this transaction, in the midst ofliterally a global set of ­­ of deals that are going onsimultaneously, will be implemented at the appropriatetime in the appropriate way.  And whatever else that maybe, it seems to me it's difficult to say that's anabstract idea as implemented.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. But ­­ but what it appears to be, it sounds like you're trying to revive the patenting of a function. You used the word "function" earlier, and that's all I'm seeing in this patent is the function of reconciling accounts, the function of making sure they're paid on time. But in what particular way, other than saying do it through a8￼123456 why ­­ 78 9101112131415161718192021222324259￼1 computer, is this something new and not functional?2 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it does it through ­­3 it creates the shadow accounts because of the concerns4 for security. You don't ­­ you're not going to allow5 somebody to enter into a central bank's own accounts.6 You create the shadow accounts. You monitor through the7 software that allows you to do that. You evaluate each8 of the transactions to ensure that the settlement will9 be available. You do it sequentially, and you act on it10 by the end of the day or whenever the transaction is to11 take place, and you implement that transaction.12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't it ­­ why isn't13 doing it through a computer not enough? I mean, was the14 cotton gin not an invention because it just means you're15 doing through a machine what people used to do by hand?16 It's not an invention. It's the same old, same old.17 MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Scalia ­­18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why ­­ why is a computer19 any different in that respect?20 MR. PHILLIPS: At one level I agree with you21 completely. There is no difference between them.22 This Court has, however, said on more than a23 few occasions, albeit in dicta, that coming up with an24 idea and then say, use a computer, is not sufficient.25 And what I'm trying to suggest to you is we don't fall10￼1 within that dicta.2 Now, if you don't accept the dicta and you3 say use a computer is fine, then I think we're done.4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'm not saying use a5 computer is ­­ is much of a novelty. I mean, that's ­­6 that goes to whether it's novel or not. If you just say7 use a computer, you haven't invented anything. But if8 you come up with a serious program that ­­ that does it,9 then, you know, that may be novel. But that's a novelty10 issue, isn't it?11 MR. PHILLIPS: To be sure, Justice Scalia.12 JUSTICE BREYER: And this is exactly the13 question I really would like to you to focus on for me.14 Why is it ­­ and I'm not saying this from a point of15 view, but it seems to me pretty clear that if what you16 did was take the idea of solvency ­­ remember King Tut,17 that’s why I use the exaggeration ­­ and what you say18 is implemented by having the abacus man keep track and19 say stop, okay ­­20 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.21 JUSTICE BREYER: Then we implement it by22 having somebody with a pencil and a piece of paper and23 this is all that they add, you see. Say: Have a man24 with a pencil and a piece of paper keeping track and25 saying, stop, or we say, implement it in the computer,11￼1 which will automatically keep track and say stop, are2 they all enough? Are some of them enough? What's the3 rule?4 And you realize I couldn't figure out much5 in Prometheus to go beyond what I thought was an obvious6 case, leaving it up to you and your colleagues to figure7 out how to go further. Am I making enough ­­ making8 clear enough what's bothering me? And I'd really like9 to get your answer to this.10 MR. PHILLIPS: And ­­ and look, there's11 no ­­ I'll be the first one to ­­ to confess that trying12 to use language to describe these things is not all that13 easy. But the way I think you can meaningfully look at14 this is to say that this is not simply something that15 was a fundamental truth, this is not something that16 simply says use a computer. It's not simply something17 that says maintain solvency. It ­­ it operates in a18 much more specific and concrete environment where you're19 dealing with a problem that's been in existence since20 the 1970s, a solution in the 1990s, that CLS itself21 acknowledges needed a solution and came forward with22 their own solution that looks a lot like ours.23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But my ­­ my initial24 question, and I think I can work this into King Tut,25 is ­­      MR. PHILLIPS:      JUSTICE KENNEDY:      MR. PHILLIPS:I'm certain that's true.      JUSTICE KENNEDY:      MR. PHILLIPS:software.      JUSTICE KENNEDY:program necessary to make the patent valid?MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it's ­­ it's necessary to make the invention effective. As the Solicitor General said, the computer is essential to the efficacy of this invention because of the complicated financial­­ is ­­ is whether or notYou mean wrote the code?   Yes.Right. Well, that's absolutely ­­   Well, then ­­ then ­­But that's true of almost allThen why is the computer12￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425(Laughter.)      JUSTICE KENNEDY:you could have patented that system, idea, process,method, without attaching a computer program.MR. PHILLIPS: You cannot, absolutely cannot do that with this system, because it is so complex and so many interrelated parts.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose I thought ­­ and, again, it's just a thought because I don't have the expertise ­­ that any computer group of people sitting around a coffee shop in Silicon Valley could do this over a weekend. Suppose I thought that.131 arrangements that exist and that can only be resolved on2 a ­­ on a real­time basis. Your abacus is great if you3 happen to be waiting for the pyramids to be finished or4 waiting for the gold to move in and out, but it doesn't5 help with you an abacus if you're dealing with literally6 thousands of transactions simultaneously going on in7 different countries at different points in time.8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's just an idea,9 hey, let's use a computer.10 MR. PHILLIPS: But it's not just ­­ I mean,11 obviously, part of it is use the computer, Justice12 Kennedy. But more fundamentally, it goes beyond that.13 See, I ­­￼14 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:15 copyrighted?16 MR. PHILLIPS:17 JUSTICE GINSBURG:18 software that comes with this ­­ that's part of this19 patent, is it ­­ is there?20 MR. PHILLIPS: No. Justice Ginsburg, what21 we did here is what the Patent and Trademark Office22 encourages us to do and encourages all software patent23 writers to do, which is to identify the functions that24 you want to be provided for with the software and leave25 it then to the software writers, who I gather are, youIs your softwareNo, I don't believe so.    There is no specialMR.

Because5 you just said, look, this Court has said it's not6 sufficient if you have an idea and then you say use a7 computer to implement it; right? So are you saying that8 your ­­ that ­­ are you saying that you're doing more9 than saying use a computer to implement it or are you10 saying that it's ­­ that the idea itself is more than an11 idea?￼12 13 1415 mean,16 believe that if you analyze the claims and you don't17 caricature them and you don't strip them out of the18 limitations that are embedded in there, this is not some19 kind of an abstract concept.

I ­­ I So putting the computerRight. ­­ you're saying that you've      MR. PHILLIPS:      JUSTICE KAGAN:the computer aside?Right. And what is that, putting      MR. PHILLIPS:it's difficult to do that because you absolutely needthe computer in order to implement this.  But the key tothe invention is the notion of being ablesimultaneously, dealing with it on a chronological basisto stop transactions that will otherwise interfere withthe ability to settle on time and under the appropriatecircumstances.  And the only way you can do that in areal­time basis when you're dealing with a global economyis to use a computer.  It is necessary to the efficacyof this.      So in that sense, I can't ­­ I can'tdisaggregate it the way in some sense you're suggesting.It seems to me it's bound up with in ­­ it's bounds upwith the whole notion of is this an abstract concept.JUSTICE BREYER: Can you in fact ­­ now, this is ­­ look, there are 42 briefs in this case. I actually read them and I found them very, very helpfulIt is ­­ well ­­ and again,15￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. PHILIPS: Yes.JUSTICE KAGAN: There is something that you've patented that has ­­ that is not just simple use a third party to do a settlement.161 up to the point where I have to make a decision, because2 they're serious. I mean, you know ­­ now, the problem3 that I came away with is the one that you're beginning4 to discuss, that if you simply say, take an idea that's5 abstract and implement it on a computer, there are ­­6 you're going to get it much faster, you're going to be7 able to do many, many things, and if that's good enough,8 there is a risk that you will take business in the9 United States or large segments and instead of having10 competition on price, service and better production11 methods, we'll have competition on who has the best12 patent lawyer. You see where I'm going on that one?13 MR. PHILLIPS: Yeah, of course.14 JUSTICE BREYER: And if you go the other way15 and say never, then what you do is you rule out real16 inventions with computers.17 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.18 JUSTICE BREYER: And so in those 42 briefs,19 there are a number of suggestions as to how to go20 between Scylla and Charybdis. Now, I would like to21 know ­­ I don't know if you can step back from your22 representational model. That's a problem. But you’re all23 we have now. And ­­ and from my point of view, I need24 to know what in your opinion is the best way of sailing25 between these two serious harms.￼171 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, Justice Breyer, I guess2 I would suggest to you that you might want to deal with3 the problem you know as opposed to the problems you4 don't know at this stage. I mean, we have had business5 method patents and software patents in existence for6 well over a decade and they're obviously quite7 significant in number. And ­­ and we know what the8 system is we have. And Congress looked at that system,9 right, and didn't say no to business methods patents,10 didn't say no to software patents, instead said the11 solution to this problem is to get it out of the12 judicial process and create an administrative process,13 but leave the substantive standards intact.14 So my suggestion to you would be follow that15 same advice, a liberal interpretation of 101 and not a16 caricature of the claims, analyze the claims as written,17 and therefore say that the solution is 102 and 103 and18 use the administrative process. If you ­­19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips, let me just20 stop you there, because four Justices of this Court did21 not read that legislative history the way you do. And22 it was ­­ was in Bilski.23 MR. PHILLIPS: But this is post­Bilski.24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Justice Stevens went25 carefully through that and he said: Congress was￼￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425                                                       18reacting to a decision.  It had ­­ it was not addressing101.  So there are at least four Justices who say ­­ whodidn't buy that argument.     MR. PHILLIPS:         Well, I mean, it still seemsto me that the ­­ the natural inference is Congress didnot change 101.  Congress created an entireadministrative system to deal with 101, 102 and 103.And ­­ and I would hope ­­     JUSTICE SCALIA:anyway, right?     MR. PHILLIPS:     JUSTICE SCALIA:     MR. PHILLIPS:skills, Your Honor.     JUSTICE SCALIA:  And four is not fiveThat's true.  Four is not five.And you've exhausted my math                             By the way, we ­­ we havesaid that you can't take an abstract idea and then sayuse a computer to implement it.  But we haven't saidthat you can't take an abstract idea and then say hereis how you use a computer to implement it ­­      MR. PHILLIPS:      JUSTICE SCALIA: you're doing.      MR. PHILLIPS:making and ­­      JUSTICE SCALIA:Exactly.  ­­ which is basically whatAnd that's the argument we're  And that's a little19￼1 different.2 MR. PHILLIPS: ­­ that's the line we're3 asking the Court to draw here.4 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how are you saying the5 how? Because I thought that your computers ­­ that your6 patents really did just say do this on a computer, as7 opposed to saying anything substantive about how to do8 it on a computer.9 MR. PHILLIPS: I would urge the Court to10 look at Joint Appendix 159, 285­286, where it goes11 through the flow charts. This is ­­ and this is just a12 specific example of the method by which you stop a13 transaction, and it goes through various series of14 detailed steps and what the computer has to do in order15 to do that. It doesn't actually, obviously, put in the16 code, but that's what the PTO says don't do. Don't put17 in the code because nobody understands code, so ­­ but18 put in the functions, and we know ­­ and we know that19 someone skilled in the art will be able to put in the20 code. And if they aren't, if they can't do that, then21 it's not enabled and that's a 112 problem.22 To go back, Justice Breyer, to your23 question. So on the one hand, you've got a problem that24 it seems to me Congress to some extent has said is okay25 and we've got a solution and that solution's playing201 through. On the other hand, if this Court were to say2 much more categorically either that there's no such3 thing as business method patents or adopt the Solicitor4 General's interpretation, which is to say that there5 cannot be software unless the software somehow actually6 improves the computer, as opposed to software improving7 every other device or any other mechanism that might be8 out there.9 What we know is that this would inherently10 declare and in one fell swoop hundreds of thousands of11 patents invalid, and the consequences of that it seems12 to me are utterly unknowable. And before the Court goes13 down that path, I would think it would think long and14 hard about whether isn't that a judgment that Congress15 ought to make. And it seems to me in that sense you're16 essentially where the Court was in Chakrabarty, where17 everybody was saying you've got to act in one way or the18 other or the world comes to an end, and the courts have19 said, we'll apply 101 directly.20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If we say that ­­ If we say21 that there's no software patentability and agree with the22 Attorney General, do you lose in this case?23 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it would be very hard24 for me to see how that ­­ how ­­ how I can get around25 that particular problem, because the computer is the￼21 1    essence of it, so ­­ and a portion of it is clearly the 2    software.  So I think if you say there is no such thing 3    as software patentability, I do lose in this case, yes, 4    Your Honor.  As do a whole lot of other people. 5         JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips, in response ­­ 6         JUSTICE KENNEDY:         Is there any common ground 7    between you and the government ­­ maybe a better 8    question to ask the government ­­ a common ground 9    between you and the government on something in the10    software area that's patentable, other than making the11    computer itself work?  You understand the government to12    say no software patents.13         MR. PHILLIPS:         That's the way I interpret14    the government's ­­ the government's brief.15         JUSTICE BREYER:         It was like ­­ there's a16    Bloomberg brief out here that was on this, that said,17    no, you can ­­ you can patent computer software when18    it's an improvement in the computer, when it's an19    improvement in software, when it's an improvement in a20    technology that is developed out of computers like21    robotics, when it is an improvement in a machine or22    technology, but you cannot improve it where it is simply23    an improvement in an activity that is engaged in24    primarily through mental processes.  But what they mean25    by that is business, finance, and similar arts.￼221 That's ­­ I mean, that's ­­ it wasn't quite what ­­ I2 know. That's what I want to know what you don't agree3 with about that, because it's a little more refined than4 you suggested.5 MR. PHILLIPS: I read the Solicitor6 General's brief as broader than the Bloomberg brief7 in ­­ in terms of the approach. And IBM's argument is8 if you knock out software patents, you eliminate web9 browsing, word processing, cellphones, e­mail. Those10 are all activities that I don't think fall within the11 meaning of the ­­ the meaning of the government's theory12 of the case.13 JUSTICE BREYER: But I'm asking14 asking you, what about this one that I just15 You see, I went through those five steps ­­16 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.17 JUSTICE BREYER: ­­ and four of18 could patent and the fifth one you can't.19 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. But I ­­20 my answer to that is that's nowhere in the statute and21 it doesn't seem to me to reflect an abstract idea. It's22 a ­­ it's a line you draw that takes out business method23 patents. If the Court wants to eliminate business24 method patents, fine. But you just said no to that in25 Bilski two, three terms ago.￼you ­­ I'mmentioned?them youand I guess23￼1 Now, to be sure, give the Solicitor General2 credit, he comes here and says to you: We didn't like3 the result in Bilski; we want you to say don't use4 process in order to get there, which is a statutory5 interpretation; come up with an extraordinarily6 complicated way of looking at the exception and use that7 to get to the exact same result.8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you're doing a9 very good job of proving ­­10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In Bilski, Justice Breyer11 did try to say that there wasn't that ­­ a whole lot of12 distance between the four who thought business methods13 were not patentable. But he ­­ he also said something14 else in ­­ in the other case, Mayo. Justice Scalia15 asked you the question about doesn't that go to novelty,16 but didn't Justice Breyer say in Mayo that novelty can17 be relevant to patent ­­ to patent eligibility? He said18 there's ­­ there's an overlap.19 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, he said there's an20 overlap. Here in this context, I think, basically the21 Respondents' theory would mean that they are completely22 coterminous. And I don't think that's what the Court23 meant. And also, we know from Diehr that there's got to24 be at least some significant limitations on the extent25 to which novelty has to be built into 101. That is the24￼1 province of 102 and 103. And, as I said, Congress2 modified the system of adjudication to create an3 administrative mechanism that allows you to get to 1024 and 103. And at least in context, it's important to5 realize there have been 11 cases since that was created.6 Nine of the 11 have been knocked down on 102 or 103 grounds7 and not on 101 grounds. And it seems to me that's the8 answer to this problem, is leave 101 as the coarse9 filter. If on its face it states these kinds of broad10 abstract principles, fundamental truths, and even if it11 says use a computer, those should be struck down.12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which of the ­­ which of13 the opinions below captures your position most14 accurately?15 MR. PHILLIPS: I would guess it would be16 Judge Moore's opinion below that would capture ours most17 correctly.18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And if we were to think19 your method claim is ineligible, do you agree that your20 systems and ­­ your medium and system claims fail as21 well? Do they rise and fall together?22 MR. PHILLIPS: No. No, I don't believe they23 do rise and fall together. I mean, I think you could ­­24 if you wanted to interpret our medium claim ­­ I mean,25 our ­­ our method claims in a ­­ in a particularly20 well be a patentable subject matter21 depends on how the claims play out.22 JUSTICE KAGAN: No, but23 the claim would have said something24 you know, there's this process by which people order25 products and we want to do it over the Internet, we wantbecause ­­ but itexactly.  I mean,along the lines of,25￼1 abstract way, I think you could still say that the2 system claims, which clearly are ­­ are how to create a3 computer system and how to implement it using that4 method, would be a much more concrete version of that in5 a way that would take it out of 101. That said, I,6 obviously, believe that all of our claims satisfy 1017 and should go on to the next stage.8 JUSTICE KAGAN: Can I give you a9 hypothetical, Mr. Phillips, and you tell me how it's10 different or the same? Let's say, you know, 30 years11 somebody took a look around the world and said, a lot of12 people seem to order products by mail. They get the13 catalogues in the mail and then they send back their14 return forms. And let's say that one of the founders of15 the Internet said, wouldn't this be an amazing system,16 we could actually do this by computer, and they had17 patented that. Is that the same?18 MR. PHILLIPS: I don't know if it's the19 same, but I would ­­ I would argue that it could very26￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425to do it electronically, and we will use a computer todo that, to essentially take the process of mail ordercatalogues and make it electronic.     MR. PHILLIPS:         I could certainly ­­ I thinkI could write a claim ­­ a set of claims that I believewould satisfy 101.  And ­­ and to the extent thatyou'd ­­ that you'd think those are no different thanthe ones I have here, then my argument is simply I thinkI satisfy 101 with the claims we have before us, YourHonor.     If there are no further questions, then I'dlike to reserve the rest of my time.     CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:         Thank you,Mr. Phillips.     Mr. Perry.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK A. PERRY      ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS     MR. PERRY:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:     That path between Scylla and Charybdis wascharted in Bilski and Mayo.  Bilski holds that afundamental economic principle is an abstract idea andMayo holds that running such a principle on a computeris, quote, "not a patentable application of thatprinciple."  Those two propositions are sufficient to27￼ 1    dispose of this case.2 If Bilski and Mayo stand, Alice's patents 3    fail.  Therefore, Mr. Phillips and his friends are 4    asking this Court to change the standard, even though 5    this Court has had three unanimous decisions in the last 6    four terms establishing what the Court called a myriad, 7    a well­established standard.8 On the abstract idea, Justice Ginsburg, you 9    asked Mr. Phillips what's the difference between hedging10    and this claim.  There is no difference.  This is11    hedging.  It is hedging against credit default rather12    than price fluctuation, but it is simply hedging.13 And Mr. Phillips stood up for 26 minutes and14    never once referred to the patent.  Let's look at what15    the inventor, the so­called inventor said about this16    invention.  This is at JA 293 to 94 in the17    specification.18 This claim has simply two steps. It's very19    simple.  "First, debiting and crediting on a real­time20    basis the relevant shadow records; and second, by21    periodically affecting corresponding payment22    instructions."  Period. Those are direct quotes.  Debit, credit,23    and pay.  Your Honor, you can't get much more simple24 than that.25 Mr. Phillips suggests, well, we have281 multilateral transactions, global things, chronological,2 time zones and so forth. None of those are claimed,3 Your Honor. Those are all recited in specification.4 The claims read on a single transaction involving two5 parties.6 JUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask you at some7 point, not necessarily this second, to say in my ­­ this8 is just ­­ you know, you have an opinion for a court.9 Different judges can have different interpretations.10 All you're getting is mine, okay?11 But I think it's pretty easy to say that12 Archimedes can't just go to a boat builder and say,13 apply my idea. All right. Everybody agrees with that.14 But now we try to take that word "apply" and give15 content to it.16 And what I suspect, in my opinion, Mayo did17 and Bilski and the other cases is sketch an outer shell18 of the content, hoping that the experts, you and the19 other lawyers and the ­­ the circuit court, could fill20 in a little better than we had done the content of that21 shell.22 So, so far you're saying, well, this is23 close enough to Archimedes saying "apply it"24 needn't go further.25 Now, will you at some point in the next￼that wefew291 minutes give me your impression of, if it were necessary2 to go further, what would the right words or example be?3 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, as ­­ Justice4 Breyer, as to abstract ideas, the PTO has filled in that5 shell by listing economic concepts, legal concepts,6 financial concepts, teaching concepts, dating and7 interpersonal relationships and generally how business8 should be conducted as examples of those things that are9 likely abstract, which, of course, all follow directly10 from Bilski and the discussion this Court had in Bilski.11 And this patent ­­ these patents fall squarely within12 that.13 Congress, in the AIA, confirmed that￼14 reading. Congress, in the CBM method, said business15 methods that are subject to special scrutiny ­­ that is,16 dubious patents ­­ include methods and corresponding17 apparatus, which is what we have here, that pertain to18 data processing in the financial services industry and19 do not offer a technological solution. That describes20 Alice's patents to a letter, Your Honor. So that we21 have ­­22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:23 technological solution?24 MR. PERRY:25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:What do you think is aYour Honor ­­        How could they, if at1 all, written their patent to ­­ to make ­­ to make2 their software eligible? What would ­­ what do they3 need ­­ would have needed to have added?4 MR. PERRY: Justice Sotomayor, they have no5 software, first. They've never written software.6 They've never programmed a computer. So that's a7 nonexistent set.8 Second, there are many technological9 solutions to trading and settlement problems. For10 example, data compression. These ­­ these trading11 platforms involve the movement of very large quantities12 of data around the world. The physical pipes, that is,13 the fiber optic cables and data lines are limited.14 There are very sophisticated algorithms for both15 security and speed to move data through the transmission16 lines in novel and useful ways that could well be17 patented.18 Nothing like that is claimed here. To come19 back to where I started, if you look, for example, at20 Claim 65 of the '510 patent, as Mr. Phillips reads it,21 it literally reads on a two­party escrow to sell a22 house, so long as the escrow agent is typing this stuff23 into24 with25the HUD­1 using a computer.  That has nothing to domultilevel ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:         Well, that's a30￼31￼1 little more complicated. He referred us to Joint2 Appendix Page 159, which is not a change in how3 computers work. But it is ­­ constitutes the4 instructions about how to use the computer and where it5 needs to be affected. And just looking at it, it looks6 pretty complicated. There are a lot of arrows and7 they ­­ you know, different things that go ­­8 (Laughter.)9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but I mean,10 you know, it ­­ in different directions. And I11 understand him to say that in each of those places,12 that's where the computer is needed.13 MR. PERRY: Mr. Chief Justice, Figure 16 has14 nothing to do with the invention asserted against my15 client in this case. There are two inventions in this16 patent. One invention involving multilateral contract17 formation is not asserted against my client. And all of18 these drawings pertain to that. The only drawings that19 pertain to the asserted claims are 25 and 33 to 37. And20 that was established below, and it's established in this21 Court. And Mr. Phillips had never disputed it.22 So the claim he's pointed the Court ­­ the23 figure he's pointed the Court to has nothing to do with24 the invention. It's for a different invention that is25 not at issue in this case.18 This is not such19 for that is this is a20 were prosecuted under21 all the applicant had22 JUSTICE KENNEDY:23 again, you already did it once ­­ an example of a24 business process patent ­­ of a business process idea25 and invention that is patentable.a patent.

They all pertain to the other3 invention. That's why in the back of our red brief we4 excerpted the very little bit that actually pertains to5 this. You sort of tack on patent ­­ the tack on claim6 that Mr. Phillips is asserting here. It's four columns.7 It's less than five pages in the printed appendix that8 actually pertains to this invention. And it contains no9 disclosure whatsoever.10 Justice Scalia, to your question about how11 the computer does it. Of course, a patent that12 describes sufficiently how a computer does a new and13 useful thing, whether it's data compression or any other14 technological solution to a business problem, a social15 problem, or a technological problem, would be within the16 realm of the ­­ of the patent laws. That is what the17 patent laws have always been for.13 trading platform or a14 that wouldn't disable15 case ­­16 JUSTICE KENNEDY:17 language, I've called18 process.

PERRY:         Yes, Your Honor.JUSTICE KENNEDY:         I'm asking you:  Is therehedging system or something else,them.  And this is what the Diehr        Well, I ­­ I ­­ in mythat mechanical rather than33￼1 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, there are many2 examples. One would be a technological solution to a3 business problem. So that, for example ­­ I'll give a4 different example. There are many applications today.5 The Court may be familiar with streaming video to watch6 video on your computer.7 It is not possible to get enough data8 through existing lines in its raw format. The data has9 to be manipulated in order to see live video. So if you10 want to watch TV on your phone, for example.11 Those algorithms, those inventions are12 undoubtedly technological. And if they are used in a34￼1 any business process, any business activity that is2 susceptible to a patent, a pure patent, innovations that3 deserve patents?4 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, again, a5 technological solution to a business problem could well6 be, whether it's a method or a process, is equivalent.7 Again, Congress said method in a corresponding apparatus ­­8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you give me an9 example?10 MR. PERRY: I thought the data compression11 example was a good one. I'll try an encryption12 technology. Many of these trading platforms, you know,13 dealing with securities and money would require some14 sort of security devices. You could have a process for15 securely transmitting data, would be another computer16 implemented technological solution to a business17 problem. Again, nothing like that claimed here.18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How about e­mail and19 just word processing programs?20 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, a program ­­ let me21 try it this way to both of your questions. In our view,22 if what is claimed as the inventive contribution under23 Mayo ­­ in other words, if we have an abstract idea, as24 we do here, and what is claimed as the inventive25 contribution for Step 2 is the computer, then the35￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425computer must be essential to that operation andrepresent an advancement in computer science or othertechnology.  And we know that's not met here, JusticeSotomayor, because ­­     JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So you're saying no toe­mail and word processing.     MR. PERRY:         Your Honor, I think at apoint ­­     JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         They certainly havefunctionality and ­­ and improvement of functionalityfor the user.     MR. PERRY:         At a point in time in the past,I think both of those would have been technologicaladvances that were patentable.     JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         How?     MR. PERRY:         Today ­­ because they would haveprovided a technological solution to a then­unmetproblem.  Today, reciting, and do it on a word processoris no different than and do it on a typewriter or ­­ anddo it on a calculator.     The inventive contribution component, whichuses specifically the language of conventional androutine and well understood, will evolve withtechnology.  That's why it's different than the abstractidea component.1 And here we know that these patents don't2 claim anything that was not conventional, well3 understood, and routine. We went through that in great4 detail, and Alice has never disputed a word of it. They5 just say you're not supposed to do that analysis, even6 though the Court, 9­0 in Mayo said we should.78 look9 ThisAnd in this case, it's very important toat what Alice's own experts said on the subject.is not our expert.  This is Alice's expert.  Andis at Page 1327­28 of the Joint Appendix.  "It is10 this11 possible to do the business methods of maintaining12 accounts, adjusting accounts, and providing an13 instruction without a computer or other hardware."14 And then, Justice Breyer, directly to your15 abacus. If someone had thought of this invention,16 so­called invention, 100 years ago, they might have17 implemented it in a nonelectronic manner using various18 precomputing tools such as an abacus or handwritten19 ledgers.20 We know from Benson, the Court's seminal21 computer implementation case, that if you can do it by22 head and hand, then the computer doesn't add anything23 inventive within the meaning of the 101 exception. That24 is the holding of Benson. And the Court reiterated that25 in Mayo.36￼     MR. PERRY:         Two     CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:impractical without looking     MR. PERRY:         Mr.answers.        ­­ but it'sto do it on the computer?                            Chief Justice, first, theseclaims literally read, as Alice reads them, on a singletransaction between two parties, so it's not 20 peoplefor a hundred years.  It's one person sitting in a room,so that's not a problem.     Second, if what is being claimed is thenecessary speed or efficiency or data crunchingcapabilities, if you will, of a computer, then it wouldhave to be claimed, and there's nothing claimed here.37￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425     Flook said exactly the same thing.         If youcan do it with pencil and paper, then the computer isnot offering anything that the patent laws are or shouldbe concerned with.     It is only where the method will not workwithout a computer, which is not these claims, and wherethe computer itself is doing something that the patentlaw is willing to protect.     CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:         What if ­­ what ifyou can do it without a computer, but it's going totake, you know, 20 people a hundred years?  In otherwords, theoretically, you can replicate what thecomputer does ­­38￼ 1    All that is claimed ­­ and my friend is going to stand 2    up on rebuttal and tell you all that the expert said, 3    well, what is claimed is a computer, but it's just a 4    computer.  It just says a computer configured too.  It 5    doesn't say that the computer actually has to ­­6 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, but the trouble with 7    that particular test is, as I think partly the Chief 8    Justice said, how long, et cetera, and then add to that, 9    though you could do it without a computer, what happens10    at the end of the line is the automobile engine goes off11    or it begins to sputter or it turns left.12 You see, it's possible to take Archimedes or King ­­13    ­­ you know, I use that example purposely to call14    attention to the problem.  You can take those things,15    and you're not just saying apply it, and you're not even16    just saying ­­ you are saying use the computer, but at17    the end of the road, something physical in the world18    changes and everybody would say, now, that's ­­ that19    falls within, I mean, probably, I mean, my20    hesitation shows I'm looking for the right words.21 MR. PERRY: Justice Breyer, I think your point is22    the reason that it is equally fallacious to suggest, on23    the one hand, as Alice and IBM does, that simply24    reciting a computer is a magic key that gets you through25    101 and you never have to do any other inquiry, and what39￼1 some of folks, the amici on the other side, say, which2 is that computers or software are never eligible. Both3 of those things have to be wrong because what the Court4 said in Bilski was future innovation is too uncertain.5 We are not going to do that as a Court. And the Court6 laid out an approach using abstract ideas in Bilski and7 inventive contribution in Mayo that is flexible enough8 to take into account that innovation and to deal with9 particular claims in context, which is why, at the end10 of the day, we have to come back to these patents and11 decide which ­­12 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Perry, before we get13 back to these matters, just, you said to Justice Scalia if a14 patent sufficiently describes how a computer will15 implement an idea then it's patentable. So how16 sufficiently does one have to describe it? What do we17 want a judge to do at this threshold level in terms of18 trying to figure out whether the description is19 sufficient to get you past it?20 MR. PERRY: If I can answer in two steps,21 Justice Kagan. First in the negative: What the22 applicant or patentee must do ­­ must not do is simply23 describe the desired result. That would take us back to24 State Street. That would simply say: I claim a magic25 box that buys high and sells low or vice versa, I401 suppose, I claim a magic box for investing. That's what2 these patents do.3 And then to put it in the affirmative and in the4 language of Mayo, the claim has to recite something5 significantly more, something significantly more than6 the abstract idea itself. That would be a contextual7 analysis based on the claims and specifications and file8 history, and we know that some devices, some methods,9 some programming will pass that.10 It is not going to be a bright­line rule and11 that's one of the tug­of­war issues that this Court and12 the Federal Circuit have been having in these cases.13 The Federal Circuit wants bright­line rules: All14 computers are in or all computers are out.15 This Court has been more contextual. This16 Court has been more nuanced. This Court has looked at17 things in a more robust way.18 JUSTICE KAGAN: You're not suggesting that19 specific code is necessary?20 MR. PERRY: No, Your Honor. I think the ­­21 actual description of the programming is a 112 problem.22 I agree with that, a 112 issue. That is the realm of23 the written description requirement. What is a 10124 problem is it is on the applicant to do more than simply25 describe the results, simply say: A magic box that does￼411 intermediate settlement. And we can tie that back to2 this particular prosecution, the '510 patent which is3 the method patent.4 The examiner rejected it. Under Section5 101, the examiner said, this is an abstract idea. You6 can't have this patent. And the only change that this7 applicant made was to add in the adjusting step8 "electronic adjustment." It put in one word,9 "electronic adjustment." And under State Street, which10 is what this patent is prosecuted under, that was11 enough, because the result of adjusting run through a12 computer is enough.13 Under current law that can't be enough.14 That just can't get a patent over the line, because this15 Court said in Mayo, and I got to quote this language:16 "Simply implementing a fundamental principle on a17 physical machine, namely a computer, is not a patentable18 application of that principle." That's all that Alice19 has done.20 These are pre­Bilski patents. They never21 should have been issued. General Verrilli will stand up22 and address that point. And certainly under current23 law ­­ one point on the AIA. Congress did not send all24 this to the administrative process. Congress created25 two avenues, the courts and the PTO to use the￼42￼ 1    standards.  Essentially it ratified Bilski and Mayo and 2    said, we agree with what you all are doing at the 3    Supreme Court and the existing standards are good enough 4    for us.  This is a judicial problem.  And that is a good 5    reason.  The abstract ­­6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Federal Circuit in 7    this case split in many ways, and it had our decisions 8    to deal with.  And you said, given Bilski and Mayo, this is 9    an easy case.  What is the instruction that escaped a10    good number of judges on the Federal Circuit?  How would11    you state the rule?12 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, I think there's a13    significant element to the Federal Circuit that14    disagrees with Mayo and has been resistant in applying15    it.  Chief Judge ­­ former Chief Judge Michelle filed a16    brief in this Court essentially saying Mayo is a17    life­sciences case, you should limit it to that because18    if you apply it to everything else, then these patents19    are no good.20 Mayo we submit is a technology­neutral,21    industry­neutral, exception­neutral framework that can22    be used to answer all of these questions.  This is not23    the death of software patents.  The software industry is24    all before this Court saying, this is fine with us.25    I mean, every company in the United States practically except43￼1 for IBM is saying, go ahead. This will not affect2 software patents.3 Justice Ginsburg, this Court's precedents4 are clear. They are unanimous. They just need to be5 applied. To suggest that there is confusion that needs6 to be addressed by retreating, beating a retreat from7 recent unanimous decisions, would simply reward8 intransigence, difficulty, refusal to adhere to what are9 clear precedents because ­­10 JUSTICE KAGAN: Should we be concerned,11 Mr. Perry, that there are old patents that in fact could12 meet the test that you set forth but won't because they13 were written in a different time and so used much more14 general language?15 MR. PERRY: Your Honor, the applic ­­ or the16 patent holder would have the opportunity to institute a17 reexamination proceeding or some sort of administration18 process to address that issue.19 And second, it should be noted, this is a20 very small problem. There are 2 million outstanding21 patents in the United States. In the last four fiscal22 years there were 22,000 infringement litigations23 instituted, but since Bilski, there have only been 5724 district court decisions on Section 101 issues. There25 have only been 12 Federal Circuit decisions total on44￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425computer implementation.     We are talking about a group of patents,Justice Kagan, that's way out at the tail end ofdistribution.  Most patents never have a 101 challenge.This is not an issue with cotton gins and other things.     This is a problem for the most marginal,most dubious, most skeptical patents, the ones that thisCourt in Bilski ­­ and remember what Bilski's holdingis.  The majority said they are processes, but it didnot say they are eligible.     Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.     CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:         Thank you, counsel.     General Verrilli.   ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.   ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS     CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS     GENERAL VERRILLI:         Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court:     An abstract idea does not becomepatent­eligible merely by tacking on an instruction touse a computer to carry it out.  A computer makes adifference under Section 101 when it imposes ameaningful limit on the patent claim.  That occurs whenthe claim is directed at improvement in computingtechnology or an innovation that uses computing1 technology to improve other technological functions.2 That's the test that we believe is most faithful to this3 Court's precedents in Bilski and Mayo. It keeps patents4 within their traditional and appropriate domain and it5 is capable of being administered consistently by Courts6 and by PTO examiners.7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you answer the8 argument that your view would extinguish business­method9 patents and make all software ineligible for patent10 protection?11 GENERAL VERRILLI: Yeah, with ­­ let me12 address software patents first because that, I think, is13 obviously a significant question. And it's just not14 correct to say that our approach would make software15 patenting ineligible. Any software patent that improves16 the functioning of the computer technology is eligible.17 Any software patent that improves ­­ that is used to18 improve another technology is eligible. For example,19 the patent in the ­­ in the Diehr case20 which ­­21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why do22 this in that ­­ reach software patents23 case?is one inwe need to reachat all in thisthe necessity for24 25GENERAL VERRILLI:         Well ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         What's45￼461    us to announce a general rule with respect to software?2    There is no software being patented in this case.￼ 3         GENERAL VERRILLI: 4         JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 5         GENERAL VERRILLI: 6    well, they ­­ they ­­ there's a process being and ­­ and 7    one can think of software patents as process patents. 8    And I think that's why my friends on the other side are 9    saying the sky is falling because they ­­ they are10    interpreting what we're saying about that when a11    computer makes ­­ when a computer's involvement makes12    something eligible under 101, it's calling those into13    question, and it doesn't.14         JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Do you think we have to15    reach the patentability of software to answer this case?16         GENERAL VERRILLI:         Well, I think you can ­­17    I think the answer to that question is no, not18    necessarily.  You can decide it by saying that ­­ that19    Bilski answers the question of whether this is an abstract20    idea, because this form of hedging is really no21    different than the form of hedging as a conceptual22    matter at issue in Bilski.  And then Mayo answers the23    question of whether the use of a computer in this case24    adds enough to the abstract idea beyond conventional25    steps, because here all we have, after all, is justWell, I ­­ There's a systems.Well, I ­­ I think ­­47￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425conventional use of computing technology, no computerinnovation, such that you don't qualify under 101.  Youcould take that approach.     But it is important to the United Statesthat we ­­ and to our patent examiners that we get someclarity, if we can.  I think the clarity could come fromthe test that I propose, which I want to reiterate ­­     CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:         Well ­­     JUSTICE BREYER:         Could ­­ could ­­ could yougo on with that because you were just getting to thepoint where I think you say a computer improvement that,in fact, leads to an improvement in harvesting cotton isan improvement through a computer of technology, so itqualifies.     But then I think you were going to say, or Igot this also from the brief, a computer improvementthat leads to an improvement in the methods of sellingbonds over the telephone is not an improvement intechnology reached by the computer.  Am I right aboutthe distinction you're making?     GENERAL VERRILLI:         I don't think there's ayes or no answer to that question.     JUSTICE BREYER:         What is your view?  Yeah,what is ­­ how do we deal with just that problem?     GENERAL VERRILLI:         If there is a genuine     GENERAL VERRILLI:     JUSTICE BREYER:the distinction?  Yeah, that ­­If I'm not right, what isline  That is generally theAnd how is that justified?  I do want ­­That ­­ that is Judge DykGENERAL VERRILLI:we're drawing.

Yes, yes.We got the computer.  But then it doesn't improve thecomputer, but rather, it improves through the computerthe harvesting of cotton.     Now you've got it in what you said was yoursecond category, which is an improvement through thecomputer of a technology.  And I thought in your briefyou were distinguishing an improvement through thecomputer of a human activity that is not a technologyand, in particular, to pick an example of that,something in finance or something in business.     Now, am I right about the distinction you'remaking?491 in ­­ in Bilski in the Federal circuit, four people sort of2 picked it up maybe, five didn't pick it up. Would you say3 a few words about it?4 GENERAL VERRILLI: Sure. About ­­ let me go5 to Bilski there in that I do think, while ­­ while6 certainly the Court held that the term "process" got a7 natural construction which could include business8 methods, it seems to me that that's not all the Court9 said in Bilski. The Court also said that it was10 historically and traditionally quite rare that business11 methods were patent eligible.12 It also said that ­­ that the ­­ that courts13 and the PTO examiners should use the abstract ideas14 exception to 101 to police the appropriate boundary.15 It also said that the16 machine­or­transformation test that the United States17 advocated remained a useful tool. And, of course, that18 directs you to seeing whether there is a technology19 application.20 And, of course, the holding in Bilski was21 that the ­­ the method for hedging risk was ineligible22 because it was an abstract idea, and I can't imagine23 that if in Bilski the ­­ the claim had been exactly the24 same but had added use a computer to carry out some of25 these standard random analysis functions that are￼501 claimed by the patent, that you would have found it to2 be patent eligible.3 And I ­­ I would submit for the Court that4 the key point here, I think, is that now, given where5 the Court ­­ what the Court has held in Bilski, given6 what it's held in Mayo, the abstract ideas exception is7 really the only tool left to deal with what I ­­ what I8 think I fairly read Bilski as saying is a significant9 problem, the proliferation of patents of business10 methods.11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there an example that12 you can give us of a ­­ what we can call a business13 process that is patentable, a process that doesn't14 involve improving the workings of a computer?15 GENERAL VERRILLI: I ­­ I think it's going16 to be difficult for me to do that. I think, for17 example, if you had a business method, a process for18 additional security point­of­sale credit card19 transactions using particular encryption technology,20 that might well be patent eligible. It's a technology21 that it makes conduct of business more efficient or22 effective.23 But there is a technological link here, and24 we do think that's critical to our ­­ to our point of25 view with respect to the case. And I ­­ and I do think,￼51￼1 remember, that when we say something is not patent2 eligible, we're not saying they can't do it. We're3 saying they can't monopolize it.4 And the concern in a situation like this one5 is that if this is patent eligible, it's hard to see6 why, for example, the first person who came up with a7 frequent flier program wouldn't have been able to claim8 a patent there, because, after all, that's a business9 method for improving customer loyalty implemented on a10 computer.11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: General, I ­­ you12 mentioned a while ago the need for greater clarity and13 certainty in this area. And I'm just wondering, in your14 brief, you've got a non­exhaustive list of factors to15 consider, and there are six different ones. And I'm just16 doubtful that that's going to bring about greater17 clarity and certainty.18 GENERAL VERRILLI: I take ­­ I take the19 point, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think the key is that20 they are all directed to answering the question of21 whether the innovation that is claimed and is an22 innovation in either, A, the improvement of a computer's23 functioning or, B, the use of computer technology to24 improve the functioning of another technological25 process, and a case like Diehr would be in the latter52￼1 category.2 And so I do think that that's the key3 benchmark. That's the baseline. That's the test that4 we do think can be applied clearly and consistently by5 the courts or the PTO. And it avoids the risk of things6 like frequent flier programs or the Oakland A's money7 ball methods for evaluating the contributions in8 individual baseball players make or any one of a host of9 other things that our intuitions tell us just don't10 belong in the patent system.11 That's the ­­ drawing that line keeps them12 out; not drawing that line lets them in. And with all13 due respect, I don't think that the novelty and14 nonobviousness filters at 102 and 103 really deal with15 that problem effectively, because when you get to16 nonobviousness in 103, for example, you'll be asking a17 different question.18 If you take the frequent flier program, you19 would say, well, is this innovation in building consumer20 loyalty something that would have been obvious to21 somebody who runs an airline? It's totally divorced22 from the question of technology at that point and,23 therefore, I don't think you're going to get the screen24 that you need to get in order for the patent system to25 be confined to its traditional and appropriate scope.53￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425     If there are no further questions, thankyou.     JUSTICE GINSBURG:         I have a question abouthow do you identify an abstract concept.  The ­­ anatural phenomenon, a mathematical formula, those areeasy to identify, but there has been some confusion onwhat qualifies as an abstract concept.     GENERAL VERRILLI:         We would defineabstract ­­ an abstract concept as a claim that is notdirected to a concrete innovation in technology,science, or the industrial arts.  So it's the ­­ it'sabstract in the sense that it is not a concreteinnovation in the traditional realm of patent law.     Thank you.     CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:         Thank you, General.     Mr. Phillips, you have four minutesremaining.   REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS      ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS     MR. PHILLIPS:         Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.     I'd just like to make a few points.     First of all, with respect to the questionyou asked, which is looking at 159, et cetera, all I cantell you is that if you look at claim 33, it talks aboutmatched orders, matched orders are then described in541 286 and 287, and then makes specific reference to 159,2 and that flow chart that's there. And it's all designed3 as a package. It's only one element of the ­­ of the4 invention, but it is a central element, and it's an easy5 one to understand, that it goes well beyond simply the6 notion of hedge ­­ hedge against settlement risk and do7 it by a computer.8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your adversary says that9 his ­­ the appendix to his brief are the only patents at10 issue, that the flow charts are not at issue in this11 case.12 MR. PHILLIPS: There's no basis for that13 statement, Your Honor. There ­­ remember, this went off14 on a very truncated litigation process. So there's ­­15 you know, we ­­ we got cut off at the beginning of it.￼16 There's been no construction of17 and ­­ and obviously, these are18 to how you interpret the claim.19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:the ­­ of the claimsspecifications that goIf we were to say that 20 there are no business patents ­­21 MR. PHILLIPS:22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:23 survive at all?24 MR. PHILLIPS:25 believe so. I think there's no question. And, youYes.     ­­ would your patentNo, I don't ­­ I don't55￼1 know, General Verrilli could not have been any plainer2 in his statement of how he wants to interpret the3 abstract idea concept.4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes, he wants to say no5 business patents.6 MR. PHILLIPS: No business methods ­­ just another7 way of saying no business methods. And, you know, the8 Court rejected that. And it seems to me extraordinary9 to say Congress didn't reject no business methods in10 101, but we're going to do ­­ we're going to manipulate11 the judicial exception to accomplish precisely that same12 thing. It seems to me that's wholly inappropriate.13 Justice Ginsburg, you asked my ­­ my friend14 here, you know, what's his test? He didn't answer that15 question, you'll notice, because he doesn't have an16 answer. His basic argument is, whatever you do, just17 kill this patent.18 And if I were in his shoes, I suppose I'd19 take that same position. I think what's absolutely20 clear is that the test ought to be one that is21 structured as a very coarse filter, not the kind of22 filter that he's pushing for where it changes over time.23 I mean, I thought his ­­ I thought his response to one24 of the questions about e­mail and word processing that25 Justice Sotomayor asked is over time it would change.561 Well, that's exactly what 102 and 103 are for. That is2 not the purpose of ­­ of Section 101.3 And then he uses the example of encryption.4 I guarantee you if we were arguing about encryption in5 this case, he would say to me that that's an abstract6 principle because encryption is a concept that's been7 around since time immemorial. George Washington used8 it. Everybody has used encryption.9 And the question again, that's not the10 solution to these problems. The question is, how did we11 go about doing it? And we go beyond the basics of12 simply saying use a computer, and that's what we ask13 this Court to focus on and to evaluate.14 As to the frequent flier program, it's15 pretty clear to me that even though it was a novel idea16 in some sense, the concept itself would have been viewed17 in ­­ in the KSR fashion as quite obvious as a means of18 improving customer loyalty.19 There are solutions here. Giving us 10120 pass doesn't create a monopoly. It just gets us to the21 102 and 103 inquiries that are at the heart of what the22 patent laws ­­ and 112 that are at the heart of what the23 patent laws ought to be dealing with.24 If there are no further questions, Your25 Honor, thank you.￼57￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425     CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:         Thank you, counsel.The case is submitted.
