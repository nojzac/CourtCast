Michigan.          Mr. Moran.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. MORAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, andplease the Court:          For centuries the knock and announce rule hasbeen a core part of the right of the people to besecure in their houses from unreasonable searches andseizures.  It reflects the notion that when thegovernment has the right to enter a house, whether toperform an arrest, to search for evidence, or to seizegoods, that the people should have the right to answerthe door in a dignified manner, except in an emergency,and to avoid the unnecessarily gratuitous embarrassmentand shock that often follows a precipitous policeentry.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So wouldn't it bemore accurate to say that it's protected the right tobe free from unreasonable entry as opposed tounreasonable search and seizure?MR. MORAN: Well, this Court has recognized 31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-(10:00 a.m.)reargumentmay it￼1 in Wilson, consistent with the common law authorities,2 Mr. Chief Justice, that they are connected, that the3 entry directly affects the reasonableness of the search4 and seizure that occurs within. And that's why this5 Court in Miller and in Sabbath suppressed the evidence6 following knock and announce violations. But in7 Wilson, this Court directly stated that the common law,8 the Fourth Amendment, -- the common law that informs9 the Fourth Amendment, directly demonstrates that the10 Framers thought that the method of entry directly11 affects whether a search or seizure inside a home is12 reasonable.1314 there has15 financial16 warrant.17 to knock.18 officers.19 anything seized after that is -- must be suppressed.20 MR. MORAN: If there is --21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It just seems to me in the22 hypothetical I put -- and there's obviously a reason I23 put it -- is there's just no causal link between the --24 the suppression and -- and the failure to knock.25 MR. MORAN: Your Honor, the evidence inside41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So -- so in your view,to be a 4- to 6-hour search for complexrecords, business documents.  There's aThe search is otherwise proper.  They forgetThey say, oh, you know, we are policeThere's a discussion for a while.  But --￼1 -- the evidence is seized inside. The seizure of the2 evidence inside is directly related to the manner of3 entry, just as there's a direct causal link between4 when the officers come in without a warrant when they5 should have gotten a warrant first. They thought there6 was an exigent --7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but you say directly8 related. That -- that assumes the very point that I9 have in mind. I don't know why it's directly related.10 MR. MORAN: Well, going back to Wilson, this11 Court said in Wilson, if I might quote from Wilson,12 that the -- the common law search and seizure leaves no13 doubt that the reasonableness of a search of a dwelling14 may depend in part on whether law enforcement officers15 announce their presence and authority prior to16 entering.17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It depends -- it depends in18 part.19 MR. MORAN: It depends in part, certainly.20 There are other factors as well, but the reasonableness21 of the search depends in part.22 The issue --23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, what -- what do you24 do with our opinion in -- in 1986 in Segura v. United25 States, which seems to me to contradict your assertion51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that you cannot separate, for purposes of the2 exclusionary rule, the manner of entry from the search?3 In that case, the -- the policemen entered without a4 search warrant. So the entry was clearly a violation.5 They left two officers in the room and other officers6 went back and got a search warrant. When they returned7 with the search warrant, the two officers who were in8 the room proceeded to do a search, and we admitted the9 evidence. It seems to me that in that case, we -- we10 did succeed in -- in separating the -- the entry from11 the subsequent search, and I don't know why -- why we12 can't do the same thing here.13 MR. MORAN: Because there were exceptional14 circumstances, Justice Scalia, in Segura.15 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what were the16 exceptional circumstances?17 MR. MORAN: A 19-hour delay and a warrant18 that was obtained that had nothing to do with the19 initial entry. That was in no way dependent on the20 initial entry.21 JUSTICE SCALIA: We're still, it would seem22 to me -- I don't know -- the warrant wasn't dependent23 on the initial entry? You could also say the initial24 entry wasn't the product of the -- of the later25 warrant.61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. MORAN:  The initial entry was not theproduct of the later warrant, but once this Court ruled--          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And therefore was unlawful.          MR. MORAN:  That's right.  The -- the initialentry wasn't lawful.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  But we didn't hold -- but wedidn't hold that.          MR. MORAN:  Well, but this -- the Governmentin Segura never contested the fact that the evidencethat was seen and seized during the initial entryshould be suppressed.  And that's all we're asking forhere.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me?  No, I don'tunderstand that.          MR. MORAN:  When the officers went ininitially in Segura, some evidence was seen and seizedat that time, and the Government did not contest thatthat evidence should not --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  No.  I'm talking about onlythe evidence that -- that was the product of the searchconducted after the warrant was delivered.          MR. MORAN:  That's right.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that evidence wasadmitted in.71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. MORAN:  Right, but the --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Even though the entry ofthose officers was an unlawful entry.          MR. MORAN:  The entry -- the initial entrywas an unlawful entry.  When they came back with thewarrant --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, no, no.  The -- therewas no subsequent entry.  You said the initial entrywas unlawful.  Those officers stayed there.  Theirpresence there was the product of an unlawful entry.          MR. MORAN:  Their presence was, yes.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Their presence was theproduct of an unlawful entry, and nonetheless, weadmitted in the -- the material that they obtained inthe search after a warrant had been obtained.          MR. MORAN:  I -- I read Segura as saying thatthe presence -- the later presence of the warrant,which was in no way tainted by the initial entry, madethe officers' presence in the home retroactively lawfulfrom that point.  It was unlawful until that point,which is why the Government did not contest the -- thepoint that all the evidence that was seized during theinitial entryissued had tofor here.up to the point when the warrant wasbe suppressed.  That's all we're asking8 Washington, DC 20005 1-1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          I can imagine hypotheticals in which you havea knock and announce violation and then somethinghappens like in Segura or like in Murray, where youhave later action that creates an independent source.But in your typical --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose the -- suppose theofficer -- excuse me, we forgot to knock, but we arepolice officers.  We do have a warrant.  We're going toproceed with a search.  Please don't be alarmed.  We'regoing to -- does that do it?          MR. MORAN:  That might do it.  That would bea different case than the case we have here --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but your -- yourpoint is -- is there -- is that they have to go out andcome back in again.          MR. MORAN:  You would have to create somesort of analogy to Murray and Segura.  Murray andSegura are exceptional cases.  There are very rarecases when the Government breaks in and then realizeswe shouldn't have done that.  We should go get awarrant.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I agree.  Segura -- Iforget what it is in torts.  It's kind of asupervening, independent cause or something like that.MR. MORAN: Yes. Yes. And -- and you can 91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 have -- imagine such hypotheticals in the knock and2 announce context. And in the Moreno case in the Ninth3 Circuit, you have one where you have a knock and4 announce violation committed in the outer door. No5 evidence is found in the outer door, but then the6 officers properly knock and announce at the inner door,7 and the Court in the Ninth Circuit held that that was8 proper to seize that. We have no problem with that.9 That -- that seems like a proper result because10 ultimately the purposes of the knock and announce rule11 were vindicated when the officers knocked and announced12 at the inner door before -- before forcing entry.13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Moran, how -- how14 long do you think the officers had to wait before they15 could have entered?16 MR. MORAN: In this case?17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.18 MR. MORAN: From Banks, somewhere closer to19 15 seconds. 15 to 20 seconds was considered --20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What would -- if they21 had done that, what would have been different from what22 happened in this case?23 MR. MORAN: Mr. Hudson presumably would have24 gotten up from his chair, would have come to the door,25 would have admitted the officers, and then after --101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why do you presumethat?  Someone sitting in a chair with gun -- with agun and the drugs you say would have gotten up andsaid, oh, it's the police.  Let's see what they want?          MR. MORAN:  We presume that people actlawfully in response to commands from the police.  Wedo not presume that people will act unlawfully.  If thepolice have evidence or information that someone will,in fact, act unlawfully by trying to dispose theevidence or by --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Isn't a good sign ofwhat might have happened what actually happened whenthe police came in, which was there was an effort tohide the evidence?          MR. MORAN:  The record does not disclose anyeffort on Mr. Hudson's part to hide any evidence, YourHonor.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought -- where --where were the drugs found?          MR. MORAN:  The rocks of crack cocaine, forwhich he was convicted, were found in his left frontpants pocket.found?CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where was the gunMR. MORAN: The gun was in the chair. 111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In the chair?               MR. MORAN:  In the chair.  There was no     evidence that there was any secreting of evidence in     this case.               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is there any reason     to suppose that if the officers had waited 15 seconds     instead of the 3 to 4, that they wouldn't have found     the same evidence?               MR. MORAN:  It's always possible, Your Honor,     but we don't presume that.  Just as in Segura, the     Court said --               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, the only -- the     only reason they wouldn't have found the same evidence,     I take it, is if they -- if -- if the defendants had     had additional time to dispose of it.               MR. MORAN:  We don't contest that they would     have found the same evidence, no.  We do not argue that     Mr. Hudson or any of the other people in the house     would have destroyed the evidence.               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is --               MR. MORAN:  We certainly don't make that     argument.               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is in the chair the same     thing as on the chair?               MR. MORAN:  I --121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You tell me something is inthe chair.  Did they stuff it -- stuff it in thecushion or what?          MR. MORAN:  It's not really clear from therecord, Justice Scalia.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, inside it --          MR. MORAN:  It's in -- in the chair.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think it's pretty clearyou don't talk of something as being in the chair.It's on the chair unless you stuff it in the chair.  Iassume he stuffed it behind a pillow or something.          MR. MORAN:  I'm not completely clear exactlywhere in the chair it was.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  English is English.  Yousaid it was in the chair.          MR. MORAN:  In the chair.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.          MR. MORAN:  49 of the 50 States currentlysuppress evidence following knock and announceviolations, just as this Court did in -- in Miller andSabbath.          JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what do you think isthe standard for determining what sort of causalconnection there has to be in order to have suppressionhere?131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. MORAN: We go back to the Wong Sun fruits2 test. Is the evidence that was recovered the direct3 fruit of the violation? In other words, is there a4 clear, logical connection? Now, my opponent --5 JUSTICE ALITO: What's the purpose of the6 causal connection requirement? What's the reason for7 having it?8 MR. MORAN: Well, it's so -- it's so that9 there is a -- an obvious connection. Before the court10 takes the step of -- of excluding evidence, there11 should be some connection, some clear connection,12 between the violation and the evidence recovered. But13 my --1415 requiring 1617 matter of18 unrelated19 -- should20 2122 if, for example, the police break into my house and --23 and find evidence -- find nothing in my house -- they24 illegally break into my house, but then they -- they do25 a proper warrant search of my office and find evidence,141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-JUSTICE ALITO:  And what's the reason fora clear connection?MR. MORAN:  I suppose that it's simply thelogic, that evidence that's completelyto a violation nobody would think should bebe excluded.  But evidence --JUSTICE ALITO:  But why?MR. MORAN:  Well, it's -- it's unrelated.  So￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425I -- I don't -- I don't see any connection between theillegal search of my house and the legal search of myoffice, assuming that it was not the fruit of theillegal search of my house.          JUSTICE ALITO:  But why?  Isn't the reasonjust a -- just a question of crafting an appropriateremedy for -- an appropriate deterrence --          MR. MORAN:  Yes.          JUSTICE ALITO:  -- for violations?          MR. MORAN:  Exactly.  It -- the whole pointis deterrence.  And so you wouldn't deter the officerswho illegally broke into my house by excluding theevidence from my office if -- if -- it may even well bedifferent --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Sure you would.  Sure youwould.          MR. MORAN:  Well, it may well even be adifferent --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, you'd deterred himmore if you threw the whole case out, but we don't dothat.          MR. MORAN:  No, we don't.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.          MR. MORAN:  We -- we limit --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, we -- we insist that151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the deterrence somehow be related --          MR. MORAN:  We do.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- to the -- and -- and therelated usually means that the acquisition of theevidence was the product of the violation.  It wascaused by the violation.  And -- and for that reason,we keep it out.          And here, it's -- it's hard to say that thiswas caused by the fact that they -- that they enteredin a few seconds too soon.  So he would have answeredthe door and they would have seen the stuff.          MR. MORAN:  What the knock and announceviolation causes, Justice Scalia, is the officer to beillegally in the home.  Going back to the common lawauthorities, the courts have long recognized --American courts have long recognized that an officerwho illegally enters a home, even with a valid writ ora valid piece of paper allowing him to be in the home,if the manner of entry is illegal, he is a trespasser. His entry is -- is void ab initio.  And so in thatsense, the entry is the cause of the illegal --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Although you say it can beretroactively validated.          MR. MORAN:  After Segura --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, in Segura, you can161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425retroactively validate it by -- by getting a warrantafterwards.          Could it be -- have been retroactivelyvalidated by knocking and announcing afterwards?  I'm-- I'm sorry we came in too soon, and they run back tothe door and they knock and announce and wait -- wait10 seconds.          MR. MORAN:  Again, I --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Would that do the job?          MR. MORAN:  I concede that it's possible thatyou can come up with a Segura-type hypothetical.  Ithink the easiest one is the Moreno case from the NinthCircuit.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  The hypothetical soundsridiculous only if one accepts your explanation ofSegura, that -- that it was somehow a retroactivevalidation.          MR. MORAN:  Well --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Sorry.  I have laryngitis.Can you hear me all right?          MR. MORAN:  Yes, I can, Justice Breyer.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Why is it retroactivevalidation?  I would have thought Segura and thosecases are Silverthorne cases.MR. MORAN: It is. It's an -- 171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: All that it is is it's an2 independent chain of events.3 MR. MORAN: It's an independent source.4 JUSTICE BREYER: An independent chain of5 events that almost certainly would have led to the6 discovery of the evidence despite -- not without --7 despite the unlawful entry. And if that's so, all we8 have is a -- is a set of cases where deterrence is most9 unlikely to play any significant role because no10 policeman could possibly count on that kind of thing11 getting the evidence in --12 MR. MORAN: And that's exactly right. And --13 and the situation we have in Michigan now is that14 officers know to a certainty that if they violate the15 knock and announce rule, nothing will happen. And so16 that's why in all the other States --17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not true.18 There are cases where the violation of the knock and19 announce rule gives rise to evidence that may be20 admitted and that would presumably be excluded if you21 can show that the seizure is related to the violation.22 The problem here is that the evidence that is being23 suppressed, as -- as you've suggested, that there's no24 question that it would have been available if the25 officers had waited 15 seconds as opposed to 4 seconds. 181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. MORAN: Mr. Chief Justice, none of the2 parties has been able to identify any cases in which3 you can point to evidence and say this -- this evidence4 was produced by the knock and announce violation and5 nothing else in the house --6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The Solicitor General7 hypothesized one in the amicus briefs. If somebody --8 you know, they -- they burst in and someone screams,9 you know, run away, it's the police, that excited10 utterance caused by the absence of a knock and announce11 would presumably be related to the violation and could12 be suppressed. That doesn't mean that the gun and the13 drugs that are found in the room is in the same14 category.15 MR. MORAN: If I may make two responses to16 that. First, the Solicitor General hypothesized such a17 case but has not identified a single case where that's18 ever happened. It's purely hypothetical.19 But the second point is that excluding that20 evidence would have no deterrent effect whatsoever21 because by -- by definition, that's evidence that the22 police would only get by committing the knock and23 announce violation. So the police lose nothing by24 risking the possibility that somebody will make an25 excited utterance and then say, okay, we won't get to191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 use that excited utterance, but we would never have2 gotten that excited utterance in the first place.3 That's not deterrence, Mr. Chief Justice. That's4 restitution. That's like saying that I can be deterred5 from stealing something by being told that if I'm6 caught, I'll have to give it back.7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What it is is8 recognizing that if there is a fruit of the illegal9 act, it is suppressed so that there is a cost to the10 illegal act. What it's saying is that not everything11 that happens after the illegal act is a fruit of the12 illegal act.13 MR. MORAN: I think your question, Mr. Chief14 Justice, really goes to the worst position language in15 Nix, and the point is, from our brief, is that this16 Court has placed the prosecution in the worst position17 than it would have been had the police acted lawfully18 dozens, possibly scores, of time -- times.19 All the cases in which the Court has noted20 that the police easily could have obtained a warrant.21 Most recently in Georgia v. Randolph, where this Court22 noted that there were two lawful methods for the police23 to get the cocaine -- the cocaine residue on the straw,24 but still suppressed the evidence. The police and the25 prosecution do get placed in a worse position, and201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that's necessary for deterrence. What --2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would it have been3 possible for these police to get a no-knock warrant?4 MR. MORAN: It might well have been. I was5 asked this question last time, Justice Ginsburg, and6 I'd like to modify my answer. In Michigan, there is no7 statute governing no-knock warrants, and there's --8 there are also no court decisions governing no-knock9 warrants. And there never will be under the People v.10 Stevens regime.11 One of the nice things that's happened in --12 in -- since Wilson v. Arkansas, in fact, before Wilson13 v. Arkansas in many States, is courts have developed --14 developed procedures for police officers to get no-15 knock warrants, to go to the police and ask for a no-16 knock warrant.17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what about in this18 case, which is Justice Ginsburg's question? If the19 police said, we have reasonable grounds to -- to20 believe that he has a weapon and we're also looking for21 drugs that are easily disposable, would that be grounds22 for knocking -- for not -- for dispensing with the23 knock requirement?24 MR. MORAN: Could the -- could a judge have25 issued such a warrant in Michigan? Is that your211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425question?          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, let's take it step bystep.  Suppose the police articulate this at the outset--          MR. MORAN:  It could well --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- and under -- under Stateprocedures, they're allowed to make the on-the-spotjudgment.  Would that -- would those facts suffice toallow them to enter without the knock?          MR. MORAN:  If they had specific informationalong those lines, that -- that there was evidencehidden in places or -- or stored in places where itcould easily be disposed --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, is that correct?  Ithought in most States, there had to be a statute thatauthorizes a non-knock warrant.          MR. MORAN:  In most States --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  And that most States dohave such statutes.  And we had this case becauseMichigan chooses to go on -- on a separate path.          MR. MORAN:  Most States do have statutes, buta few States by court decision have allowed for theissuance of no-knock warrants.  My point --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Even -- even if Michigandoesn't, I mean, that has nothing -- as I understand221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 it, that -- that doesn't affect the -- the answer to2 the Federal question that we have because, as I3 understand it, we -- we can -- we can take as good law4 that even with a warrant that does not have a no-knock5 authorization, if the police have a justification for6 going in without knocking, so far as the Fourth7 Amendment8 910 1112 is what -- what is Michigan law on the subject, but the13 -- the issue we've got is not Michigan law.14 MR. MORAN: That's right. And this case15 comes to us in the posture in which --16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But this is a -- this is a17 place -- a case in which the warrant was for drugs. Is18 that not so?19 MR. MORAN: It was.20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, so in -- in this21 case, they could have entered in your view if they had22 specific knowledge of the gun and disposable23 contraband.24 MR. MORAN: Yes, after Banks and -- and25 Richards, especially Richards, if the police had231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-is concerned, the search is still good.MR. MORAN:  That's right.JUSTICE SOUTER:  Isn't that correct?MR. MORAN:  Absolutely.JUSTICE SOUTER:  So what we're really arguing￼1 reasonable suspicion that you had contraband in a2 position where it could be easily disposed and if they3 had information about the weapons that could be used to4 resist the police entry, then yes, there could have5 been a -- a legal no-knock entry.6 JUSTICE SCALIA: What about just the former7 without the latter? I thought the former alone would8 be enough.9 MR. MORAN: Either would be. That's correct,10 Justice Scalia.11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Going back to my question,12 isn't it then a reasonable assumption, based on the13 police experience in case after case, that where there14 -- where narcotics are housed, there is often a gun and15 there is ease of disposal, couldn't the police simply16 say this is a narcotics search and therefore we don't17 need to knock and announce because those circumstances18 will be present in most cases?19 MR. MORAN: No, because this Court20 unanimously foreclosed that argument in Richards v.21 Wisconsin by holding that there must be a22 particularized showing for the particular case. That23 particularized showing I will gladly concede will be24 easier to make in a narcotics case than it would be in25 a -- in a stolen property case.241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          But it wasn't made in this case, and thiscase comes to this Court on the posture that theprosecution has conceded, at every step of the way,that that particularized showing was not made here andthat, therefore, there was a knock and announceviolation.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  Aparticularized showing of what?          MR. MORAN:  That in this particular case,it's likely that the drugs would be in an easilydisposable situation and that the occupants would bearmed and ready to resist the police entry.  And therewas no such showing made here.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I --          MR. MORAN:  The prosecution didn't evenattempt to make such a showing.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm vaguely recallingcases from the court of appeals in the D.C. Circuitthat accepted a presumption that if there are drugsaround, there are likely to be firearms around.  Areyou saying that that's inconsistent with the Richardsdecision?          MR. MORAN:  That might not be inconsistent,but the -- the -- to follow that up with, therefore,you can do a no-knock entry automatically is251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425inconsistent with the Richards decision.          The --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask this question?As I understand it, the prosecutor conceded a violationof the knock and announce rule.          MR. MORAN:  Yes.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  And I'm just wondering.  InMichigan, since there's no adverse effect to it, do theprosecutors routinely concede that there's a violationbecause there's no point in litigating it I suppose?          MR. MORAN:  Well, I don't even think we getthat far, Justice Stevens.  Motions to suppress aren'tfiled.  There's no point filing a motion to suppressexcept for the -- the fact that this case is pending inthis Court.  There's no point for --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  So that if the issuearises, you can assume the prosecutor will always say,yes, we'll assume there was a violation.  There wouldbe no reason not to assume that.          MR. MORAN:  That's right.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  So you'll never reallylitigate in Michigan how far they can go before theyviolate the rule.          MR. MORAN:  It's a dead letter in Michigan.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  But I assume that lawsuits261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 are allowable if -- if knock and announce is -- is not2 observed, and if you intrude upon someone in a state of3 undress.4 MR. MORAN: Michigan --5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't a civil lawsuit6 bringable?7 MR. MORAN: Michigan has a particularly8 vigorous State immunity statute that makes it9 effectively impossible to sue for a -- a knock and10 announce violation. I have not found a single Michigan11 case in which anyone has successfully sued for a knock12 and announce violation.13 You can sue in Federal court under section14 1983, but there you run into various doctrines,15 especially including qualified immunity.16 I made the claim the first time and it still17 hasn't been contradicted by my opponents. We've not18 been able to find any cases, published or unpublished,19 in which anyone has collected anything other than20 nominal damages anywhere in the United States --21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But those doctrines22 that you're talking about would be overridden on the23 hypothetical that you want us24 In other words, you're saying25 evidence, there's going to be271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-to be concerned about.if you don't suppress theno incentive to comply￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425with the law.  So they're going to deliberately violatethe law.  Well, if they're deliberately violating thelaw, qualified immunity isn't going to help them verymuch.          MR. MORAN:  Qualified immunity would stillprotect them to the extent that any reasonable officercould have thought that a -- a no-knock entry wasvalid.  I cited a number of cases, for example, whereinnocent people have been shot following entries intowrong doors, and qualified immunity has been granted tothe officers.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wait a minute.  Thegovernment is not arguing here that -- that it's valid. It's just arguing that though it is invalid, thepunishment for it should not be to let the criminal go. That's -- that's all they're saying.          MR. MORAN:  That -- that is their argument.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  The punishment for theinvalidity should not be the -- the inadmissibility ofall of the evidence of the crime that was found.          MR. MORAN:  That --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's quite differentfrom saying that it's -- that it's valid.  So I thinkthey acknowledge that -- that a lawsuit against anofficer who knowingly dispenses with -- with knock and281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 announce because, as you say, he says there's --2 there's no consequence, but there is a consequence. He3 can be sued.4 MR. MORAN: I assume --5 JUSTICE SCALIA: And sometimes he may be6 going into the wrong house and the person suing him may7 not be a criminal, but may be some -- some innocent --8 innocent bystander.9 And -- and what about -- you know, you say10 there's no incentive to knock and announce. There --11 there may -- you don't know any Michigan cases in which12 a -- a civil suit has succeeded, but I know numerous13 cases in which police who -- who burst in without14 knocking and announcing expose themselves to danger,15 that is, to being shot at by a -- by a householder who16 doesn't know that they are the police. Isn't that17 enough of -- of an incentive, the fact that you may18 lose your life?19 MR. MORAN: No, Your Honor, because I think20 what some officers will do is exactly what Officer Good21 did in this case, which is shout police and then burst22 in immediately. So they'll do the announce part, which23 protects the police, to some extent, from being shot,24 but they will skip the rest of the knock and announce25 requirement, which is to wait some reasonable amount of291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 time to allow the householder to make himself more2 dignified, to get to the door, to answer the door, to3 admit the police in a dignified manner.4 You raise the point that lots of innocent5 people are subject to search warrants. Thousands of6 cases every year of -- of people who didn't do anything7 either --8 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I think9 you thought the police here had to wait10 seconds? What was the figure you gave?11 MR. MORAN: Well, from Banks,12 ruled that 15 seconds -- 15 to 20 seconds was an13 appropriate time for a drug search.14 JUSTICE ALITO: And now suppose they waited 1015 seconds. And so there would be a -- a constitutional16 violation? Why would suppression be appropriate in17 that situation? Why would it be in any way18 proportional to the -- to the violation that occurred?19 MR. MORAN: Well, if it was 10 seconds,20 Justice Alito, the government still might have an21 argument. 15 seconds was enough in Banks. The Court22 did not say --23 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, wherever the line is,24 suppose they're just -- they're just slightly on the25 wrong side of the line?301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-you said the --what?  15this Court￼1 MR. MORAN: I think as a practical matter,2 that if the police are just very slightly on the wrong3 side of the line, the courts are not likely to hold4 that there was a knock and announce violation. But5 when you have a flagrant violation like here --6 JUSTICE ALITO: Then you're -- you're7 contradicting the premise.8 MR. MORAN: Well, in a case like -- in a --9 if a court were to hold that the police did violate the10 knock and announce requirement by coming in -- by11 coming in, by not giving the person a reasonable amount12 of time to come to the door or to make himself13 presentable, then yes, the evidence should be14 suppressed because those officers need to be deterred.15 The -- the exclusionary rule is all about deterrence,16 and is there any method that will deter officers from17 violating the knock and announce requirement other than18 excluding the evidence by teaching them through example19 that next time you need to wait longer? You need to20 wait a reasonable amount of time for someone to come to21 the door unless you have facts suggesting that waiting22 a reasonable amount of time would defeat the purposes23 of the search.24 JUSTICE SCALIA: What about -- you talk about25 deterrence. What about their not getting promoted? I311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425assume that -- that police departments, even if youhave some maverick officers, that the administration ofthe police department teaches them that they have toknock and announce.  Or if it doesn't teach them that,then you do have a 1983 cause of action against thecity, not just the officers.  And that -- you know,that's a deep pocket.          MR. MORAN:  I very seriously doubt officerssuch as Officer Good will not be promoted because ofthe violation that he committed --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why?  Really?          MR. MORAN:  -- in a case like this.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- you know, I'm thepolice commissioner and I have a policy that you -- youobey the law, you knock and announce, and -- and I knowthat this particular officer disregards it all thetime.  You really think that's not going to go in hisrecord?          MR. MORAN:  I do, Justice Scalia, and I thinkit's inconsistent with Mapp in which the Courtrecognized that other remedies have proven completelyfutile in enforcing the -- the Fourth Amendment.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mapp was a long time ago.It was before          MR.1983 was being used, wasn't it?MORAN:  It was before 1983 was --32 Washington, DC 20005 1-1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You bet you.          MR. MORAN:  -- being used.  But I don't thinksection 1983 has changed the landscape here.  I -- Idon't think Mapp is ripe for overruling, and in fact,the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, one of the amicifor the other side, concedes that tort remedies cannot,at this time, substitute for the exclusionary rule.          If there are no other question, I'll reservethe balance of my time.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. Moran.          Mr. Baughman, we'll hear now from you.           ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY A. BAUGHMAN               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MR. BAUGHMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          Justicewas arguing casesRobert Jackson once said that when hebefore the Court, he always gavethe well-structured argument hethree arguments:rehearsed, the disjointed and confused argument hedelivered to the Court, and the brilliant argument hethought of in the car on the way home.  I have the rareopportunity to deliver the argument I thought of in thecar on the way home.(Laughter.)MR. BAUGHMAN:  But I'm going to refrain,331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 mindful of the fact that this is our -- our second time2 through and try to hone in on -- on what I think are3 some critical points.4 A search warrant, a judicial command, must be5 obtained from a neutral and detached magistrate. It6 must particularly describe the place to be searched and7 the things to be seized, and it must be issued based on8 probable cause drawn from information which is sworn to9 are affirmed -- or affirmed. If these requirements are10 met, the privacy of the described premises will be11 invaded, and any privilege the occupants might have to12 withhold evidence or contraband from the police is13 abrogated.14 But that command must be executed in a15 reasonable fashion. And so the police may not bring16 third parties into the premises who are unnecessary to17 the execution of the warrant. They may not search in18 places where the items described may not be found.19 They may not cause unnecessary damage to property, and20 they may not use force to accomplish the entry unless21 consent to enter is denied either explicitly or22 implicitly or unless entering immediately is reasonable23 under the circumstances to avoid the destruction of the24 evidence or harm to the officers.25 If no valid warrant exists in the first341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 place, then -- and no exception exists, then the2 privacy of the dwelling has been unlawfully invaded.3 It never should have happened. But if a valid warrant4 exists and some error occurs in its execution, it is5 not the invasion of privacy which should not have6 occurred that is commanded by the warrant.78 there was9 there wasJUSTICE SOUTER:  And you -- you concede thaterror in execution here?  You concede thata violation because -- technically becauseno knock?10 there was 111213 You've got a case in which, as I understand it, not14 only was the evidence but the warrant itself anMR. BAUGHMAN:  Yes.JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why do you concede that?15 indication not only that drugs were present, but that16 guns were present. It's perfectly true we don't have a17 general rule that anytime you do a drug search, you can18 do a no-knock, but in this case you had specific19 evidence that there were firearms there. And based on20 what I've seen in the case, I don't know why Michigan21 did not argue that, in fact, it was justified to go in22 without knocking.23 And I'll be candid to say you -- to tell you24 that the fact that Michigan does not make that argument25 suggests to me that Michigan is trying to structure a351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 case in which it's going to have the best shot to -- to2 get the exclusionary rule out of the way here. Why3 don't you claim that the search was lawful?4 MR. BAUGHMAN: Well, let me first say this5 case was not structured to try -- to try to -- to get6 it here on our -- on our part. I think initially the7 prosecutor handling the hearing here reached the8 conclusion that Richards precluded an argument that a9 no -- that the failure to knock and announce was10 justified here. But --11 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, Richards precluded a12 general rule, but it didn't preclude you from arguing13 in a specific case, and it's the fact that the14 prosecutor and, hence, all the way up the line to you15 do not argue that is -- is what I don't understand.16 MR. BAUGHMAN: Well, again, I -- I think it17 would be an interesting argument to revisit Richards on18 this proposition.19 JUSTICE SOUTER: I don't think we have to20 revisit Richards. I -- I think what -- what I'm --21 what I'm concerned is that you don't make an argument22 based on the evidence in this case that you had23 probable cause to believe that there were going to be24 guns facing you when -- when you went in the door and25 therefore the knock was not required.361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. BAUGHMAN:  Again, I think the -- thebelief of the prosecutors, as the case went forward,was that because that belief, the -- you're correct.Guns were described as things to be seized in thewarrant.  The probable cause for that was not anyspecific knowledge about a gun in the house.  It wasthe officer's general experience that when I executesearch warrants for drugs, guns tend to be there.Richards seems to say, at least it certainly could beargued, that's not sufficient.  You can't make thatdecision based on experience that drugs and guns gotogether.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, are you suggesting --did -- did the warrant -- I don't know this.  I shouldbut I don't.  Did the warrant authorize seizure of gunsas well as --          MR. BAUGHMAN:  Yes, it did.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- drugs?  Well, are yousuggesting that the -- the gun portion of theauthorization was, in fact, invalid?          MR. BAUGHMAN:  No.  I -- I don't because Ibelieve probable cause can be based on the experienceof officers --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.          MR. BAUGHMAN:  -- without specific knowledge371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 of the --2 JUSTICE SOUTER: If -- so -- in any case, at3 -- at the moment that you got the warrant, you -- you4 had, in fact, a -- a finding by a trial court, or a --5 whoever the issuing magistrate was, that there was6 probable cause to believe that you were going to7 confront guns as well as drugs inside. And -- and8 Richards does not seem to me to be a good reason, under9 those circumstances, to concede that you didn't have a10 basis for -- for dispensing with the knock.11 MR. BAUGHMAN: It may not have been a good12 reason, but it was the reason in that the prosecutors13 believed that the rejection of the drugs and guns14 always go together as a justifying -- not knocking15 and announcing in Richards meant that the determination16 in this case that guns were on the premises based on17 the officer's experience that drugs and guns go18 together, not any specific knowledge about a gun was19 inadequate then to forgive knocking and announcing.20 That may have been a misjudgment, but it was a belief21 that Richards foreclosed that. It was not an attempt22 to set the case up. We had the Stevens case in23 Michigan.24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, do you think25 just as an empirical matter that in most cases where381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425there's known to be guns plus drugs, the police willenter without knocking?          MR. BAUGHMAN:  No.  I -- I don't believethat's the case.  I think if there's specific knowledgethat there are guns on the premises, yes, absolutely.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  There's -- there's specificknowledge.          MR. BAUGHMAN:  Yes.  If they knew -- I thinkthen they would enter without knocking.  If -- if the--          JUSTICE SOUTER:  There was specific knowledgehere.          MR. BAUGHMAN:  Well, no, it's knowledge basedon experience.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, you got a -- you got awarrant --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's in the warrant.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- that said look for them. That's about as specific as you can get.          MR. BAUGHMAN:  I understand but the facts inthe affidavit justifying looking for guns was in myexperience drugs and guns go together.ways.JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, you can't have it bothJUSTICE STEVENS: But, nevertheless, was not 391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425there a finding that there was probable cause thatthere was a gun there?          MR. BAUGHMAN:  Yes.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  All right.          MR. BAUGHMAN:  I would be happy to -- to, ina different case, make the argument that althoughRichards says a court cannot say that knock andannounce is forgiven every time a drug warrant isexecuted on the theory that experience teaches thatdrugs and guns go together.  I'd be happy to argue thatthat holding does not apply when a judge determines, inissuing the warrant, that drugs and guns go together,so I'm putting it in the warrant.  I'd be happy toargue that case.          At this time --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Don't argue it to me.  Itdoesn't make much sense.(Laughter.)          MR. BAUGHMAN:  Prosecutors believed thatRichards couldn't be avoided by putting the drugs andguns go together into the warrant instead of --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask this?          MR. BAUGHMAN:  -- the judge --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask this questionabout the practice in Michigan? Since People against 401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Stevens and People against Vasquez have been decided,are there any cases, other than this one, in which aprosecutor has raised the knock and announce argumentthat got litigated all the way to the appellate court?          MR. BAUGHMAN:  Yes, there have been a handfulof cases where defense attorneys have filed a motion,despite People v. Stevens, and then they -- they havelost because of Stevens.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  So but there really is noincentive for the prosecutor to fight -- argue aboutthis anymore in Michigan, is there?          MR. BAUGHMAN:  No.  Not, in the criminalcase, the prosecutor is responsible -- be, as it was inthis case, although the judge refused to follow Stevens--          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, it concedes there's aviolation.          MR. BAUGHMAN:  -- there should be no hearing. They're not conceding the violation.  They're simplysaying the -- a violation is irrelevant to the questionof the admission of the evidence, so we should notlitigate it.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  So there's no point inlitigating it.MR. BAUGHMAN: Exactly. 411111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE STEVENS:  So it's a functionalequivalent of conceding a violation in every casebecause there's simply no effective remedy.          MR. BAUGHMAN:  Well --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  No effective remedy in thelitigation itself.          MR. BAUGHMAN:  In the criminal --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Of course, there's alwaysthe possibility that the officer will be disciplined byhis very zealous superior, I guess.          MR. BAUGHMAN:  Or -- or civil litigation.There is no -- there is no exclusion.  Yes, that'scorrect.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Do you -- do you dispute --your -- your brother on the other side said in hisargument that he had not heard a dispute about this.But do you dispute his claim that there has never beenany -- at least in recent history, any -- any civiljudgment actually rendered against anyone in theofficer's position?          MR. BAUGHMAN:  I -- I am not aware of onefrom Michigan.  I am aware that there have been civiljudgments against officers from other jurisdictions.I'm not aware of one in Michigan.  I know there have --there are some suits that have been brought in the421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 Eastern District that are pending. And -- and part of2 the difficulty is civil suits can be brought. They can3 be settled. There can even be trials and damages4 awarded, and they won't be in the reports. They're not5 in the F.Supp.'s. They're not in the --6 JUSTICE SOUTER: But we don't -- we don't7 have any indication that there's an effective8 deterrence then in civil suits. Maybe there will be9 some day, but we haven't seen it yet in Michigan, I10 take it.11 MR. BAUGHMAN: I think one could also make12 the argument that that cuts the other way. The fact13 that there are not a lot of reported decisions may mean14 there's not a lot of violations going on, that the15 police are not routinely kicking down doors without16 knocking and announcing when they should, and that's17 why they're not being sued.18 JUSTICE SOUTER: And it may mean that -- that19 potential plaintiffs say if the courts are winking at20 this in the criminal case, we don't have much chance of21 getting a -- a verdict in a civil case.22 MR. BAUGHMAN: No. It's not --23 JUSTICE SOUTER: We don't know,24 might be the case too, mightn't it?25 MR. BAUGHMAN: It might be, but431111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  1-but thatit's not beenWashington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425my experience that either -- either the criminals orcertainly innocent parties, people -- probable cause,after all, doesn't mean certainty.  People who have haddamage done or physical injury occur have been -- areshy about suing the government in those circumstances.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is there any evidence thatthe citizens -- that Michiganders are less litigiousthan people in other States?          MR. BAUGHMAN:  That certainly hasn't been myexperience and certainly not in my county.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  So -- so the mere existenceof suits in other States ought to suffice as something--          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that's -- that's adeterrent.  Shouldn't it?          MR. BAUGHMAN:  I would -- I would think so.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I still don't understandwhere -- where we are with guns.  You -- you have aspecific finding in a warrant that says there'sprobable cause there's going to be a gun, and there'sdrugs.  I take it your position is that this allows youto enter without knocking.          MR. BAUGHMAN:  It would be my position.  Iwould have thought, as the prosecutor thought here,441111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that a probable cause finding that guns are in the2 house, based not on any specific knowledge about guns,3 but based on experience in similar circumstances, was4 not sufficient to satisfy Richards in terms of not5 knocking. I would certainly make the argument that it6 ought to be, but I would have not criticized the7 prosecutor, who didn't make that argument.8 JUSTICE STEVENS: But why would you bother9 making the argument? The evidence can't be suppressed.10 I don't understand why -- why would there ever be any11 litigation over this issue in a criminal case?12 MR. BAUGHMAN: And -- and I think Your Honor13 is correct. The prosecutor's point in this case was we14 shouldn't litigate --15 JUSTICE STEVENS: And can you cite me any16 other example of a -- a violation of the Fourth17 Amendment? Maybe we shouldn't have held it's a18 violation. I understand that argument. Is there any19 other area of Fourth Amendment law in which the20 violation of the Fourth Amendment is not followed by a21 suppression ruling?22 MR. BAUGHMAN: Well, certainly. Let me give23 an example. One of the circumstances that I indicated24 that the police -- a manner in which the police must25 behave when reasonably executing a warrant is not to451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 look in places where the items sought cannot be found.2 If the police were searching a house for stolen3 computer monitors, a large object, and as they were4 searching for them, they opened the desk drawer where5 the monitor could not be and they shut it, and they6 found computer monitors in the home, the -- this Court7 has never addressed the question, that I'm aware of,8 but the law is uniform in the country that you would9 not suppress the computer monitors.10 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, now you're talking11 about other cases in other courts. I looked through12 with my law clerks 300 cases since Weeks, not Mapp,13 Weeks. That's what we're talking about, 1914. I14 couldn't find in 300 cases one single Supreme Court15 case that did not suppress evidence where there was a16 Fourth Amendment violation with one exception. The17 exception is there are sets of cases where deterrence18 is really not a factor. For example, good faith; for19 example, it isn't going into a criminal proceeding.20 Okay?21 Now, what I'd like you to do is to tell me if22 I missed some, which is certainly possible, or second,23 if you want us to change the rule and go back 300 years24 or 300 cases back before 1914, or are you going to tell25 us that deterrence doesn't play a role here or whatever461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425you want?  I want to put to you the state of the art asfar as I can see it.          MR. BAUGHMAN:  It would be my position thatin all of those cases, there was a causal connectionbetween the evidence found in the --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, there's a causalconnection absolutely here.  It is a but-forconnection.          MR. BAUGHMAN:  Well --          JUSTICE BREYER:  This person being in theroom and a child of 2 would know that if you get into aroom, as a result of your being in that room, you'relikely to find evidence.  So it's both but for and itfits within the problem.  There we are.          That's the same, by the way, as it is withmaking a false oath to a magistrate.  You make a falseoath to a magistrate.  That permits the magistrate toget into the house with -- the policeman gets in therewith a warrant.  It doesn't take the court long tosuppress that.  About a second.  And -- and how -- howis this somehow different?          MR. BAUGHMAN:  Let me try to give a couple ofexamples from different situations to make my pointthat there is a difference.JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, give some cases first. 471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425 He's talking about actual cases.          MR. BAUGHMAN:  I --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, isn't it possiblethat if his law clerk overlooked Segura, he overlookedother cases as well.          JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  We read Segura.  Weread Segura, which happens to be a case --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  There was unquestionably,was there not, a violation of the Fourth Amendment inSegura?          MR. BAUGHMAN:  Your Honor is correct, and Iam confident that when the officers returned with thesearch warrant, with the officers already inside, theydid not knock and announce when they when they returnedwith the search warrant.          JUSTICE BREYER:  He is not -- well --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Isn't that an examplewhere there's a violation of the Fourth Amendment thatis brought up and yet suppression is not the --          MR. BAUGHMAN:  Because of the habeas concernsof comity that this Court has, that's correct.  It isalso not suppressed.          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- important exception.  Theexception which comes from Silverthorne is when thereis an independent chain of events such that it will be481111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 -- not could be, but would be -- in fact, discovered2 anyway, despite the unlawfulness -- Silverthorne --3 Holmes says, of course, you don't keep it out then4 because that's not going to impact deterrence. Now,5 that's Segura. That's Silverthorne. That's case after6 case. Of7 that this8 Then I --9 this, but1011 couple of 121314 make the point. It is -- and my -- my belief is --15 it's common in human experience that things can be16 accomplished either by command or by permission when17 the manner of doing so, the manner in which they end up18 being accomplished is subject to criticism. And let me19 give a couple quick examples.20 If, when she was young, I sent my daughter to21 her room -- and that was rare, but if I sent her to her22 room and she stomped up the stairs and slammed the23 door, she would be in further difficulty not because24 she carried out my command by going to her room, but25 because she stomped up the stairs.491111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-course, I accept that.  And if you can showcase somehow fits within that chain, fine.then I maybe appear I have my mind made up onI'm open to change.MR. BAUGHMAN:  Well, let -- let me try aexamples that --(Laughter.)MR. BAUGHMAN:  -- that I -- that I hope might￼1 If a young athlete is told by his coach,2 catch the ball with two hands and he catches it with3 one, he is admonished not because he caught the ball4 but because he caught it with one hand.5 And if a football player taunts the opposing6 team as he crosses the goal line, he gets a penalty not7 because he crossed the goal line, but because he8 taunted the other team.9 These strictures are not prerequisites to the10 conduct. I do not tell my daughter go to your room but11 only if you don't stomp up the stairs --12 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. That's -- I -- I13 understand that point from your brief and I'm glad that14 you brought it up. But I have never -- I have never15 seen Fourth Amendment matters cut that finely. I have16 never seen the courts say I want to go back to the17 reason why this policeman is unlawfully in the room and18 then try to connect each piece of evidence with that19 reason. Rather, they ask is he unreasonably and20 unconstitutionally in the room.21 So my concern about that, which I'd like you22 to address, is if we took that approach, I think we'd23 be doing it for the first time, and we'd let a kind of24 computer virus loose in the Fourth Amendment. I don't25 know what the implications of that are. I can't tell501111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 you what you're saying is illogical. It's not2 illogical. It's conceivable, but it strikes me as3 risky and unprecedented.4 MR. BAUGHMAN: I think as -- as -- in the5 examples I gave, knock and announce works the same way.6 These are not prerequisites. They're rules of7 conduct. They are principles of behavior. It's not do8 this only if you behave in this manner. It's do this9 and behave in this manner while doing it. And if you10 don't behave in the manner we have prescribed, the11 question is what flows from that misbehavior, not from12 the achievement of the end.13 JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that your14 example it's -- stomping up the stairs is like failing15 to knock and announce.16 MR. BAUGHMAN: That's correct, and -- and the17 police are not illegally on the premises and my18 daughter --19 JUSTICE STEVENS: And so there should be a20 deterrent for the stomping up the stairs, and you've21 got no deterrent for the knock and announce.22 MR. BAUGHMAN: Well, and part of what -- part23 of what I wanted to say also to Justice Breyer and I24 think also works here is it's -- the suggestion seems25 to be that knock -- that a Fourth Amendment violation511111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 -- the question of whether one has occurred and the2 question of whether or not the -- to apply the3 exclusionary rule are one in the same. And this Court4 has never said that. To me that would be a dramatic5 changing of the law of this Court. This Court has6 always said those are separate questions, and I think7 Petitioner's argument conflates the two.8 We first ask whether there has been a9 constitutional violation and then we say -- this Court10 has said the premise for application of the11 exclusionary sanction is whether or not the challenged12 evidence is the product of the illegal government13 activity. So once we establish that there has been a14 constitutional error, the question becomes is the15 challenged evidence the product of it. And just like16 the touchdown is not the product of the taunting, the17 entry into the premises is not the product of the18 failure to knock and announce. It's the product of a19 warrant, which the judge issued commanding the police20 to enter.21 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't -- isn't the problem22 that in -- in fact, it's the product of both? The23 warrant alone does not get the police officer into --24 into the building. It -- it is in fact the entry that25 gets the police officer into the building, the521111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 execution of the warrant. The judge has to do2 something. The police officer has to do something.3 And the question that I think we face when we4 say is the later search the product of the entry, is --5 is what your -- what -- I think a point that -- that6 counsel on the other side was making. It's a pragmatic7 point. Where do we draw the line of causation? And8 his answer is -- and I think the -- the answer of the9 cases that Justice Breyer was -- was referring to -- is10 this. We draw it in a way that will allow us to deter11 illegal police conduct, and if we engage in this12 slicing process of causation that you talk about, there13 will be no deterrent for the violation of the no-knock14 rule. If instead we say, yes, this is enough the15 product that we ought to deter -- that we ought to --16 to respond to it in a way that will deter the no-knock17 and therefore we find causation and we get deterrence.18 What is fallacious about that argument?19 MR. BAUGHMAN: There's nothing fallacious20 about the argument if one accepts that excluding the21 truth in -- in a criminal proceeding is a fair tradeoff22 in that circumstance --23 JUSTICE SOUTER: We do that every single time24 we exclude a piece of evidence in every suppression25 case, don't we?531111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 34 said that5 because it -- it has a high societal cost, it should6 only be done when there is a causal connection, when7 the evidence is the product of the police wrongdoing.89 Baughman. 1011121314 AS 15MR. BAUGHMAN:  I thank the Court.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Salmons.  ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS   ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTMR. BAUGHMAN:  But -- but the Court has --JUSTICE SOUTER:  Don't -- don't we?MR. BAUGHMAN:  Yes, we do.  But the Court hasbecause that's a dramatic thing to do,CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr.MR. SALMONS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 16 and may it please the Court:17 Suppression would not be an appropriate18 remedy in this context for two primary reasons. The19 first is if the knock and announce rule does not20 protect the individual's privacy interest in the21 underlying items seized and, instead, it seeks to limit22 discrete risks related to the execution of warrants23 that property will be damaged, that officers will be24 mistaken for intruders, or that occupants will be25 caught in embarrassing situations. That makes the541111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 knock and2 Amendment3 executing4announce rule similar to other Fourthrequirements related to the manner ofwarrants such as --JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, what -- what do you5 say to Justice Breyer's argument that we haven't6 previously analyzed suppression by tracing or trying to7 trace the causal connection between a particular piece8 of evidence and a particular reason for the rule that9 was broken? What we have said in the past is if the10 rule or the standard is violated and the search is11 therefore unreasonable, the evidence doesn't come in.12 You're proposing a -- a different causal13 analysis. You're proposing a causal analysis that14 requires the connection between a piece of evidence and15 the particular reason for one of these standards in16 every case in which suppression is -- is requested.17 Number one, do you agree that that -- that18 would be a departure, as Justice Breyer suggested? And19 number two, what would be the justification for that?20 MR. SALMONS: It would not be a departure,21 Your Honor. In fact, that's common practice in the22 Fourth Amendment area. This Court, for example, in New23 York v. Harris looked to the purposes of the rule24 against arrest in the home absent a warrant and to25 conclude that it wasn't appropriate to suppress a551111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 statement made at the station even though it assumed2 that there was but-for causation. And this Court in3 Cruz did a similar analysis. It's very common to look4 to the purposes served --5 JUSTICE BREYER: It's common, when you have a6 chain of causal connection, to say it ends somewhere.7 It's common, and in Harris, it ended once they left the8 home and now they're over in the station.9 MR. SALMONS: But --10 JUSTICE BREYER: This isn't over in the11 station. This is in the home. You speak of interests,12 but this doesn't interests.13 What about Boyd? I mean, the most famous14 statement in Fourth Amendment history to all invasions15 on the part of the government and its employees of the16 sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of life. It17 is not the breaking of his doors and the rummaging of18 his drawers that constitutes the essence of the19 offense. But it is the invasion of his indivisible20 right of personal security, personal liberty, and21 private property.22 Now, I thought -- 1886 -- that's what's23 governed these cases for about 100 -- and far more, a24 century and a25 then suddenly1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400half or a quarter.  And -- and the --you say, well, it's this interest in the56 Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 one or the other one. I mean, doesn't that describe2 it?3 MR. SALMONS: No, Your Honor. I mean,4 certainly that's -- that is one of the principles5 underlying the Fourth Amendment, but this Court has6 looked to the types of considerations I'm discussing,7 and I will give you some examples. And we think, in8 fact, the knock and announce rule is very analogous to9 -- for example, to a claim of unnecessary property10 damage or to a claim that the officers brought the11 media along when they shouldn't or that they used12 excessive 1314 here that15 warrant.16force.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  There's no doubt inan invasion of the home was authorized by theRight?MR. SALMONS:  That's correct.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The interest we're1718 talking about is not the sanctity of the drawers. It19 is 10 seconds that the officers should have waited20 additionally, according to the -- to your brother.21 MR. SALMONS: That's correct. The illegality22 --23 JUSTICE BREYER: Correct? I'm sorry. That24 is correct? I -- I thought that this warrant does not25 say you can enter the house without knocking.571111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 I mean, I have a warrant. This warrant lets2 me search the house in daytime. I search it in3 nighttime. Is my search authorized?4 MR. SALMONS: I don't think that would be a5 warrantless search or I don't think that would be a6 violation. That might be --7 JUSTICE BREYER: I have a warrant --8 MR. SALMONS: -- of the manner of execution.9 But again, if I may --1011 example?12 question.1314 Street. I search 1518 5th Street. Was it a warrant --JUSTICE BREYER:  What -- what happens with myI'm curious.  That's not a rhetoricalI have a warrant which says, search 1618 5th15 a warrant 161718 search 1518. I don't have a warrant that allows me to19 come in in the middle of the night when it says day,20 and I don't have a warrant here that allows me to come21 in without knocking. So where's the warrant?back search?MR. SALMONS:  Well --JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't have a warrant to22 MR. SALMONS: I think the question in that23 case, Your Honor, would be about reasonable reliance on24 the warrant and whether it was a reasonable mistake.25 And if it wasn't, then it would be a warrantless581111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 search. 23 attention4 We think5 the typical -- in the typical case, a premature or6 unannounced entry will be a forcible entry. But7 whether the claim is that the officers entered a few8 moments prematurely or that they unnecessarily used a9 battering ram on the door, in either case the -- the10 violation doesn't relate to the privacy interests and11 the items to be seized and shouldn't result in12 suppression. And in addition to that --13 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it does relate to the14 privacy interests, and we've seen the explanation. One15 of the reasons for requiring the knock is that there is16 enough respect for a person's home, a person's privacy17 to say the police should not barge in like an invading18 army.19 MR. SALMONS: Well, that certainly is --20 JUSTICE SOUTER: That is a respect for21 privacy.22 MR. SALMONS: That -- that certainly is true,23 Your Honor, but that -- that is not a protection --24 JUSTICE SOUTER: And that is involved -- and25 that is -- that is the whole point of -- of knock and591111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-And if I may just focus the Court --on the claim of unnecessary property damage.that's quite analogous here in part because￼1 announce, isn't it?2 MR. SALMONS: No, Your Honor. The point of3 knock and announce is a more limited privacy. It's not4 related to the privacy of the items to be seized.5 That's separate. And that's why it makes it like the6 claim of unnecessary --7 JUSTICE SOUTER: We're talking about the8 privacy of individual in his home, and the9 reasonableness of the search depends upon the10 reasonableness of invading the individual's privacy in11 his home. Is that not the general rule?12 MR. SALMONS: No, Your Honor. I think what13 -- what focuses in terms of suppression is whether the14 government has obtained an evidentiary advantage as a15 consequence of the illegality. Here, the illegality16 was the failure to delay a few additional moments17 before entry.18 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then there will never be a19 suppression of -- of evidence specified in a warrant20 when the warrant's no-knock component is violated --21 MR. SALMONS: But --22 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- because we -- we will say23 -- in every single time, following your argument, you24 will -- we will say the -- the violation had nothing to25 do with the authorization to seize the evidence. The601111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 violation simply had to do with the -- with the -- the2 niceties and the risks involved in entering. So if we3 accept your argument, no-knock is -- is a dead duck,4 isn't it?5 MR. SALMONS: I don't think so, Your Honor.6 If I may try to explain. I think as a general matter,7 with regard to physical evidence in the home that's8 within the scope of the search warrant, that you're --9 you're probably right. Most of the time, that evidence10 will come in.11 We think that there are probably at least two12 areas that might lead to suppression in these cases.13 One is the -- the type of statements that the Chief14 Justice mentioned earlier. Another might be what you15 might call proximity evidence, that the officers went16 in prematurely and as a result, they saw a --17 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Salmons, may I ask you18 this -- this question? If you'd been the prosecutor in19 this case and you had -- knew that the evidence would20 be suppressed if there were a constitutional violation,21 would you22 violation2324 there is a reasonable argument that could be --25 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes or no.have conceded that there was a constitutionalin this case?MR. SALMONS:  Well, I don't think -- I think611111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. SALMONS: I'm -- I'm attempting to answer2 that, Your Honor. I think there's a reasonable3 argument that could be made in this case that there4 wasn't a violation. I think it was probably a smart5 strategy.6 JUSTICE STEVENS: So you would not have7 conceded.8 MR. SALMONS: I can't -- I can't second-guess9 the strategy here to concede it.10 JUSTICE STEVENS: But you would not have11 conceded. If you -- if you thought there was a12 reasonable argument, you would not have conceded that13 there was 1415 argued in16 probably the safest --17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me what --18 what happens if there's a violation of the daytime19 warrant provision in -- in a search warrant and the20 search is 2122 Honor. I 23at night?  Do we suppress?MR. SALMONS:  I think generally no, Yourthink -- and I would -- I would --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are there cases -- area violation, would you?MR. SALMONS:  I think I probably would havethe alternative, Your Honor.  I think that's24 there cases on that?25 MR. SALMONS: I -- not in this Court. There621111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 -- there may be in the court of appeals. I think the2 way that the Court would analyze that would be, again,3 along the same lines.4 Now, certainly in jurisdictions that haven't5 adopted the rule that we're articulating here, the6 courts may suppress. But we think under the principles7 we're articulating, that suppression probably would not8 be appropriate there.9 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but apparently you're10 saying we would not suppress because as long as the11 warrant specified the items to be seized and they12 didn't go beyond that, there was no causal connection13 between the fact that they broke in and disturbed14 people in the night, when they were not authorized to,15 and their ultimate obtaining of -- of the evidence.16 Once again, it seems to me if we follow your -- your17 reasoning, then the distinction between the nighttime18 and the daytime warrant is a dead letter.19 MR. SALMONS: Well, you know, we respectfully20 disagree with that. We think that there are two21 separate questions, what the Constitution requires and22 whether suppression is an appropriate remedy.23 JUSTICE SOUTER: The Constitution requires --24 MR. SALMONS: The Court has always treated25 those --631111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE SOUTER: The Constitution requires a2 reasonable search. It is hornbook law that violating3 no-knock, violating nighttime searches when only a4 daytime search is authorized amounts to an unreasonable5 search. You're saying that's utterly irrelevant6 because there's no causal connection between that7 violation and the seizure of the particular items that8 the warrant -- the warrant specified.9 MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, if I may. It's10 also hornbook law now in this Court that you can't11 unnecessarily destroy property in executing the warrant12 or effecting the entry and that you can't bring the13 media along. This Court in both Ramirez and --14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'd to get your -- I'd like15 to get your position. I -- I think Justice Souter is16 correct, that under the theory you're arguing to us17 here, the violation of the daytime warrant rule is not18 grounds for suppressing evidence. So we can have19 nighttime searches with no suppression remedy.20 MR. SALMONS: Well, I -- I think that's21 probably the position that we would take. I think the22 way the Court would analyze that, as it has done in23 these other cases, it would look to two factors. One,24 what are the purposes served by the Fourth Amendment25 rule that's violated and how well those purposes fit641111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 with the remedy of suppression; and two, whether the2 government obtained any evidentiary advantage as a3 result of 45 Salmons. 67 8 91011 you think12 announce rule in this case. Correct?13 MR. MORAN: I do, Your Honor. The warrant14 was never actually made part of the record, but my15 understanding, from the record we have, was that only16 drugs -- there was only knowledge of drugs. The -- the17 warrant authorized a search for guns because Officer18 Good told the magistrate that in his experience guns19 were often associated with drugs. But they had no20 particularized information about any guns on the21 premises. They only had particularized information22 about drugs on the premises.23 The issue here about causation goes back, I24 think, to the common law. And as Justice Breyer25 articulated, when an officer is illegally in the home,651111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-the violation.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr.Mr. Moran, you have 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. MORAN:  Thank you --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You think there --there was a violation of the knock and￼1 that causes his seizure of goods or his arrest of2 people in the home to be illegal. If I can go all the3 way back to 1831, Chief Justice Shaw of the4 Massachusetts Supreme Court said, the rule is well5 established -- this is 1831 it was well established --6 that where an authority given by law is exceeded, the7 party loses the benefit of his justification and the8 law holds him a trespasser ab initio although, to a9 certain extent, he followed the authority given. The10 law will operate to defeat all acts thus done under11 color of lawful authority when exceeded and a fortiori12 will it operate to prospectively to prevent the13 acquisition of any lawful right by the excess and abuse14 of an authority given for useful and beneficial15 purposes.16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you draw a17 distinction between two cases? If they illegally18 entered and they suddenly said we waited 4 seconds, it19 was supposed to be 15. They say, never mind. They go20 back out.21 they come22 23 There's another knock.  They wait 15 andin.  Then it's all right.  Correct?MR. MORAN:  It might be.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  But you're24 saying it's a25 and enter and1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400world of difference if, when they go inthey say, we should have waited 10 more66 Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 seconds, we're the police, we're here to execute a2 search warrant, let's count to 10, then all of a3 sudden, it's invalid from there on. Those are the --4 they're two different cases in your mind?5 MR. MORAN: I think that's -- that's right6 because an -- a reasonable search and seizure, as this7 Court held in Wilson, requires a lawful entry. Eight8 Justices agreed that an -- a lawful entry is the9 indispensable predicate of a reasonable search in Ker10 v. California. These are not disconnected. It is not11 in.12 The -- the prosecution's claim here, the13 Respondent's claim, would eliminate all manner of entry14 arguments from the exclusionary rule. Nighttime15 search, use of excessive force, blowing up the building16 to get in, knocking a wall off the building wouldn't17 matter. They were in -- they're in, they have a18 warrant, everything is fine once they're in. It simply19 wouldn't matter for exclusionary purposes.20 In Harris, I want to stress again in Harris21 that this Court never questioned the fact that the22 evidence found inside the home had to be suppressed,23 and that's all we're asking for here. The evidence in24 the home.25CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 671111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112131415161718192021222324251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400          The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 11:00 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)68 1-Washington, DC 20005
