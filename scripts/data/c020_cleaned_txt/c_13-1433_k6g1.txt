Cain.      Mr. DeSanctis.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL B. DeSANCTISON BEHALF OF PETITIONERMR. DeSANCTIS: Mr. Chief Justice, and mayit please the Court:      The decision of the State court in this casewas to not ­­ to deny Kevan Brumfield a hearing on hisclaim of intellectual disability.  That decision wasbased on an entirely unreasonable determination of thefacts of Brumfield's mental condition.  The courtspecifically ­­ the court expressly stated in its decisionto deny a hearing was, quote, "based on the three bases"that it laid out in its oral ruling at Page 172 of thePet App.  And I'd like to discuss each of those in turn.      The first basis given by the State court wasthat Brumfield scored a 75 on the Wechsler IQ Test.That's not just suggestive of intellectual disability;that's actual evidence of intellectual disability, andthere was no testimony in the record to the contrary.This Court made it clear in Atkins, all of the clinicaltexts on which this Court relied on in Atkins make it1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425clear, and the Louisiana Supreme Court had made it clearin Williams and in Dunn.      The second basis for the State court'sdecision was that the defendant has not, quote,"demonstrated impairment based on this record inadaptive skills."  To demand or even expect that bloodfrom the stone of the pre­Atkins record where neitherintellectual disability nor adaptive skills were evenraised, is completely unreasonable.  ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I ­­ I'm sorry, but isn't ­­ I ­­ I don't ­­ whether I agree with you or not, isn't it your burden to prove that he had some deficits in adaptive ability? You have to make the threshold showing.MR. DeSANCTIS: Yes. There's a threshold showing under Louisiana law.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what did you show that met that prong in any way?MR. DeSANCTIS: Sure. The standard under the Louisiana law is a low one. It's a burden of coming forward with some evidence of objective facts that put the movant's intellectual disability at issue.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:MR. DeSANCTIS:CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:        Well, how is it ­­It's not ­­How is that4￼51 determination under State law pertinent to the question2 here?3 MR. DeSANCTIS: I was ­­ I was merely4 answering Justice Sotomayor's question as to what facts5 were put into evidence before the State court. I was6 setting the stage for the standard.7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I understand8 that. But given ­­ given the facts that were9 presented ­­ and this is what the language of the law10 is, of course. The evidence presented in the State11 court proceeding, how is that pertinent on the12 Federal ­­ Federal question?13 MR. DeSANCTIS: We're ­­14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, I15 don't think it would be a different ­­ your burden, I16 don't think, would be different on the question that's17 presented here if the State law required a higher18 threshold or ­­ or not.19 MR. DeSANCTIS: And we're not requiring ­­20 we're not challenging the State law in this part of21 our ­­22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in your answer to23 Justice Sotomayor, I ­­ I thought you said, well, if the24 State has a very low standard. What difference does25 that make? Are you saying that if the State with its￼  What ­­ what ­­­­ but that's not our      JUSTICE KENNEDY:      MR. DeSANCTIS:argument.  I will ­­      JUSTICE KENNEDY:you're on ­­ on this:  Suppose at the trial, in thesentencing phase, an expert ­­ medical expert testified,in my view, this defendant does not have an intellectualdisability as we define that in medical terms.Would you be here?MR.

Is that your point?MR. DeSANCTIS: No. There ­­ there could be in that case, but that's not our ­­      JUSTICE KENNEDY:      MR. DeSANCTIS:argument.      JUSTICE KENNEDY:difference does it make ­­ and I think this was what theChief Justice was concerned with as well.  What differencedoes it make that Louisiana has a low bar or a high bar?MR. DeSANCTIS: It ­­ it may not make a difference, Your Honor. And ­­ and it's not a ­­7￼1 course.2 MR. DeSANCTIS: It's a hypothetical;3 obviously, that wasn't this case. There was no4 testimony at the State trial or sentencing about5 intellectual disability. But in that case, we probably6 still would be here because that's what happened in7 Williams. In the ­­ in Williams 1, the defense's own8 expert at trial, prior to Atkins, had testified that the9 defendant was not intellectually disabled, and yet the10 Louisiana Supreme Court sent it back for an Atkins11 hearing because Atkins had entirely changed the legal12 landscape. Now here ­­13 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the first question ­­14 the first question presented in your petition is15 "Whether a State court that considers the evidence16 presented at a petitioner's penalty phase proceeding as17 determinative of the petitioner's claim of intellectual18 disability under Atkins... has based its decision on an19 unreasonable determination of the facts."20 So suppose that at the penalty phase21 proceeding there is evidence of 5 IQ tests, all above22 140. Would it be wrong to say that that's23 determinative?24 MR. DeSANCTIS: Again, obviously not our25 case, but in that situation, we address that in our blue      JUSTICE GINSBURG:      MR. DeSANCTIS:      JUSTICE GINSBURG:involved in a wholly differentthe books?  Because when you were before the State courtat the sentencing hearing, you weren't talking aboutintellectual disability.MR. DeSANCTIS: That's ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG: You were talking about some mitigating factors. So the State court never had before it an Atkins claim. An Atkins claim is raised for the first time on post­conviction review.MR. DeSANCTIS: That ­­ that's exactly right. It's ­­ it's similar to the reasoning that this   Is ­­ is your point ­­So ­­   Is your point that we areinquiry once Atkins is on8￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425brief.  For the purpose of making clear that we are notasking for a bright­line rule, in a situation wherethere is uncontested ­­ uncontested evidence in thepre­Atkins record that disqualifies the individual fromintellectual ability, if that were the case ­­JUSTICE ALITO: So the answer to the first question is no, it is not necessarily unconstitutional to regard the penalty phase evidence as determinative.MR. DeSANCTIS: It is in this case on this record, and Section (d)(2) is by its very nature a factual inquiry.91 Court adopted in Bobby v. Bies. And in precisely this2 setting, the Louisiana Supreme Court held ­­ or it3 explained that prior to Atkins, as Your Honor just4 explained, a defendant only had to show diminished5 capacity as a mitigating factor and wasn't called upon6 to marshal demonstrations of intellectual disability or7 impairment in adaptive skills.8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you not think it would9 have been ineffective assistance of counsel pre­Atkins10 for a lawyer who had a client who was severely mentally11 disabled not to bring that fact forward in the ­­ in the12 sentencing hearing for consideration by the jury?13 MR. DeSANCTIS: Your Honor ­­14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Even ­­ even though it15 wasn't, you know, a mandatory Federal basis for ­­ for16 exempting him from the death penalty, surely you would17 want the jury to consider that kind of evidence,18 wouldn't you?19 MR. DeSANCTIS: Your Honor, this Court in20 Henry and again in Atkins recognized that putting on a21 defense of, quote­unquote, "mental retardation," as the22 term was used at that time, is a double­edged sword.23 It's a much higher burden typically than the lower24 burden of putting on mitigating evidence of one's mental25 condition.￼      JUSTICE SCALIA:      MR. DeSANCTIS:judge. First ­­      JUSTICE SCALIA:rid of that argument that Atkins had not been decided.That ­­ that had nothing to do with the case, right?MR. DeSANCTIS: Okay. Turning to the evidence in this case, first, it was evidence before the State court judge that Mr. Brumfield had a fourth grade reading level in terms of mere word recognition, not even comprehension. That's, again, actual evidence All right.­­ before the State courtFine.   So let's get10￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      And ­­ which brings me to answer Justice ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't find that persuasive. It seems to me you ­­ you have the burden to show that there was some basis for the State Supreme Court coming out the other way, and that basis should have been in the record, according to the Federal statute, and your only defense is, well, we didn't put anything in the record because Atkins had not yet been decided.MR. DeSANCTIS: No, Your Honor. And that goes to Justice Sotomayor's question as well. There was overwhelming evidence of impairment of ­­ in adaptive skills and intellectual disability in the State court record ­­11￼1 of impairment in adaptive skills.2 It was in the record before the State court3 that Mr. Brumfield, quote, "has a basic deficit4 somewhere in his brain." It was in the record in the5 State court that he had a very low birth weight that put6 him at risk of neurological trauma, and it was in the7 record from Dr. Bolter that Mr. Brumfield was in trouble8 many, many, many years ago.9 The second expert before the State court,10 this is in the State court record, was Dr. Guin. She11 was a social worker. She didn't perform any tests of12 her own, but she found that Mr. Brumfield was sent to,13 quote, "special education from the third grade; that he14 had been placed in and out of mental hospitals because15 no one knew what to do with him throughout his childhood16 and youth; that his main problem was that he cannot17 process information the way normal people do." And18 that's ­­ that ­­ that is a key indicator of19 intellectual disability that this Court recognized twice20 in Atkins.21 She testified that Brumfield ­­ before the22 State court, she testified that Brumfield needed someone23 to, quote, "help him function." That he did poorly even24 at recess as a child because he couldn't function with a25 lot of chaos around him. That age ­­ at age 11, one of12￼1 the mental institutions in which he had been placed,2 quote, "questioned his intellectual functions and noted3 his slowness in motor development." And that the4 nurses, literally from his birth, recognized that there5 was something wrong with him and that he was slower than6 normal babies.7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Am I wrong in my8 understanding that the record included an expert report9 stating that Brumfield possessed, quote, "a normal10 capacity to learn and acquire information" and that he11 had, quote, "adequate problem and" ­­ "and reasoning12 skill" ­­ "problem­solving and reasoning skills." Is ­­13 is ­­ is that correct?14 MR. DeSANCTIS: Your Honor, if ­­ that's ­­15 I believe that's from the report of Dr. Jordan.16 Dr. Jordan did not testify in the State court17 proceeding. It's ­­18 JUSTICE SCALIA: It ­­ it was not in the19 record?20 MR. DeSANCTIS: It's actually an issue of21 debate whether Dr. Jordan's report was in the record.22 At the Federal hearing, the State conceded that it was23 not. And the ­­ and the judge doesn't ­­ the State24 court judge doesn't say he read it, although it was25 discussed by some of the experts, though not the ­­ the1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425portion you just read.      JUSTICE SCALIA:                             Well, if it was in it, it'spretty categorical, you know.  I would think that'senough for the State court to hang its hat on.  I don'tthink we ­­ we can possibly find that it wasunreasonable evidentiary finding, if ­­ if that wasindeed in the record.MR. DeSANCTIS: Your Honor, it ­­ it is, because, again, the burden ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did ­­ did the State put it in the record?MR. DeSANCTIS: No, there's no evidence, Your Honor, that the State put it in the record. They have claimed at various points in the proceeding ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you didn't, but another ­­ another expert referred to it.MR. DeSANCTIS: That's correct. Bolter ­­ Dr. Bolter referenced Dr. Jordan's report regarding his IQ testing, that it was merely a screening test and he was dismissive of it.JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the State wasn't ­­ didn't put it in evidence, so it wasn't ­­MR. DeSANCTIS: And they didn't ­­ and they did not ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: And ­­ and are we talking13￼correct.      Second, it ­­ it ­­ it is very relevant thatthe State court ignored all of the objective facts afterthe defendant had been required only to come on withsome evidence.  There's no indication in the Statecourt's decision, which he explains precisely was basedon the three factors that he just laid out.JUSTICE GINSBURG:MR. DeSANCTIS:JUSTICE GINSBURG:   Did you ask ­­The State court did not ­­                               Did you ask the Statecourt for funds as a matter of Federal right?  The otherside says, did you ask for funds for State habeas onlyunder State law and not under Federal law; is that true?MR. DeSANCTIS: We requested funds repeatedly in ­­ in every petition before the court. And in doing so, at least six times we cited the Louisiana court of Deboue v. Whitley. That case discusses Ake and is based exclusively on Ake and Federal law. And this Court has made clear that if ­­14￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425about the trial record now?      MR.

So, yes.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. DeSanctis, I ­­ I will perhaps talk about what is a little confusing; if not confusing, disconcerting in this case. There seems to be an inequity that one could perceive that says you can use the penalty phase record, but the other side can't to challenge your conclusions. Because that's basically what you're saying. And so and that was, I think, Justice Alito's point, which is you concede on some ­­ in some circumstances the State might.What makes your case different? Now, I do know that this ­­ in this case you're saying you provided some ­­ a sufficient amount of some evidence.MR. DeSANCTIS: Correct.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And the State was unreasonable by not giving you a hearing to determine the merits of your claim.MR. DeSANCTIS: Correct.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. We don't even get to the issue of whether you were entitled to funds at that hearing, but I don't even think under Louisiana you wouldn't be, once you've made the threshold showing.MR. DeSANCTIS: It's a distinct issue that1 our question ­­2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:3 MR. DESANCTIS:4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:5 question, because it's ­­ it's a bit of a takeoff from6 Justice Alito's question, which is what is ­­ why in7 your case can't the State rely on the evidence in the8 penalty phase, if that's what you're relying on to make9 your sum showing?10 MR. DeSANCTIS: There really is no inequity11 there, Your Honor. And I'm glad you asked. The12 Louisiana Supreme Court explained it in Dunn, which13 predated the State court's decision in this case by14 almost a year. The court explained that although the15 defendant was not called upon to offer proof of16 intellectual disability on ­­ at the trial prior to17 Atkins, the defendant did offer evidence of intellectual18 disability through that record. It was far less than19 the evidence that I just articulated.20 From there, the court explained that it was21 improper for the State court to then weigh any contrary22 evidence without the guidance of experts and essentially23 make a diagnosis itself as to where ­­ whether the facts24 in the record are consistent or inconsistent with25 intellectual disability.    Right.­­ one does not depend on.All right.  So answer my16￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA:2 it itself, even when there are experts. I mean, I don't3 understand that.4 MR. DeSANCTIS: Once the defendant comes5 forward with ­­ with some evidence, which Mr. Brumfield6 did here overwhelmingly, if there's contrary evidence in7 the record, that's what the hearing is for. And that's8 all we were asking. We weren't asking for ­­9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Put this ­­ put this in10 perspective for a moment. Suppose we're in the district11 court on a petition for habeas.12 MR. DeSANCTIS: Federal district court.13 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Federal ­­ United States14 district court, and the question is: Is the defendant15 entitled to a hearing? This petitioner entitled to a16 hearing?17 what is the standard that the district18 court must find ­­ met before the district court has a19 hearing on the facts? Before the district court can20 have its experts. Does he have to find that the State21 collateral decision was clearly erroneous? Or that22 there was a prima facie evidence of ­­ of disability23 that the State collateral court ignored? What's the24 district court have to do before it decides it's going25 to have a hearing and call its own experts?The court always has to do17￼18￼1 MR. DeSANCTIS: So ­­2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What standard must it meet3 and did it meet that standard here?4 MR. DeSANCTIS: The answer to the final part5 of your question is yes. I would break it down this6 way: The ­­ the question of whether an individual is7 intellectually disabled this Court left to the States8 under Atkins. So the State standard is what applies for9 the showing that a defendant must make in order to prove10 his intellectual disability at the hearing.11 If that occurs pre­Atkins as it did in this12 case and we get to Federal habeas, under 2254(d)(2), the13 Federal habeas judge looks at whether the factual14 determinations in this case of the defendant's mental15 condition were unreasonable. And here they were. The16 judge articulated three grounds, one of which was17 evidence of intellectual disability, one of which was18 irrelevant to the question of intellectual disability,19 and ignored a plethora of evidence in the record putting20 Mr. Brumfield's intellectual disability ­­21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So are you saying ­­2223 JUSTICE KENNEDY: ­­ that the district24 court, the United States district court decided to have25 a hearing because it found that the State court's19 1 collateral review determination was, fill in the blank,￼2 clearly erroneous?3 MR. DeSANCTIS:4 Unreasonable.5 JUSTICE KENNEDY:6 MR. DeSANCTIS:7 and (d)(2) ­­8 JUSTICE KENNEDY:9 were some open questions, or because no one could read10 the record to say that there was evidence that he had no11 disability?12 MR. DeSANCTIS: Because the ­­ the State13 court judge in this case expressly indicated what his14 decision was based on. It was based on three bases, all15 of which are entirely unreasonable and no one could ­­16 no one could say that they support a claim that the17 defendant is not intellectually ­­18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Also, we've heard ­­19 heard a lot of discussion on the evidence at issue in20 this particular case. What ­­ what is the broader21 significance of that discussion here? I'm concerned22 your answer to Justice Alito was that the answer to23 your ­­ your first question was no, it's not necessarily24 the case that it's unreasonable determination in a25 situation where the State considers the evidence blahWas unreasonable.  That's the AEDPA standard.That's the AEDPA standardUnreasonable because there20￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425blah. But you're saying now that in this case it was? MR. DeSANCTIS: Correct.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what is thebroader significance of the question you want us todecide?  Since you've conceded that the question ­­ theanswer to the first question presented is no.MR. DeSANCTIS: No. I'm sorry, I certainly did not mean to concede that the answer to the first question presented is no. My answer to Justice Alito's hypothetical was if there is uncontested evidence in the record ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, right. But I mean ­­MR. DeSANCTIS: ­­ disqualifying intellectual disability, then ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. But you ­­ your question is: If it's determinative, is it unreasonable? And Justice Alito ­­MR.

So as a general rule, the question is ­­ the answer to the question is no. And in terms of what we're going to decide, I just need to know whether it is simply whether the facts in your      MR.

DeSANCTIS: Not ­­ that came from10 Dr. Jordan who did not testify. And his report actually11 doesn't say what he scored there. And the evidence at12 trial that came out about it was Dr. Bolter saying what13 Dr, Jordan did was merely a screening test, which is not14 reliable anyway. So there is no other number in the15 record.16 The second prong articulated by the State17 court was that Mr. Brumfield had not demonstrated18 impairment in adaptive skills. This Court, the19 Louisiana Supreme Court have all indicated that because20 Atkins changed the playing field, it is unjust and21 unreasonable to look to a pre­Atkins record for that22 determination. However, the record from that ­­ from23 that pre­Atkins trial and sentencing was replete with24 evidence which the ­­ which the State court never25 mentions in his decision.￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA:2 MR. DeSANCTIS:3 JUSTICE SCALIA:4 that the question you sought to bring before us; namely,5 that the State court couldn't use it at all, period. I6 mean, question one that you ­­ you presented in your7 petition is as follows: "Whether a State court that8 considers the evidence presented at a Petitioner's9 penalty phase proceeding as determinative of the10 Petitioner's claim of intellectual disability under11 Atkins has based its decision on an unreasonable12 determination of the facts." Whether a State court, any13 State court, not this particular State court, but14 whether any State court that makes its decision based15 upon a pre­Atkins penalty phase hearing is16 automatically ­­ has automatically made an unreasonable17 determination of the facts. Wasn't that the question18 you presented?19 MR. DeSANCTIS: We did not intend that20 the ­­ the question presented to be ­­ to sound more21 like a legal question that would become a matter of law.22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, fine. That's what it23 sounds like.24 JUSTICE BREYER: I thought your case25 included the following: Atkins says you cannot sentence I thought the former ­­Third ­­I thought the former was24￼251 to death and execute an intellectually disabled person.2 So Mr. Smith, whose case is not final, says to the3 judge, Judge, I would like to produce evidence I am4 intellectually disabled. The State says, no, you can't.5 That would clearly violate Atkins. Wouldn't it?6 MR. DeSANCTIS: Correct.7 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, suppose it says, yes,8 you can ­­ now, we don't have an Atkins. A standard9 which says when you do and when you don't have to state,10 let this person present evidence. We don't say it. But11 the State has found one. The State of Louisiana has a12 standard, and I take it if that's a good enough13 standard, that's what we should follow.14 And that standard from State v. Williams15 says, we will give you a hearing, if you, Mr. Smith,16 provide objective factors that will put at issue ­­ put17 at issue, the fact of mental retardation. If you will18 come forward with some evidence to put your mental19 condition at issue. And so I guess, unless we think20 Louisiana can't use that standard, that that standard is21 good enough for Federal purposes. And, therefore, the22 issue is did your client and you put forward some23 evidence to put your mental condition at issue.24 And as long as you came forward with some25 evidence, then unless we're prepared to write some new￼14 JUSTICE SCALIA:15 clearly.16 JUSTICE BREYER:17 important that that be your argument­­18 MR.

Ms. Burns.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF PREMILA BURNS       ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTMS. BURNS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      I would like to just begin by recapping thatwhat is at issue here is whether the ultimate factualconclusion that was made by the State habeas court, wasThere's no broader legalNot on (d)(1).

But that's the10 standard. That's what I think ­­ the quest ­­ of course11 you can't know whether it's unreasonable or not12 unreasonable unless you know what standard you're trying13 to meet. And my impression is ­­ and that's why I went14 on at length, and you heard what I said ­­ and the ­­15 and it's really to you; I want to be sure he adopts16 it ­­ the standards seem to be the standard you are17 entitled to a hearing, says Louisiana, indeed a new one,18 if you meet the standard of State v. Williams.19 MS. BURNS: If ­­20 JUSTICE BREYER: And that seemed to me good21 enough to be a Federal standard in the absence of any22 other.23 Now, am I right about that or wrong?24 MS. BURNS: The ­­ the court ­­ the cases25 have held that for funding or for ­­30￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: Forget funding for the2 moment.3 MS. BURNS: There must be sufficient factors4 set forth, objective factors, not mere conclusive.5 JUSTICE BREYER: No. I agree with that. I6 just want to know factors to show what. And am I right7 in saying in the absence in Atkins of any standard about8 when you have to have a hearing, that the State standard9 is good enough. What he wants is a hearing. He doesn't10 want us ­­ he'd like it ­­ but he doesn't want ­­ we11 don't have to say whether this person is intellectually12 disabled or not. He wants a hearing. And there is13 nothing in Atkins that says what the standard is to give14 him a hearing. Therefore, I looked at the State15 standard from Williams and thought that's good enough to16 serve as a Federal standard. Now, am I right or wrong?17 MS. BURNS: The standard is, under deference18 to the State, and to the State of Louisiana and to our19 mental retardation intellectual disability statute, that20 there are three prongs ­­21 JUSTICE BREYER: No. No. You're not22 answering my question. Of course we defer to the State,23 and we defer to the State when it makes what judgment?24 The judgment you, Mr. Defendant, are not entitled to a25 hearing. So what's the standard under which they decide2 MS. BURNS:3 JUSTICE BREYER:4 Williams. Am I right,5 MS. BURNS:6 meet an adaptive prong7 forward of this prong.8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. Are we going9 around in a circle, a little bit of a circle? It seems10 to me that if what happened here was the right thing,11 the Federal court went back and said, did the State12 properly preclude this Petitioner from putting on or13 discovering evidence? Did it improperly fail to hold a14 hearing? And the court there said, by the ­­ the15 courts ­­ by any standard, there was some16 evidence ­­ certainly by the State standard, but even by17 a constitutional standard, there was some evidence of18 incompetency. He was entitled to a hearing. They19 didn't give it to him, so now I will give him the20 hearing, because this is Federal habeas. And, in fact,21 we have said if a State improperly precludes you from22 developing a claim, then there is no deference owed to23 the State.24 So what we're really looking at was, was the25 Federal hearing properly granted? You did not argueThe standard ­­     And I thought it's State v.or am I wrong? The ­­ the ­­ the failure to­­ you have to put some evidence31￼1 whether he's entitled to a hearing or not?1 that on the basis of the evidence produced at the2 Federal hearing, that this man was not intellectually3 disabled. You have put all your eggs in the basket of,4 on the record that didn't permit a hearing, he didn't5 make out a threshold finding. That's been your only6 defense so far.7 MS. BURNS: But the two issues that were8 presented to the Fifth Circuit were both that there9 should have been ­­ there should never have been a10 hearing in this case, which is still our position, for11 failure to give deference under AEDPA; and secondly ­­12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So if we disagree with13 that ­­ if we disagree with that, what are you left14 with?15 MS. BURNS: Well, then it ­­ it needs to16 be ­­ if you find that there should have been a hearing,17 then you need to remand it back18 Fifth Circuit for review of the19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:20 the conclusion from the facts developed there?21 MS. BURNS: Absolutely. And, of course, our22 position to the Fifth Circuit was you should look at23 both of these issues. You look at AEDPA, and if you24 should find that there should have been a Federal25 hearing, then at that point we ask you to look to theto the Fifth ­­ thefacts.Why?  Ah, to ­­ to view32￼331 fact that he did not make a preponderance case, which2 they made a preliminary finding of in footnote 8.3 JUSTICE BREYER: But that isn't ­­ that4 isn't ­­ at this moment, I'll put it once more, and see5 if I get an absolute, definite answer from you, and I'm6 overstating, but if I had to decide at this moment7 whether there is enough evidence for you to win on the8 point is he intellectually disabled, I would say you9 win. If I decide ­­ have to decide whether or not he10 presented enough evidence to get a hearing, I would say11 you lose.12 Now, that's why it's important to me to13 know. Are we trying to decide here whether there was14 enough evidence, such that the State under Federal law15 was unreasonable in not granting him a hearing, there I16 look at the standards of Williams, and I think you lose.17 If we're deciding something else, like whether he's18 intellectually disabled, and I'm repeating myself, I19 think you win.20 That's why I want your answer to the21 question of which are we deciding, or both.22 MS. BURNS: The point is that no evidence,23 not one adaptive deficit was ever presented at State24 habeas.25 JUSTICE KAGAN: But Ms. Burns ­­ Ms. Burns,￼341 I think what Justice Breyer is driving at is just this,2 and reasonable people might disagree on the answer to3 this, but I think, you know, the determination that the4 State court was making at that moment was whether to5 have a hearing. And under Louisiana law, I don't think6 you disagree with this, I don't think anybody could7 disagree with this, under Louisiana law, you have a8 hearing when the defendant has come forward, and it's ­­9 the burden is on the defendant ­­ but when the defendant10 has come forward with some evident ­­ some evidence that11 raises a reasonable doubt as to his mental capacity.12 That's the standard that's in Williams, it's repeated13 again in Dunn. You don't agree ­­ disagree with that.14 MS. BURNS: I do not, Your Honor.15 JUSTICE KAGAN: And ­­ and so what Justice16 Breyer is suggesting is that when we ­­ when we realize17 that that's the determination that the State court is18 making, whether the defendant has come forward with some19 evidence putting his mental capacity at issue, it looks20 awfully like an unreasonable determination of facts to21 say that this record does not meet that standard.22 That's all that the case is about, isn't it?23 MS. BURNS: I disagree. I disagree. This24 is almost a reverse Hall situation in the ­­ in the25 States looking at. Because if you look at Hall, Hall￼351 was trying to rest totally on an IQ. Here he's trying2 to do the same thing to say, oh, there's a 75, possibly3 we concede a higher IQ than that. But Hall ­­ in Hall,4 there was a preclusion of the adaptive, as this Court5 has said is ­­ is integral to the showing, not one6 adaptive deficit ­­7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I think what ­­8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the ­­ but9 adaptive ­­ adaptive was not relevant to the ­­ the10 determination at the sentencing hearing, because there11 was no Atkins. They were trying to show mental deficit,12 but they adapted something when we're making an Atkins13 determination. And there was ­­ that was never before14 the sentencing court. It's only after Atkins is decided15 that adaptive becomes ­­ becomes relevant.16 But I didn't ­­ I wanted to ask you17 something in this record that's disturbing, and maybe18 you can explain it. There is a brief ­­ you know it;19 it's by Justice Calogero ­­ that says there were 1820 people who were sentenced to death and ­­ and before21 Atkins. Then Atkins is decided. Every one except for22 this Petitioner got a hearing in the State court; is23 that true?24 MS. BURNS: That is not true. And if Your25 Honor will indulge me, I can go case by case. It will￼36￼1 eat into my time, but I'll be glad to do that. In2 Dunn ­­3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Please don't.4 (Laughter.)5 MS. BURNS: In many of those cases, there6 was either a pretrial showing of mental retardation,7 something in the record that was serious, a diagnosis8 which was never present in this case. There was no9 mention of the word "intellectual disability" in Kevan10 Brumfield's case until June 16th of 2003, after Atkins11 was decided ­­ and that is the first time ­­ after12 Atkins was decided that he made this claim that says I13 have a 75 IQ, I have adaptive deficits without14 specifying one of them.15 JUSTICE KAGAN: But ­­16 MS. BURNS: And they were onset prior to 18.17 He did not meet his standard under Atkins.18 JUSTICE KAGAN: But Ms. Dunn, if we could go19 back, just on this point: You said he didn't meet the20 standard. And the standard is, as Justice Breyer21 suggested and you agreed, the one that comes from Dunn.22 And what I understand Mr. Brumfield to be saying is,23 look, all I need is some evidence. The evidence that24 was in the trial record, even though it was pre­Atkins,25 the evidence was ­­ that was in the trial record was, I37￼1 had a very low IQ, 75. In addition, there was some2 evidence of ­­ of adaptive deficits, even ­­ even though3 they weren't trying to prove this point, evidence came4 in that he didn't read very well, he didn't write very5 well, he had problems processing information. So that6 there was all that evidence.7 And then you sort of top ­­ when you look at8 the ­­ what the court said, I mean, basically, each one9 of the three things that the court said was just wrong.10 You know, the 75 is evidence of disability, there was11 evidence of adaptive functioning, and this idea that the12 court had that evidence relating to an antisocial13 personality somehow precluded the finding of mental14 disability is wrong as well.15 So I guess the question that Justice16 Breyer's question really leads to is like: What's not17 some evidence here? And didn't the court just18 misunderstand what ­­ what record it was looking at and19 what it was doing?20 MS. BURNS: I ­­ I would disagree,21 respectfully, and I would also ask this Court to22 remember that the court here looked at the entire record23 and that ­­24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's the point. It25 seems to me ­­14 MS. BURNS:15 entirety of the record.16 JUSTICE SCALIA:17 was.18 MS. BURNS:19 JUSTICE KAGAN:20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:21 MS.

Does the State saying that there has to be4 some evidence, does that mean if there is one item of5 evidence ­­ even though it's outweighed by everything6 else, it's contradicted by other ­­ by other7 witnesses ­­ if there's one little peppercorn of8 evidence, you have to go on to a hearing? Is that what9 the State rule means? Or does it mean when you consider10 the entirety, including the rebuttal evidence ­­ ­ ­­11 MS. BURNS: It is ­­12 JUSTICE SCALIA: ­­ is there reasonably some13 evidence of his mental disability?1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:2 a minute.3 MS. BURNS:4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:5 there is a legal question here. And the legal question6 is: Can a State make the final determination of ­­ of7 mental incapacity, or lack thereof, based on a trial8 record that did not address the issue? That was the9 question presented. And you're saying it can, and what10 your adversary is saying, if there is some evidence of11 mental incapacity, then I'm entitled to a separate12 hearing that addresses that question alone; I can put in13 additional evidence and contradict whatever happened at14 the penalty stage. That's what his point is. Why is he15 wrong?16 MS. BURNS: He's wrong because that would17 require ­­ if mental retardation was not raised, which18 it could have been in this case as a mitigator, there's19 any other relevant mitigating circumstances if you ­­20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You don't disagree that21 in Williams and Dunn, your own supreme court said, it's22 a double­edged sword, and we don't expect counsel to23 raise an issue that doesn't get them off.24 MS. BURNS: Justice Sotomayor, if I may25 disagree with that: The rationale of this Court inBut wait a minute.  Wait­­ planning in this prong.        But wait a minute.  Then39￼40 1 Atkins is that we are an evolving, decent society that￼2 will not have a consensus to3 people.4 JUSTICE BREYER: We're all on the same page.5 MS. BURNS: That falls in the face ­­ that6 falls in the face of saying that juries, then, are7 inclined to execute them if they show some evidence of8 mental retardation.9 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I think we're all10 on the same page here, and I think we've made some11 progress in this, because I agree with you, and I agree12 with Justice Scalia that what we have to do –and there13 isn’t to ­ is to look at the whole record and see, keeping14 in mind the fact that it was a pre­Atkins record, and they15 didn't know about Atkins, but looking at the whole record,16 is the Louisiana court clearly wrong? Is it unreasonable17 in saying there wasn't enough evidence, even though there18 has to be some, which is up to them pretty much how they19 say the some, but they're unreasonable in saying that20 there wasn't some evidence justifying a hearing. And21 the only way to do that is for us to read it. Is ­­ is22 that right?23 MS. BURNS:24 JUSTICE BREYER:25 MS.

And ­­8 and I doubt that this Court is going to read the whole9 record in all of these Atkins cases in the future. I10 mean, what ­­ what you're saying is ­­ is ­­ you don't11 think it's ­­ it's fantastical?12 MS. BURNS: I do, Your Honor.

BURNS:JUSTICE KENNEDY:MS. BURNS:Yes.

He said, if I had money I would investigate and I would come up with a lot more than I did at the sentencing hearing, but the State won't give me any money.MS. BURNS: Justice Ginsburg, if I may address this issue, because unlike the majority of cases that this Court has analyzed in an AEDPA deference, although under a Strickland umbrella normally in terms of mitigation and ineffectiveness of counsel, by filing separate claims for funding, this man was awarded at ­­ at the time of this trial, approximately $10,000 in42￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425different case.

BURNS: He made a vague ­­ in his very15 first habeas petition, and this went on for a period of16 44 months. The first petition says, I need about 1017 different types of experts and probably will need money.18 Then he filed four motions to continue, saying, I am19 still reviewing this record and I do not know what20 experts I will be needing.21 Then when he came in on the hearing, there22 was never ­­ although there was a claim at the very,23 very end; claim 105, which was the last claim ­­ he24 never ­­ he never filed a separate Ake motion as had25 been done in everything pre­trial in this case.

If he wasn't going to produce anything14 more at the hearing, then what was already in the15 record, there would be no point in granting a hearing.16 And so if the only purpose of the hearing was to allow17 him to put in additional evidence with funding, case18 comes down to the question whether it was19 unconstitutional ­­ whether under AEDPA it was clearly20 established that it was unconstitutional for the State21 court to deny funding for this purpose.￼There was neverhe did not makehe did not make­­ my ­­ and mythe thresholdany kind of46￼1 funding.

And he can go out and seek6 pro bono support. He could try to go back to the same7 experts that he had used at the sentencing.8 So even without funding, the opportunity for9 a hearing might have been worth something to him. And10 what's clear, isn't it, this is the ­­ you said11 that there is questions as to whether he asked for12 funding or didn't ask for funding. What's clear is that13 he asked for a hearing, isn't that right?14 MS. BURNS: He did ask for a hearing. But15 to get a hearing, again, you have to meet a threshold.16 And I might add to the Court that it would have been, as17 in many other cases, a relatively simple matter to go18 back, to have approached Dr. Bolter, Dr. Jordan, Dr.19 Guin and just said, look, a case named Atkins has come20 out in 2002. You have previously evaluated this21 defendant; would it now make any difference to you, in22 view of the holding in that case, would you, just say in23 a letter ­­24 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, often in ­­ often, in25 order to obtain, a hearing a party whom is moving for a471 hearing has to make a proffer of what will be shown at2 the hearing. It makes no sense to say we're going to3 have a hearing and I want a hearing and I have the4 burden of proving at the hearing that I'm entitled to5 something, but I don't have any evidence to prove the ­­6 the point that I need to prove.7 MS. BURNS: And my ­­8 JUSTICE ALITO: So it does seem to come down￼9 to funding, unless there is10 record, and maybe you or your counsel can point to11 something in the record that shows that he wanted a12 hearing, even if he wasn't going to have funding.13 MS. BURNS: He proceeded with the hearing14 that day with ­­ without making any type of objection15 and proceeded to the merits. He ­­ he, first of all,16 did not file any separate Ake claim.

Richter, it is the ultimate8 conclusion, the factual conclusion reached by the court,9 not necessarily the language that he used. It does not10 require that each and every ground that he relied on be11 articulated.12 And the court stated in his rulings that, I13 have examined this record. It says, I've looked at the14 application, the response, the record, which in this15 case, just to educate the Court as to Louisiana habeas16 procedure, if a habeas judge is reviewing, he would get17 the 16 initial volumes of the case. There were four18 additional supplemental volumes. That includes19 everything from indictment to pretrial discovery, any20 answers, documents that were filed in answer to that.21 It includes the testimony during any suppression or22 funding hearings.

BURNS: Thank you, Your Honor. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MR. DeSANCTISON BEHALF OF PETITIONERMR. DeSANCTIS: Thank you, Mr. ChiefJustice.      First, the ­­ Dr. Jordan's report was not inthe record, and that is made clear at the PetitionAppendix 39a, note 13, where the court noted that55￼1 counsel recognized that it was not in the record.2 Second, counsel articulated that there were3 scores ­­ IQ scores in the ­­ in the 80s and 90s.4 That's not correct. Federal ­­ volume I of the Federal5 hearing at page 57 shows that there were two other6 tests: One a 75, and one a 54.7 Finally, I want to emphasize that this Court8 recently recognized that it's unconstitutional to create9 an unacceptable risk that persons with intellectual10 disability will be executed. The State court's11 determination of the facts in this case created12 precisely that risk. And now that we're here, it's not13 just risk; it's certainty. The only court to provide14 Mr. Brumfield with a hearing found that he is15 intellectually disabled, and unless this Court reverses16 the Fifth Circuit's erroneous ruling, an intellectually17 disabled person will be executed.18 Thank you.19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.20 The case is submitted.21 (Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in the22 above­entitled matter was
