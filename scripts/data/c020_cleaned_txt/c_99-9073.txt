The United States.          Mr. Strang.              ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEAN A. STRANG                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. STRANG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          Paula Buford's case presents the very type ofmixed question well-suited to de novo review, and that'sparticularly true here because of the overriding, indeedthe pervasive importance of uniformity in the currentFederal sentencing scheme.          Paula Buford serves a prison sentence roughlytwice as long as it would have been because of the way inwhich the district court interpreted and appliedguidelines and commentary on relatedness andconsolidation.  In her view, the Court of Appeals of theSeventh Circuit erred by declining to give independentreview to the question of consolidation incorporated intothe meaning of relatedness, specifically declined toreview de novo whether her prior convictions, her priorcases in fact had been consolidated.          I think there are several specific reasons that                             3 1    make this an appropriate case, an appropriate mixed 2    question application of the guidelines -- 3              QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Strang, isn't there one, 4    perhaps, factor that cuts against your argument the fact 5    that district courts probably see this kind of case -- 6    kind of an argument in connection with sentencing, a 7    typical district judge, much more often than a typical 8    judge of a court of appeals? 9              MR. STRANG:  It is true, Your -- Mr. Chief10    Justice that but a fraction of sentences ever are appealed11    on any ground, but there is no reason to assume that the12    district judge would be reviewing the act of a State court13    in his own district or her own district or of any court14    familiar to that district judge.  The fact that the prior15    convictions here arose in Milwaukee County, the seat of16    the Eastern District of Wisconsin, I think is fairly17    described an accident.18              QUESTION:  That's where the Federal judge sits,19 is it not?20              MR. STRANG:  Yes.21              QUESTION:  In Milwaukee County?22              MR. STRANG:  Yes, and that's an accident of the23    facts here.  There's no reason that Ms. Buford's prior24    convictions could not have arisen in Tuscaloosa, Alabama,25    or San Fernando, California --4 1              QUESTION:  Let me ask you another question.  I 2    guess that the guidelines provide that sentences are 3    related where the offenses occurred on the same occasion, 4    or were part of a common scheme or plan, and those 5    questions seem to involve certain factual determinations. 6    Do you think that on appellate review there would be a de 7    novo review? 8              MR. STRANG:  Never of historical facts, 9    regardless which path one takes to relatedness.  The10    basic, or what this Court has called historical facts,11    would be subject only to clear error review.1213 law? 1415    consolidation, which is the third prong of the definition16 here, yes.17              QUESTION:  Well, in the example that I gave you18    of common scheme or plan there might be mixed questions of19    fact or law, and would there be de novo review there?20              MR. STRANG:  There may well be mixed questions,21    and I think the common scheme or plan is the application22    here that next to consolidation most calls or most invites23    de novo review.  If we look at the question of an24    intervening arrest, which is the initial screening device25    in the definition under the application note, I think that5QUESTION:  How about mixed questions of fact andMR. STRANG:  The particular mixed question of 1    one is most factual, that an intervening arrest rarely, if 2    ever, would arise beyond fact, it seems to me. 3              QUESTION:  I mean, technically I think you're 4    right in saying the words which come out of an application 5    note in a guideline about, that you could deem a thing 6    consolidated when it's -- what is the exact word? -- when 7    it's functionally consolidated, when it's -- you know, 8    what are the words I'm thinking of, functionally 9    consolidated when the cases -- when sentencing was joined,10 okay.11              Now you want to know -- this is somebody writing12    an application note in the guideline, and logically13    speaking nobody's disputing the brute facts.  They're14    disputing whether sentencing was joined, those words,15    sentencing was joined, do or do not apply to this16    undisputed factual situation in the world, so if you're17    going to go on a, all legal questions are for the court,18    and the court of appeals, all factual questions are for19    the trial judge, and this is a legal question, in that20    rubric I guess you win.21              But I would have thought that there were22    millions of legal questions of this kind that are really23    for the trial judge, because what they call for is the24    expertise of the trial judge, and they are so minor that25    if you start getting court of appeals into all that thing,6 1    what you will produce is an unbelievable mess, where the 2    courts of appeals try to figure out every possible 3    ramification of the application of every application note 4    in the guideline.  That's what I'm worried about, with 5    accepting -- 6              MR. STRANG:  Sir, I understand the concern.  I 7    think -- first let me note, Justice Breyer, that the 8    functional consolidation term comes only from the Seventh 9    Circuit and some of the other court of appeals, the10    application on the guideline themselves refers simply11    to -- well, the application note refers simply to12    consolidation.13              It is a question of what type of guideline are14    we applying here, and clearly if we confine ourselves15    today to the realm of Federal sentencing, United States16    sentencing guidelines, I would submit clearly that some17    guidelines never rise above fact in their application.18    Others I think are altogether discretionary in their19    application.  Many of the Chapter 5 guidelines would fall20    into that category.21              Still others, including the consolidation22    question here, I think are the sort of mixed question --23              QUESTION:  What I'm thinking is that the words,24    joint sentencing, are words that every trial judge in the25    United States would understand reasonably well, and71 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112 case.13              QUESTION:  Well, I suppose you could have a case14    where the trial judge says, if there are two different15    attorneys for the State appearing, asking -- at a single16    sentencing proceeding, that there are two different17    attorneys for two different offenses and there are two18    different sentences, that, as a matter of law, is not a19    consolidated sentencing.20              I suppose a judge could say that, and if he said21    that, then I think that you have a fairly strong case that22    this would be a statement of such generality, that is23    reviewable de novo.24              MR. STRANG:  And --25              QUESTION:  Is that your point?8they're words that I as an appellate court judge wouldhave a very crude understanding, and therefore I'd like toknow what the trial judge thinks about it rather than whatI think about it.          MR. STRANG:  I don't know that Your Honor'sunderstanding would be any cruder.          QUESTION:  I haven't done joint sentencing.Every one of them has.          MR. STRANG:  But the determination is one that Ithink peculiarly is made here on court documents --transcripts, pleadings, orders, at least in the ordinary 1              MR. STRANG:  Well, yes, and I -- 2              QUESTION:  All right.  Now, but won't there be 3    some other cases where it's not quite so clear, and where 4    the judge said, well now, you know, I know how these State 5    court judges work, and it's clear to me that the two 6    sentences were related because the length of the drug 7    sentence term must have been calculated by reference to 8    what he gave for the robbery term.  That might be a 9    different case, or would it?10              MR. STRANG:  I don't know that it would, because11    it really turns, I think, on the guideline one is12    applying, and if anything is true of the scheme that the13    Sentencing Reform Act established, it is that an exercise14    of discretion, if that's what Your Honor is describing,15    must be explained so that it can be assessed for16    reasonableness.171819202122232425          It is also, I think, true here that facts mustbe found, whether that's the whole of the inquiry orwhether that's simply the predicate, then, to applying thelegal standard to classify the facts.          QUESTION:  Do we ask ourselves, does deferencemean that two different trial judges could reach differentconclusions and both would be accepted?          MR. STRANG:  That is exactly what I think itmeans, and to put it in concrete terms, I think what it9 1    means here is that if Paula Buford had a twin, John, who 2    had done the very -- who had committed the State court 3    crimes in 1992 with her, also the 1998 Federal crime, but 4    he had been sentenced by the district judge below Judge 5    Stadtmueller and had received a 7-year or 84 to 105-month 6    sentence, whereas Paula for the exact -- in the exact same 7    situation had received nearly 16 years, a court of appeals 8    giving clear error review would be bound to affirm both of 9    those convictions and sentences.10              QUESTION:  I could see that happening if, in the11    case, I suppose, the Federal judge was trying to ask what12    the State judge likely did with reference to trying to13    balance the two sentences.  I think you'd have a stronger14    point if he says, as a matter of construction of this15    statute, that two attorneys, two offenses, two separate16    sentences does not mean textually that they're17    consolidated.  They are not consolidated.18              MR. STRANG:  And that, of course, implicitly is19    what this district judge said, and the relevant, or the20    most important pages are 21 --21              QUESTION:  I think he came pretty close to that.22              MR. STRANG:  Yes, he did.  He took note that,23    you know, the facts appeared undisputed.  He was left to24    try to apply the guideline and the -- I guess he called it25    the applicable application notes, and then made comment101    about there being two separate prosecutors, albeit from2    the same D.A.'s office, pursuing separate interests.3    There were two separate pieces of paper entered reflecting4    judgments.5              QUESTION:  And there was no formal6    consolidation.7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. STRANG:  That is true, there was no formalorder of consolidation.          QUESTION:  And it's possible the court ofappeals could say, this is too complicated, unless there'sa formal consolidation we won't apply the guideline thatway, because that isn't even settled, is it, that thisnotion of functional qualification doesn't come out of theguideline, doesn't come out of any application note.  It'ssomething that some courts made up.          MR. STRANG:  Yes, in a word --          QUESTION:  And if there is to be any kind ofuniformity infused in this process, why should it comefrom the court of appeals rather than the SentencingCommission?  I mean, you could see common scheme.  Youcould see crimes that happened simultaneously.          But this notion of consolidation, a judge couldconsolidate just because the guy happened to havecommitted a number of crimes totally unrelated.  Itdoesn't have the coherence that the other two categories11 1    have, so why shouldn't this be something for the 2    Sentencing Commission to straighten out, and then there 3    would be uniformity, to get the uniformity that way rather 4    than sticking the court of appeals into the picture? 5              MR. STRANG:  The Sentencing Commission very well 6    can, and is empowered to address questions and to try to 7    advance clarity in that way.  That, of course, says 8    nothing about the question on certiorari granted here, 9    which is the standard of review, and the Sentencing10    Commission cannot tell this Court the standard of review.11              I think also, if we're talking, then, about the12    substantive rule of --13              QUESTION:  No, but your argument -- I mean, if14    this is the point of Justice Ginsburg's question, your15    argument is that the only way to get uniformity is to have16    de novo court of appeals review, and the point made in17    response to that is no, you could achieve substantial18    uniformity by having more detailed prescription by the19    Sentencing Commission of what constitutes consolidation20    and then having the usual deferential review.21              MR. STRANG:  I --22              QUESTION:  So long as the details are23    significant enough, you know, complete enough, you'll get24    reversed even on deferential review if you fail to follow25    them.  Why isn't that a more sensible way of achieving the121    uniformity that you're after here?2              MR. STRANG:  I -- in the world of could, I agree3    with much of what Your Honor said.  Uniformity is advanced4    by de novo review vis-a-vis deferential review.  I mean,5    so as between courts acting on the question, I think the6    courts of appeals are better situated to provide7    uniformity.8 910111213141516171819202122232425          The Sentencing Commission could -- is a co-actor here, there's no question, but there's also noquestion that Congress did not mean that the commissionwould oust the Federal courts of appellate jurisdiction,quite the contrary.  This was part of the SentencingReform Act -- it included 3742 -- and giving the appellatecourts a much more active role in reviewing sentences thanever they had before in this --          QUESTION:  That's true,  but they don't have --I mean, they left to the courts to work out what would bea sensible relationship among trial court, appellatecourt, and Sentencing Commission, and therefore I wouldthink what Justice Ginsburg said was highly relevant.          MR. STRANG:  It --          QUESTION:  That --          MR. STRANG:  Again, the Sentencing Commissioncould act.  It is also clear -- and this is in thelegislative history that we cited.  It's clear that13 1    Congress had in mind that appellate decisions would assist 2    the Sentencing Commission in determining what it is that 3    needed clarification or revisitation, so I don't think 4    it's an either or -- 5              QUESTION:  No, it's not either or -- 6              MR. STRANG:  -- situation. 7              QUESTION:  But you can certainly say that when 8    you have the kind of question that trial judges know quite 9    a lot about, where appellate judges know not that much,10    where it is highly complex and factually related, that one11    should rely upon the Sentencing Commission to provide the12    necessary uniformity, and that would be a strong argument13    in favor of deferential review here.14              MR. STRANG:  Well, I don't know that it would.15    My problem is that you are then leaving the Sentencing16    Commission to look at the largely unreported work of17    district judges in 94 districts, rather than looking at18    the largely reported work of appellate judges in 1219    circuits, as I understand it, so I'm not so sure, Your20    Honor, that de novo review still isn't the better way to21    interact with the commission.22              That said, again I want to make clear that the23    commission has the role that Justice Ginsburg posits, and24    that it is not every guideline or application of guideline25    that I suggest is appropriate for de novo review under14 1    this Court's teaching.  This one, yes, consolidation I 2    think is peculiarly appropriate. 3              QUESTION:  And why is it peculiarly suited to de 4    novo review, Mr. Strang? 5              MR. STRANG:  One, the overriding importance of 6    uniformity here, which I think elevates the need to 7    clarify and develop. 8              QUESTION:  Why is uniformity more important with 9    respect to this guideline than any other?10              MR. STRANG:  Oh, no, the guidelines generally,11    Mr. Chief Justice, I'm sorry.  The guidelines in general,12    the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984.13              QUESTION:  Well, I thought you were saying that14    uniformity is important with respect to this particular15    guideline.  You're saying uniformity is important with16    respect to every single aspect of the guidelines?17              MR. STRANG:  Yes, and I'm sorry, the confusion I18    created.  I am saying in a sense both.  Uniformity always19    here is important in Federal sentencing, but when we're20    talking about a guideline that has a complex statutory21    standard, as this one, and is not a matter of purely22    individualized application such as acceptance of23    responsibility, or a decision whether to depart upward or24    downward for some unconsidered fact, then I think25    uniformity of the rule, clarity of the rule, the meaning15 1    of the legal standard is exceptionally important. 2              QUESTION:  Why is that more important than, say, 3    the clarity of the rule with respect to, say, acceptance 4    of responsibility? 5              MR. STRANG:  Acceptance of responsibility falls 6    closer to the realm of what this Court has called 7    supervision of litigation.  It is dependant upon factors 8    that cannot be transmitted by transcript, or are not 9    available to a court of appeals.  The defendant's10    demeanor.  The manner in which he interacts with counsel.11    You know, a variety of issues that may appear only off the12    record and therefore concern conduct immediately before13    the district court.14              I think to follow on my answer to Your Honor's15    earlier question, a clear rule of decision I think is16    important here for consolidation, because the potential17    disparity in otherwise like-placed persons is so great, as18    the facts of this case demonstrate.19              QUESTION:  One clear rule for appellate courts20    that recognizes the expertise that district judges have21    might say, I reject this notion of functional22    consolidation.  Either it's consolidated or it's not, and23    so if it's consolidated, formally consolidated, that's one24    thing.  If it's not formally consolidated, forget it.25    That would hardly benefit people in your client's                                  161 situation.23456789 it?          MR. STRANG:  That's exactly the path that theFirst Circuit now has gone, no consolidation unlessthere's a formal order of consolidation of record, but denovo review of the question of the consolidation question.          QUESTION:  But wouldn't there be a hugetemptation for a court of appeals to take that position,therefore to reduce the number of cases that would come to10              MR. STRANG:  I don't know, never having been in11    that position.  The number of cases raising this issue is12    not overwhelming.  It's -- I think it's sufficient to13    allow some development of the law, but it's certainly not14    overwhelming, and what the rule of decision would be, I15    have an opinion about what it ought to be.  How it would16    play out I'm not sure with any confidence I can suggest to17    Your Honor, and I'm of course here focused on the standard18    of review.  I'm not sure that's a satisfactory answer.19              QUESTION:  You alluded to the number of cases20    that would be implicated by the decision and you said, you21    know, it's not an overwhelming number.  Well, I suppose22    it's not so far as the application of the decision to23    beyond career criminal --24              MR. STRANG:  The career offender?25              QUESTION:  -- the Career Offender Act, but I171 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9suppose there would be an application whenever guidelinesentences were imposed in consideration of prior offenses,and I suppose the number of those would be enormous.          MR. STRANG:  Well, certainly the question ofrelatedness of prior cases can arise in any calculation ofcriminal --          QUESTION:  And it -- I mean, it must do sothousands and thousands of times a day in the Federalsystem, mustn't it?          MR. STRANG:  Yes.  They can arise, the --          QUESTION:  So if we rule your way, and we saythere should be de novo review here, in effect as a matterof law, then I would suppose the courts of appeals aregoing to be faced with a tremendous number of challengeshaving nothing to do with the Career Offender Act.          MR. STRANG:  I think not.  I mean, the narrowquestion here is consolidation as the path to relatedness,and at least --          QUESTION:  Yes, but I don't see how we could --well, maybe I should ask this question.  Is there a basisupon which we could say that the consolidation questionshould be reviewed de novo, but other questions ofrelatedness need not be?          MR. STRANG:  The Court conceivably could do1810111213141516171819202122232425    that. 1              QUESTION:  Well, conceivably, but I mean -- 2              MR. STRANG:  Well -- 3              QUESTION:  -- sensibly? 4              MR. STRANG:  Yes. 5              QUESTION:  How?  Tell me what the rationale is. 6              MR. STRANG:  The rationale would be that, as I 7    suggested earlier, the initial screening, the question of 8    an intervening arrest, ordinarily, at least my mind 9    struggles to find a situation in which that would present10    more than a factual or pure factual issue.  Did crimes11    occur on the same occasion?  Ordinarily it seems to me12    that's a fact-bound, entirely fact-bound inquiry.13              QUESTION:  Right, but that does not exhaust the14    universe of questions about relatedness.15              MR. STRANG:  That's correct, it does not.16              QUESTION:  And so I come back to my question to17    you, could we classify consolidation as in effect an issue18    that should be reviewed as if it were a legal issue and19    hence de novo, and at the same time on some principle20    basis say that generally the question of relatedness is21    not to be treated as if it were a legal issue and subject22    to de novo?  Can we split the baby that way?23              MR. STRANG:  I think the Court could.  Whether24    prudentially it ought is another question, but I think it25    could because at least as I read this Court's prior19 1    decisions on mixed questions it really becomes a matter of 2    deciding, does the balance tip factual or does the balance 3    tip legal?  Does it tip toward one class of judges, one 4    level in the hierarchy, or toward the middle? 5              QUESTION:  Oh, no, I realize that, but the 6    problem I'm having is simply the fact that there's 7    something peculiar about this issue, because consolidation 8    is simply a subset of relatedness. 9              MR. STRANG:  Yes.10              QUESTION:  And it would seem to me to be11    difficult, as a matter of principle, to say that the12    consolidation issue gets de novo, whereas relatedness13    generally does not, and I want to know if there is a14    principle basis for making that distinction, what that15 basis is.16              MR. STRANG:  I think it's whether the mixed --17    the mixture tips factual or tips legal is the best18    principle I can identify.19              QUESTION:  You're saying the statute has20    different tests for relatedness, some of -- many of which21    are mixed questions, and some of those are proper for de22    novo review, and others not.23              MR. STRANG:  This particular guideline yes, and24    then the guidelines generally.25              QUESTION:  May I just ask sort of a general20 1    question?  We're not really construing a statute here. 2    We're construing a note in the guide -- in a particular 3    guideline.  To what extent, if there -- there is ambiguity 4    and difficulty in figuring out what the consolidated means 5    or related means.  Isn't there something the Sentencing 6    Commission could give greater particularity to in its 7    definition of the relevant terms? 8              MR. STRANG:  For the rule of decision, yes, Your 9    Honor, it could.10              QUESTION:  It just sort of strikes me it's sort11    of a strange issue for us to be wrestling with.12              MR. STRANG:  Well, and of course under Stinson,13    although this is not a statute it's binding law, so it14    doesn't merit less time or consideration in that sense, I15    think, but again I have to acknowledge because of16    Mistretta we have the Sentencing Commission out there, and17    when we get to the question of the rule of decision,18    having first settled the standard of review, yes, the19    Sentencing Commission can weigh into that.20              QUESTION:  Isn't there something to be said,21    too, for discouraging rather than encouraging a great22    number of appeals of sentencing factors to the court of23 appeals?24              MR. STRANG:  But I think de novo review does25    that, and it's the point I wanted to make in response to211    Justice Souter's question as well.  At least as I2    understand the theory, or a theory of de novo review, is3    that as the law develops clarity through that process4    lawyers and district judges are more likely to get it5    right and to know that.  The district court is very6 bright. 78910111213141516171819202122232425(Laughter.)MR. STRANG:  Well, it --QUESTION:  You know, I sometimes think we take a          QUESTION:  Well, that's a very optimisticpicture of the legal profession.case here to decide a question and the opinion we writedeciding it creates three new questions for lawyers toargue about, so I don't think certainty is very certain inanyway, but just as a practical matter it seems to me it'sbetter to have these things resolved finally by thedistrict courts in some cases than simply appealed to thecourt of appeals.          MR. STRANG:  Well, in the end, Your Honor, wherethat would take us is back to the persuasion that thedistrict courts are best able to provide uniformity insentencing and that, indeed, at page 12 of the UnitedStates brief, is an assertion it makes, and that's simplyat war, I suggest, with the basic congressional findingsand purposes of the Sentencing Reform Act, that it was221 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425precisely the lack of uniformity with largely unsuperviseddistrict judges --          QUESTION:  It motivated the SentencingCommission --          MR. STRANG:  Yes.          QUESTION:  -- Act, there's no doubt of that, butit's one thing to say that we don't want two people in thesame cell block in Leavenworth convicted of the samething, one serving 1 year and the other is serving 20years, but when we get down to the finer points there maybe more to be said for discretion, assuming it'sconsistent with the guidelines.          MR. STRANG:  Although this is a situation wherethe difference -- although not 1 and 20 years, thedifference is really quite remarkable.          If there are no further questions, I'd like toreserve a few minutes for rebuttal.          QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Strang.          Mr. Wolfson, we'll hear from you.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R. Q. WOLFSON                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MR. WOLFSON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court:          The court of appeals properly applied adeferential standard of review to the district court's23 1    decision for two principal reasons.  First, the text of 2    the Sentencing Reform Act itself directs the courts of 3    appeals to give due deference to the district court's 4    applications of the guidelines to the facts and, second, 5    institutional considerations also support a deferential 6    standard of review.  The district courts are better suited 7    for making the kind of fact-intensive decision that is 8    typically involved in applying the guidelines to a set of9 facts.10              QUESTION:  Suppose, as in Justice Ginsburg's11    example, a district court said there is no consolidation,12    in my view, unless there's a formal order of13    consolidation.  That's it.  That seems to me a general14    proposition, a general and very broad interpretation of15    the text, which is susceptible of de novo review and which16    ought not to vary from one court to another.17              MR. WOLFSON:  Justice Kennedy, I think I agree18    with you.  That is, if the district court said, I19    interpret the guideline to mean that in no case may I20    conclude that two prior cases were consolidated unless21    there were a formal order of consolidation, and then22    that's the rule of law, and then I apply the rule of law23    to the facts of this case.24              Now, the court of appeals would be authorized to25    review that rule of law in a plenary fashion.24 1              QUESTION:  All right.  Now, suppose he says, 2    where there are two offenses and two attorneys and two 3    sentences, that is not consolidation? 4              MR. WOLFSON:  If he announces that as a 5    generally applicable rule of law that's -- that is, it 6    doesn't matter what any other fact of the case is, that is 7    the rule of law that applies in every case of this nature 8    that will come before me, that is a rule of law. 9              But if he -- but if, on the other hand, what he10    is doing is saying, I read what the court -- I read the11    standard that has been enunciated by the court of appeals,12    and that is, there may be such a thing as functional13    consolidation, and now I'm going to determine whether the14    disparate facts of this case answer to that description,15    and I see there are 15 salient facts in this case and16    eight of them tip in one direction but seven in another,17    and on balance I conclude that it's not functionally18    consolidated, that is --19              QUESTION:  He didn't do that here.  He was a20    very careful judge.  He did say, I'm left to conclude the21    only inference of consolidation is the fact that the22    sentences were imposed in two different cases.  That's23    almost a negative formulation of the hypothetical rule I24 gave you.25MR. WOLFSON:  Well, he said a lot -- actually,                  25 1    Justice Kennedy, I think he said -- 2              QUESTION:  He then does go on. 3              MR. WOLFSON:  He said more than that.  I mean, 4    I'm -- I would point the Court to page 21 of the joint 5    appendix which, without belaboring it too long, he also 6    did go on to say there were guilty -- there were separate 7    guilty pleas entered, there were two separate judges, you 8    know, he found there was no agreement among the parties 9    that the cases would be consolidated, so I think really10    what he was doing was answering to the other description11    that I was discussing which he was saying, here's how I12    think the facts of this case ought to be classified13    according to a legal standard, and that is the application14    of the guidelines to the facts, which Congress --15              QUESTION:  Well, do you think this was a mixed16    question of fact and law here?17              MR. WOLFSON:  I think it's best viewed that way,18    Your Honor, a mixed question of fact and law.  That is,19    consolidation is -- can be understood as a legal concept20    and functional consolidation.  It's similar to the21    common -- I think more clearly a mixed question of fact22    than law is the common scheme or plan idea.23              If anything, this perhaps seems a little more24    factual.  I think the common scheme or plan notion of25    relatedness is one that comes up very frequently, and that26 1    is, I agree, is a mixed question of fact and law and, like 2    this case, if the Court were to apply that application 3    note to a set of facts, that should be reviewed 4    deferentially on appeal, and it's very -- 5              QUESTION:  Well, I understand that the necessity 6    for allocating resources of the courts at the different 7    levels in the right way, but it seems to me if you had a 8    twin case to this that it should have come out a different 9    way.  I just don't see what discretionary findings, what10    deference that ought to be given to the trial judge in11    this very case.12              I'm not saying that other consolidation cases13    there wouldn't be some factors, say if the judge, the14    Federal sentencing judge said, well now, these State15    judges I'm sure must have balanced the two sentences and16    that makes them related.17              MR. WOLFSON:  Justice Kennedy, I think what the18    district court was doing in this case was saying, when I'm19    asked to consider whether something is functionally20    consolidated, I'm really considering did the previous21    State court system treat the two cases as though they were22    one?  Now, there's no order specifically saying that they23    did, so I have to look at the record of what happened in24    those two cases and see how the court system treated this25 case.27 1              Now, there isn't a, kind of an immediately 2    obvious answer, so the court had to look at the way that 3    those cases were treated from the complaint stage all the 4    way until the sentencing, and there were various factors 5    that strongly indicated that the two cases were not 6    consolidated.  They were charged by separate complaint. 7    They were assigned to two judges.  One of the judges said, 8    I'm not going to wait for sentencing in the other judge -- 9    in the other case, it's too long, I'm going to go full10    steam ahead on this case.11              So I think the evaluation, the district court's12    determination that the totality of the facts have a13    certain character is what we view as the application of14    the guideline to the facts, and that is what is entitled15    to deference.16              Now, on the institutional consideration point, I17    don't think there's any reason to think that that task18    would be done better if repeated by three appellate19    judges, or at least that that task isn't -- doesn't --20    that that function isn't worth the cost to the justice21    system as a whole.22              After all, although it's true that the judge did23    not make credibility determinations in a classic sense, he24    was required to draw inferences from a historical record25    to sort of fill in the gaps, try to figure out why the28 1    court system treated this case one way rather than 2    another, and that is a very fact-intensive determination, 3    and I also think there's not any particular reason to 4    believe that an agglomeration of appellate case law in 5    this subject would prove particularly useful for this -- 6              QUESTION:  No, but that's why -- that's why 7    probably really -- I actually think, I guess, is if an 8    appellate court decided to review these things de novo 9    that would be fine.  If an appellate court decided to10    review them with some deference that would be fine.  But11    the people who ought to work it out are the Sentencing12    Commission, I mean, which they can do, basically.13              MR. WOLFSON:  Yes --14              QUESTION:  So suppose I thought that, I mean, I15    can't -- I promise you that I can get good reasons both16    ways what it should be.17              MR. WOLFSON:  Well, the Sentencing Commission,18    of course, does review every district court sentencing.19    Now, when one --20              QUESTION:  In other words, the way the21    Sentencing Commission would work it out is, it would22    tolerate differences among the circuits in that respect,23    unless it really began to show up in different sentences24    being given to different people, at which point all they'd25    have to do is write a new application note.291 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. WOLFSON:  Well --          QUESTION:  They would assign it to a staffperson, look into it, write a new note that's clearer, andvote on it, and that's the end of that.          MR. WOLFSON:  But of course -- well, of course,that's true of many aspects of the administration of thesentencing system.  That is --          QUESTION:  Yes, and normally we don't hear them.Normally we leave --          MR. WOLFSON:  It's true of permissible bases fordeparture.  It's true of -- I mean, other -- there areother sentencing guidelines applications that are of verysimilar character, whether somebody is a minimalparticipant in an offense, whether his crime involved morethan minimal planning --          QUESTION:  Not quite the same, because thoseusually are very fact-related to the facts of the crime,while this, in fact, is a matter of judicialadministration, which we could say judges throughout thesystem are somewhat more familiar with.          MR. WOLFSON:  Well --          QUESTION:  It's unlikely you'll get an oddfactual situation with something like consolidation, isn'tit?  I mean, this is a sort of weird case in that normallyit's fairly clear whether the cases were consolidated or30 1    not consolidated, isn't it? 2              MR. WOLFSON:  It may not be entirely clear 3    whether a case was functionally consolidated, and it may4 not -- 5              QUESTION:  That's a concept the courts make. 6              MR. WOLFSON:  And it may not be clear whether a 7    case -- it may not be clear whether a case involved a 8    common scheme or plan.  Courts can reach whether 9    defendant's prior offenses involved a common scheme or10    plan.  Courts can permissibly reach different conclusions11    about a set of facts on that case.12              The point I'm trying to make is that, you know,13    if a district court on review of a court of appeals, say14    it were de novo, were to say well, this case is plainly15    functionally consolidated, or this case is functionally16    consolidated because this defendant's two prior offenses17    in Wisconsin State court were consolidated, I don't think18    that helps the district court decide any later case say19    well, this defendant's Alabama offenses were -- were20    functionally consolidated.21              QUESTION:  Mr. Wolfson, by answering as you did,22    you're sort of accepting this functional consolidation23    notion.  Has the Government taken a position in dealing24    with these -- this consolidation notion of whether it25    should be a consolidation order or, we're not going to31 1    mess with functional consolidation, or has the Government 2    just not taken a position on that? 3              MR. WOLFSON:  Well, we have argued in some lower 4    courts, Your Honor, that consolidation means formal order 5    of consolidation, but the Seventh Circuit has ruled 6    otherwise.  Several other courts of appeals have ruled7 otherwise. 8              We haven't asked those courts to reconsider that 9    rule of law.  We're not asking this Court to reexamine10    this.  We accept the concept for this case that there11    is -- that there is such a thing as functional12    consolidation, and the more important question to us is13    how that concept, as with many -- as with the application14    of many concepts in the sentencing guidelines, how that15    concept is applied and how that application should be16    reviewed.  It's a more important issue to us in terms of17    the overall administration of the guidelines system,18 and --19              QUESTION:  May I ask this question, Mr. Wolfson:20    if you do not require a formal order of consolidation, as21    I understand your position, how could this have been more22    consolidated?  One judge, one proceeding, two sentences23    imposed at the same time to run concurrently.  What other24    possibly could make it consolidated for purposes of25    sentencing except a formal order?                                  321 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. WOLFSON:  I think the other things thatcould have made it more clearly consolidated would havebeen, one plea bargain would have been a very, a veryimportant factor had that been in the other direction, onedistrict attorney who was there to represent the interestsof the State in both cases, and not two district attorneyswhere one specifically --          QUESTION:  But they could be --          MR. WOLFSON:  -- abjured any interest in theother case.          QUESTION:  But all those things could happen ifthere were a formal consolidation, too.  You could stillhave two district attorneys.          MR. WOLFSON:  You could, but I mean -- but Ithink --          QUESTION:  You could have no -- you could havetwo plea bargains, too.          MR. WOLFSON:  And although there were concurrentsentencing the judge understood the sentences to bedifferent sentences.  That is, they were not -- they werenot entered in one sentencing order.          QUESTION:  Well, just on two counts of anindictment you get two different sentences, too.  I mean,I have difficulty understanding it because they wereconcurrent, imposed at the same time by the same judge.  I33 1    don't know how you'd get more consolidated. 2              MR. WOLFSON:  If they had been determined 3    pursuant to a single plea bargain, Justice Stevens -- 4              QUESTION:  Right, I see. 5              MR. WOLFSON:  I think one could reach a more -- 6    a better conclusion that they were consolidated, because 7    it indicates that the -- you know, that the executive 8    branch was treating them as though they were inextricably 9    connected, but that's -- that was not what happened in10 this case.11              It was really a happenstance that they were12    sentenced on the same day and it might well have been that13    they were not.  After all, Judge Geske said, I'm not going14    to wait for the entry of the plea in the other case, I'm15    going to go ahead with sentencing in my case, and that, I16    think, is a strong factor that points in the opposite17    direction.18              Now, of course, to go back to the standard of19    appellate review point, I think there isn't any particular20    reason to think that the court of appeals de novo review21    would necessarily arrive at a better result, or a more --22     as a systemic matter more accurate result of these23    determinations, because the facts are so disparate.24              There's also the point that surely when the25    State court is deciding whether to consolidate cases, as34 1    the Wisconsin State court said, or whether it's not, it's 2    not thinking, well, in some possible future Federal 3    prosecution -- 4              QUESTION:  No, but the word consolidated, it's a 5    Federal question as to whether it's consolidated, isn't6 it? 7              MR. WOLFSON:  I think that's right. 8              QUESTION:  It's whether it's consolidated -- 9              MR. WOLFSON:  Yes, right.10              QUESTION:  -- within the meaning of the note.11              MR. WOLFSON:  Right.  I think that's right, that12    it's a Federal term.  I would ordinarily expect that if13    the State court entered a formal order of consolidation14    under its criminal rules that would be enough, absent some15    extraordinarily unusual facts, but even so, I mean,16    surely -- I mean, as the district court, as the district17    judge pointed out in this case, you know, he did look at18    the record in the State court.19              QUESTION:  The thing that's interesting to me, I20    have a lot of sympathy for your basic position, but on the21    facts of this particular issue it seems a little hard for22    me to swallow.  The thing that's really hard for me to23    swallow is the district judge came out the other way and24    said it's not even close.  He said they're not even close25    to being consolidated.35 1              MR. WOLFSON:  Well, of course -- 2              QUESTION:  If I remember it correctly. 3              MR. WOLFSON:  I mean, the petitioner has not -- 4    the petitioner has only argued that de novo review should 5    be applied, and the petitioner has not argued that if a 6    deferential standard of review is applied that the 7    judgment should be reversed, so that's -- you know, I 8    mean, that's the case as we take it. 9              QUESTION:  Mr. Wolfson, could the district judge10    have taken into account that these cases were put together11    for sentencing but that they could not have been put12    together for trial?13              MR. WOLFSON:  Well, I think that cuts -- you14    know, the fact that they could not have been put together15    for trial may cut in our direction.  That is --16              QUESTION:  Yes.17              MR. WOLFSON:  Right.18              QUESTION:  I'm suggesting that.19              MR. WOLFSON:  Right.  Right.    I think he could20    have.  I'm not sure that the -- I'm hesitant to rely too21    heavily on that, because I'm not sure that the Wisconsin22    court rules forbid, flatly forbid consolidation for trial,23    but they certainly presume that a drug case and a nondrug24    case will not -- will proceed along separate tracks, and I25    think that this, as the Seventh Circuit pointed out, you36 1    know, that is a factor pointing against functional 2    consolidation in a case like this, because Wisconsin seems 3    to have a policy of not wanting such cases to be tried4 together. 5              QUESTION:  Of course, the irony of that position 6    is that in this particular case the bank robberies and the 7    drug addiction seem to be related. 8              MR. WOLFSON:  Seem to be -- 9              QUESTION:  Related in a realistic sense.10              MR. WOLFSON:  The prior bank robberies?11              QUESTION:  Yes.12              MR. WOLFSON:  Well, I don't think that's true13    actually, Justice Stevens.  After all, although the, you14    know, the facts -- I don't think that there's a showing15    that the -- you know, the bank robberies and the drug16    addiction were, you know, part of a, as we might say, part17    of a scheme or part of a modus operandi.18              QUESTION:  Well, she was robbing the banks to19    get the money to feed her drug habit, as I understand it.20              MR. WOLFSON:  Well, that is generally not enough21    for a court to view cases as related, or even as part of a22    common scheme or plan, I mean, you know, and the district23    court was quite clear on that point and the court of24    appeals agreed, and the petitioner didn't argue otherwise,25    so I mean, it's a more narrow concept than that when one37 1    is asking whether prior cases are related. 2              QUESTION:  Is it your position that under this 3    guideline we have to -- it has to be all or nothing de 4    novo review or deferential review, or can we parse it out 5    and say, common scheme and plan are deferential, 6    consolidation is de novo, or do we just make a mess out of 7    the guideline if we do that? 8              MR. WOLFSON:  I think that all three subprongs 9    of the relatedness test -- that is, common scheme or plan,10    same occasion, consolidation, are applied -- are reviewed11    under a deferential standard of review.  That's not to say12    that there are never any legal questions that may be13    involved in that, and those, as we discussed earlier,14    would be reviewed de novo.15              An example I can think of in this case is, the16    guideline says that offenses are not deemed to be related17    if they were separated by an intervening arrest, and so18    there you might have to, you know, consider whether19    something was a continuing crime, and the same would be20    the case -- I'm sorry, I meant with the common, with the21    same occasion subprong you might have to consider whether22    the offenses were -- one of the offenses was a continuing23    crime and that's a legal question.24              QUESTION:  If we don't want to do that, if we25    want to follow up on this idea, could we do this?  Could381    you say, look, we're not here considering whether -- the2    word in the guideline is consolidated.  Or, no, the word3    in the application note is consolidated, right?4              MR. WOLFSON:  Right.5              QUESTION:  All right.  The word in the6    application note is consolidated for sentence, and really7    what we're considering in this case is not whether8    consolidated for sentencing has to be de novo or9    deferential.10111213141516171819202122232425          We are considering, in the circumstance where acourt of appeals has decided that the words consolidatedfor sentencing include something called functionalconsolidation, then can the court of appeals decide thatthat concept which is a subset of consolidation, namelyfunctional consolidation, maybe should be reviewed de novoor not.          We don't have to get into whether the thing ofthe document, you know, consolidation means when there'san order.  That's not before us.  We're considering theconcept called functional consolidation.          MR. WOLFSON:  Well, I think the rule does --          QUESTION:  I'm rather tempted by that, so --          MR. WOLFSON:  I think the rule that we areproposing does lend itself to a more generalapplicability, Justice Breyer.39 1              I mean, we have -- section 3742(e) does say that 2    the courts of appeals shall give due deference to the 3    district court's applications of the guidelines to the 4    facts, and that is a system-wide directive.  It's -- 5              QUESTION:  My problem with it is that I can 6    think, probably, if you give me a few minutes, which I 7    won't take, of instances in this highly complex set of 8    rules and thousands of words in the guidelines where it 9    just will not turn out to be right always to let the10    district court have its way when it applies a form of11    words to a fact situation, but there will be many others12    where it seems to be just the right thing to do, and13    therefore a narrow holding might be preferable.  That's my14    thought.  I'd like your view on that.15              MR. WOLFSON:  Well, the statute does say due16    deference, and so it doesn't exclude the possibility that17    there will be situations where de novo review is18    appropriate, as when the district court engages in a legal19    interpretation of a guideline, or where it seems clear20    that that's what it was doing in that particular case.21              QUESTION:  Well, that's true -- I mean, under22    deferential review, or you know, abuse of discretion, if23    the district court comes to a legal conclusion that's24    wrong it can be reversed on appeal, can it not?25              MR. WOLFSON:  That's correct, but I am thinking40 1    of, there are some guidelines where there may be legal 2    conclusions that the court has to engage in. 3              One thing -- one that has come to mind is the 4    definition of aggravated felony in section 2(l), where 5    there are both legal determinations to be made and then 6    applying those determinations to the facts, but I think 7    that one can presume as a general matter that when the 8    issue is a mixed question of fact and law, as the Court 9    described it in Miller v. Fenton, where it falls somewhere10    between a pristine legal standard and a determination of11    the raw historical facts, I think that as a general matter12    where it falls in that category a deferential standard of13    review will be appropriate.14              QUESTION:  It's hard to -- the reason I find it15    hard to do it that way is in the statute books you can16    find questions where all you're doing is applying the17    legal label to a fact situation, the most important thing18    in the world, the least important thing, whether a newsboy19    is an employee, whether a foreman is an employee.20              The same description applies to what the judges21    do.  The consequences are enormously different.  You see,22    I mean, that's a classical example, but that's what I'm23    afraid of right here.24              MR. WOLFSON:  Well, one has to look at the, sort25    of the system as a whole and the institutional41 1    considerations and reach a judgment about how Congress 2    intended the system to operate, and I mean, certainly in 3    Koon, you know, the Court was aware that the question of 4    whether a permissible departure one way or another was, 5    had enormous significance not just in the facts of 6    particular cases. 7              It could mean a tremendous difference in the 8    defendant's sentence, and yet the Court concluded as a 9    general matter whether the district court concluded10    that -- when the district court concluded that it was or11    was not a permissible -- an appropriate basis for12    departure, I should say, on the facts of the case was to13    be reviewed deferentially.14              Now, that's not to say that the Court couldn't15    conclude that the answer it reached was wrong.  I mean,16    the Court reached such a conclusion in Koon, as a matter17 of fact.18              QUESTION:  But under your view the trial courts19    will not have any guidance from the appellate system even20    as to what factors ought to be considered in whether there21    was consolidation.22              MR. WOLFSON:  I don't think that's right,23    Justice Kennedy.  That is, I think -- I mean, deference is24    not no review.25              That is, I think a court can't -- if the42 1    district court makes a clear error of judgment about 2    whether something was consolidated or was not 3    consolidated, just as if it makes a clear error of 4    judgment as to whether a defendant's prior offenses were 5    part of a common plan -- 6              QUESTION:  Well, I'm thinking in the context of 7    this case, where we're pretty well agreed on what 8    happened, the two attorneys and the two different offenses 9    but the one hearing.10              MR. WOLFSON:  Well, I mean, this case is -- I11    can't think in this case, or a case like this, of any12    facts, say, that would have been so out of bounds for a13    district court to consider that it -- you know, that it14    would have been completely erroneous to have considered15    that fact, but looking at the system more generally and16    not just consolidated but relatedness and applications of17    the guidelines, I don't think that one should arrive at18    the conclusion that due deference means no review at all,19    just as is the case in departure decisions under,20    departure decisions under the guidelines.21              The courts of appeals can give the district22    court guidance about what is inappropriate, an23    inappropriate basis for departing in that situation.24              QUESTION:  Isn't it -- maybe you could comment25    on this.  It would seem to me, of course, you're right43 1    that deference doesn't mean no review at all, but I would 2    think that it would be more difficult for a court to 3    review in a sensible and critical way a decision about 4    whether consolidation had occurred than it would have been 5    under the old law for a court to review whether a sentence 6    was appropriate when you're asking the question, should 7    the sentence have been 10 years or 20 years. 8              Here, we've got a case in which this question of 9    consolidation is going to make the difference, as I10    recall, between doubling a sentence or not, and I would11    suppose that in the absence of some clear rule it would be12    more difficult to review the consolidation decision under13    the guidelines than it would under the old law have been14    to review the sentence itself, as, say, between 10 and 2015    years, which is a very strange result.1617 here? 1819    quite understanding, but I think that one has to assume20    that the courts of appeals announce interpretations of the21    guidelines and that the district courts then apply those22    interpretations in a faithful manner to the facts of23    cases.  Now --24              QUESTION:  Yes, but can you give me an25    example -- give me an example, keyed to this case,44Am I seeing things in a -- in the wrong wayMR. WOLFSON:  Well, I think that -- I may not be 1    perhaps, of the kind of announcement of a rule governing 2    the meaning of consolidation that would be appropriate and 3    would actually make a practical, critical difference when 4    courts are reviewing consolidation solely for abuse of 5    discretion. 6              MR. WOLFSON:  Well, of course, if the district 7    court had -- I mean, assuming it hadn't been settled in 8    the Seventh Circuit, if the district court had said no 9    functional consolidation --10              QUESTION:  No, but we're taking this case in the11    context that there is something called functional12    consolidation, and I -- I'm assuming that that really13    could cover, as you in your argument a moment ago pointed14    out, a tremendous variety of facts.15              You said, you know, even if you come down with a16    rule it would be difficult to review on a de novo basis17    because of the extraordinary variety of facts, so we're18    starting with the assumption that you've got functional19    consolidation, number 2, that functional consolidation20    covers a tremendous amount of district territory.21              If you make those assumptions, what kind of a22    rule on abuse of discretion review could a court announce23    that would be of any critical help?24              MR. WOLFSON:  Well, of course, if the district25    court had refined that rule further and had announced451 what -- 2              QUESTION:  Ah, but all smart trial judges know 3    that the less they say the better, and smart trial judges 4    who want to keep control of sentencing decisions, which 5    the guidelines have made it very difficult for them to 6    keep control of, are going to keep their mouths relatively7 shut. 8              MR. WOLFSON:  It may be that the functional -- 9    that de facto or functional consolidation is sufficiently10    fluid that, you know, in the ordinary course the district11    court's determination is going to be controlling.  I mean,12 it's --13              QUESTION:  I thought your response to this was14    going to be that you don't have to have the court of15    appeals doing the job, that it should be done by the16    commission.1718192021    desired.22              MR. WOLFSON:  Well, I think that's right, the23    Sentencing Commission is there precisely to continue the24    process of making the sentencing guidelines more uniform25    by reviewing the experience of the district court.46MR. WOLFSON:  Well, that's --          QUESTION:  That the commission can promulgatemore detailed specifications as to what constitutesconsolidation if, indeed, more detail is needed, or 1              QUESTION:  True enough, but the consequence is 2    now, since the commission has not done any such thing, 3    that it seems to me that the range of unreviewable 4    discretion is greater when a court is determining what is 5    or is not a functional consolidation than the range of 6    unreviewable discretion was under the old law when a court 7    was deciding whether to give 10 years, or 20 years, or 508 years. 9              MR. WOLFSON:  Justice Souter, one response I10    would like to say is, I think as the commission and as the11    courts refine the legal concepts farther and farther down,12    and as the legal concepts themselves become narrower, I13    think it's going to be the case that the district court's14    determination whether any case where the facts of the case15    fall within those legal concepts is more likely to be16 upheld.17              That is, if all we had was two cases, or if two18    cases are related --19              QUESTION:  Okay, but I think what your argument20    in fact means is, if the Sentencing Commission decides to21    get into this with more detailed rules, then the22    discretion is going to be limited, but if the Sentencing23    Commission doesn't, then we are left with what seems to me24    this rather ironic situation of less reviewable25    discretion --471 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Wolfson, my understandingof the rule before the sentencing guidelines came intoeffect was that a majority of the circuits said there wasno review of sentencing so long as it was within thelimits specified by law.          MR. WOLFSON:  That's correct, if it was withinthe statutory limits there was no review at all, but --          QUESTION:  And didn't some circuits take theposition that there was an abuse of discretion review?          MR. WOLFSON:  Yes, but my point is, it's harderto find, I think, an abuse of discretion inherently as thelegal rule that you're applying to a set of facts becomesnarrower and narrower.          QUESTION:  You're --          MR. WOLFSON:  I mean, as both the SentencingCommission and the court of appeals, I think that's sortof inevitable.          Now, the court of -- if all that were availablein this case were the bare guideline that said related,and there were no application notes, then as -- the courtof appeals would have then undertaken the task of refiningthat concept of related, which is at a more general level,and then would have applied it.          Thank you.          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Wolfson.481 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          Mr. Strang, you have 3 minutes remaining.            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DEAN A. STRANG                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. STRANG:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.  Iwant to revisit the question of the Sentencing Commissionand the interplay with de novo review.          This Court in Mistretta approved the basicstructure and rule of the Sentencing Commission, ofcourse, and my view on that, or anyone else's, no longermatters, but I think we cannot rely here too much on theSentencing Commission or cede the ground properly inFederal courts.          For one, the Sentencing Commission never can fixdisparity in a given case, or cure a lack of uniformity inthe cases as they come.  It can act only to try to reduceor prevent that in the future.          QUESTION:  Oh, I thought it can act101112131415161718    retrospectively.19202122232425          MR. STRANG:  I'm sorry.          QUESTION:  I thought that its rules can beretrospective, that it can, indeed, require resentencingin light of its new rules.          MR. STRANG:  It can.  It can do that.  Iwouldn't expect it to do that in a situation like this.In its -- its powers really are not so different in its49 1    realm than would be Congress' power in the realm of 2    reconsidering what this Court does in the area of an 3    ordinary statute. 4              Congress can act there, too, to alter the rule 5    or even the standard of review, so I think it's clear, 6    3742 certainly makes it clear, I think, that Congress 7    envisioned here a critical role for the courts of appeals. 8    The question then is, well, at what level? 9              I want to note how much de novo and deferential10    review look the same in terms of the mechanical tasks that11    judges must undertake.  It's only the conclusory act, as I12    understand it, that differs.13              That is, the briefs must be read, the relevant14    portions of the record must be examined, and in the end15    the difference then is will reasonable, if inconsistent,16    conclusions be allowed to stand -- well, yes, that's17    deferential review -- or does a court of appeals simply18    look for the right answer, de novo.19              De novo review continues to have its place and20    it has its place here, just as much, I think, as de novo21    review admittedly on a case-by-case basis helps us22    understand reasonable suspicion, or helps us understand23    probable cause, or helps understand what in custody means24    for Miranda purposes.25              So in the end I'm married to the belief that the501 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425word do in 37 -- thank you very much.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Strang.          The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 12:03 p.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)51
