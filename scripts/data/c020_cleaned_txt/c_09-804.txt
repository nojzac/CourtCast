Amara.Mr. Olson.ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSONON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:Congress crafted a carefully balanced ERISAenforcement scheme that enables plan participants to recover plan benefits under section 502(a)(1)(B) and equitable remedies for ERISA violations under section 502(a)(3).In this case, Respondents are seeking a remedy for misleading plan summaries that violated ERISA. Their remedy, if they were harmed by defective plan summaries, is under 502(a)(3), equitable remedies, not for plan benefits under 502(a)(1)(B). The section that governs the relief that is sought is a necessary antecedent to any of the other questions in this case, and ERISA carefully structures, and this Court has repeatedly said the Court is not interested and does not -- is not willing to alter the structure that - Subject to Final Review3￼ - Subject to Final Review41 Congress carefully crafted and carefully developed over2 the years to provide remedies with respect to ERISA3 programs.4 And the scheme is such that, if there is a5 participant to the plan who is seeking benefits under6 that plan, section (a)(1)(B) of -- subsection (a)(1)(B)7 of section 502 provides for relief under the plan. If8 there are other violations of ERISA, section 502(a)(3)9 provides for equitable relief. That is the scheme10 carefully developed by Congress.11 Now, in this case what happened is that12 Cigna changed its pension program, its ERISA plan, from13 a defined benefit plan to a cash benefit plan, a cash14 value plan. And it put out, as required by ERISA,15 summaries of the new plan that the district court found,16 and the court of appeals affirmed, were misleading in -­17 in the sense that they did not provide all of the18 information necessary for plan participants to evaluate19 what was happening.20 Now, the changes to the plan were lawful.21 ERISA permitted and does permit these kind of changes to22 an ERISA plan. There was nothing unlawful about the23 plan and the plan change. And the beneficiaries, the24 participants to the plan, did not have any choice.25 Cigna had the right to change the plan. It did change￼ - Subject to Final Review1 the plan.2 It did have an obligation under ERISA to3 provide accurate summaries, and the district court and4 the court of appeals found that those summaries were not5 inaccurate. In other words -- they were not accurate.6 In other words -­7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson, when you say8 the employees had no choice, but the district court9 found, didn't it, that the reason for this plan summary10 being misleading was that the employer, Cigna, feared11 that there might be a backlash on the part of the12 employees if they found out, if they were told the truth13 about this plan; that is, that it was less favorable,14 that they would not have the same benefits that they had15 under the prior plan?16 MR. OLSON: That is correct, Justice17 Ginsburg. They had no choice in the sense that Cigna18 could adopt a change in the plan, as it did. That was19 permitted under ERISA, but it was required to give20 accurate summaries.21 The choice that you're suggesting and the22 district court was concerned about is that an individual23 could have left the employ of Cigna if he or she was24 unhappy with the change in the plan, or the district25 court said there could have been some sort of a protest.5￼ - Subject to Final Review1 What we're saying is that the remedy -­2 what was -- what was the violation is the summary3 itself. And we're not -- we're not challenging that4 here. That's a finding below. The summary was5 misleading, but that makes it a violation of ERISA. The6 summary is not the plan. And -­7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Olson, we have8 several times referred to the plan as having a range of9 documents associated with it, not as having just a10 single written instrument, but we referred to documents11 and instruments governing the plan. We did that in12 Curtiss-Wright, which is the case that you pin so much13 on. We did that in Kennedy.14 And the statute itself talks about that on15 numerous occasions, that there are documents and16 instruments, in the plural. And one would think that17 the SPD is -- is one of those documents and instruments18 that govern the plan.19 MR. OLSON: It's quite clear from the20 structure of the statute that is correct, as you21 suggest, that there may be multiple instruments or22 documents that are the -- create the plan itself. But23 the summary plan document, the SPD, is not a part of the24 plan. It is a separate document. It is a summary. It25 is a succinct statement of what might be in the plan,6￼ - Subject to Final Review1 and it must be accurate, and it must be written in2 comprehensible English.3 But I would refer the Court to section 10244 (b)(2) and (4), which are on pages 3a, 4a, and 5a of the5 blue brief. That describes the obligations that are6 required with respect to the summary plan document. And7 it describes the instruments of both the summary plan8 document and the instruments that constitute the plan9 itself in the following sentence -- and this is a10 similar sentence in subsection (4), but I'm reading from11 subsection (2), which is on 4a of the blue brief.12 It says: "Summary plan" -- it refers to "a13 summary plan description and the latest annual report14 and" -- or other -- "and the bargaining agreement, trust15 agreement, contract, or other instruments under which16 the plan was established."17 The construction of that sentence has to be18 that the summary plan description is a separate19 document. It is not one of those latter category of20 documents under which the plan was established. And the21 proof of that, if -- if English doesn't teach it to us,22 which I think it does, is the reference to the annual23 report. No one would say and no one would contend that24 the annual report is a part of the instruments creating25 the plan.7￼ - Subject to Final Review1 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I was struck by2 something else, Mr. Olson. I was struck by the fact3 that the -- that the statute saying what is in the4 summary plan description is packed with information that5 needs to be in the summary plan description. By6 contrast, the written instrument, which you equate to7 the plan, the written instrument says barely anything8 about what has to be in it. It just says the name of9 the fiduciaries has to be in the written instrument.10 So it seems clear that this statute is set11 up so that everything that is important, everything that12 the employee needs to know and needs to rely upon, is13 supposed to be in the SPD, not necessarily in the14 written instrument.15 MR. OLSON: Well, the written instruments,16 as these things turn out, are long, complex documents.17 They may be 90, 100 pages long. The summary, as you18 suggest, Congress said, yes, there is a separate19 document that must state in intelligible English that20 plan participants can understand the following things,21 and they must be furnished to plan participants, but22 they are not the plan document. The way that ERISA is23 structured, it -­24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Am -- are we missing25 something? They -- they cannot be in the SPD unless8￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425they are in the plan; isn't that right?MR. OLSON: Well -- if the -- if the -­JUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so the one cannot be more detailed than the other, can it?MR. OLSON: The plan can be more detailed than the SPD.JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. But what -­JUSTICE KAGAN: But can't the SPD -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Whatever is in the SPD mustbe in the plan; isn't that right?MR. OLSON: Well, if the plan is -- if theSPD complies with ERISA, yes. It has to be -­ JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. That's what I'mtalking about, of course.MR. OLSON: Yes. Yes, exactly. But noteverything that is in the plan, or the plan -- as the statute says, the documents that constitute the plan need not necessarily be in the summary. The words "summary plan" -­JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Olson, what about the opposite? Because the statute seems to be written so that things are in the SPD which don't need to be in the written instrument. And together, they all somehow constitute the plan.MR. OLSON: Well, I -- I submit that that is - Subject to Final Review9￼ - Subject to Final Review101 not the way the statute is written, and subsections (2)2 and (4) of the provision that I was referring to make3 that clear if the word "summary" itself did not make4 that clear. But the Curtiss-Wright case to which you5 referred to in your earlier question also proves that.6 Curtiss-Wright case talked about a summary7 plan description and said it can't modify the plan -­8 using "plan," "summary plan description," in different9 terms -- it cannot modify the plan, which is what the10 district court here held, unless the plan specifically11 says that it may be modified in a certain way and that12 the summary is an appropriate amendment to the plan. So13 the Court -- and this was a unanimous decision of this14 Court -- was referring to the summary as something that15 was separate, that might modify the plan if the plan16 itself allows for it to be modified in that fashion.17 Now, the Government says that the summary18 plan description is a part of the plan and so do19 Respondents. And that's what the court below -- the20 court below didn't actually find that the SPD was a part21 of the plan. The court found, on the latter pages of22 its opinion, that it was a modification, it was an23 amendment to the plan. That's inconsistent with the24 Curtiss-Wright case because in this case the plan itself25 specifically says that it cannot -- does not say that it￼ - Subject to Final Review111 can be amended by the SPD.2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that what the3 district court said was that they would treat the plan4 as containing what the summary said, not that -- that it5 was part of the plan itself, not an amendment,6 amendment. I thought that was what the district court7 said.8 MR. OLSON: I think in the -- on page of9 the -- this is of -- this is the summary to the cert10 petition, page 218, which is the district court's -- the11 conclusions of the district court's decision. Under12 Roman numeral VIII, the district court specifically said13 that the terms of Part B have been correspondingly14 modified by the SPDs.15 The court was saying -- I think you were16 referring, Justice Ginsburg, to the relief that the17 court ordered, but the court was ordering that relief on18 the theory that the SPDs modified the plan. And the19 plan itself, under Curtiss-Wright, doesn't provide for20 it to be amended in that way. And the SPDs -­21 JUSTICE SCALIA: It can't be part of the22 plan without modifying the plan, can it?23 MR. OLSON: That's -­24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Because it contradicts25 other provisions.￼ - Subject to Final Review121 MR. OLSON: That's correct. And the SPDs,2 the two SPDs themselves, on page 922a and 938a of the3 Joint Appendix, specifically say that if there's any4 discrepancy between the SPD and the plan, the plan5 governs. The language is at the bottom of, for example,6 at the bottom of 922a. So -­7 JUSTICE KAGAN: But the SPD can't negate the8 force of ERISA, and if ERISA says that the summary has9 to be consistent with the plan documents, nothing in the10 SPD can negate that requirement.11 MR. OLSON: That's correct. No one -- but12 Congress did consider prohibiting a provision like that13 in SPDs, that they could not disclaim, they could not14 say that if there's any inconsistency, the plan15 governed, and Congress did not adopt such a provision.16 This is a perfectly legal provision, to tell17 someone that if there's any discrepancy -- and there's18 bound to be discrepancies, the -- as I said, the plans19 themselves can be 90, 100 pages, very long and very20 complex. That's why there is an SPD that can't contain21 everything in the plan.22 And one of the things that would be the23 outcome of what the Government and Respondents are24 urging here is that plan creators, these companies that25 create these plans, either will be discouraged from￼ - Subject to Final Review131 doing it, or they will start preparing summaries that2 are 90 and 100 pages long so they -­3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they can't do that4 because the statute requires the summary to be5 understandable and not prolix.6 MR. OLSON: That's Catch 22, because if7 there's a -- if there's a discrepancy because they have8 to be short, summary, and intelligible, then we have -­9 we're faced with the proposition that someone's going to10 say, well, I read the SPD and it didn't say what was in11 the plan. If the SPD is as long and as detailed as the12 plan, then there's a violation of ERISA.13 My point I guess in this is that, yes,14 Justice Kagan, the statute requires the SPD to contain15 certain information. We accept the fact of the16 conclusions of the court below in this case that they17 did not do so. There are two SPDs. They failed to live18 up to the -- to the requirements of ERISA. There is a19 remedy for that. It is a violation of ERISA, and it20 specifically says in 502(a)(3) that for violations of21 ERISA, equitable remedies are available. And that is22 what Congress decided. It is -- unless it's a part of23 the plan, you must go under (a)(3).24 JUSTICE KAGAN: But the very question here25 is if there is an SPD that is inconsistent in some way￼ - Subject to Final Review1 with the written instrument, what happens? Is the2 written instrument modified or, instead, is the3 provision in the SPD given operative effect? And that4 question is one about your benefits under the plan.5 MR. OLSON: I would submit that it can't6 modify the plan unless the plan permits that. That's7 Curtiss-Wright. That's a unanimous decision of this8 Court.9 JUSTICE KAGAN: I do think you're10 over-reading Curtiss-Wright. Curtiss-Wright talked11 about whether a particular provision satisfied the12 requirement that a plan have an amendment provision. It13 didn't say anything at all about whether there are14 provisions that can have operative effect regardless of15 whether they pass through a formal amendment procedure.16 MR. OLSON: It seems to me -- I think we17 might disagree about that, respectfully. I think that18 the sense of the opinion in Curtiss-Wright was that if19 you're going to say that this SPD modifies the plan, it20 can only do so if the plan permits the SPD to modify the21 plan. Then the Court sent it back to a lower court to22 determine whether in fact the employees that were23 involved in creating the SPD there had the authority24 under the plan to modify the plan -- was it done -­25 JUSTICE BREYER: So far we're just14￼ - Subject to Final Review151 discussing, I take it, whether under (1) the other side2 is entitled to their benefits even if they weren't hurt,3 on a contract theory.456 we took the 789 you're right -- it should have come under (3). But I10 don't know if that's harmful, whether it was (3) or (1).11 And the question I thought we were to decide was, if12 you're under (3), say, where equity is at issue, now13 equity is at issue and the district court says: Here we14 have 27,000 people, and now here's how I'm going to go15 about this. I'm going to look at this provision mistake16 here, and the mistake it seems to me was likely to cause17 them harm. And once that's shown -- and they showed it,18 it's likely to cause it harm; we can't be sure, but it's19 likely -- then it's up to your client to refute case by20 case that these guys were not -- or women were not21 really harmed. Okay?22 Now, that seems very sensible to me. And -­23 and if that's the issue we're going to decide, I'd like24 to hear you explain why that isn't sensible. It's an25 equitable matter. This is simply a way of going aboutMR. OLSON: That JUSTICE BREYER: case to decide a MR. OLSON: Yes. JUSTICE BREYER:-­All right. But I thought different issue.And that is -- I'll assume￼ - Subject to Final Review1 it. What's wrong with that?2 MR. OLSON: Well, in the first place, it is3 important which section that -­4 JUSTICE BREYER: I agree, but I don't5 understand -- I'm with you on this one so far.6 MR. OLSON: Okay. Okay. Because it's a7 different defendant. The plan is the defendant versus8 the plan administrator is the defendant. So that's9 important.10 Secondly, (a)(3) provides only for remedies11 that are available in equity. Then the point that you12 -- that you're making with respect to what provision of13 equity, what is the -- what is the action that's brought14 and what is the remedy sought, as this Court talked15 about in the Varity case, and so therefore those are16 those questions.17 Now, the Second Circuit said "likely18 harmed." The fact is, as I pointed out at the very19 beginning, this was a lawful change in a plan and it's a20 plan where 27,000 people that were employees were21 participants in this plan and they would have had to do,22 as Justice Ginsburg suggested, either leave the company23 and suffer some harm or engage in some -­24 JUSTICE BREYER: You're sounding to me as if25 you're saying there wasn't likely harm. Okay.16￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. OLSON: Except -­JUSTICE BREYER: Are you conceding that the standard that they used, that the standard was -- the question that you raised at the beginning, whether -­ whether the showing of likely harm is sufficient in the absence of a rebuttal?MR. OLSON: Absolutely we are not, and so -­JUSTICE BREYER: All right. That's what I want to hear: What's the argument against thatstandard?MR. OLSON: Six circuit courts of appeals have held that -- that detrimental reliance is required. If -- if this is an action under (a)(3) under equity, neither the Government nor the Respondents dispute the fact that detrimental reliance would be required if you're proceeding in equity under (a)(3).JUSTICE BREYER: All right. And does "likely harm" capture that idea?MR. OLSON: "Likely harm" is not a demonstration of prejudicial reliance. - Subject to Final Review17￼they mean.JUSTICE BREYER: Why not? Why not?MR. OLSON: That's the -­JUSTICE BREYER: That's the kind of harm What they mean -­MR. OLSON: Because -- - Subject to Final Review181 JUSTICE BREYER: -- by harm is they were2 hurt, brought about by reliance.3 MR. OLSON: Well, in the first place, it4 comes out of the blue, "likely harm," as I suggested,5 since this was a legal, lawful change. People were6 going to retain their employment. They didn't have a7 right to opt for one or the other. If they could prove8 that they were -- this is -­9 JUSTICE BREYER: You object to this decision10 saying the following: Of course, the lower court said11 likely harm is necessary. As we understand it, given12 the context of equity, what that means here is that13 there was reason to believe -- reason to believe -- it14 was probable that, or some words like that, that there15 would have been harm caused by reliance on the -- the16 misstatement.17 MR. OLSON: I -- that would not be justified18 at all. I mean, under equity, as this Court said in the19 Lyng v. Payne case, which is cited in the briefs, this20 is like an estoppel action. An essential element of an21 estoppel action is detrimental reliance on the adverse22 party's misrepresentation.23 What the district court below did was, by24 coming up with this "likely harm" harm thing, is throw25 the burden over to the plan or the plan administrator￼ - Subject to Final Review191 and saying: Demonstrate that any one of your -- all of2 your 27,000 members of this purported class somehow were3 hurt by a change in a plan over which they had no4 control, over which they had no discretion, unless they5 were going to leave the -­6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But wasn't the -- wasn't7 the meaning of "likely harm" simply that they were8 promised one thing in the plan document, and so what9 likely harm is, is we have to do away with what they10 call, what is it, "the wear-away effect"? So that's the11 harm, the wear-away effect, and we have to remedy that.as, what isan action to be an18 MR. OLSON: Against the plan.19 suggests in various parts -- I can't remember exactly20 which page to refer to -- that $70 million would be the21 consequence of this against the plan, on which some22 people, depending upon how long they were with the23 company, when they left the company, whether they were24 about to retire, whether they stayed longer and the25 interest rates fluctuated, there can be all --12 And the way13 it, instead1415 seek benefits under the plan, which would16 (a)(1)(B) action against the plan itself.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.to remedy it is to treat this of (a) or (b), (a) plus (b)?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then you can't seems to me, each individual to make a about whether they have actually been - Subject to Final Review5 require, it6 calculation7 harmed, whether there's detrimental reliance. The whole8 point of these plans is to give people some comfort and9 assurance when they are age whatever, that: Don't10 worry; retirement is taken care, or at least I can rely11 on that.12 And your formulation would sort of put that13 up in the air and say: We don't know if you're going to14 be harmed or not; wait until you're 65 and we will see.15 MR. OLSON: Well, Chief Justice --16 Mr. Chief Justice, that is the statute. The statute17 gives you relief with respect to a misleading plan18 summary under the laws of equity. The laws of equity19 would require that the person say -- demonstrate in some20 way that they were harmed. The petition -- the21 Respondents in this case, the named members of the22 class, claim that they were out 30-some thousand dollars23 each. They would have an incentive to bring an action24 by themselves.25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it couldn't be --20￼ - Subject to Final Review1 MR. OLSON: Under the rules -­2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it couldn't be3 brought as a class action, and isn't that a large piece4 of this picture, that proceeding as they did they can5 proceed as a class? Proceeding under detrimental6 reliance, it would be hard to get a class because it7 would be an individual case of detrimental reliance.8 MR. OLSON: The Rules Enabling Act provides9 that a class mechanism cannot change the substantive10 provisions of law. And so, it cannot be that, because11 this is brought as a class action, the rules of equity12 somehow change.13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then the question is,14 under the -- under the section that the district court15 proceeded under, not the one that you say is proper, a16 class action would be appropriate.17 MR. OLSON: A class action might be18 appropriate, but it would not change the detrimental19 reliance requirement. Again, this -­20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, turning to (a)(3), I21 have two questions. One is, as you -- and this is22 probably for your friends on the other side more than23 you. But as you understand the "likely harm" standard24 that prevails in the Second Circuit, is it likely harm25 to a majority of the members of the class, all of the21￼6 difference,7 itself says89 think that's the question -­ - Subject to Final Review221 members of the class? Do you know? Has the Second2 Circuit told us what that means?3 MR. OLSON: Yes, well, the Second Circuit4 suggested, and the Government and Respondents,5 particularly the Respondents, say if there's a materiallikely harm is presumed. And the Government -­JUSTICE SCALIA:Likely harm to whom? I10 1112 asking, and13 likely -- is it likely that the class as a whole has14 been harmed, or that each -- is it likely that each15 individual member of the class has been harmed?16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or -- or a significant17 number?18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or a majority? Or19 whatever?20 MR. OLSON: Yes, I -­21 JUSTICE SCALIA: What does "likely harm"22 mean? Do we know that?23 MR. OLSON: And I -- I totally agree with24 the import of those questions. You can't describe that,25 in this Court --MR. OLSON: ThatJUSTICE SCALIA:I have the same question. Does it meanis the question.-- that Justice Kennedy is￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314151617181920212223242523 JUSTICE KENNEDY: My question had no import.I really wanted to know the answer to that. (Laughter.)MR. OLSON: Well, the answer -- the answer is what the district court ordered and the Government seeks and the Respondents seek, is they're all harmed by this, that there's any material disparity, then everybody -­JUSTICE BREYER: Maybe it wouldn't be too hard. They're -- they're joined as members of the class in light of a certain set of characteristics, and the judge would find that, other things being equal, individuals who have that set of characteristics which in this circumstance make them members of the class would be harmed in all likelihood, okay? Done.Now, it's up to -- it's up to the -- the defendant then to show that in a particular case this individual wasn't harmed.MR. OLSON: It defies reality -­JUSTICE BREYER: Why?MR.

BRUCE13 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS14 MR. BRUCE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it15 please the Court:16 Our position is that detrimental reliance is17 not found in section 102 of ERISA, which establishes the18 summary plan description requirement. It's not found in19 section 404(a)(1)(D) of ERISA, which establishes the20 fiduciary duty that's in accordance with the plan21 documents and instruments, plural, insofar as consistent22 with the provisions of this title.23 It's also not consistent with any language24 in section 502(a), either in 502(a)(1)(B) or 502(a)(3).25 The reference to equitable relief is to appropriate￼ - Subject to Final Review261 equitable relief to redress a violation of Title I or a2 violation of the terms of the plan.3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that seems to me4 like just a roundabout, complex way of saying that you5 must recover under the plan, because if reliance is not6 required then there must be some basis on which you must7 recover, and that recovery must be under the plan. So8 it's -- it's -­9 MR. BRUCE: Well, the -- the -­10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, if you say -- if11 you say injury is not required, then -- then I don't see12 how the SPD can give you recovery, unless the SPD is the13 plan, which brings us right back to the argument, which14 is your argument, under the first -- under the first15 section, under (a) -­16 MR. BRUCE: Under either (a) -­17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- (a)(1), (a)(1).18 MR. BRUCE: Under -- our understanding is19 that under either (a)(1)(B) or (a)(3), that the court is20 effectively providing an injunction in a case like this,21 where -- where an action violates the statute. And here22 a plan provision which had a very detrimental effect on23 people was not disclosed to them, and so the effect of24 the statute is to make that unfavorable provision25 ineffective. And so --￼ - Subject to Final Review271 JUSTICE ALITO: If the -- if the SPD is part2 of the plan, then where does the "likely harm" standard3 come from?4 MR. BRUCE: I think, as we've said in our5 brief, we think that the likely harm, possible6 prejudice, and the material conflict that -- that is7 used in the Third Circuit in Burstein, we think that all8 of those standards are very similar, that they are9 really looking at whether it -­10 JUSTICE ALITO: No, but why is there any11 requirement whatsoever, other than the fact that it's in12 the plan? If the SPD is the plan and the SPD says you13 get certain benefits that you wouldn't get under the14 written document, then -- the previously executed15 written document, then you get the benefits under the16 SPD, period. It doesn't matter whether there's likely17 harm or reliance or anything else, right?18 MR. BRUCE: Well, I think, Justice Alito, we19 see this more as a nondisclosure issue, that the20 unfavorable provisions in the plan were not disclosed,21 and that the effect of the statute is to make those22 unfavorable plan provisions ineffective. But because23 the statute refers to, for example, material24 modifications and being sufficiently comprehensive and25 reasonably apprising, that there are enough￼ - Subject to Final Review281 qualifications in there where the court can look and2 see, is this really -- was this conflict, was it really3 about something that was significant to people that4 might have an impact on their decision making and5 whether the terms of their employment are satisfactory,6 whether they might want to seek another job, they might7 just go into the office and say: We need more benefits.8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me that9 it's a very tough argument to say -- to make a10 nondisclosure claim on the theory that the summary is11 part of the plan, because the whole point of a summary12 is not to disclose everything. If it disclosed13 everything, it wouldn't be a summary. And if you can14 claim something because it didn't disclose it, it seems15 to me that's in tension with the idea that it's not16 supposed to be just a repetition of the plan.17 MR. BRUCE: Our position is that the SPD is18 one of the documents or instruments governing the plan.19 And by statute it's required to have certain -- to meet20 certain requirements, and therefore it becomes a21 document governing the plan. It is -- in response to22 Mr. Olson, it is referred to as a document in section23 1024(a)(6) of the statute, and of course this Court has24 repeatedly referred to it as a plan document and to25 "plan documents" plural. So, what --￼ - Subject to Final Review291 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's -- I think2 the brief -- the Petitioners' brief pointed out, it3 governs the plan only when it's more favorable to the4 participants, because you wouldn't say, if the plan were5 more favorable and the summary would show fewer6 benefits, that the summary would then govern.7 MR. BRUCE: I think the -- the8 favorable/unfavorable is that the way -- the way I see9 it is that an unfavorable plan term, when you look at10 Curtiss-Wright, an unfavorable plan term must be validly11 adopted and it must be disclosed in accordance with12 ERISA in order to be effective.13 And so, in the Frommert v. Conkright case,14 that was specifically what the Second Circuit held, was15 that the summary plan description did not disclose the16 phantom offset, and therefore the phantom offset was17 ineffective. Here the summary plan description did not18 disclose the wear-away provisions. People's normal19 expectation is that if they are under a pension plan and20 they are continuing to work, that they are continuing to21 earn pension benefits. So that the SPD was not22 apprising them that there were unfavorable provisions in23 the plan, which were validly adopted, but which were24 secret as far as they were concerned.25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So there's a -- there's a￼ - Subject to Final Review301 presumption that everything in the plan is favorable? I2 still don't see how you get it both ways. If it -- if3 it understates the benefits, that doesn't count?4 MR. BRUCE: The -- the Congress in ERISA is5 concerned with unfavorable effects on participants.6 It's about protecting employee rights. So the focus is7 on losses of benefits, and there is a specific provision8 in the regulations and in the statute about disclosing9 all the circumstances that can result in a loss of10 benefits. So there was a plan provision here which11 caused the loss of benefits that was never disclosed to12 people. And it was -- there was no baseline where13 people knew, well, the plan document may have a14 wear-away provision, and the SPD doesn't mention it and15 therefore there is no wear-away.16 They didn't know what wear-away was. They17 don't know what wear-away is today, because it has never18 been disclosed to them that there's a way to -- to rig19 up a pension plan where you can have a period of years,20 unbeknownst to you, where you're not earning any an21 additional benefits.￼2223 with that? 2425JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Are you finishedMR. BRUCE: Yes. Sorry.JUSTICE BREYER: If you're finished. As I - Subject to Final Review311 understand what you have been saying and written, you2 don't mean that the SPD, the summary, is a contract? I3 mean, one thing would be to say it's a part of the plan4 and moreover it's a contract, so therefore we enforce it5 according to terms. That's one view.6 But if you took that view, you get into7 problems such as were mentioned. The employer would8 write 10,000 pages because he knows it's an enforceable9 contract. Nobody would understand it. You'd have to10 worry about the time when it was less favorable than the11 written document. So call it a plan if you want, as12 long as you 1314 saying just15 And what I don't understand is why wouldn't that16 provision govern? I take it there's a provision,17 1054(g)(1), that says a plan cannot reduce the rate of18 accrual of future benefits unless there's written notice19 in a manner calculated to be understood by the average20 plan participant.21 So I would have thought, I read that, I get22 what you've said in your brief. The summary was23 inadequate. It wouldn't have been understood, and,24 therefore, according to this particular provision, those25 provisions in the plan that reduce benefits are void.don't mean it's an enforceable contract. Now, there's a provision that deals with it, what you said in response to Justice Alito.￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314151617181920212223242532 So now we enforce the plan with the -- in the absence ofthose particular void provisions, and you get what you want. Now, I thought that makes a lot of sense to me, except I don't see that anywhere in this case.MR. BRUCE: Now -­JUSTICE BREYER: So there's some reason it doesn't seem to appear in the opinions. It doesn't appear in the briefs. It doesn't appear anywhere until you just mentioned it in response to Justice Alito, or seemed to.MR. BRUCE: No, it is in the opinion. JUSTICE BREYER: It is?MR. BRUCE: The district court found aviolation. It's 1024(h) -- it's 204(h) of ERISA, that that provision -- the district court found a violation of that provision, which if the court had provided relief would have resulted in the class receiving much more relief than the court ultimately ordered; that it would have resulted in the class receiving four or five times as much relief, because they would have just been put back under the old pension formula.JUSTICE SCALIA: What is that provision? JUSTICE BREYER: (h). He's right, it's (h). JUSTICE SCALIA: Does it appear anywhere in-- in the briefs? 1024(h), does it appear anywhere in - Subject to Final Review￼ - Subject to Final Review1 the briefs?2 MR. BRUCE: It appears in our petition for3 certiorari, because after the district court found a4 violation of it, the district court declined to provide5 relief because there had been an intermediate interim6 amendment that might have -­7 JUSTICE BREYER: I understand that. So8 suppose we can't reach that, which would seem to be the9 logical thing to govern this, but we can't, okay? Then10 we only have two choices. The first choice is (1)(b),11 which seems to -- you want to use that by treating the12 summary as a contract, or we go to (3), in which case13 we're under equity.14 Now, between those two, the first one gets15 all the problems that we just were talking about. The16 second one would seem to be you're free and clear as17 long as you show some kind of reliance and harm, and18 then we're back to what I thought we granted this for,19 which is why not say if harm is likely, then the burden20 shifts?21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why not?22 MR. BRUCE: That's -- that's -- that's one23 way that it would be -- that was the way it's approached24 under the Securities Act, where there is an express25 reliance requirement.33￼ - Subject to Final Review341 JUSTICE BREYER: What happens in a trust law2 where, let's say, there are 10 or 50,000 beneficiaries3 in a trust, and -- and the trustee has indeed made an4 error. And now they can recover money only if, only if5 there really has been harm. Now, how do the -- how does6 trust law work that out? This can't be the first time7 this ever arose in history. We have a big class, and -­8 MR. BRUCE: Well, I -- we didn't go based on9 a trust law case involving a big class, but we based it10 on Bogert and on section 173 in the Restatement of11 Trusts, that when there is a breach of the duty to12 disclose all of the material information that the13 beneficiary needs to know in interacting with a third14 party, which in this case would be Cigna with respect to15 their employment, that then there is no requirement of16 proving reliance; that the trustee can prove -- as the17 Second Circuit set up, that the trustee can try and18 prove that the beneficiaries have all the information19 that they needed.20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you say under standard21 trust law once you show there's a breach, the burden22 shifts to the trustee to show that there's no harm?￼2324 the -­ 25MR. BRUCE: For a breach of the duties toJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, I understand that - Subject to Final Review351 to be the Second Circuit rule, but I didn't understand2 that to be the rule generally in the law of trusts, and3 I quarrel with the Government's brief on that. I think4 the Government's brief is quite wrong to suggest that5 this is part of the law of trusts.6 MR. BRUCE: Now, I -­7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, it could be the law8 of ERISA under the Second Circuit, but that's something9 quite different.10 MR. BRUCE: My understanding is -- I mean,11 that's the law that's been -- that this Court has12 adopted in securities cases where we have nondisclosures13 to broad classes, is that there's a presumption of14 reliance, which -- because it's unrealistic for15 thousands of people to prove reliance in -- in -­16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's not under17 trust -- trust law, or correct me if I'm wrong.18 MR. BRUCE: Well, that's -- that's what I'm19 saying, that there's a commonality between the20 securities cases, trust law as stated in the -- in the21 comment to section 173 and in Bogert, and what the22 Second Circuit is doing.23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could I just stop -­24 the securities cases, does that involve stock traded in25 a market, in which case the inference of harm would be￼ - Subject to Final Review361 much more obvious and follow more logically than in the2 trust context?3 MR. BRUCE: Well, one -- one of this Court's4 very first ERISA cases was Teamsters v. Daniel, in which5 the Securities and Exchange Commission had considered6 pension plans to be a security. And -- and the case7 actually involved break-in-service rules, and this Court8 concluded that whatever protections the securities laws9 offered, potentially offered, to participants were now10 offered in more concrete form under ERISA.11 But the -- the point that I want to get back12 to on reliance is that my reading of this Court's13 decision in Bridge and in Lyng v. Payne is that this14 Court does not look for the closest analogy to a15 statutory provision. The question is: What did16 Congress do in enacting this statutory provision?17 JUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you this: If18 this were an individual action and it -- and it were19 under (a)(3), what would either the plaintiff or the20 defendant have to show, depending on what the burden -­21 who has the burden, on the issue of likely harm?22 What would "likely harm" mean in that23 context? The person was likely to have left the24 employment of the company, or what? What else?25 MR. BRUCE: "Likely harm" can include￼ - Subject to Final Review371 that the -- that if the person knew about the provision,2 they might have asked for the provision to be changed.3 They might have asked for a different compensation4 package. They might have asked -- they might have taken5 personal kind of self-help steps to protect themselves6 so that they might have -- have, you know, decided to7 have their wife work longer. They might have decided to8 work longer themselves. They could have saved and saved9 differently.10 There's both the -- the steps that you can11 take in relation to your employment and the steps that12 you can take on a personal basis.13 JUSTICE BREYER: Could they here have14 gone -- could they also have said to the company: Look,15 why are you doing this? If interest rates fall, we're16 going to lose money. But interest rates might rise, and17 if interest rates rise, you'll lose money. So we're18 risk-averse, so what we would like to do is just make19 sure we get the same pension that we would under Plan A,20 and then if there's more on Plan B, add it in, and we'll21 risk the fact that interest rates might have gone up.￼222324 have talked 25MR. BRUCE: The district court -­JUSTICE BREYER: So they could -- they might the company into it.MR. BRUCE: Well, the district court found - Subject to Final Review381 that there was a real prospect of employee backlash if2 the employees knew about these benefit reductions. It's3 well-established in behavioral economics that people are4 very averse to losses. So if a -- if the statute and5 the regulations are requiring the loss to be disclosed,6 it isn't going out on a limb to say that there's going7 to be a reaction to that.8 And here, Cigna knew that there was a9 reaction to that, and they had examples from the press10 of with Deloitte & Touche had had a similar situation11 where they had to roll back the cash balance changes12 because employees were so upset.13 I think, in response to Justice Alito's14 question, the -- I don't think that the individual has15 to -- that if the individual has to prove possible16 prejudice, then I think that, as -- as our district17 court ruled here, then I think the standard inevitably18 becomes very close to actual prejudice. And so I think19 that the possible prejudice is really to the employee20 group. It's to the -- the statute is in terms of the21 average plan participant. It's all based on objective22 standards.23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under your proposal, I24 assume, if you prevail, under your position, the -- the25 summaries will now become part of the plan. So that￼ - Subject to Final Review391 even if there's no intent to mislead, there can be a2 class action if the -- if the SPD is in anyhow at3 variance with the plan -­4 MR. BRUCE: Well, as we -­5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and to the -- to the6 detriment of the employee.7 MR. BRUCE: Well, as we said in the brief,8 there are already cases that -- that recognize9 exceptions to liability here, and one of them is for10 prompt correction of any problem. So if you have the11 unintentional error in that unintentionally the12 wear-away provisions weren't disclosed, well, then the13 issue is: Why wasn't that corrected at any point in14 time? We're now 12 years out, and Cigna has never15 disclosed those wear-aways to anyone.16 JUSTICE ALITO: If an administrator -- if an17 administrator issues a summary plan description that is18 100 pages long and is basically the same thing as the19 written instrument, and that's a violation of the20 requirement in ERISA that it be a summary and that it be21 intelligible to ordinary readers, what remedy is22 available to a beneficiary?23 MR. BRUCE: I think -- I think that that's24 -- obviously, injunctive relief in terms of an order to25 correct that would be available. I think in terms of --￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314151617181920212223242540of affecting the benefit offers, of saying, well, isa -- if the SPD is identical to the plan document, is there any -- there are no undisclosed plan provisions, then. So it becomes -- it becomes more difficult in terms of relief, but obviously there would be relief for the understandability requirement.JUSTICE ALITO: Well, doesn't that putthe -- think of the incentives for the administrator in that situation or for the plan sponsor. If you issue a succinct SPD, you risk misleading the recipients as to the contents of the plan, and you may have financial liability.If, on the other hand, you issue -- you err on the side of issuing an SPD that is comprehensive, well, the worst that can happen, according to what you just said, is you can be faced with an injunction to provide a more concise and comprehensible statement.MR. BRUCE: Well, intentional errors should not be countenanced, and here Cigna was deliberately misleading employees. If it's an unintentional error, then it should be promptly corrected.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. MR. BRUCE: Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kneedler.ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER - Subject to Final Review￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENTSMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:The pension benefits an employee accrues while she works are a major component of hercompensation for working, just as her wages are. The employee is entitled to receive those benefits and to recover them if they are withheld without any particularized showing of detrimental reliance, just as she is entitled to recover the wages that were promised to her.JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Kneedler, do you view this as essentially a contract case, as that just suggested, or instead a trust case?MR. KNEEDLER: We view it as basically a contract case. In Firestone, the Court referred to contractually -- contractually guaranteed benefits, those under the plan. And the reason we think that here, in this case the district court found that the SPD basically promised, represented to employees, that after the conversion they would receive pension benefits in the form of A plus B, the old benefits plus the new benefits, accruing right away.ERISA -- the scheme of ERISA is that the SPD - Subject to Final Review41￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425is often -- typically the only document that the employee receives to inform him or her about the contents of the plan.JUSTICE ALITO: If this is a contract case, then where does the "likely harm" standard come from? If I'm owed something under a contract, I'm entitled to get that under the contract. I don't need to show that I was likely harmed by, that I relied in any -- in any way on anything.MR. KNEEDLER: Right. We do not think detrimental reliance -- and I think it works out -­JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think likely harm isrequired?MR. KNEEDLER: In this sense: If the -- if the SPD contains these sorts of representations such that the employee could reasonably be expected to rely upon them in defining her benefits, then that controls. The likely harm is not being told, or being told something different from what the underlying plan says.JUSTICE SCALIA: But the likely harm -­MR. KNEEDLER: That could be rebutted -­ JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not the likely harm.That's the breach. That's the offense. MR.

KNEEDLER: Unless the participantactually knew or couldn't reasonably depend upon it. Actually knew -- for example, this was the case in the Govoni case in the First Circuit, that -- whose formulation is the one that other courts typically follow. That was the situation where the employee found out before she retired what the true facts were, and, therefore, there could have been no claim of harm or -­ or that the -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then it's notcontract.JUSTICE KENNEDY: The minute you get away from contract -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it contract or notcontract?MR. KNEEDLER: No, it is contract,because -- because in that -- it -- it -- the question is: What is the contract? To the employee, typically the SPD is the only thing that is the contract that -­JUSTICE BREYER: But the SPD is written by the fiduciary.MR. KNEEDLER: Yes.JUSTICE BREYER: And the other is written by - Subject to Final Review￼ - Subject to Final Review441 the -- by the person who is giving the money, the2 employer. So now you're saying that it's a contract,3 even though it wasn't written by the employer and even4 though it could differ in dozens of ways from the actual5 -- from the actual plan document. Sometimes they'd be6 favorable to the employee, sometimes they'd be7 unfavorable, sometimes they'd be different but neutral.8 So what's the judge supposed to do? Forget about the9 basic document and just enforce this thing written by10 the fiduciary?11 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, but the underlying12 formal document is -- is what controls, unless the SP -­13 unless there's a conflict. This case -­14 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I said that there can15 be conflicts, sometimes favorable to the employee,16 sometimes unfavorable, sometimes neutral. So what we17 have is a document that's, by the way, supposed to be18 short, but I guess if we took your view it wouldn't be19 short anymore. And -- and it -- it could differ in any20 one of three ways; and I could think of seven other21 ways.22 So -- and we'll find seven others. So, what23 -- how is a judge supposed to react? Is he supposed to24 say that this two-page document is the contract, is the25 contract, and there are all kinds of conflicts -- what's￼ - Subject to Final Review451 supposed to happen?2 MR. KNEEDLER: It forms -- it forms part of3 the contract. And cases of conflicts between the SPD4 and the -- and the formal plan document are not common,5 and they shouldn't be, because the SPD -- the6 administrator or the employer has an obligation to7 make sure -­8 JUSTICE BREYER: That isn't my question. My9 question is: One, why should a document written by a10 different person, the fiduciary, govern over the actual11 plan? Second, what happens when you have a favorable12 conflict? What happens when you have an unfavorable13 conflict? What happens when you have a neutral14 conflict?15 MR. KNEEDLER: As to -­16 JUSTICE BREYER: How should it be worked17 out?18 MR. KNEEDLER: As to the first point, it is19 -- it is common, and it was critically true here, that20 the -- that the employer, the plan sponsor, is involved21 in -- in drafting the SPD. This was an SPD that was22 issued in conjunction with the plan amendment, and the23 SPD and the plan amendment -­24 JUSTICE BREYER: I think the fact that this25 individual in this case happened to be the same group or￼ - Subject to Final Review461 person is beside the point of my question.2 MR. KNEEDLER: Okay. And -- and so the -­3 the second point is, I -- I think it would be useful for4 the Court to look to the experience of certificates of5 insurance under group insurance plans. That is the most6 directly analogous circumstance in our view. It is the7 prevailing position in the courts, and it has been for8 some time, that where an employee -- or employee under a9 group health plan or pension plan receives a certificate10 of insurance that sets forth certain elements, essential11 elements of the plan, and the -- an underlying insurance12 policy is in conflict with that, that the certificate of13 insurance governs, for the same reason that the SPD14 governs -­15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is this governed by ERISA16 or are these things governed by ERISA?17 MR. KNEEDLER: Some of them may be and some18 ofthemmaynotbe.Imean,it-­19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So where does the rule20 come from, then?21 MR. KNEEDLER: The -- the rule is a common22 insurance rule that in -- in the group insurance23 situation, where you have an underlying policy that the24 individual insured is not going to see.25 JUSTICE SCALIA: But we have a statute here￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425which says that it is the plan that governs. I mean, that -- that's -- don't you think that's a crucial difference?MR. KNEEDLER: Well, but there's -- it's also a statute that, as this Court said inCurtiss-Wright, that the SPD is designed to -- to furnish the employee the essential information under the plan.JUSTICE BREYER: Is that true of the certificate of insurance?

What kind of test16 would we use?17 MR. KNEEDLER: I think it would be -- I18 think it would be the same thing where you -- where you19 have a -- either in this case an affirmative20 representation of what the -- of what benefits will be21 due, or you could have a situation where there was a -­22 a failure to disclose.23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if it's a contract24 case as you're submitting, then the burden-shifting25 rules, it seems to me, that apply in trusts don't apply.48￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR.

MR. KNEEDLER: That's -- that is critical toour position. And, again, the insurance/certificate of insurance analogy, it's all the same reasons that we say under ERISA, that that's the only document that is given, it's given for the obvious purpose of -- of telling the employee the essential aspects of the deal that he's going to get, and ERISA identifies, itemizes what they are and requires that the plan administrator not -- not minimize what they are.JUSTICE SCALIA: So it can't -- it can't amend the plan, contrary to what we've said.MR.

Under the16 insurance cases that I mentioned, what the courts17 says -- what the courts say is the certificate becomes18 part of the contract, but those cases also say when19 the -- when the plan is more favorable, that the plan20 governs because that -- under ERISA, that is the21 operative plan document that the administrator is22 supposed to operate under day to day.23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,24 Mr. Kneedler.25 Mr. Olson, you have 4 minutes remaining.MR.

Congress3 can take care of this if it wishes, but Congress enacted4 a carefully reticulated scheme; you're either suing for5 benefits under the plan or you're suing for violations6 of ERISA.7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why didn't that (h) apply8 here? Was it not egregious enough? Is that -- is that9 why it didn't apply? Or they just forgot about it or10 what?11 MR. OLSON: I -- I don't think that the -­12 the notice that was involved was referring to the SPD.13 The SPD, to the extent that it violates ERISA, there is14 a remedy that still exists; Congress hasn't changed.15 It's in (a)(3).

You￼16 can seek an 1718 that that's19 sufficient remedy, that's what Congress decided; and we20 referred in footnote 3 of our reply brief of a number of21 cases that -- that circuit courts have handledinjunction.And to the extent the Court is concerned an empty remedy, that that's not a22 demonstrating detrimental reliance and providing for23 remedies.24 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but I still have the25 same question Justice Scalia had, which is -- which is - Subject to Final Review1 why didn't this (h) thing apply here, because they2 didn't have -- their claim, the notice wasn't good, and3 if the notice wasn't good, then -- the plan didn't4 change, and if the plan didn't change, they should have5 gotten the money.

Very few5 people read their SPDs, but you only need one person to6 read the SPD to come in and say, by the way, folks,7 21,000 of us are not getting our retirement benefits for8 the next few years. And within a day, every employee in9 the workplace is going to know about that. So doesn't10 this give an incredible windfall to your client, Cigna,11 or to other12 intentional13 detrimental14companies that commit this kind of misconduct if you hold them to this reliance standard?MR. OLSON: The -- I refer to what￼15 Justice Kennedy was referring to. To the extent that16 we're talking about trust law, we're talking about the17 requirement of a loss. I would say that a person would18 not necessarily have to have read the SPD but have been19 aware of it and taken some steps in connection with it.20 And that's the evidence that would have to be21 established, and there's no -- and every court has said22 that under (a)(3) equity requires detrimental reliance.2324 Mr. Olson. 25CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,The case is submitted.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425(Whereupon, at 11:08 a.m., the case in the above-entitled matter was submitted.) -
