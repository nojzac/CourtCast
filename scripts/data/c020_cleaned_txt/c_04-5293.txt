Ms. Percival.ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROSEMARY E. PERCIVAL ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMS. PERCIVAL: Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:The question before the Court today is whether the trial court violated Carman Deck's rights to due process and a fair and reliable sentencing proceeding, as guaranteed by the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments, when the trial court forced him to appear handcuffed to a belly chain and shackled in legirons before the jury which would determine whether he was to live or to die.Counsel objected to the restraints and filed a motion asking for the procedures set forth by this Court in Holbrook v. Flynn. Holbrook described shackling as an inherently prejudicial practice and set forth a procedure by which courts would exercise their discretion in maintaining courtroom security while protecting the rights of the defendant.If the court is to impose an inherentlyPage 31111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 prejudicial practice like shackling, it first must2 determine that the shackles are necessary to further an3 essential State interest specific to the trial and must4 find that no lesser means is available to meet those State5 interests.6 The court abused its discretion in failing to7 apply the Holbrook standard in penalty phase.8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the -- did counsel9 suggest less intrusive restraints?10 MS. PERCIVAL: Counsel had filed an extensive11 motion in which it set forth a number of different ways in12 which courts in Missouri and in other jurisdictions had13 dealt with the problem where the -- where the courts14 minimized the effect of the shackles on the jury by hiding15 them from view such as by placing boxes around counsel16 table, ensuring that the defendant was already in place in17 the courtroom before the jurors entered, that sort of18 thing. And the court summarily overruled that motion.19 JUSTICE SOUTER: What was the basic20 justification in the first place for shackling? I mean,21 were there insufficient bailiffs or -- or why did they do22 it in -- even in -- during the trial itself?23 MS. PERCIVAL: The court did not establish a24 record for why the shackles were -- were warranted. The25 only justification that the court gave was -- at thisPage 41111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 penalty phase retrial was that Deck had been convicted,2 but there's nothing else in the record as to what3 justification the court had.4 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is there any indication that5 there were or were not present court security officers?6 MS. PERCIVAL: There's nothing in the record as7 to security officers in the courtroom.8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Who -- who should -- whose9 responsibility should it be to get something like that10 into the record? I mean, I read it. I don't -- I have no11 idea whether there was a good reason for the shackling or12 not.1314 to the use of shackling, it is incumbent upon the State to15 show that the restraints were harmless, and by doing so,16 they would need to make a record that -­17 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: What's the authority for the18 burden of proof question? What -- what -- which of our19 cases do you rely on for that?20 MS. PERCIVAL: Well, it's basically Chapman21 because shackling is an inherently prejudicial procedure,22 and when the court imposes that without justification, the23 burden falls on the State to show that it was, in fact,24 justified or that the shackling was -- was harmless and25 that the jurors could not see it or that sort of thing.Page 51111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MS. PERCIVAL: Once defense conviction objects￼1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So the principle is there's a2 right not to be shackled, and when the State says that3 that right has to be compromised, then the State has to4 have the burden of proof?567 that rule89 It would -- it's -- it flows from Holbrook and Illinois v.MS. PERCIVAL: Yes.JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I looked -- and I find in Chapman?MS. PERCIVAL: No, it would not be in Chapman.10 Allen and Estelle v. Williams. Those cases set up the11 standard that is really enunciated in Holbrook.1213 they not,14 a trial?15 1617 different. He -- I mean, when you shackle somebody who18 hasn't yet been convicted, you -- you send a message to19 the jury that, you know, this -- this person belongs in20 irons. But the jury had already found this person guilty.21 MS. PERCIVAL: Yes, Your Honor.22 JUSTICE SCALIA: He was -- he was convicted.23 MS. PERCIVAL: Yes, and -­24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Should that make no difference?25 MS. PERCIVAL: The reason that this presumptionPage 61111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE SCALIA: Those -- those are all, are cases involving the -- the guilt phase of -- of Right?MS. PERCIVAL: Yes, Your Honor.JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, this is a little￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425applies in penalty phase as well, the presumption of -­ that shackles are inherently prejudice, it stems from -­ we could start the analysis in guilt phase. In guilt phase, courts have held that shackles are inherently prejudicial because they make the defendant appear -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Guilty.MS. PERCIVAL: -- dangerous, violent, untrustworthy, and then hence, they are more likely to be guilty.Notably in -- in guilt phase, there's no question as to character. In penalty phase, however, where the State still has a burden of establishing that the defendant is worthy of a death sentence by evidence presented in court, the question of character is a key factor that the jury considers.JUSTICE SCALIA: Can -- can I ask you? You say counsel proposed some alternatives to -- to the visible shackling. Did counsel object that there shouldn't have been any shackling at all?MS. PERCIVAL: Counsel filed a motion saying that there should not be restraints at all, but within that motion, he explained how courts in Missouri had accommodated --JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.MS. PERCIVAL: -- both interests successfully.Page 71111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: But he did take the position2 that there was no need for shackles at all.3 MS. PERCIVAL: Yes, yes.4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Back on your earlier part of5 your answer to Justice Scalia, that it's inherently6 prejudicial in the sentencing stage, if one of us were to7 agree or the whole Court, the majority, were to agree with8 your position and write the opinion out, what would we9 cite for that, other -- other than our -- our own10 assumptions as to how the system worked, judicial notice?11 MS. PERCIVAL: Well, I think that you could12 follow Holbrook pretty closely and that I think what you'd13 need to -- to deal with is there's a whole bunch of14 precedent regarding how prejudicial shackling is. We know15 that character is essential in penalty phase, and the16 other characteristic of penalty phase is the heightened17 for reliability which is not present in the guilt phase.18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: With -- with character, we19 know -- we know he's a murderer.20 MS. PERCIVAL: We know that on that day 7 years21 prior that Carman Deck was dangerous to those people in22 that situation. But what the jury is being asked to23 consider is whether his acts on that day were really in24 conformity with what his character is and what it -- how25 he would behave if he were sentenced to life withoutPage 81111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 parole.2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are you sure that it's as -- as3 prejudicial in the -- in the penalty phase as it is in the4 guilt phase? I mean, in the guilt phase, it does make the5 person look like a criminal. In the penalty phase, I -­6 I'm really not sure if I -- if I were a prosecutor whether7 I would prefer to have the defendant shackled or not. The8 issue before the jury is whether to leave this person in9 his -- in his current incarcerated state for life or to10 execute him. And I -- I might think that showing, you11 know, what -- what kind of an existence it is to be -- to12 be a life prisoner walking around with the legirons and13 chains -- I'm not sure that that is going to cut in favor14 of the jury's giving the death penalty or -- or to the15 contrary, make the juror think, boy, what a wretched life16 this is and -- and that ought to be enough.17 MS. PERCIVAL: Well, Your Honor, in Beck v.18 Alabama, a similar situation arose. In Beck, the question19 was whether Alabama's statute which prohibited the jury20 from getting lesser included offense instructions in a21 first degree murder case was constitutional. And Justice22 Stevens in his opinion writing for the Court stated that23 there may be factors that cut in favor of the defendant24 and factors that cut against the defendant, but the25 uncertainty and unreliability that is forced into thePage 91111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 fact-finding process is what the problem is.2 So as in this situation, perhaps some jurors3 would -- would think, you know, he's wearing these4 shackles just because he was convicted. Others might -­5 may, as well, say he's wearing them because he's6 particularly dangerous. We don't know, and there's that7 unreliability of the -- the fact-finding process since the8 defense has not been able to confront this evidence and it9 hasn't come in from the stand.10 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: What are the factors in11 Missouri that the State would be trying to prove to urge12 the imposition of death versus life imprisonment? What13 are the things in Missouri that are deemed relevant?14 MS. PERCIVAL: Well, there are statutory15 aggravating circumstances, and the jurors are also allowed16 to consider non-statutory evidence.17 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is future dangerousness an18 issue in Missouri?19 MS. PERCIVAL: It is not a specific aggravating20 circumstance, but it's something that is -- is certainly21 relevant and that the jurors can consider.22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does your whole case turn on23 how shackling affects the argument that you're -- that the24 accused is making that he's not dangerous, et cetera, or25 is there some other different standard that we could usePage 101111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 to the effect, say, that it's just not consistent with the2 dignity in an American courtroom, something like that?3 MS. PERCIVAL: Well -­4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does your whole case turn on5 whether or not this is prejudicial to the fact-finding6 process on the specific issues or is there some more7 general standard?8 MS. PERCIVAL: Well, there are certainly other9 considerations that shackling affects. Shackling impedes10 participation in the trial by affecting how the client can11 communicate with counsel and that sort of thing, how the12 jurors will gauge his demeanor, whether his mental13 faculties will be diminished through the shackling. Our14 argument here -- because counsel did not specifically15 object on grounds of right to be present, our argument16 here focuses on how the jury viewed the defendant, given17 the fact that he was in these -- this extreme form of18 restraints, and these extreme restraints were unjustified.19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In the prison setting, does20 he wear such restraints? Justice Scalia suggested the21 jury might say, wow, that's the way he has to go around22 the rest of his life with the -- all chained up. But in23 -- do we know whether in the prison he would be routinely24 wearing these restraints?25 MS. PERCIVAL: No, he would not be unless he wasPage 111111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425a very disorderly inmate or something like that, but I think most of the jurors would -- would know from seeing jail shows and jail movies that inmates are typically not restrained in that fashion so that -­JUSTICE SCALIA: It's --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I mean, I think the -­ JUSTICE SCALIA: -- it's still an oppressivereminder of -- of how this individual, if sentenced to life, is -- is subject to -- to the orders of prison authorities which on some occasions will subject him to this kind of restraint.I -- once again, if I were a prosecutor, I'd rather have him dressed up in a nice, new suit and his hair combed and smiling. I would much prefer that to having him in shackles.JUSTICE STEVENS: Are you aware of any cases in which prosecutors have objected to shackling?MS. PERCIVAL: No, I am not, Your Honor.JUSTICE STEVENS: So Justice Scalia would have, I suppose, but he's unusual as a prosecutor I think.(Laughter.)MS. PERCIVAL: No.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I think there is -­is something to the point that if I'm a juror and the defendant is sitting about as close to me as you are atPage 121111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 the counsel table and I see that he can't suddenly jump2 out at me, I have a certain -- certain security in making3 a deliberated judgment. I -- I do think it may cut both4 ways. And that's why I'm asking you is if there are some5 other considerations here.6 MS. PERCIVAL: Well, I think -- I don't think7 there's other considerations other than, you know, this is8 penalty phase of a capital trial where we have to have the9 reliability of the fact-finding process. And the jurors10 are gauging the character of this defendant. And as you11 mentioned in your concurring opinion in Riggins, the jury12 is searching to discover the heart and mind of this13 defendant, and considerations such as character or future14 dangerousness are very important and may, in fact, be15 determinative of what sentence the defendant receives.16 Shackling a defendant basically places a thumb17 on death's side of the scale and dehumanizes the18 defendant, making it easier for the jury to find that he19 is worthy of a death sentence.20 The Holbrook standard that this Court21 established is a great standard. It has been in effect22 for -- for decades and it works. It is efficient and it23 is just as easily applied in penalty phase.24 Holbrook promotes the reliability of a death25 determination by limiting the risk that impermissiblePage 131111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 considerations will come into play. It also allows2 consideration of the individual circumstances of the case3 that is so crucial in the penalty phase.4 Holbrook --5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me ask you this. You, of6 course, would object to having to show prejudice in any7 individual case. Then it seems to me, to follow, that8 that's prejudice -- that that means because prejudice is9 difficult to show. And if prejudice is judicial -­10 difficult to show, why should we rule for you anyway?1112 reliability of the death sentence. If -- if shackles are13 inherently prejudicial in guilt phase where character14 isn't even at issue and that has a lesser standard of15 reliability, then they certainly are inherently16 prejudicial in the guilt -- in the penalty phase where the17 defendant's life is at stake.18 And as Justice O'Connor has recognized in her19 concurrence in the Eddings v. Oklahoma case, this Court20 goes to extraordinary measures to ensure that the21 defendant sentenced to be executed is afforded process22 that will guarantee, as much as humanly possible, that the23 sentence was not imposed out of whim, passion, prejudice,24 or mistake.25 Shackling opens the door to prejudice andPage 141111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MS. PERCIVAL: Because we are concerned with the￼1 mistake by giving the jury the impression that the2 defendant is particularly dangerous and therefore worthy3 of a death sentence.4 JUSTICE BREYER: Is -­5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you make of the judge6 -- well, the jury, already having been polled, and every7 one of them said this would not affect our judgment?8 MS. PERCIVAL: This Court in Holbrook dealt with9 the same situation, and the Court in that case held that10 when a procedure presents such a probability of prejudice11 that it is inherently lacking in due process, little stock12 need be placed in jurors' claims to the contrary because13 jurors may not even be conscious of the effects that14 shackling will have.15 And at that point in the proceedings, the jurors16 had not been instructed as to what specific factors they17 would be looking at. They did not know that Missouri has18 four steps in their sentencing procedure. They did not19 know how this would play into it. So their response that20 they would not be affected really should have little21 bearing here.22 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose the judge had said this23 defendant has just been convicted of killing two people.24 He convicted them -- as the jury knows, he was convicted25 of having killed them because he wanted to avoid beingPage 151111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 sent back to prison. The jury may sit there and think,2 well, if he killed two people to avoid being sent back to3 prison and we've just voted him guilty, maybe he's going4 to try to lunge out in the courtroom and get us. And5 therefore, I want him shackled. Now, suppose the judge6 had said that. Would that be an adequate reason?7 MS. PERCIVAL: No, I don't think it would. I8 guess what you're saying is if the jurors believe that the9 shackling is done for their protection. Then that gives10 the jurors the idea that -- that this man is going to -­11 has done something to indicate -­12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I think you have to give13 that answer to Justice -- to Justice Breyer, and that's14 why I'm asking. I -- I think you just have to say that15 this is inherently inconsistent with the atmosphere we16 want to have in a courtroom. It seems to me --I--I'm17 not quite sure I can find a lot of authority for that, but18 it seems to me that has to be your argument.19 MS. PERCIVAL: Yes, it is.20 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, Ms. Percival, would you21 still be here today with this argument if the defendant22 had simply had shackles around his ankles that would have23 prevented him, in -- in effect, from running or lunging at24 anyone, but that that had been concealed by appropriate25 covers around the table where he was sitting so that thePage 161111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425jury was unaware of that situation? MS. PERCIVAL: Yes.JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Would you still be here -­ MS. PERCIVAL: No. I -­JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- making this argument thatit's inherently prejudicial even though the jury couldn't see it?MS. PERCIVAL: I would not be here arguing that if the court had gone to -- had -- had balanced both interests and had limited the risk that this impermissible factor would come into play. And in fact, at the first trial and penalty phase, Deck wore leg braces underneath his clothing and he behaved perfectly fine. It was only when he came back on -­JUSTICE O'CONNOR: That wasn't obvious orvisible particularly to the jury.MS. PERCIVAL: No, it was not.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but then you're giving away the Riggins argument, which is that this somehow affects the psyche of the defendant and he can't fully participate, et cetera, which I thought was your argument.MS. PERCIVAL: Well, that -- that is one of the problems with excessive shackling. I think with -- with leg braces -- there's -- there's a balance with -- with Holbrook. And the court is balancing the State'sPage 171111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 interests and courtroom security with the defendant's2 interest in a fair trial. The leg braces was an effective3 balance because it protected the courtroom security, but4 it also enabled Deck to be judged on -- just on the5 evidence presented in court and to have the freedom6 necessary to -­7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So can every defendant have8 leg braces in every case?9 MS. PERCIVAL: No, Your Honor. No.10 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is -- you -- you have -­11 Justice Kennedy alluded to one of your earlier arguments,12 and that is the -- somehow the -- the shackling affects13 the capacity to participate. I thought you meant by that14 if the --15 counsel.1617 angles on18 with counsel, such as by taking notes. The other aspect19 is if the shackles are so distracting to the defendant or20 causing him pain that he will not be able to concentrate21 on what is going on at the trial to enable him to help his22 attorney and participate.the hands are shackled, he can't write notes to Do you mean something else?MS. PERCIVAL: Well, there are two different that. First, there's the ability to communicate￼23 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I -- I would grant you if24 -- if they -- they are so tight that it's causing pain,25 you've got a separate problem, but short of that, does thePage 181111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425so-called capacity to participate suffer simply because he's -- he's in irons? I mean, the only participation that he's going to do, I presume, is -- is sit there and -- and communicate with his lawyer. It's going to affect his capacity to write a note to his lawyer. What else is it going to do?MS. PERCIVAL: If the shackles are -- are very obvious, it might deter the defendant from coming to court in the first place, lest he be characterized as this dangerous person.JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you know of any instance ofthat?MS. PERCIVAL: I cannot cite to any right now, Your Honor. But -­JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he does have to stand upwhen the judge comes in -­MS. PERCIVAL: Yes, when the -­JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and presumably when the jury files in.MS. PERCIVAL: Yes. When the judge comes in, when the jury comes in, the defendant would stand up. And so-­JUSTICE SOUTER: But your -- your problem with that, as I understand it, is simply that at that point with all these chains and so on, he's giving an impressionPage 191111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 or the State is requiring him, in effect, to give an2 impression to the jury that may be a -- a false3 impression.4 MS. PERCIVAL: Yes.5 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.6 MS. PERCIVAL: Yes, it is.7 JUSTICE SOUTER: But back to participation.8 MS. PERCIVAL: It could also prevent him from9 testifying if he knows that he would need to walk from10 defense table up to the witness box.11 JUSTICE SOUTER: But that would be true if he12 were in the legirons.13 MS. PERCIVAL: That -- you're right, Your Honor.14 But there's other measures that the court could take to15 ensure that the defendant was in place at the witness box16 before the jury would come in.17 JUSTICE SOUTER: True, true.18 MS. PERCIVAL: But in this case the judge took19 no remedial measures. The judge was perfectly satisfied20 by the fact that the jury could see these restraints.21 JUSTICE SCALIA: I gather there was some22 evidence or perhaps it's conceded that he was put on a23 suicide watch before his first trial. This was the second24 trial. Right?25 MS. PERCIVAL: Right. When --Page 201111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: That he had been put on a2 suicide watch and that he had tried to injure himself by3 knocking his head against the cell wall?4 MS. PERCIVAL: Yes.5 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if the judge6 had specifically stated I'm putting him in irons because7 the man is -- is violent enough towards himself or others8 that I'm worried about the safety of the jury.9 MS. PERCIVAL: Well -­10 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if the judge had said11 that?12 MS. PERCIVAL: Okay. That incident -­13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would that have been enough?14 MS. PERCIVAL: I -- I don't think it would have15 been in this case because that incident had happened well16 prior to the first trial, and at the first trial, he was17 wearing the leg braces underneath his clothing and they18 sufficed. Deck was a perfectly calm, orderly defendant in19 the courtroom. There were no problems.20 And so there's two issues. There's the issue of21 whether the shackles were warranted and then whether the22 -- they were excessive. And these -- handcuffing him to a23 belly chain and forcing him to wear legirons were24 excessive.25 May I reserve the rest of my time, Your Honor?Page 211111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, you may, Ms. Percival. Ms. Nield.ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHERYL C. NIELD ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMS. NIELD: Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:The State of Missouri and Mr. Deck agree that the trial court needs discretion to fashion security measures such as restraints. That's particularly so in a case like this where we're talking about a penalty phase. Mr. Deck, at the time of his penalty phase retrial, had already been convicted, among other things, of two counts of murder. So by definition, he was a dangerous individual. In those circumstances -­JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, isn't -- isn't thequestion whether he -- he was dangerous in the courtroom? MS. NIELD: That is part of the question. Thatis true.JUSTICE SOUTER: There's no question he was dangerous when he committed the murders, but -- but I don't know that that means he's dangerous in a courtroom.MS. NIELD: Well, I think that certainly suggests that he's dangerous right off. In terms of whether or not he's dangerous in the courtroom, there's other facts that are conspicuous upon this record.Page 221111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, is there some burden on2 the part of the prosecutor and the court to consider at3 least alternative restraints or measures to make sure that4 there's no misbehavior?5 MS. NIELD: There may be but prior to that,6 there -- there should be a burden on the defendant to,7 first of all, articulate that the restraints are visible8 and make a record on that. And second of all, to -­9 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, apparently that was10 done. Do you say that there was no motion made by defense11 counsel and that alternatives were not proposed?12 MS. NIELD: I think I disagree with the13 characterization. There was a motion filed pretrial that14 contained a lengthy discussion of the law, which included15 discussion of various cases and alternatives to restraint16 that had been used. But that said, the motion itself is17 styled motion to have accused appear at trial free of18 restraints. The relief requested was that Mr. Deck should19 appear free of restraints both --20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you -- do you take the21 position that every defendant can be restrained if the22 restraints are not visible to the jury?23 MS. NIELD: It -- it would depend on the nature24 of the restraints, but if the restraints are not25 visible -­Page 231111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE KENNEDY: Legirons strapped to the leg of the -- of the table but not visible.MS. NIELD: Right. If not visible, then that would be fine.JUSTICE SCALIA: Why don't you limit it to double murderers anyway?MS. NIELD: Certainly that would be fine. JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I want to know whatyour position is. Traffic offenders?MS. NIELD: Again, it -- it depends upon thecircumstances, but if they're not visible to the jury, the defendant has a difficult time -­JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, the circumstances that you were given was a traffic offender.MS. NIELD: A traffic offender who is restrained where it's not visible -­JUSTICE O'CONNOR: With -- with non-visible restraints. Is that perfectly okay?MS. NIELD: Yes, it is. Yes, it is because if the jury doesn't see them, then --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: It's kind of an extreme position, isn't it?MS. NIELD: That's true, but it points up the importance of making a record on the visibility. If theyPage 241111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 are not visible -­2 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is -­3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But this -- this is given -­4 I mean, this is legirons. It's not leg braces. Belly5 chain. You don't need to make a record to -- to know that6 those things are visible. Is there any serious doubt that7 they were visible?8 MS. NIELD: Well, I -- I think there was serious9 doubt and that's borne out by defense counsel's question10 to the voir dire. He said to the -- during the voir dire11 to the panel, you either do or will know that Mr. Deck is12 restrained, and I guess that's what happens when you're13 convicted. That's a rough paraphrase. But the either -­14 the part that he said, you either do or will know, that's15 a direct quote. So defense counsel himself was not even16 necessarily -­17 JUSTICE BREYER: What about his motion? Is Mr.18 Leftwich -- is that defense counsel?￼1920 there was 2122 would ask23 panel for24 shackled in front of the jury and makes them think that he25 is going to -- that he is violent today and going to doMS. NIELD: One of them. That's true. Anda gentleman -­JUSTICE BREYER: All right, fine. He says I that or like to move to strike the entire jury cause because of the fact that Mr. Deck isPage 251111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425something in the courtroom. And I read that, he's saying, of course, they can see it.MS. NIELD: Again, we --JUSTICE BREYER: That doesn't say he can see it -- they can see it?MS. NIELD: I think that's an allegation by counsel that that may be the case.JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So has anybody said -- he said, Judge, I would like you to get rid of this jury which happens to be looking at the shackles. Okay. Now, at that point, you have to do -- then isn't it up to the prosecution to say, what do you mean looking at them? They can't see them. They're hidden.MS. NIELD: Well, recall at -- at this point the sequence is critical. By this time, defense counsel in his voir dire questioning had already let the cat out of the bag. Either you do or will know that he's restrained. But by -­JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, are you taking the position here that this record does not disclose that the belly chains and the handcuffs and the other restraints were not visible?MS. NIELD: Yes. I'm taking the position that we don't know from this record that they were visible.JUSTICE O'CONNOR: That there's nothing in thePage 261111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425record toshow that.MS. NIELD: That's right.JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And you don't concede it. MS. NIELD: I do not. I do not concede it. JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but your position wouldbe precisely the same if the record made it perfectly clear that the jury could see everything, I think.MS. NIELD: I think the test would be the same. That's -­JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.MS. NIELD: That's true.JUSTICE STEVENS: So this is an alternativeargument that you're making.MS. NIELD: That's true.JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the State of Missouri is submitting to us the proposition that every defendant in every case can be shackled so long as it's not visible. And I -- I find that an extreme position because it's an indignity on the defendant and the defendant is entitled to dignity in a courtroom.MS. NIELD: Well, this points up the distinction in this case between guilt phase and penalty phase. And what we're talking about here and the rule that I am urging this Court to adopt relates to the penalty phase. And in the penalty phase, like Mr. Deck's, we have aPage 271111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 person2 phase,34 prison5 phase?6who's been convicted of murder. Now, in a guilt certainly there are issues of presumption -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could he be forced to wear clothes once he's convicted and it's the sentencingMS. NIELD: I think he possibly would be able7 to, yes. Yes, I do because prison clothes identify the8 defendant, and if a defendant is an escape risk, for9 example, that would identify the defendant in case he were10 to bolt from the courtroom, for example.11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's no for example12 here because the court said, in answer to the lawyer's13 objection -- the -- the lawyer says, it prejudiced him -­14 prejudices him toward the jury and it makes him look15 dangerous. The court's answer: the objection you're16 making will be overruled. He has been convicted and will17 remain in legirons and belly chain. The only thing that18 was relevant, according to the trial judge was he has been19 convicted.20 MS. NIELD: That is the only stated reason, that21 he has been convicted. I think what that means is he's a22 twice convicted murderer. Of course, he's dangerous.23 Further, there are reasons spread upon this24 record. And keep in mind the same judge from the penalty25 phase retrial has been with this case from the beginning.Page 281111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 There are reasons spread upon this record that justify2 additionally the use of restraints against Mr. Deck.3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why? He went through the4 entire guilt phase with the more moderate restraints, just5 the leg brace, and there was no incident. There was no6 disturbance in that trial. He didn't try to lash out at7 anyone. Why wasn't that the best example of what one8 could anticipate in the penalty phase?9 MS. NIELD: What you state is true, but by the10 time of the penalty phase retrial, Mr. Deck's position, to11 paraphrase from Martinez v. Court of Appeal, had changed12 dramatically. He had already been convicted. Add to that13 he had already pursued his direct appeal through the14 Missouri Supreme Court.15 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is the fact of conviction16 critical for your point of view because it doesn't really￼17 matter if18 no danger1920 question. 2122 though he23 prejudicial in the eyes of the jury to see a man shackled24 when one of the issues they'll have to decide is whether25 his future dangerousness might -- might justify hisPage 291111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005there's prejudice or that because there's no -­ of prejudice?MS. NIELD: I'm not sure I understand yourJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, do you concede that evenhad been convicted, it would, nevertheless, be1 execution? Do you think there is prejudice there, or do2 you share Justice Scalia's view that it would be a good3 thing for the defendant?67 it not be8 should be9JUSTICE STEVENS: And if it depends, why would appropriate to have a rule that the trial judge required to explain the basis for his decision? MS. NIELD: Certainly here it would have beenMS. NIELD: I think it would depend. Some45 jurors might take away that the person -­10 simpler had the trial court been a little wordier, and11 that's not the case. That said, I think the test should12 be, looking back, has the trial court done something13 that's reasonable.14 And then to get into the prejudice issue, I15 think you have to look at the facts of this case. In16 terms of whether or not the restraint could prejudice Mr.17 Deck, one thing to look at is the defense that he offered18 in mitigation. His defense in mitigation was not that he19 was not a dangerous individual. It was not that these20 murders were an aberration -­21 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but would you not agree22 that it's always of relevance to a jury in deciding23 whether the -- the man should be executed, is how24 dangerous is this guy?25 MS. NIELD: Yes, certainly juries can considerPage 301111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that, and jury case law is in accord. But on the facts of this case, Mr. Deck's defense in mitigation was not that he was a safe individual or, again, that the murder of these two people was an aberration in an otherwise saintly life. That's not the case.The mitigation defense was that he did these horrible things. He is some -- a nefarious individual, but that he should not be sentenced to death because that wasn't his fault. It was his parents' fault. They had done a poor job in raising him. He had suffered difficult circumstances growing up. So there's simply no intersection between the mitigation defense offered here and whatever the jury might take away that might be negative from the fact that he was restrained.JUSTICE SOUTER: But the fact -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could they put him in a cage?MS. NIELD: Could they put Mr. Deck in a cage? I don't think so. Could they put -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: He's -- he's been convicted. We know he's dangerous.MS. NIELD: Right.JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me your argument is much like arguing on the merits of the -- at the original trial that his defense was alibi or something like that, therefore you don't have to worry about thePage 311111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 prejudice that arises from the restraints.2 MS. NIELD: Well, I think in the penalty phase,3 we're looking at reliability. And -- and the bottom line4 is restraining somebody who's twice been convicted of5 murder is not in any way unreliable or misleading.6 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but the bottom line from7 the other point of view is that shackles are always8 prejudicial, and you try to have the scales evenly9 balanced when you're deciding whether the man should die10 or not.11 MS. NIELD: In terms of making that decision,12 it's important to remember that Missouri has procedures in13 place to channel, at the front end, the jury's decision14 whether or not to impose death. Among those are15 aggravating circumstances. And in this case the16 aggravating circumstances did not relate at all to17 dangerousness or future dangerousness. In fact, in18 Missouri -­19 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the -- the stated20 aggravating circumstances didn't, but the point of -- one21 point of the argument is that by shackling the man in -­22 in this complete and visible way, you are creating the23 impression that no one could fail to -- to perceive that24 this guy is so dangerous that they can't even depend upon25 courtroom security either to protect him from the -­Page 321111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 protect the jurors or courtroom personnel or to prevent2 escape. That -- excuse me. That may not be a verbal3 argument about dangerousness, but it seems to me that it4 is an unmistakably visible one. What is your response to5 that?6 MS. NIELD: Two responses to that. In terms of7 the dangerousness, again, this jury in particular knew8 that Mr. Deck had been convicted of murder. They knew9 that the choice they faced was both stark and very10 serious: life without probation or parole or death. And11 so to present Mr. Deck in restraints could hardly come as12 a shock. To the contrary, it might be confusing and cause13 consternation to have a twice-convicted murderer sitting14 at counsel table no more restrained than counsel or the15 people in the courtroom.16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we know why the judge17 apparently changed his mind? Because if I remember18 correctly, at the pretrial hearing, the court said that19 the defendant would be allowed to, A, wear his own clothes20 and, B, to have leg braces underneath for security. And21 then sometime after that pretrial hearing, the judge22 apparently changed his mind. Do we know what triggered23 that?24 MS. NIELD: We -- we do not. There is no record25 of any such pretrial hearing. The only way we know aboutPage 331111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 that is from allegations in the motion for new trial. So2 there is -- there is no record on that at all.34 question,5 that's an6 used in a78 whether or not the trial court's action was reasonable.9 And in looking at reasonableness, we can consider areIf possible, I'd like to get back to the cage Justice Kennedy, that you posed. That's a -­ extreme form of restraint. Could that ever be case? It's possible.But then I think we get into questions of10 there other perhaps less visible, less dramatic forms of11 restraint that might do the job equally well. That's not12 to say, however, that a -­13 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, how about the ones that14 were used on Mr. Deck during the trial? Was that an15 alternative that was reasonable?16 MS. NIELD: I think it was an alternative in17 this case, and the defense didn't proffer, at the time of18 the objection, anything that they thought that might be19 less. And I think the trouble comes in here -- again, I20 don't believe a least restrictive alternatives approach is21 appropriate, but when you talk about least restrictive, I22 think it's sometimes difficult to tell what is less23 restrictive than something else because not all24 restraints -­25 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, in part it depends onPage 341111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 whose burden it is. Is it the burden of the State, if2 they're going to use shackles, to somehow establish that3 it's needed?4 MS. NIELD: I think -­5 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Or do you take the position6 that they're free to impose shackles in every case, even a7 traffic offense, if the prosecutor wishes to do it,8 without any justification? That's your position9 apparently.10 MS. NIELD: Well, I think if it's non-visible11 restraints --12 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is that right?13 MS. NIELD: I -- I don't think that's --14 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is that your position?15 MS. NIELD: No. I don't think that's precisely16 right.17 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: No?18 MS. NIELD: I think if it's non-visible19 restraints, we have a non-issue. If the jury doesn't see20 it, it doesn't really matter. That's -- that's --21 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: That's not my question, and22 -- and it relates to what is the burden of the State in23 these situations to use the visible restraints?24 MS. NIELD: The burden is for the State to show25 that the restraints were reasonable, were not completelyPage 351111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425out of proportion -­JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And where in this record do Ifind that the State carried that burden -­ MS. NIELD: The record -­JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- and that there was a finding by the trial judge on it?MS. NIELD: There was not a finding per se, but the facts of this case, spread upon the record, support the use of restraints in this case.JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Could you point me to places in the record where it supports your position on the use of the visible restraint?MS. NIELD: Yes. Mr. Deck had an aiding escape conviction that was presented to the jury. There was the attempted escape that Justice Scalia referred to. Or excuse me. He referred to the -- the suicide --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Had that not occurred before he was even tried?MS. NIELD: That had, yes. Yes, that's true.JUSTICE STEVENS: And what were the facts of the aiding escape? Was he trying to get away or was he helping somebody?MS. NIELD: He was assisting somebody.JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, what did he do? Draw a map or what?Page 361111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 (Laughter.)2 MS. NIELD: He -- he had a saw blade and he3 assisted these other individuals in sawing their way out.4 So there's that, both a conviction -­5 JUSTICE STEVENS: Which really has very little6 probative value on this issue. I mean, the fact that he7 tried to saw his way out of a cell hardly speaks to the8 risk of fleeing from the courtroom while the proceedings9 are going on.10 MS. NIELD: I -- I must disagree. I think if11 he's aiding other people in escape, he himself tried to12 remove the glass from the window when he was held in jail13 prior to trial by removing the caulking. If he is willing14 to escape in those circumstances, what's to say he's not15 willing to escape in the Jefferson County courtroom?￼1617 that that18 phase.19 2021 might draw, it didn't prove out. So it seems to me the -­22 the closest in time is the -- and -- and in fact is the23 episode he's just been through, the trial episode. So why24 wouldn't that be -- the -- the judge would start with that25 in mind. Well, I tried this man and he didn't give me anyPage 371111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005JUSTICE GINSBURG: So we already know that -­ effort was made before he was tried in the guiltMS. NIELD: That's true.JUSTICE GINSBURG: And whatever inference you1 problems, so I have no reason to anticipate problems now.2 MS. NIELD: That's true. But again, we also3 have the fact that he had -- between the initial penalty4 phase and the penalty phase retrial, Mr. Deck had pursued5 his direct and post-conviction appeals. They had not been6 successful on the issue of guilt. The issue of guilt is7 done. He's a twice-convicted murderer. And he knew that8 at that time.9 Furthermore, we have the fact that the first10 jury in the penalty phase found one of the six aggravating11 circumstances -- actually they found all, but one of them12 was that Mr. Deck killed in order to avoid lawful arrest.13 He has 12 convictions on his record, and at the time that14 he killed the Longs, he knew that if I leave witnesses and15 they can identify me and I go to prison for breaking into16 their house and stealing money, I will not be leaving17 prison. So that was a factor as well. That was a factor18 as well.19 JUSTICE BREYER: If -- if there are some factors20 that favor putting him in shackles and I guess others21 might not, what's the argument that the judge shouldn't at22 least have to make a finding?23 MS. NIELD: Again, the question is24 reasonableness. We don't have a finding here, and it25 would certainly have been helpful. But --Page 381111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, you know, I realize you2 want to save the conviction and the penalty, but if you3 look at the mine run of cases, it's pretty hard for me to4 see how the State could show special circumstances and5 they not get a finding from the judge that they're right.6 MS. NIELD: We don't -­7 JUSTICE BREYER: It's pretty hard to see an8 argument against it.9 MS. NIELD: We don't -­10 JUSTICE BREYER: I know that hurts your case,11 but I -- I still need to think of some argument or reason12 why the judge shouldn't have to at least make a finding.13 MS. NIELD: Right. Findings would certainly be14 helpful, but again, the question is whether or not what15 the trial court did is reasonable, not if what he did was16 perfect. If conspicuous on this record, we have factors17 like an attempted escape, aiding others in escaping, the18 fact that he killed to avoid lawful arrest, the fact that19 between his initial penalty phase and the retrial he had20 pursued his remedies. With all these facts, can we really21 say that the trial court was on the side of22 unreasonableness versus reasonableness? Do we have to23 wait for Mr. Deck to actually have an outburst? Or it24 could be something where it's an -- an issue of the25 spectators in the courtroom. There could be many things.Page 391111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 It could be an issue of what the particular confines of2 the Jefferson County courthouse are and whether or not3 it's set up in such a way as to avoid escape and things of4 that nature.5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: With a -- with a blank record6 -- the -- the State is going to restrain someone and it7 may be necessary, it may be not, and if the State has the8 burden, then why shouldn't a reviewing court speculate on9 what might have been when the only thing that was -­10 appears of record is he's been convicted and will remain11 in legirons? The only reason the court gave is that now12 things have changed. He's no longer in the guilt phase13 where he enjoys the presumption of innocence. He has been14 convicted and, therefore, we can keep him in chains.15 There's nothing situation-specific about it. The judge16 seems to be saying once a person is convicted, at least of17 murder, it's fair game. It's -- it's permissible to keep18 him in legirons and shackles.19 MS. NIELD: I think that's what the court said20 here. However, it's important to remember that the21 defendant has a burden to establish a constitutional22 violation. And further, the colloquy of the court and23 counsel was such that counsel said, look, these restraints24 make him look dangerous. And the court, by saying he's25 been convicted, said, well, he is dangerous.Page 401111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Now, if there were other objections to the restraints, for example, that he was unable to communicate with counsel because his hand was not free and he couldn't write notes or if the restraints were causing him pain or if the restraints, the way they were set up, were causing him to have difficulty facing the jury perhaps -­JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Nield, is -- is the State making a harmless error argument here? I really couldn't tell from your brief whether you're doing it or not. Are -- are -- is the State asserting that assuming it -­ assuming it was wrong, assuming it was a violation, this jury would have -- would have come out the same way anyway?MS. NIELD: That's right. That's true. JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that?MS. NIELD: First of all, again, the defense inmitigation was essentially that Mr. Deck is dangerous, but we ought to spare him the penalty of death because of his poor upbringing. And that defense in mitigation does not intersect or have any sort of nexus with any sort of presumptions that jurors might draw.JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what specific aggravating circumstances did they jury find? You say there are statutory aggravating circumstances in Missouri.MS. NIELD: That's correct.Page 411111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: And the jury found -- there are2 five.3 MS. NIELD: There were --4 JUSTICE SCALIA: And the jury found all five.5 MS. NIELD: Actually there were six -­6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Six.7 MS. NIELD: -- that were pled in this case and8 the jury found all six. And they are as follows. The9 murders were each committed while he was engaged in10 another homicide. He murdered each victim for the purpose11 of receiving money. Both murders involved depravity of12 mind. Each murder was committed for the purpose of13 avoiding lawful arrest. Each murder was committed while14 Mr. Deck was engaged in the perpetration of a burglary,15 and each murder was committed while Mr. Deck was engaged16 in the perpetration of robbery.17 So, again, none of these factors -- there's no18 nexus between these factors, which are really implicit in19 the guilt finding -- no nexus between these aggravating20 circumstances that render Mr. Deck death-eligible and any21 sort of dangerousness that the jurors might take away from22 the fact that he was restrained.23 Once you get past the death-eligibility hurdle24 with the aggravating circumstances, then comes the Eighth25 Amendment concerns about reliable and accurate sentencingPage 421111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425in the selection decision, the decision that's one of a moral nature of whether this person should be put to death. And on that front, again, restraining somebody who's twice been convicted of murder is not inaccurate, it is not unreliable, it's not misleading in any way.JUSTICE KENNEDY: So -- so it's never ground for reversal? I'm -- I'm wondering, in line with Justice Scalia's question, is -- is -- would the calculus be, well, this is not a close case and some other cases are closer? I mean, is that what we do?MS. NIELD: I think --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Your --your--I--Ithink first position at least would be that it's never prejudicial. But assume we don't agree with that.MS. NIELD: I think -­JUSTICE KENNEDY: How does harmless error work to -- to pursue Justice Scalia's line of questioning?MS. NIELD: I think in terms of harmless error, that would be our second position, but the first position here is that a constitutional violation has not been established.JUSTICE KENNEDY: I understand that.MS. NIELD: And where that's the case, you look at the totality.JUSTICE SCALIA: But answer his question. GivePage 431111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 him an example of where it -- it wouldn't be harmless2 error.3 MS. NIELD: Where it wouldn't?4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Assuming that it is a5 violation, what's an example of where it wouldn't be6 harmless error?7 MS. NIELD: An example of where it might not be8 harmless error is where the defendant's defense in9 mitigation is focused specifically on dangerousness or10 future dangerousness. For example, if the defense in11 mitigation is I committed these murders, but I'm very sick12 now, I'm feeble, I'm not going to pose any sort of threat13 to anybody inside or outside the prison walls, if the14 defense in mitigation relates to danger. Or, for example,15 if the defense in mitigation was that while incarcerated,16 the person had found religion and realized the error of17 his or her ways and was no longer inclined to do these18 things and felt remorse, that again might relate.19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or I suppose if future20 dangerousness was a specific aggravating factor under21 State law, as it is in Texas, for example -­22 MS. NIELD: Correct. That would make a23 difference.24 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- then -- then you would25 concede that if this was unlawful, the error clearly wouldPage 441111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 not be harmless.2 MS. NIELD: That could certainly make a3 difference there. That's correct.4 Or another example of where the defense in5 mitigation might intersect more with the dangerousness6 issue. In the Simmons line of cases, in one of the cases7 the defense was that the particular defendant had a8 proclivity for attacking elderly women and that was the9 nature of his crime. But in prison there were no elderly10 women, and so he would not pose a danger to anyone outside11 the prison walls if incarcerated for life, nor would he12 pose a danger to other prisoners because they were not13 elderly women.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the question here15 was, was he dangerous in the courtroom? Was he going to16 lash out at a witness or try to -­17 MS. NIELD: I think that's the question when the18 trial court looks at the restraints issue, but Mr. Deck is19 saying that this impaired the reliability of his20 sentencing under the Eighth Amendment. And there, we do21 look at these other kinds of issues. It's not whether he22 would be dangerous in the courtroom. That's the trial23 court decision at the front end under the Eighth24 Amendment, and when we look at reliability, is this25 something that is going to impel the jury to impose aPage 451111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 death sentence based upon whim or caprice or2 arbitrariness. And we would submit that it is not.3 Again, to restrain somebody who's convicted of4 killing not one, but two people, to do that does not send5 the jury irrevocably down the path of giving death. And6 that points up the prosecutor's argument in this case.7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If he -- if he were kept8 under these restraints, legirons and the -- what do they9 call it -- belly chain, day in and day out in prison,10 would that constitute cruel or unusual punishment?11 MS. NIELD: It could. It could. And it would12 depend upon the prison security. The difference being, in13 prison, he's already confined versus outside the prison14 walls. It -- it could present a problem. In one of the15 Spain cases, the -- the neck restraint was deemed to be16 cruel and unusual, and particularly if it's ongoing, if17 it's -- if it occurs for a lengthy period of time.18 But, of course, we don't have that here and we19 have not a prison context but a context of a local, rural20 courtroom where the trial judge has to make sure that the21 people in that courtroom, the personnel, the spectators,22 the jurors, that they are safe. And we would submit that23 under the facts of this case, that that trial court's24 decision was not unreasonable.25 The Missouri Supreme Court was correct in itsPage 461111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425analysis and it should be affirmed.JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Ms. Nield.Ms. Percival, you have about 4 and a half minutes left.REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROSEMARY E.

PERCIVAL: Yes, Your Honor.This constitutional violation was not harmless for a number of reasons.For one, character was the key consideration in the jury's analysis of whether this person should live or die. The court is saying that even 7 years after this crime occurred, that Carman Deck is so dangerous that he needs to be in both belly chain and legirons to keep the￼courtroom that he's dangeroussafe, to keep him there.

PERCIVAL: Yes, I am, Your Honor. And that's because there's -- that is the -- just the firstPage 471111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 step of the Missouri procedure. The jury then goes to2 step two, by which they look at both statutory aggravators3 and nonstatutory aggravators to decide whether death is4 warranted. At step three, they then weigh the mitigation5 against the aggravation.6 The Missouri Supreme Court itself in the first7 appeal stated that Deck had presented substantial8 mitigation about his horribly abusive childhood.9 And it's not accurate that the defense was only10 related to his -- his childhood. In closing arguments,11 defense counsel repeatedly argued that Deck deserved to be12 in prison because of what he had done, but that he would13 be safe in prison. There would be no risk that he would14 hurt anybody else. So that was part of the defense15 strategy.161718 the first 1920 argument at this trial.21 These restraints were visible throughout the22 trial. There were 15 recesses, at which time Deck would23 have had to stand up when both the jurors leave the court24 and come back in.25 The shackles dehumanized Deck and it degradedPage 481111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼These restraints were -­JUSTICE SCALIA: That was at this trial or at trial, that -­MS.
