Indiana.          Mr. Friedman.           ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD D. FRIEDMAN               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. FRIEDMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          The Court can decide these cases, as itdecided Crawford without testing the outer bounds ofthe Confrontation Clause, by adopting a simpleproposition that is easily understood by andintuitively sensible to ordinary lay people and socapable of being passed on from generation togeneration as one of the cornerstones of ourfundamental liberties.          A criminal conviction cannot be based on anaccusation made privately to a known law enforcementofficer.  If a State wishes that such an accusationbe presented in support of a conviction, then it mustensure that the accuser testifies in the manner longrequired by the common law system of criminal justice,in the presence of the accused, under oath, and subjectto cross examination.31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          As in Crawford, the Court does not need tooffer a comprehensive definition of the termtestimonial.  It is enough to say that an accusation toa known law enforcement officer must be testimonialunder any plausible definition.          JUSTICE BREYER:  When, for example, there'san undercover agent, a law enforcement officer -- let'sthink of the mafia or the Ku Klux Klan reveals himself. One of the co-conspirators during the ongoingconspiracy switches sides.  But no.  He doesn't switch. He's still in the conspiracy.  Makes a whole lot ofstatements.  Those are all inadmissible, though they'dcome in now because they would be in the furtherance ofthe conspiracy.          MR. FRIEDMAN:  Statements in furtherance of aconspiracy, if I understand --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  There -- but there's-- in other words, I've got your definition and allI've tried to do is create a circumstance where, whileit fits your definition, it's made by a person that isin the conspiracy.  So I make him undercover, the lawenforcement officer.          MR. FRIEDMAN:  If it's an undercover lawenforcement --JUSTICE BREYER: But known. 41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. FRIEDMAN:  By -- by known, I mean to thedeclarant.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.          MR. FRIEDMAN:  By known, I mean to thedeclarant.  So if it's --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.          MR. FRIEDMAN:  -- if it's an undercover agentand so it's a statement to an undercover --          JUSTICE BREYER:  So you're saying myhypothetical could never come up.  What I'm trying todo is -- it seems to me that your hypothetical is goingto take statements that would come in that are prettyfar removed from the prosecution that are in oddcircumstances, are not just a testimonial at all inanybody's thought, but it keeps them out.          MR. FRIEDMAN:  I -- I'm afraid I -- I don'tfully understand the hypothetical.  If the -- if theofficer is not known to the declarant as a lawenforcement officer, then there's no problem.  Then --then the statement could --          JUSTICE BREYER:  He's known.          MR. FRIEDMAN:  If he's -- he's known to thelaw enforcement officer and the member of theconspiracy is making a --JUSTICE BREYER: It's continuing. 51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. FRIEDMAN: It's a continuing conspiracy,2 but -- but that statement to the law enforcement3 officer saying that somebody else in the conspiracy has4 committed a crime, would not, in fact, be in5 furtherance of the conspiracy. It would blow the6 conspiracy apart.78 me I have 910 1112 Your Honor, I feel duty-bound to say there are no bad13 hypotheticals, but there are -- there are easy ones,14 and I think if -- if it's a known officer -- it's -- in15 that situation, it's going to be accusatorial. If it's16 not a known officer, it's -- it's not accusatorial --17 JUSTICE ALITO: What if a statement is made18 to a known law enforcement officer providing19 information that's -- that's very incriminating against20 somebody, but it doesn't specifically identify that21 person? Does that fall within your test?22 MR. FRIEDMAN: I -- I believe it does. Of23 course, in this case we have both, a description of the24 crime and an identification of the perpetrator.25 JUSTICE ALITO: So it's an accusation even61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  You've convinceda bad hypothetical.(Laughter.)JUSTICE BREYER:  You go ahead.MR. FRIEDMAN:  I -- I don't think it's --￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425though it doesn't identify the person who is alleged tobe the perpetrator?          MR. FRIEDMAN:  We could call it what we will. I think -- I think that it still would be within thenarrow proposition that we're advocating that a -- thata description of the crime to a known --          JUSTICE ALITO:  So really, your test is anyevidence that's -- any statement made to the police or-- is an -- is testimony.          MR. FRIEDMAN:  No, Your Honor.  I think it --it either has to describe a crime or identify theperpetrator or, as in this case, do both.  So --          JUSTICE ALITO:  Any relevant evidence givento law enforcement is testimonial.          MR. FRIEDMAN:  Well, when you say -- when yousay relevant, I think that if the law enforcementofficer -- if -- if it's a statement to a known lawenforcement officer in the line of duty, it's -- it'salmost always going to be testimonial.  If it -- if itidentifies the -- the perpetrator or describes thecrime, I would say it's clearly testimonial, or if it'sin response to the -- to the officer's inquiries, it'sclearly --          JUSTICE ALITO:  If somebody calls and says, Ijust saw a blue Toyota with Ohio plates commit a hit71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 and run, that's testimonial?2 MR. FRIEDMAN: I believe -- I believe so.3 Now -- now, in fact, that would provide some4 identifying information because it is a person who is5 associated with that blue -- with that blue Toyota.6 But if it's simply a officer in the donut shop, I just7 saw Jack, he's back in town, with no clear relation to8 any -- any crime, that's presumably just chatter and9 that wouldn't be testimonial even if it -- even if it10 later becomes relevant.11 JUSTICE ALITO: But if it's relevant that12 Jack is back in town, then that's testimonial.13 MR. FRIEDMAN: If -- if at the moment that14 it's made, the declarant understands that Jack being15 back in town might be useful in an investigation, or if16 a reasonable person in the position of the declarant17 would understand it, that would be testimonial. Yes.18 Yes, Your Honor.19 So the -- the basic principle for which we're20 advocating does not lie at the -- outside of the -- of21 the definition of testimonial. I think it's simply a22 core proposition.23 JUSTICE ALITO: And the people who are making24 all these statements are -- are to be understood as25 witnesses against somebody within the -- the language81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 of the Confrontation Clause?2 MR. FRIEDMAN: I think within the -- within3 the meaning of the Confrontation Clause, if those4 statements are allowed at proof -- as proof at trial5 without the person coming in, then what we have6 essentially done is created a system by which people7 can create evidence for use by the legal system, by8 engaging those statements without coming into court.9 That's -- that's right.10 And so I think one of the critical factors11 here is to imagine what happens if statements, such as12 the ones in -- in this case, are admitted -- are13 admissible, and this Court holds -- holds that they14 are, then basically they always can be admitted. Then15 any State is free to create a system in which a16 statement to a responding officer comes in as proof.17 There's no need for the -- for the -- the declarant to18 show up at trial, and there's no doubt that -- that19 that is what would happen. California and Oregon have20 already adopted such statutes, and -- and my State of21 Michigan is on the verge of doing so.22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Statutes that -- that say23 what?24 MR. FRIEDMAN: That say -- that say25 accusations to a -- made to a law enforcement officer,91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 in the case of Oregon and the pending Michigan bill,2 accusations of domestic violence are admissible so long3 as they are made reasonably freshly -- but they give a4 24-hour time frame -- they -- they are admissible. No5 need for excitement. So -- so the idea that -- that6 the jurisdictions have limited this to -- to excited7 utterances is -- is not -- is not so. If -- if the8 Court affirms the decision here, I think the message9 would go out that these -- that these statutes are10 perfectly okay.11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And those -- those --12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and what -- what is13 the theory on which the statutes are -- are adopted?14 MR. FRIEDMAN: The --15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's the argument that16 they propose to say it's not testimonial? I know you17 disagree with it, but --18 MR. FRIEDMAN: Justice Kennedy, the -- I19 don't think there is a theory. And I say that quite20 seriously. I -- I actually testified last month before21 the Michigan House on the -- the bill saying I believe22 this bill is blatantly unconstitutional. I believe23 it's going to be held unconstitutional within a few24 months. There was not a high level of interest in the25 constitutional argument before the legislature. I101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 don't think there is a theory. I think the -- I think2 the theory is that prosecutors say that these would be3 good laws to pass. So --4 JUSTICE BREYER: What's -- what's worrying me5 on this is -- I'll tell you my concern without the6 hypothetical. Crawford wrenches the Confrontation7 Clause free of the hearsay rule, and therefore,8 testimony -- it might be testimonial even though it is9 not hearsay or falls within an -- doesn't fall within10 an exception. You understand what I'm saying. Fine.11 Now, you come along with a suggestion, and12 what struck me immediately was that, wait a minute,13 can't I easily think -- apparently not easily -- can't14 I easily think of instances where it would be15 testimonial but it isn't an accusation made to a16 policeman. And conversely, can't I easily think -- not17 easily -- of instances where, well, it would have come18 in, but it was statements made to a policeman maybe19 years before, maybe about this, maybe about that?20 Maybe it's a hospital record. Maybe it's a business21 record. There are all kinds of exceptions to the22 hearsay rule, and they don't run parallel to the test23 you've just given. That's what's worrying me. What's24 the test?25MR. FRIEDMAN: Your Honor, let -- let me be 111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 very clear. We do not propose that this categorical2 principle that an accusation to a law enforcement3 officer is a definition of what's testimonial. We4 regard this as a core category of testimonial5 statements such as the core categories that the Court6 listed in Crawford. So -- so if a statement fits7 within that -- within that category, that is sufficient8 to make it testimonial.9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Such as in Crawford, but10 in Crawford, it was the kind of formal statement, the11 Court said, materials such as affidavits, custodial12 examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was13 unable to cross examine, or similar pretrial14 statements. Similar pretrial statement is not an15 agitated woman calling 911 or telling a police officer16 who -- as in your case, who comes in response to a17 call, there's a disturbance going on in that house, get18 there.19 MR. FRIEDMAN: Right. I -- I understand,20 Justice Ginsburg. Of course, Crawford was only listing21 a non-exclusive list of -- of core -- of core22 categories.23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. We -- we -- that --24 that quotation was a -- a description of what Crawford25 described as the core.121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. FRIEDMAN: Right.2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not the totality of3 --4 MR. FRIEDMAN: Certainly not the totality,5 and if you say, well, this statement was informal, it6 -- it doesn't make sense and I think it conflicts with7 a comment in Crawford in footnote 3 to say, well,8 informal testimony is -- is okay, as the Court said in9 -- in Crawford. If -- if sworn out-of-court testimony10 is invalid, it wouldn't make sense to say that11 testimonial statements are perfectly okay.12 Now, so far as the principle that --13 because the witness is under agitation, the --14 Confrontation Clause doesn't -- doesn't apply,15 think that's -- that's valid at -- at all. It16 certainly isn't valid historically. If -- if it were,17 we would have seen examples over history in which18 agitated declarants -- their statements came in. But19 as -- as General Dreeben has indicated, the very -- the20 very organizing principle of prosecution was that the21 accuser must come and -- come and testify.22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the legislatures that23 have passed laws of the kind you describe have before24 them information that there is a rather high incidence25 of the victim being intimidated and therefore not131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-unswornthattheI don't￼1 showing up in court to testify?2 MR. FRIEDMAN: Your -- Your Honor, in the --3 in the Old Bailey sessions papers there were4 approximately 2 percent of the cases, the victim who5 was the prosecutor did not show up. It was a recurring6 -- a recurring matter. Why they didn't show up may7 have been for various reasons. And I want to emphasize8 that the State in the very first paragraph of its brief9 emphasizes that there are numerous reasons why, in the10 domestic violence context, the -- the accuser may not11 testify in court. And in those roughly 2 percent of12 all the cases, which is 2,000 cases, in not a single13 one -- well, I'm sorry. There was one in which there14 was a -- a conviction. That's because -- because the15 defendant -- because the defendant confessed. But in16 all the others, the accusation was -- the -- the case17 was summarily dismissed.18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you -- you have to19 assume not only that the victim is unwilling or20 reluctant to testify, you have to assume that the21 victim has disappeared because the victim, unwilling or22 not, could be subpoenaed. Isn't that right?23 MR. FRIEDMAN: The -- the victim could be24 subpoenaed, and in -- in this case, as in Davis, the25 victim was subpoenaed, but subpoenas have to be141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 enforced. And -- and I think in some cases the2 prosecution does -- simply doesn't enforce the3 subpoenas. It's what the Cook County --4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right, but I'm saying the scope5 of the problem is -- is much more narrow than what is6 suggested by simply describing how often it is that the7 -- that the complaining witness is reluctant to8 testify. That doesn't stop anything.9 MR. FRIEDMAN: Well --10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Reluctant or not, that11 witness can be -- can be subpoenaed.12 MR. FRIEDMAN: That is -- that is correct,13 Justice Scalia. It is the State's choice whether to14 compel the -- the person to -- to testify, and if, as15 Cook County has done, they put in particular efforts to16 protect the witness, to encourage her to testify, then17 prosecutors get a very high return. That is, in -- in18 the Cook County program, 80 percent of -- of the19 witnesses testify. They get a very high conviction20 rate, and they protect the -- the witnesses.21 So I think the message from this Court is22 going to be one of two things. Either it's okay to23 adopt a California/Oregon type of statute and just --24 just let any statements come -- come in, or we have to25 put in the resources to -- to -- into domestic violence151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 to ensure that the witnesses come -- come to court.2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't know why the or3 would necessarily follow. I mean, if you prevail,4 there's nothing that compels the State to put money in5 what has been suggested, a training program, shelters,6 counselors for these people.7 MR. FRIEDMAN: They --8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Nothing at all compels the9 State to do that.1011 compelled12 compelled13 simply be14 evidence-based prosecution, which has just been a15 phenomenon of the last 14 years.1617 that that 181920 of course 2122 correct. 2324 their cases.25 MR. FRIEDMAN: That161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-MR. FRIEDMAN:  They -- they would not beto do that, but -- they would not beconstitutionally to do that.  They woulddeprived of a -- of -- of the so-calledJUSTICE SCALIA:  Your point, I thought, waswould be the incentive for --MR. FRIEDMAN:  ThatJUSTICE SCALIA:  ----MR. FRIEDMAN:  That-- that --for police departments,JUSTICE SCALIA:  ---- that -- that isif they want to makeis correct.  They -- they￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425would -- they want to make their cases, and -- and Ithink they can make their cases best if the witnesstestifies, in which case, under the ConfrontationClause now -- now construed, there's no objection thento bringing in the prior statement at all.          JUSTICE BREYER:  What about present senseperceptions?  That might be a good one.          MR. FRIEDMAN:  And -- and --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Apparently 803(1) has thefirst exception --          MR. FRIEDMAN:  Right.          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- to the hearsay rule.It's present sense impression.          MR. FRIEDMAN:  Yes.          JUSTICE BREYER:  So on the phone, somebody isdescribing very calmly -- very calmly to the policemanthe terrible crime that he sees going on in front ofhim.  Now, I gather from the fact that it's an -- thatit is a exception, that now in the Federal courts thatwould be admissible.          MR. FRIEDMAN:  Well, it would have been underRoberts presumably.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  No.  Forget the --yes.  Every day of the week, they come in.  Is thatright? Present sense impressions.  It's here as the171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425first exception to the hearsay rule.          MR. FRIEDMAN:  It's -- it's an exception.  Incivil cases, there's no problem.  In -- in criminalcases --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, there it is, 803(1).          MR. FRIEDMAN:  That's right.          JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, and you practicedthis for years.  See.  I mean, you're an expert inthis, and I -- I think my impression -- just tell me ifI'm wrong -- is it's 803(1).  It says a present senseimpression comes in.  So I guess it does unless I'm --          MR. FRIEDMAN:  Yes, but until -- until Whitev. Illinois basically let the guard down, these --these statements could not come -- accusatorystatements that might have been in present senseimpressions did not -- were -- were not the basis forprosecutions.  Once -- once White v. Illinois wasdecided, then -- then courts allowed them in routinely.          JUSTICE BREYER:  So if we adopt your rule, aperson calls up on the phone and says, I'm here at thebaseball game, there's a terrible crime going on infront of me, and he describes it --          MR. FRIEDMAN:  Right.          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- to the police officer,that no longer could come in.181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. FRIEDMAN: I -- I believe that is correct2 because that --3 JUSTICE SCALIA: I should hope not. I mean4 --5 MR. FRIEDMAN: It -- it shouldn't. It's an6 accusatory -- it's an accusatory statement to -- to a7 -- a -- to law enforcement.8 Now, I mean, the Court could, if it wanted,9 carve out or -- or draw the line at statements that are10 describing the contemporaneous -- the absolutely11 contemporaneous commission of a crime. I don't think12 it's a particularly good line to draw.13141516 of -- 171819 the facts20 what I was asking.21 MR. FRIEDMAN: The -- the rule is that the22 hearsay law -- the rule against hearsay provides -- the23 modern rule against hearsay provides no -- no24 restriction. The Confrontation Clause should.25 And let me address the -- your concern,191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  I wasn't --MR. FRIEDMAN:  Yes.JUSTICE BREYER:  -- trying to reduct you outMR. FRIEDMAN:  Right.JUSTICE BREYER:  I just wanted to know whatare about the rule.  I was just -- that's￼1 Justice Breyer, that is this hearsay rather than --2 than confrontation. I think -- I think that the notion3 of the accuser is central to the confrontation right4 and always -- and always has been, and those 2,0005 cases really develop. As of 1791, the rule against6 hearsay was barely developed, and we cite -- or the7 -- the rule against hearsay was barely developed and8 Edmund Burke said that a trained parrot could recite9 all the laws of evidence in 5 minutes, and that is no10 longer -- that is no longer so.11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Edmund Burke say that?12 MR. FRIEDMAN: Edmund Burke said that, yes.13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Friedman, can I go14 back to your answer that the police will then -- in15 response to the position that you're urging, will then16 protect the victim and all these fine things? It17 wasn't so long ago that the police wouldn't bother with18 these prosecutions at all. They didn't care about19 them. And if you say you're going to have to drag in20 the victim, you're going to have to jail her for21 contempt if she's so scared that she won't testify,22 they'll say, who needs it. We've got a lot of other23 crimes to prosecute.24 MR. FRIEDMAN: Well, I -- I hope not, Your25 Honor, and I -- I believe that we've gotten past the201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 point. I mean, I think we now recognize how serious a2 -- a crime domestic violence is.3 Let me emphasize that it is just as now4 sometimes a prosecutor will compel a victim to5 testify. It will still be that sometimes they will and6 sometimes they won't. That will be a matter of -- of7 State policy. There are other approaches as -- as8 well. And -- and hopefully, compulsion isn't9 necessary, I think, if the prosecutors pay -- pay10 sufficient attention and -- and care, but beyond that,11 there's the possibility of forfeiture. If, indeed, the12 reason why the victim will not testify is because of13 intimidation, then -- then the prosecution -- it is14 open to the prosecution to prove that. In many cases,15 the case can be proven --16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's very powerfully17 hard to prove, isn't it?18 MR. FRIEDMAN: I don't think so, Your Honor.19 And -- and, of course, it remains to be seen20 easy or how hard it -- it is to -- to prove.21 fact, the -- as Mr. Fisher said, the rules of22 don't apply at the -- at the preliminary hearing. It's23 the judge, not the -- the jury that has to decide. And24 the standard of proof presumably would not be beyond a25 reasonable doubt. So --211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-just howBut, inevidence￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you are back --2 as Justice Breyer pointed earlier, you're making the3 prosecution prove two crimes instead of one.4 MR. FRIEDMAN: Well, intimidation is -- is a5 crime, but it wouldn't -- it wouldn't be a full6 criminal case. It would, as in many other contexts,7 simply a preliminary hearing on -- on a threshold8 issue. As we have for every evidentiary problem, for9 every -- for any -- any evidentiary problem, such as10 does the present sense impression exception apply,11 there's a preliminary --12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but every13 evidentiary problem, the -- the root of the problem is14 not the inability of the -- or the unwillingness of the15 primary victim to testify. I mean, that's what makes16 intimidation so hard to prove in these cases is because17 you have to get the -- if -- if the intimidation is18 successful, the witness to testify about the -- the19 crime is unavailable and unwilling to do so.20 MR. FRIEDMAN: Well, it -- it would remain21 for the Court to determine what the standards are for22 proving --23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you wouldn't have to24 prove beyond a reasonable doubt, would you?25 MR. FRIEDMAN: I -- I wouldn't --221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: This is -- this2 is a pretrial hearing on whether the -- the -- there's3 been intimidation. Couldn't the judge just find it4 more likely than not that the defendant has intimidated5 a witness?6 MR. FRIEDMAN:7 suggest that that would8 standard. It may be --9 CHIEF JUSTICE Prior decisions of the Courtmost likely be the -- theROBERTS:  But the -- the judgeif the witness doesn't testify,10 can't make that finding11 can he?12 MR. FRIEDMAN:13 judge may well, and I think it would remain --14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How's that? The15 prosecutor goes in and says, we think the defendant has16 intimidated the witness by saying he's not going to17 support her financially, he's going to leave, whatever,18 and -- and the -- presumably the -- the defendant says19 no -- no, and the witness isn't there. The judge says,20 well, I find by a preponderance of the evidence that he21 has intimidated her?22 MR. FRIEDMAN: I think it remains an open23 question what the standards would be for -- for proof24 and whether that would be constitutionally accepted.25 This, of course, is a matter for -- for another day.231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-Oh, I think that -- that the￼1 I think what the Court can't do is2 effectively assume as a -- or create an irrebuttable3 presumption that in all domestic violence cases, the --4 the victim has been intimidated, which is what the5 State asks, even though they acknowledge at the very6 outset that there are many other reasons why -- why the7 victim may not testify. The -- there's no domestic8 violence exception for the confrontation right, just as9 there's no organized crime exception for the10 confrontation right.11 So I do think that -- that what the12 procedures are for forfeiture is -- is a big open13 question. But -- but it's the State's burden to prove14 forfeiture. It -- it can't be assumed as a per se15 matter.16 JUSTICE BREYER: Do you have a second choice17 rule? I mean, we have Professor Amar, who has pretty18 formal criteria.19 MR. FRIEDMAN: Yes.20 JUSTICE BREYER: We have the rule that you21 just enunciated, and I don't want, before you sit down,22 to -- I want to find out if you have an intermediate23 position, a fall-back position.24 MR. FRIEDMAN: Well, our -- our narrow rule25 is -- is simply the -- an accusation to a law241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 enforcement officer. We -- we, of course, believe that2 the more general test is reasonable expectation of the3 declarant and that's where -- where I disagree with --4 with Professor Amar. I don't know that he would -- I5 don't know that he would disagree. I'd be surprised if6 he would disagree that an accusation to a law7 enforcement officer is -- is testimonial because --8 because that is such a -- a narrow principle. Now --9 now, he does speak about -- about formality, but10 formality, for reasons I suggested, I don't think -- I11 don't think makes an awful lot of sense because it then12 gives the police officers and prosecutors an incentive13 to take testimony informally.14 And what we have then, as in this case, we15 have not the affidavit, which -- which the State is16 condemning as admissible. They now concede that that's17 inadmissible. The evidence on which this prosecution18 is based is a police officer's rendition of what he was19 told orally, which is a denigrated form of -- form of20 evidence. That's where a formality rule will -- will21 get you.22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where -- where do you23 come out on the person running out of the house and24 yelling to her neighbor with the law enforcement25 officer standing by?251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. FRIEDMAN:  And -- and --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's not -- thestatement is not to the law enforcement officer, but heor she overhears it.          MR. FRIEDMAN:  If -- if the -- if the speakerknows that the law enforcement officer is there --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Doesn't.          MR. FRIEDMAN:  -- then -- then I -- then --then it's not within the narrow categorical rule for whichwe're -- we're asking now.  It may come within thegeneral test of reasonable expectation.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is anybody -- isanybody working for the State a law enforcementofficer?          MR. FRIEDMAN:  No, not -- not within the --within the narrow categorical rule that we're asking.I think it's another question if, say, you're speakingto a -- a doctor who's an employee of the Statehospital --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Or a 911 operator who was anagent of -- of the police.          MR. FRIEDMAN:  A 911 operator is a directconduit to the police, and the police are a directconduit to the court.And -- and that addresses your hypothetical, 261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 Justice Scalia, about the -- the affidavit right to the2 court. The person writes an affidavit right to the3 court. Under -- under the theory presented by the4 State under the resemblance theory -- let's take away5 the -- the sworn part of the affidavit. It's just a6 letter or -- or a message over the Internet or a7 videotape. All of those would be allowed because8 there's no formality, because there's no interrogation,9 and that's a grotesque result --10 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure what -- what11 sense it makes. Two cases. The woman runs out and --12 and says, he -- he stabbed me and I'm dying, he's a13 murderer. Case one, it's a -- a neighbor. Case two,14 it's a police officer and she sees that he's a police15 officer. Why -- why should there be a difference? It16 doesn't make any sense to me.17 MR. FRIEDMAN: Well, I'm -- I'm not saying18 there necessarily should be a difference. I think -- I19 think in the --20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I thought your test21 was if she knows that he's a police officer, it's22 testimonial.23 MR. FRIEDMAN: We're saying that is an easy24 case. That's what Professor Mosteller called a dead25 bang case where it's made to a police officer.271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, let me put it thisway.  I don't know why one case is so easier than theother.          MR. FRIEDMAN:  I think it's an easier casebecause the police officer is a direct conduit to the-- to the machinery of -- of justice.  When you'respeaking to a police officer, you know you're speakingto the State.          If the Court has no further questions, I'llreserve the balance of my time.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.          Mr. Fisher.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. FISHER               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MR. FISHER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          Amy Hammon's oral statements to OfficerMooney arose in an emergency situation very similar toa 911 call, not in a situation where a detective wasattempting to subvert the judicial system by developingevidence in secret with no intention of ever lettingthe witness testify at trial.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  She's sitting down at -- ata table, as I recall it, with the -- with the policeofficer on the other side of the table.281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. FISHER:  She may -- yes, I think.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Has a cup of coffee.          MR. FISHER:  Well, I don't know about that.She was in the living room.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought there was a cup ofcoffee, too.  Maybe -- I don't know where I got thatfrom.  Maybe I made it up.          MR. FISHER:  Well, what we know is that the--          JUSTICE SCALIA:  It didn't seem to me aterribly emergency situation in -- in that kind of acontext.          MR. FISHER:  I respectfully disagree, YourHonor.  We're talking about a woman who has -- hasstated that she has suffered a beating from herhusband, that -- a beating that may flare up at anytime if the officers withdraw, and the officer needs toknow what happened so that he can properly address thesituation.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  At the time, the officer isright there in the house.  There's certainly noemergency at the time.  Now, you could say thatthe woman is frightened about a recurrence, butif that's your definition of an emergency, it'sto cover an awful lot of situations.29-- thatif --goingWashington, DC 200051111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  1-￼1 MR. FISHER: Well, I think it's -- the -- the2 moment to consider is not just the moment when the3 officers are present, but in fact, what would happen if4 the officers were to do nothing, which is one of the5 choices that, I suppose, the officers had. They could6 find out what was going on and address the situation,7 or they could withdraw, doing nothing, and then leave8 Amy Hammon to her own devices in a highly explosive9 situation.10 They -- we don't know exactly what -- what11 Officer Mooney said when he went back into the living12 room, but what we know is that there was no apparent13 interrogation of any type. We know that Amy Hammon at14 that point told him the story of the argument that had15 taken place and the resulting physical abuse.16 Now, what we know from -- from the accusation17 test that is put forth by -- by the petitioner is18 that the reason that it doesn't apply apparently to all19 statements to -- to police officers is that it must20 somehow take account of the co-conspirator statement.21 But we don't otherwise have any grounding of that test22 in the history of the Confrontation Clause.23 The test that we are proposing, the broader24 test that we are proposing, the resemblance test, flows25 directly from statements in Crawford suggesting301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that the way that we know what is testimonial and what2 is not is by examining the lessons of history. What3 we're proposing is that in any particular context, if4 the statement resembles one of those historical abuses5 in the civil law tradition, then in that circumstance6 it's testimonial. But if the --7 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't -- isn't the problem,8 though -- I mean, as Crawford said, those examples9 defined the core. They were the paradigms, but they10 didn't purport to cover the whole ground. And it seems11 to me that your argument is to turn the core into the12 exclusive13 Clause in1415 important16 the methodology, and the methodology was let's look at17 history. What does history tell us the Founders were18 concerned about? And the Court listed the specific19 examples of affidavits, depositions, pretrial hearings,20 and -- and expanded that even to include interrogation.21 And in -- excuse me -- particular cases coming --examples, in which case the Confrontation the real world is never going to apply.MR. FISHER: Your Honor, I think thelesson from Crawford in that regard is -- is22 coming up, if there is evidence that -- that the23 statements do correspond to historical abuses, even if24 those abuses were not listed in Crawford, then that25 would be a different situation. That would be testimonial.311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'm not sure that that2 was the only concern of the Founders, I mean, the --3 the -- you know, the -- the fact that -- that the State4 could corrupt the -- the statement through the5 interrogation. I'm not sure that was the only concern.6 I -- I think the Founders believed in a judicial7 system, at least in criminal cases, where the person8 has a right to cross examine his accuser. Whether the9 fact that the -- I am -- I'll put it this way.10 I am quite sure that it would have been held11 a violation of the Confrontation Clause if, as the12 prior example I gave, someone wrote out an affidavit13 and sent it directly to the court, no intervening14 police interrogation at all, just wrote out an15 affidavit from -- from France, mailed it to the court,16 and the court has this affidavit. I am sure that would17 be a smack-bang violation of the Confrontation Clause.18 And there's none of the -- the abuse that -- on -- on19 which you -- you would hinge the entirety of the20 violation.21 MR. FISHER: Well, except that we do know22 that -- that affidavits, I agree, would have been23 prohibited, and that's one of the classic forms of24 testimony, indeed, that was enumerated in Crawford and25 that was kept out at the founding. And that falls into321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 a very well-defined category.2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But one of the reasons for3 that is -- let's assume you had a completely honest4 police officer. You may have a motive on the part of5 the witness to frame the defendant. I mean, that's6 another reason.7 MR. FISHER: Well, I think it ostensibly8 could be. I think what we know, though, looking back9 at what -- at the -- at the Raleigh trial and at -- at10 the -- at the trials even in the colonial period, was11 that the Founders were concerned about abuses by the12 State, in -- in particular, in interrogations and in13 eliciting these affidavits and in using pretrial14 testimony.15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I'm suggesting to you16 that it often happens that there are false charges made17 that the -- that the police believe to be true.18 MR. FISHER: The false charges scenario is --19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And this is fully20 consistent with prohibiting testimonial statements.21 MR. FISHER: Again, I think what Crawford was22 talking about, in terms of trying to understand the23 Confrontation Clause, was not simply to hypothesize24 various problems that different types of evidence could25 present if it weren't cross examined, but instead to331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425examine more particularly what the Founders wereconcerned about.  And that was not one of the -- of thecategories simply --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask this, Mr. Fisher? What is your answer to Justice Scalia's hypothetical,an entirely volunteered affidavit by the accuser?  Isthat admissible or not?          MR. FISHER:  I think that -- well, certainlyit's testimonial, and so --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  So that would be prohibitedby the Confrontation Clause.  Yet, that was clearly notan example that would fall within the Marian practice.          MR. FISHER:  Well, whether it would have comein --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  I mean, it doesn't resembleit is what I'm saying.          MR. FISHER:  Whether it would have been aproblem under the Marian practice I think is only partof the story.  And certainly Crawford recognized thataffidavits as a category were part of the -- of thetraditionconcernedstory butthat led to the abuses that the Founders wereabout.  So Marian is, again, part of thenot necessarily the whole thing.Now, when we articulate this resemblance --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Before you leave that,341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 surely the affidavit isn't -- isn't what's magical. I2 mean, I'm going to change my hypothetical. The person3 recites his accusation on a tape recorder and mails the4 tape to the court. Now, are you going to say, well,5 it's not an affidavit? You'd exclude that as well,6 wouldn't you?7 MR. FISHER: Well, I -- I don't know that I8 would because, again, you've got the -- you've got the9 form that Crawford was concerned about. The affidavit10 is the classic form.11 JUSTICE SCALIA: That would make no sense at12 all. I mean, that -- that is just the worst sort of13 formalism. If you do it in an affidavit, it's -- it's14 bad, but if you put it on a tape, it's -- it's good. I15 -- I cannot understand any reason for that.16 MR. FISHER: Well, I don't know that the17 analysis has to end there. I think, for example, there18 were other circumstances where other types of19 communications were problematic. In -- in Raleigh's20 trial, for example, Cobham had submitted a letter, and21 that was recited as part of the -- the concern. Now,22 if the Court were to determine that a recording of that23 sort was similar enough, it resembled enough that sort24 of abuse, then yes, it could be testimonial.25 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Fisher, let me again be351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 sure I understand your position. Would the unsworn2 letter that Justice Scalia describes be admissible or3 inadmissible under your view?4 MR. FISHER: I think that there is evidence5 historically that a letter would be testimonial,6 certainly coming out of Cobham's case and -- and other7 circumstances.8 JUSTICE STEVENS: So then you don't rely on9 the affidavit point.10 MR. FISHER: Well, I think it's -- it's a11 matter of what -- what is covered, what is mentioned in12 history. Affidavit is one of those -- those13 categories. Letters, in particular, in Raleigh's trial14 was another area that may have been problematic. And I15 think --16 JUSTICE SOUTER: If that's your criterion,17 are you going to draw the distinction between the18 letter and the tape recording?19 MR. FISHER: Well, I think that that is the20 -- whether we have the resemblance test doesn't require21 us to answer that question because I think that the22 examination the Court would undertake would again --23 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let's answer it. Is24 -- is the tape recording like the letter so that it --25 it's inadmissible?361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. FISHER:  I think it's -- I think it isvery similar to the letter and -- and could well beinadmissible, but I don't know that it's -- if theCourt adheres to the test that it set forth inCrawford, that it's looking for forms of testimony thatwere prohibited at common law, certainly that would nothave been one of them.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  A videotape -- avideotape of a crime scene is admissible.  Right?          MR. FISHER:  I think that's -- that's right. Now, if it's -- if you have a videotape of someonethat -- that's responding to an interrogation, that'san entirely different thing.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.          MR. FISHER:  But a videotape of a crime sceneagain would be -- would be not testimonial.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But a tape recordingby the same person who videotaped the crime scene,describing what he saw, you agree would be excluded.          MR. FISHER:  I think that there's a highchance that could be -- be excluded.          JUSTICE BREYER:  So what's the test?          MR. FISHER:  It's the resemblance test, andthe question --JUSTICE BREYER: Resemblance to? 371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. FISHER:  To the historical abuses thatthe Founders were trying to address.  And the --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Which were?          MR. FISHER:  Well, which were in particular,we know, affidavits.  We also know something aboutletters, and the question with the tape recording is,is it enough like, does it resemble those enough?          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you accept theGovernment's --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  I think the problem withthe examples is that none of these are abuses.  As Isee it, the examples of the tape recording mailed inand the volunteer statement, I don't see how you cancall those abuses.          MR. FISHER:  Well, I think the abuse comesnot simply in how they were created, but -- but then inhow they were later used.  And -- and again, we'retalking about trying to -- to craft a rule in part thathas some bright lines to it based on -- on just whatwas -- what forms were not used --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why isn't the -- thebright line that the Government asserts that this is acrime made in an urgent situation, when one doesn't --the declarant doesn't think rationally will this beused eventually in a trial, where the declarant wants381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 to stop an imminent threat?2 MR. FISHER: I certainly think that that3 follows from the -- the overall test we propose.4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's a different5 test than the resemblance test that you're proposing.6 MR. FISHER: Our position is it's a corollary7 to it. And certainly it's a narrower test and applies,8 I think, here in -- in both cases to that, and it9 provides the opportunity resolve both cases on the10 notion that when the officers were at the scene, they11 were in no way behaving like inquisitors. They showed12 up. They were -- they could -- they were in the middle13 of -- of an abusive situation that could explode at any14 time, and they needed to know what -- what was going on15 in order to diffuse the situation. So this case could16 be resolved on that -- on a much narrower ground.17 It's -- it's important here also to -- to18 recognize that what the -- what the prosecution did has19 no -- no similarity to what would happen at the common20 law. We have here the government issuing a subpoena to21 Amy Hammon to come and testify and, obviously, showing22 that they would have preferred the live testimony in23 this case.24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there -- was there any25 showing at all of whether they made the police -- or391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the prosecutor made any effort to enforce the subpoena?          MR. FISHER:  There was no such effort, YourHonor.  But, well, here, if I may be permitted to gobeyond the record just a little bit, what we -- what wedo know is that the case was continued one time becauseAmy Hammon did not show up in response to a subpoena,and that the second time, the -- the trial proceeded.But there was no effort to send someone out to -- toenforce it or to bring any sort of contempt sanction.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, let's assume your --you have here a woman who's sitting down in the kitchenwith the police officer, talks to the police officer,and then signs an affidavit.  Did she sign theaffidavit at that time?          MR. FISHER:  That's right, yes.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that affidavit was notadmissible because it's an affidavit.          MR. FISHER:  Correct.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  But the police officer whotestified to what she said and what he wrote down inthe affidavit that she signed, that does get in.          MR. FISHER:  Correct.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I -- I can't see why thatmakes any sense at all.  I mean, she -- she was eithertestifying when she spoke and then signed the401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 affidavit, as evidence of her testimony, or -- or else2 she wasn't testifying, in which case both the affidavit3 and the oral statement should be in. I can't -- I4 can't see drawing the line between those two. It5 really seems very strange to me.6 MR. FISHER: Well, I think whether you look7 at it from her perspective or from the officer's8 perspective, that something did change in the moment9 between the oral statement and the affidavit.10 If you look at it from -- from the officer's11 perspective, once Amy Hammon disclosed to him what had12 happened and -- and gave him information that he needed13 to handle the situation, then he could go about14 handling the situation. He didn't need the affidavit15 to do that. Once he turned to get the affidavit, he --16 he was transitioning to -- less from an emergency mode17 and more to an evidence-gathering mode.18 If you're -- if you are looking at it from19 the standpoint of Amy Hammon, then at that point, when20 -- when Officer Mooney is -- is in the house and has21 her husband, you know, in another room and she's trying22 to just describe what's going on so that she can be23 protected, that's a far different mind set.24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's a --25 it's a classic mixed motive case. We don't know when411111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 the officer is sitting down with her and asking the2 questions, whether his primary motive is to make sure3 the guy doesn't come back or if his primary motive is4 to help make the case against the guy. It's both.5 MR. FISHER: Well, I think it's reasonable to6 assume that officers, faced with an emergency7 situation, are primarily going to be working for --8 from a concern of safety, for their own and for others.9 And so even if it is a mixed motive, I think that the10 point is that particular circumstance, it's reasonable11 to infer where there's an emergency -- ongoing12 emergency, an ongoing immediate safety concern, that13 safety and security are going to be the primary motive.14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why does his motive matter?15 I mean, the -- the issue is whether she is testifying,16 whether she is a witness, and I don't see how that17 changes when she tells him these things orally and when18 she signs the affidavit afterwards. It seems to me19 she's testifying as to what events had occurred.20 MR. FISHER: Well, let me be clear that we're21 not suggesting a subjective inquiry into the officer's22 motive, but what we are saying is that whether a23 statement is testimonial depends on whether the24 government is -- is purely collecting evidence, making25 someone undergo an interrogation, for example, or421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 whether they are performing tasks that really were not2 part of -- of any type of police function at the3 founding, which is sort of a community caretaking,4 public safety function, so that by definition in5 eliciting statements concerning the immediate safety6 issue, the police officer could not have been engaged7 in the kinds of abuses that gave rise --8 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. This is helpful,9 very helpful to me, but I'm trying to see what you're10 driving at. I'm imagining the woman saying, he's11 hitting me, he's just hit me. She's in tears. That's12 excited utterance. Not. Then suddenly the officer, 513 minutes later, says I've heard what you said. Let's14 reduce it to writing. Here's the formal affidavit, et15 cetera, that is -- but to prevent Mr. Friedman's16 problem, we're going to have to say as to the second,17 that is even if you don't have the formality, you see,18 everything is the same, but not the formality. Now,19 how do we do that?20 MR. FISHER: I'm not sure if I'm following.21 Not formality --22 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm making the distinction23 you're making between she's in tears, excited utterance24 or res gestae, around there, just what you were talking25 about. Now think of the second affidavit -- when he431111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 reduces it to writing. That's different, calmer,2 clearly motive to testify, et cetera. Fine. But now3 what Mr. Friedman pointed out is if we make it turn4 solely on the formality, the piece of paper, the stamp,5 et cetera, they'll just avoid that. So we're going to6 have to sweep into the second the circumstance where7 everything is the same but the formality, and that's8 where I have the difficulty.9MR. FISHER:  Well, again, the -- thetask of understanding the Confrontationto figure out what limits there might be, andCrawford, the methodology was what does10 difficult11 Clause is12 -- and in13 history tell us the Framers were concerned about. And14 certainly15 were very16 were not.17the formal affidavit was something that theyconcerned about.  The less formal forms they               And certainly when it comes to something as18 -- as recent, you know, relatively speaking, as -- as19 the community caretaking function of the police, that20 was in no way part of -- of the abuses that the Framers21 were concerned about. And so I think even if the Court22 were to limit its decision to that part of the test,23 resolving the other instances, according to the24 resemblance test or -- or trying to figure out where to25 draw that -- you know, that line, could come later,441111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 consistent with its decision in this case.2 JUSTICE SOUTER: But your answer, I take it,3 assumes that the Framers had no concern with the4 capacity of the court to test the -- the validity or5 the truth of the statement.6 MR. FISHER: Well, I'm not entirely sure if7 that's the case. I mean, I -- of course, they were8 operating in a -- in a circumstance where -- where9 hearsay rules were -- were part of trial process.10 Certainly also, to the extent that -- that a particular11 procedure is -- is outrageous, the -- a due process12 concern might arise, but --13 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but -- no. But I'm --14 I'm not talking about outrageous circumstances in which15 the -- the statement was taken. I'm talking about the16 capacity of the court, by whatever means, to test the17 truth of that statement once it is placed before the18 court. And I understood your argument to Justice19 Breyer to assume that that testing function was not20 within the contemplation of the Framers.21 MR. FISHER: I think it was with respect to22 -- to the abuses that -- testimony elicited through the23 abuses that gave rise to the clause, the -- the common24 -- or I'm sorry -- the civil law type abuses. They did25 want to test that, but the concern --451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE SOUTER: So that your -- your -- you2 would then say they want a -- they want to test certain3 -- in certain cases where they think there may have4 been an abuse in the elicitation of the statement, but5 if there is -- there is no reason to suspect that the6 statement was taken under untoward circumstances, they7 were not concerned to test its validity.8 MR. FISHER: I think that -- that that's9 largely accurate, but they were dealing with, I think,10 a rather set form.11 JUSTICE SOUTER: But is that your position?12 MR. FISHER: Well, yes, but -- but if I may13 add a clarification, which is to say, the reason I14 think that we could circumscribe affidavits, regardless15 of whether the elicitation abuses are present, is16 simply for ease of administration, that abuses known to17 the Framers would have been arising in a circumstance18 where there would have been those abuses, and -- and as19 a form --20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Don't -- don't you think the21 Framers were aware of the fact that although there were22 law enforcement abuses, Raleigh's case and so on, there23 were also abuses every day of the week on the part of24 people who gave false testimony because they had25 grudges against the defendant? Do you think that was 461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 totally out of the minds of the Framers so as to2 support the distinction that -- that as a general rule3 you were suggesting?4 MR. FISHER: We don't know exactly all of the5 details that would have -- that they were6 contemplating.7 JUSTICE SOUTER: But why would -- why would8 we impute that -- that unconcern to the Framers about9 the -- the need to test statements which may very well10 have -- have been given because of envy, grudge, and so11 on?12 MR. FISHER: Because of -- of what we do know13 and what Crawford said that we do know, which is that14 we know that they were responding to things like15 Raleigh's trial and to Stamp Act, you know,16 enforcement, other --17 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but doesn't -- doesn't18 that get us back to the fact that those examples were19 given in Crawford as paradigm examples, if, you know,20 those were -- I think the word poor was used. But --21 but Crawford was not limited to that, and if it's not22 limited to that, why, in effect, does the -- does the23 -- should we conclude that the concern of the clause24 stops short of the self-interested witness even though25 he didn't make an affidavit?471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. FISHER:  Again, if I may be permitted tofinish.  The methodology -- the methodology of Crawfordis to look for known circumstances of abuse, aboutwhich thethat sortFramers were concerned, and we don't haveof historical evidence more generally.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.Mr. Gornstein. ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN   ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTAS          MR. GORNSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          We are asking the Court to apply the samestandard to statements made to officers at the scene asto statements made during a 911 call.  If the statementis made in response to police questions that arereasonably necessary to determine whether an emergencyexists --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask, under your view,was the affidavit admissible?          MR. GORNSTEIN:  The affidavit is notadmissible.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Why not?          MR. GORNSTEIN:  The affidavit is -- is notadmissible because, by that point, the officer had the481111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 information that he needed to resolve the emergency,2 and what he was soliciting at that point --3 JUSTICE STEVENS: I would suggest the reason4 it was not admissible is it's very clear that the5 affidavit is the testimonial statement by a witness6 that the defendant had a right to confront. The7 constitutional right is the right to confront the8 witnesses against him.9 MR. GORNSTEIN: I was just getting to that,10 Justice Stevens --11 JUSTICE STEVENS: Oh.12 MR. GORNSTEIN: -- that the -- the emergency13 was resolved, and at that point, he was --14 JUSTICE STEVENS: But you say if the officer15 independently repeats what is said in the affidavit,16 then he's the witness against rather than the --17 MR. GORNSTEIN: No, not -- no. He's -- he's18 not -- if he was repeating what was said in the19 affidavit, that's a different point. He's repeating20 the statement that was made before the affidavit was21 given. That was at a point at which the -- there was22 still an immediate danger and that he was asking a23 question that was reasonably necessary to determine24 whether that danger existed and, if so, how to resolve25 it.491111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SCALIA:  What was the immediateMR. GORNSTEIN:  When -- the immediate dangerdanger?was --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, there's thepoliceman in the room across the kitchen tablefrom the woman.          MR. GORNSTEIN:  The --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  He's not on the endphone line.  He's in the room across the kitchen table.          MR. GORNSTEIN:  That's correct.  And -- andthe problem here is what the danger was what wouldhappen if the officers left.  When -- when the officercame in and saw a frightened Ms. Hammon, he sawwreckage on the floor, he had reason to be concernedthat there was a very recent attack on her and that ifhe left the scene, that attack would be renewed.Asking Ms. Hammon what happened was reasonablynecessary to determine whether that emergency existedand, if so, how to resolve it.          Now, once he had that information, he hadwhat he needed to resolve the emergency, and at that --          JUSTICE ALITO:  In a situation like that,what was needed to resolve the situation, if hebelieved what Mrs. Hammon said, was to arrest Mr.501111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-from --of a￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Hammon.  Right?          MR. GORNSTEIN:  That's correct.          JUSTICE ALITO:  So he could -- you think hecould gather as much evidence as was necessary toarrest Mr. Hammon.          MR. GORNSTEIN:  I do not.  At some --          JUSTICE ALITO:  Why -- why not?  Why doesn'tthat follow?          MR. GORNSTEIN:  Well, at some point, what --what turns into emergency resolution moves over intointerrogation, and once you reach interrogation, thenyou have reached the core of what Crawford talks about--          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How do we know when thatline is crossed?  You said reasonably necessary toprotect safety.  That's okay.  Interrogation is notgood.  But how -- how does one tell when one stops andthe other starts?          MR. GORNSTEIN:  I -- I think this is going tobe a line-drawing question, but when you have asituation like this one where you have an officer who'sjust on the scene in the immediate wake of a -- of adomestic dispute, he asks a single question, whathappened, in -- in circumstances in which he needed toknow the answer to that question to make sure he could511111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 leave and leave her there safely. That's not2 interrogation. If he sat around for a half hour with a3 back-and-forth and give-and-take and trying to press4 and get to the situation in that kind of back-and-5 forth, that would be interrogation colloquially. And6 it's -- it's that kind of line that the Court is going7 to need to draw.8 JUSTICE BREYER: Why? Because he might be9 interrogating with no idea at all primarily in his mind10 of later court appearance. He wants to find out if11 there are guns in the house. He wants to find out if12 there are other people in the house. He wants to find13 out if somebody is being held captive. He wants to14 find out if these are the same people who did some15 other crime that's immediately taking place, what's the16 relationship. There are all kinds of interrogation.17 You're saying that all that interrogation by a18 policeman can't come in under the Confrontation Clause.19 MR. GORNSTEIN: The Confrontation Clause bars20 under Crawford police interrogation. And the21 situation is one in which we are not going to22 to examine the individual motives of officers23 case and individual declarants in every case.24 What we are looking for is a categorical rule25 that is going to capture the likely motivations in both521111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1--- thebe ablein every￼1 cases, and when you have emergency question, you're2 likely dealing with the situation with -- both from the3 officer's side and from the declarant's side, you're4 going to be having people attempting to resolve an5 immediate danger of harm. And you get --6 JUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that assumes -- this7 -- your -- your focus on whether the -- you know, the8 -- it's an interrogation or not -- it -- it assumes9 that the only focus of the Confrontation Clause is on10 prosecutorial abuse somehow. And -- and as -- as11 Justice Souter was suggesting, I don't think that was12 the exclusive --13 MR. GORNSTEIN: No, we don't -- we don't14 think that's the exclusive focus either, and we think15 interrogation can capture both, too, that when you get16 to the point of interrogation, what's happening with17 the witness is getting an increasing understanding that18 what this is being sought for is to build a case.19 I think the biggest problem with the -- the20 two rules that are proposed on the other side, that is,21 the accusation rule and the reasonable anticipation22 rule, is it captures within a -- these emergency23 statements that really don't have -- fall within any24 ordinary understanding of what testimony is. If I go25 to my house and it's late at night, I hear suspicious531111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 noises, and I see somebody and get a partial2 description of him, and I call 911, I'm seeking to3 avert an immediate danger to myself. I don't think4 under any stretch of the imagination anybody would5 refer to that as testimony. Yet, under his rule --67 Amendment 89 the CourtCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Of course, the Sixthdoesn't use the word testimony, does it?MR. GORNSTEIN:  No, it does not.  But whatsaid in Crawford was that the term witness10 was referring to -- that people can make testimonial11 statements --12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And maybe that -- and13 maybe you're not a witness when you make the call, but14 when that same call is admitted into court, then --15 then it strikes me that you are a witness.16 MR. GORNSTEIN: But -- but that's not the17 definition of witness that -- that Crawford adopted.18 That would be --19 JUSTICE SCALIA: As it happens in the other20 -- in the companion case today, the prosecution itself,21 in its summation to the jury, referred to the 911 call22 and said, you have heard the testimony of -- of the23 victim and referred to it as testimony.24 MR. GORNSTEIN: Justice Scalia, if he --25 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it's not beyond the541111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 pale to consider this testimony.2 MR. GORNSTEIN: -- if -- if he -- he had made3 a statement about a co-conspirator's statement during4 the course of the conspiracy and he had said, we have5 here the testimony of the -- his co-conspirator, that6 would not make it testimony. And if the -- the 9117 call --8 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but it would prove that9 -- that it's not beyond the pale to call it testimony.10 MR. GORNSTEIN: Well, it just does not make11 it testimony. And if it -- the prosecutor in the 91112 case had said, I don't have her testimony, I have13 something better, it's a 911 call --14 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Gornstein?15 MR. GORNSTEIN: -- of a cry for help, that16 wouldn't make it not testimony. And I don't think --17 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Gornstein, is this a18 fair summary of your position, if I may? We're really19 asking who's the witness that's being testified20 against, and when it's the affidavit, it's clearly the21 woman that's a witness there where it's inadmissible.22 But your view, as I understand you, is when it's the23 officer who is the witness, he's subject to cross24 examination, and as long as the emergency continues and25 he's describing what happened during the emergency,551111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425he's still the witness.  That's what you're saying, Ithink.          MR. GORNSTEIN:  He's -- he's still a --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  He's still the witnesswe're concerned about.          MR. GORNSTEIN:  He is the witness --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Therefore, he's subject tocross examination.          MR. GORNSTEIN:  He's the -- he's the -- he issubject to cross examination.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  And so during the emergencyperiod, he can repeat what she said.          MR. GORNSTEIN:  But I -- what I'm saying isthat she's not a witness during the emergency perioditself.saying.JUSTICE STEVENS:  I understand what you'reMR. GORNSTEIN:  It has to be both.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  That we focus not onwhether it's testimony but whether he's the witness atthe critical time or whether she's the witness.          MR. GORNSTEIN:  I -- I think that that's oneway of looking at it, Justice Stevens, but --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's not the waythe Court looked at it in Crawford.561111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. GORNSTEIN: No. I -- I think that what2 you would look to see is if, at the relevant time, that3 -- that the declarant was acting as a witness. And at4 the relevant time, when somebody is answering a5 question to avert an immediate danger, they're not6 acting as a witness. They're not making a solemn7 declaration for the purpose of proving facts to support8 a prosecution, and so they're not acting as a witness9 in those circumstances.10 And -- and it's only later, when the officer11 turns to soliciting from Ms. Hammon an affidavit, that12 what he's soliciting at that point is a solemn13 declaration made for the purpose of proving facts to14 support a prosecution. Now, that's testimony.15 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure that the two16 were -- were as separated as you -- as you claim. I --17 I took it that the affidavit -- while he was getting18 the oral responses, he was writing down what -- what19 would be put in the affidavit.20 MR. GORNSTEIN: I don't think that there's21 any evidence in the record to support that, Justice22 Scalia. That -- that -- what happened is that he took23 -- that he listened to her oral statement and then he24 proceeded to ask for -- her for an affidavit, after he25 had the information that he needed to resolve the571111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425emergency, was to figure out how he was going toprotect this person from an immediate renewed attack ifhe left the scene.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  But under your test, thewhole question is whether the emergency continued atthe time the witness' words are being repeated.          MR. GORNSTEIN:  It's not the whole questionbecause if the statement -- the question has nothing todo with and the answer had nothing to do with theemergency.  It does not come in under the rule we'retalking about.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  No, I'm not arguing that.I'm trying to figure out -- I think I have a littledifferent angle on it than you actually said in yourbrief or actually in the text of Crawford.  Of course,Crawford wasn't confronting this problem.  It describedeverything as testimonial, but the real question iswho's the witness under the text of the Constitution.          MR. GORNSTEIN:  Well, Justice Stevens, I'm --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  And I think your argumentis --          MR. GORNSTEIN:  -- I'm happy to have yourapproach if it -- if it leads to five votes in thiscase.JUSTICE STEVENS: I think I'm trying to help 581111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425you.(Laughter.)          JUSTICE STEVENS:  I know it didn't start outthat way, but it seems to me I'm helping your side ofit.  Yes.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr.Gornstein.          Mr. Friedman, you have 4 minutes remaining.         REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD D. FRIEDMAN               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. FRIEDMAN:  I -- I think that wheneverthere is a -- an out-of-court accusation repeated,there is a witness in court, but that is not thewitness that -- or that doesn't satisfy theconfrontation right because there's the -- the --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  No, but you would agreethat the officer could testify to some of the thingsthat happened during the emergency, and he's a witnessto that extent.          MR. FRIEDMAN:  Yes, absolutely, the officerwas --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  And the question is whetherhe can cover this as well.          MR. FRIEDMAN:  That's -- that, of course, isthe -- that -- that's the question.  But -- but she was591111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 acting as a -- a witness when -- when she made the2 accusation to -- to the officer, and characterizing it3 as an emergency I don't think helps anything in -- in4 this case.5 The -- the fact is that if we extend the6 emergency this far it shows -- well, it shows just how7 capable of expansion the -- the theory is because there8 is an officer with her and there is an officer with --9 with him. So the -- the only question is should the10 officers leave. That means that whenever there's --11 there's a victim potentially at large there, the12 confrontation right wouldn't -- wouldn't apply.13 The -- the whole emergency doctrine really14 distorts incentives because a -- a police officer who15 has a -- a dual motive of creating -- of protecting16 people, protecting the safety of -- of people and17 gathering evidence -- and I think it's clear that they18 do -- under an emergency doctrine, would have an19 incentive to preserve the emergency or the appearance20 of emergency for -- for as long as -- for as long as21 possible. And I -- I think the -- the State encourages22 people to call, which of course they should do, but in23 part the reason why people are encouraged to call is to24 -- is to create -- is to pass on -- is to pass on25 evidence.601111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 So I don't think that even if -- even to the2 extent that the call is a -- a cry for help, well, the3 help is -- is seeking invitation of the -- of the legal4 system. In the Davis case, of course, it was an5 arrest.6 In -- in this case, the -- the statement was7 not a cry for help. It was in response to the second8 inquiry by the police officer. The police officer was9 -- was pressing. And -- and I -- I think the -- the10 emergency doctrine simply -- simply can't -- if -- if11 there were an emergency doctrine, I think it's just12 badly founded and couldn't apply here.13 If it please the Court, I believe Crawford14 has brought us to a remarkable crossroads. If the15 accusation in this case is allowed to secure a16 conviction without the State providing an opportunity17 for confrontation, then the Confrontation Clause will18 be little more than a charade, easily evated by State19 officers gathering evidence. But if the Court20 proclaims that a conviction cannot be based on an21 accusation made privately to a known police officer,22 then it will take a long step to ensure that the23 confrontation right remains robust, as the Framers24 intended for centuries to come.25 JUSTICE BREYER: What about the resemblance611111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 idea to get around your problem? Of course, it's not2 purely formal. It's purely formal, plus those things3 that resemble what's purely formal.4 MR. FRIEDMAN: I'm not sure I quite5 understand.6 JUSTICE BREYER: Listen -- it's purely the formal7 criteria, plus anything that's the same. Now, same is8 vague, but it's no vaguer than a lot of other things9 floating around here today.10 MR. FRIEDMAN: Well --11 JUSTICE BREYER: So what do you think of12 that?13 MR. FRIEDMAN: I -- I -- not much, Your14 Honor.15 (Laughter.)16 MR. FRIEDMAN: I -- I don't think an17 accusation to a known law enforcement officer is18 awfully vague. Any legal term will have some -- some19 vagueness around the edges, but I don't think there's20 much.21 Resemblance is awfully vague. I think what22 happened here resembled the inquisitorial practices in23 the key -- in the key -- in a key respect. And I don't24 think the test Your Honor is proposing handles the25 message over the Internet or -- or a letter, the -- the621111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 tape made at the initiative of the -- of the witness.2 I think it -- it utterly fails to get that because the3 -- the prosecutors aren't involved. But clearly the4 Confrontation Clause was written against the backdrop5 of private prosecution, the system of private6 prosecution. So it has to get those clauses.7 I -- I think that this case can be resolved8 on those very narrow grounds without trying to9 establish the broad, general meaning of the10 Confrontation Clause. I'm -- I'm hoping that the Court11 is building a framework for hundreds of years to -- to12 come, and I think it's more important that it be built13 right than that it be built quickly. And so I think an14 important first step is to say an accusation to a known15 police officer, whatever else is testimonial, that16 clearly must be.17 If there are no further questions, I'm18 pleased to submit the case.19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.20 The case is submitted.21 (Whereupon, at 12:05 p.m., the case in the22 above-entitled matter was submitted.)23 24 251111 14th Street, NW Suite 40063 1-Washington, DC 20005
