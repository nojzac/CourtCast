California.          Mr. Bedrick.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. BEDRICK                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. BEDRICK:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          I would like to address three points.          One, the correct prima facie standard underBatson is whether there's sufficient evidence to permit ajudge to draw a reasonable inference of discrimination.          Two, the challenger's own reasons must bedisclosed in order for the Batson process to work and toprevent discrimination.          Three, it is improper for a third party tospeculate at the prima facie stage as to a challenger'spossible reason because what needs to be evaluated is thechallenger's own reason and own credibility and owndemeanor,and not someone else's guess as a reason.The correct prima facie test is a permissivetest where there is sufficient evidence to allowinferencea judge to draw a reasonable inference of discrimination.That's equivalent to the test where a judge decides31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425whether there's sufficient evidence to pass a case to thejury, although I'd like to add one small proviso to that,which is in case of doubt, the benefit should go in thedirection of obtaining the reason because the goals ofBatson cannot properly be enforced unless the reason forthe challenge -- the challenge is stated.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's not very --          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  That's a verystandard in the first place, and why should it bedown more?          MR. BEDRICK:  I'm -- I'm not suggestingwatered down, Your Honor.  I'm just suggesting ina tie, in case the judge finds the question is inequipoise, then there should -- the benefit should go tothe -- obtaining the reason and therefore obtaining a -- aruling on the merits.jury theproceed?going to JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is the test for going to thesame as the test for whether or not discovery can MR. BEDRICK:  No, Your Honor.  The test forthe jury is actually higher.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I'm -- I'm surprised youset the bar that high.  If we're going to --          MR. BEDRICK:  I guess I had the benefit of theargument before the Court last year and the benefit of41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-low wateredit be case of￼1 further reflection, and I think that allowing the case to2 go to the jury is a good standard except for my proviso3 that if it was close and the -- was in equipoise, then the4 benefit ought to go to obtaining the reason because it is5 a discovery-type request.6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I was just admiring your7 -- your proposal in that at least it relied on something8 that the lower courts are used to applying. I mean,9 yes, is there enough to go to the jury? My goodness,10 it's a standard test. But you've suddenly destroyed it11 all by saying it isn't quite that because, you know, if12 it's -- if it's really close, the tie goes to the13 plaintiff, which is an unusual way for the tie to go. The14 tie usually goes to the other side.15 MR. BEDRICK: The tie goes here to -- the16 standard would be fine with -- with or without the benefit17 of a tie. I would be happy with the standard either way.18 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what's the standard19 under title VII when we talk about that, when we talk20 about enough evidence to shift the burden of proof? Is21 that something less?22 MR. BEDRICK: The standard under title VII is23 something less, Your Honor, because under title VII, under24 McDonnell Douglas, the plaintiff has to prove four25 factors, that the plaintiff was a member of a protected51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 group, protected minority group; that the plaintiff was2 qualified3 rejected;4 four --56 guess the7 basing it8 formula.9 that?1011 McDonnell12 parallel step of prima facie case, shifting the burden of13 production. The defendant or respondent comes up with an14 answer, and then eventually the trier of fact decides15 whether or not the -- the plaintiff or the moving party16 has been persuasive.17 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what happens if he18 doesn't come up with an answer in -- in this case?19 What --20 MR. BEDRICK: We have --21 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- what happens if the22 prosecutor just says, gee, I -- you know -- or the -- the23 prosecutor has died? You know, it comes up later in -- in24 a habeas action. The prosecutor is dead.25 MR.

If I can take them one at a time.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  No.  It -- it's one hypothesis.There is no answer filed by the State as to what the realreason was.  What happens?          MR. BEDRICK:  The trial -- if the State refuses,willfully refuses to present an answer, the trial courtcould and most likely will, draw an inference from thatintentional refusal and hold that inference against theState.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are you going to say that if-- if there's no answer, then the challenge is presumed tobe correct?          MR. BEDRICK:  No, I'm not saying that.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All right.  So the trial judgecan -- can overrule the challenge.          MR. BEDRICK:  Yes.  The -- if -- if there isa --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It seems to me that's quitedifferent from the standard that requires it go to thejury.  You send a case to a jury if there's evidence fromwhich the jury could find for the plaintiff.          MR. BEDRICK:  Yes, Your Honor.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And that's -- it -- it seemsto me that's a -- that's much more rigorous than thestandard that you've proposed in -- in your brief, and71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that -- and that other courts use in the Batson case.

BEDRICK: That is correct.18 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- where the court has still19 ultimately got to decide it?

Step two, silence.  We get to stepthree.  What does the court consider at step three?          MR. BEDRICK:  The court considers theplaintiff's showing of a prima -- the -- the objector'sshowing a prima facie case.  The court considers theanswer given by the challenger.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Which is zero.  Which issilence.  There is no answer.          MR. BEDRICK:  If -- if -- I'm sorry, Your Honor.I misunderstood.  I didn't realize it was a silence issue.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes.          MR. BEDRICK:  If there's a prima facie case andif the prosecutor or the challenger willfully refuses toanswer, the trial judge is entitled to draw an inferencefrom that refusal to answer and I believe most likelywould draw the inference that there's something wrong hereand therefore would find a prima facie case.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  All right.

BEDRICK:  I do not know, Your Honor, becausewe have never seen a situation in which a --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  All right.  Let me --          MR. BEDRICK:  -- prosecutor has refused toanswer.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Let me suggest this.  Wouldn't-- wouldn't he almost necessarily have to consider at stepthree those reasons that the prosecutor has not given, butwhich he thinks might be good reasons for the challengewhich do not raise Batson discrimination?          MR. BEDRICK:  We have argued in our brief thatit's not correct for the trial judge to speculate as tothe prosecutor's possible reasons.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Right.  That's what I'm --that's what I'm getting at.  And -- and what I'm troubledby is I -- I take your -- I understand your point, thatit's not appropriate for him to speculate and supply ananswer at stage two.  But if stage one -- at stage one,the objector has satisfied the test and at stage three,the -- the court may, nonetheless, reject the challenge, Idon't know what he would be rejecting the challenge forunless it is on the basis of this kind of, as you put it,speculation about what the reasons might be.  So help meout there.MR. BEDRICK: I -- I agree, Your Honor. I don't 101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 know what the basis would be either if a prima facie2 case --3 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then why don't you have to say4 at that stage, if there is silence on the part of the5 government, he's got to find the violation?6 MR. BEDRICK: I -- I -- the only words that7 would differ would be got to. I would say he'd be most8 likely to if there --9 JUSTICE SOUTER: But if he doesn't have to, he's10 got to have some reason for doing it. This is not a11 matter of whim. And if he's got to have a reason and his12 reasons may not legitimately be those speculations on what13 might be a legitimate basis for the challenge, but which14 were never raised by the State, and you can't think of any15 other reasons -- and I admit I can't right now -- then it16 seems to me that he would pretty -- it would -- it would17 follow that -- that he would be required to -- to uphold18 the challenge.19 MR. BEDRICK: I believe that it -- it would20 require -- that he would ultimately uphold the challenge21 but on the basis of drawing an inference from the refusal22 to answer, and those two -- adding two and two together,23 adding the --24 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but -- but the refusal to25 answer -- I just -- you know, it happened so long ago,111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Your Honor.  I had a lot of other -- I -- you know.  Butit comes up later, and he says I just don't remember why Ichallenged this --          MR. BEDRICK:  In the case of don't remember,Your Honor --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Don't remember.          MR. BEDRICK:  -- Batson has been the law for 18or 19 years.  In California, we've had Wheeler for 25years.  Any competent prosecutor who was challengingminority jurors and was faced with a Batson motion wouldmake notes of some kind and keep a record of some kind.If he did not do that, he would not be acting competentlyand the trial court would be entitled to draw an inferencefrom that claim, refusing to remember.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Bedrick, in your briefyou were very, it seemed, uncomfortable about addressingthis question.  You said it's just like you go through thesame litany as title VII, that is, the plaintiff meets aburden which is in title VII very easy to meet --          MR. BEDRICK:  Yes.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- stage one.  Then thedefendant has to come up with a nondiscriminatory reason,and then you find out if that was pretext.          You kept saying in your brief what you said amoment ago that you have never seen a case.  You said it121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425never happens.  It never happens that the prosecutorstands silent.  So this is a hypothetical, academicquestion.  But I think you're being pressed to say, well,suppose it does happen, and I take it that your answer isin that case the person who's raising the Batson challengewins.  But you're -- you're not willing to say certainly.I mean, you seem to say -- well, why are you uncertain?          MR. BEDRICK:  The -- the title VII test and theBatson test are parallel, but not identical.  And inthe --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But suppose you had in atitle VII case the employer says, I'm not going to giveyou a nondiscriminatory reason.  You -- you've gonethrough the McDonnell Douglas.  The plaintiff has shownthose four things.  The employer says, I'm not going togive you any reason.  Then what happens?          MR. BEDRICK:  The trial -- the trial court wouldfind for the plaintiff because under the title VIIformula, which this Court has established in the McDonnellDouglas/Furnco line of cases, the finding of a prima faciecase entitles the plaintiff to a presumption.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's because --          MR. BEDRICK:  And it's bursting the bubble --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wow.          MR. BEDRICK:  -- slightly --131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I -- I don't think we've eversaid that.  I thought we've -- we've said to the contrary,that the ultimate question is always, did the plaintiffshow by a preponderance that -- that the reason wasdiscrimination.  That's what I thought our -- our casessay, not -- not automatically to punish the employer fornot giving a reason, he loses, which is what you want todo here.          MR. BEDRICK:  The employer will always give areason and the challenger will always give a reasonbecause --          JUSTICE BREYER:  What happens in a title VIIcase if, in fact, we meet just what Justice Ginsburg said?Can you have a jury trial?  Imagine a situation, jury.Okay?          MR. BEDRICK:  Yes.          JUSTICE BREYER:  The plaintiff gets up andestablishes the four points.  Defense.  The defense rests.Now, does the judge send it to the jury, or does the judgedirect a verdict for the plaintiff?          MR. BEDRICK:  I believe in the title VII contextthe judge would direct the verdict for the plaintiff.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Unusual.  I --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And -- and it seems to me the-- your -- there's some difficulty in -- in trying to141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 equate Batson challenges and -- and title VII, and that's2 because your beginning point is that you base -- you --3 you require too much of the prima facie case. It -- it4 seems to me all that's required under Batson is reason to5 inquire.6 MR. BEDRICK: Yes.7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's -- that's a special8 use of the term prima facie.9 Now, if -- if we want to be consistent with the10 use of the word -- of the term, prima facie, from Batson11 to title VII, then it seems to me this inquiry is12 necessary. But -- and you're the one that puts it in13 motion by setting this rather high threshold that is the14 same as to go to a jury. I disagree with that.15 JUSTICE SCALIA: May I suggest you might have16 put the high threshold because it's a threshold that17 judges are familiar with and can use, whereas reason to18 inquire would be a fine test for when a judge is permitted19 to demand a response but it cannot possibly be a test for20 when a judge is required to demand a -- what does -- what21 does reason to inquire mean? Is that a -- is that a22 standard that -- that can be applied in law?23 MR. BEDRICK: I accept the suggestion from the24 Court that the standard could also be25 We would be -- we would be happy with151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  1-reason to inquire.that standard.Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: What does it mean?2 MR.

BEDRICK: Pardon me, Your Honor?9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Any suspicion -- he strikes one10 black from the jury.11 MR. BEDRICK: No, not any suspicion whatsoever.12 It's a higher standard --13 JUSTICE SCALIA: It has to be reason to inquire.14 MR. BEDRICK: It has to be reason to inquire.15 JUSTICE SCALIA: What's --16 MR. BEDRICK: It would vary depending on the17 circumstances. The --18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and is that like19 permitting discovery to go forward?2021 of Batson 2223 less than 2425MR. BEDRICK:  That's essentially what step oneis --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And -- and is that standardgoing to a jury?MR. BEDRICK:  Yes.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All right.  So that -- that's161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 -- I recognize that it's been difficult for us to find an2 analog. It may be that Batson is sui generis. It may not3 be. If we're going to talk about what judges are familiar4 with, then it's prima facie case and it's title VII.5 MR. BEDRICK: But title VII doesn't quite work6 because the -- the prima -- the definition for prima facie7 case in title VII is different, and it's easier. If we8 were to put in the -- they're -- they're parallel tests.9 They're not identical. If we were to import the title VII10 prima facie case in a Batson, it will be satisfied every11 time there was a challenge to a minority juror because12 under any -- every such situation, there would be a13 minority juror who was qualified because he passed for14 cause who was rejected and the seat would be open. That15 would be -- that's a -- that's even a lower standard than16 we are --17 JUSTICE BREYER: Then are you saying, look,18 judge -- imagine you had a jury on this question. If the19 defendant has made out enough of a case that you would20 send it to the jury, then go to step two and ask the21 questions 2223 position. 2425as to why.MR.

Would this -- would this be a -- a fairsummary of -- of your position on all the steps?          Step one, there must be enough that wouldjustify sending the question to the jury if it were a juryquestion.          MR. BEDRICK:  Yes.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Number two, if there is silenceat stage two or in Justice Scalia's example, theprosecutor just can't remember, and we then go to stagethree, your position is as follows.          At stage three, number one, there is enough --there is enough evidence on the record from which thejudge can find a Batson violation.          Number two, there is a state of the evidencefrom which he is not required to find a Batson violation.Sometimes, maybe most times, the prosecutor's silence willbe a reason to find a Batson violation, in addition tothose that were stated at stage one.          And finally, theoretically -- theoretically evenwith the prosecutor's silence, the evidence at stage one,sufficient as it might be to get to the jury, will not bepersuasive.  And there may be outlying cases in which,even with prosecutorial silence, the court will say Idon't see the Batson violation shown here.Is that a fair statement of your position? 181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. BEDRICK:  Yes, Your Honor, it is.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.          MR. BEDRICK:  An example -- the only examplethat I can think -- the only practical example that I canthink of, however, where a trial court is likely not todraw a strong negative inference from the prosecutor'sfailure to answer is in the situation suggested where itreviews it -- reviewed it on appeal and the prosecutordied.  Under those circumstances, the -- maybe there --there may be notes in the file, but if there aren't notesin the file, the prosecutor's failure to answer is beyondhis control.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I take it in your viewthe California standard is more strict than the title VIIstandard for prima facie case.          MR. BEDRICK:  Yes, Your Honor, in my view it is.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, the California court atleast appears to say it's the same.          MR. BEDRICK:  The -- I believe the Californiacourt has misread title VII practice in several ways.  Ibelieve it has -- it misread what is produced at the -- ithas misread what the plaintiff's burden is to produce aprima facie case.  And under title VII, the plaintiff'sburden is merely, as I stated, to show that a member of aprotected group qualified, applied, rejected, position191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425open.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And do we say that thatequates to a standard of more likely than not or do we notsay that?          MR. BEDRICK:  The -- those facts under title VIImust be proved more likely than not.  And from that, underthe title VII McDonnell Douglas formula --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is -- is step onemore likely than not?          MR. BEDRICK:  Yes.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I don't seemuch different from what California is doing.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  I thought step onefrom which it could be found more likely than          MR. BEDRICK:  Yes --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  He doesn't have tolikely than not at stage one, as I understandposition.  He has to put in enough evidence from which afact finder could find more likely than not if he acceptsall the evidence as true and so on.          MR. BEDRICK:  That's correct, Your Honor, under-- under Batson.  The tests are not identical.  Here --I'm sort of stumbling over my tongue a bit in trying topoint out that the tests are parallel but they are notidentical.201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-of title VIIhow that'swas evidencenot.prove moreyour￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask you a question about2 the other part of your case, which is that the judge3 cannot consider in -- in step one anything except the --4 except the -- the racial strikes and -- and nothing else5 and cannot even speculate as to what causes might have6 produced the strikes? That seems to me rather extreme.7 MR. BEDRICK: It is --8 JUSTICE SCALIA: How can you possibly decide9 whether it -- a reasonable juror could find this? Let's10 assume that all three of the -- of the minority, three11 blacks are stricken by the prosecution. The judge, the12 district judge, knows that everyone of them is -- is a --13 a defendant's lawyer, every single one. He has to blot14 that out of his mind?15 MR. BEDRICK: Your Honor, that's a -- in that16 example, which I respectfully submit would be rather17 extreme and unusual, the trial judge should still not18 speculate.19 The reason why the trial judge should not20 speculate is shown by the facts of this case. With regard21 to juror Sara Edwards, the trial judge speculated on two22 possibly reasons. One possibly reason was that she had a23 relative who had been arrested for a serious crime 3524 years ago, and the second reason that he speculated was25 that she had -- was -- did not know whether she could be211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 fair in the case of a death of a child. As to the second2 reason, that would show -- if any bias, that would show3 pro-prosecution bias.4 JUSTICE SCALIA: But once -- once you have the5 lenient test that you've established, why isn't it enough6 to say even with that -- even with that speculation, a7 reasonable juror could find? Once you have that lenient8 test, I don't know why you have to exclude the9 speculation.10 I mean, there -- what if all three of the blacks11 -- it's a case in which the -- the visual evidence is12 significant and all three of the blacks are blind and --13 and you tell me the judge has to say, oh, no, it -- it14 can't be that -- that reason that they were stricken.15 That doesn't make any sense.16 MR. BEDRICK: In presenting a test -- in17 presenting a test or significant formula, every once in a18 while there will be a case where this test is slightly19 over-inclusive. And Your Honor has given an example of20 that. But if that's the case, the trial judge will say,21 you know, I bet I know what the answer is. Mr.22 Prosecutor, what's the answer? The prosecutor gives the23 answer. The trial judge says, yes, I find that credible.24 Motion denied.25 JUSTICE STEVENS: And yes, but one of the221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 things, it seems to me, you're all overlooking is that if2 it's as obvious as they're all blind, those would be3 challenges for cause.4 MR. BEDRICK: Very much so, Your Honor.5 JUSTICE STEVENS: We're talking about challenges6 where there are no -- no obvious basis for it.7 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, in practice, Mr.8 Bedrick, is it always worked out like this kind of a9 minuet? First we have step one and step two. Isn't a lot10 of it just at a bench conference?11 MR. BEDRICK: Yes. The minuet may -- may --12 will be most likely at a bench conference. In this case13 the two motions were discussed. One was discussed during14 a jury recess. The other was discussed the next morning15 before the jury was assembled. So it may be a minuet, but16 it's a -- I'm not sure who the -- there's a 1-minute17 waltz. So it is more like a 1-minute waltz than a full18 minuet.19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do we need the same -- the20 same rules for State and Federal courts? You have here21 the California Supreme Court. Why do they have to use the22 same -- the same minuet that the Federal courts do?23 MR. BEDRICK: Because under Batson and then24 under Purkett v. Elem and under Hernandez v. New York,25 this Court has declared that Batson is a rule of Federal231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 constitutional law, that the purpose of Batson is to2 protect the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights of the3 jurors to equal protection and not being "perempted" for4 racial reasons. In --5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but -- but State courts6 have different rules of evidence. They have different7 rules of procedure, and we allow Federal cases to be8 determined under those State rules of evidence and State9 rules of procedure so long as they provide due process.10 MR. BEDRICK: The California --11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why can't -- why can't the12 Batson question similarly be decided but decided under13 State rules of procedure?14 MR. BEDRICK: The California Supreme Court made15 no claim to be deciding this case under State rules of16 procedure. It asserted repeatedly that in this case that17 it was deciding this question under its understanding of18 Federal law, under its understanding of the Batson line of19 cases, and that it was interpreting Federal law and20 nothing more.21 My opponent argues that there should be a State22 law question, but that's a different position than taken23 by the State supreme court.24 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you would have no objection25 to our limiting our opinion, saying, you know, reversing241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425and remanding and saying this is not Federal law.  It'snot what we would do in Federal court.  Of course, theCalifornia Supreme Court is free to have some differentsystem.          MR. BEDRICK:  I would respectfully disagree,Your Honor.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, you don't want us to dothat, do you?          MR. BEDRICK:  No, Your Honor.  I respectfullydisagree.  This is -- I believe this is a question ofFederal constitutional law that needs to be appliedeverywhere.  This is a rule followed in 12 -- all 12Federal district -- circuits and in 48 of the 50 States.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Isn't it sometimes even whenyou're not involved with a constitutional question, if youhave a Federal claim in a State court -- Byrd against BlueRidge is one example -- the Federal procedure -- that theState procedure needs to be modified so it's in sync withthe Federal?          MR. BEDRICK:  I agree, Your Honor.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That was a question of whatkind of questions go to juries.          MR. BEDRICK:  Yes.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The State said ordinarily wedon't give this kind of question to the jury, but we're251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425dealing with a Federal claim, and the Federal proceduretrumps.          MR. BEDRICK:  Yes.  Yes, Your Honor.          If the Court has no more questions, may Ireserve the rest of my time for rebuttal?Bedrick.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Very well, Mr.Mr. Schalit.   ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH K. SCHALIT      ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. SCHALIT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          Petitioner's position would require this Courtto abandon Batson's requirement for a shifting burden ofproduction or to announce a new rule of constitutionalevidence that burdens of production shift based onimprobable inferences.          The standard recognized by the State isconsistent with Batson.  Batson provided for a shiftingburden of production and it directed the courts to look tothis Court's title VII cases to see how that processoperates.          In title VII --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, do -- do you agree thatthe California standard is more rigorous than the standard261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 applied by the Federal courts and by most State courts?2 MR. SCHALIT: No, Your Honor. California's3 standard is consistent with Batson. Now, there are very,4 very few courts that have actually considered the precise5 question presented here. California does not stand alone6 in its analysis of this --7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think the California8 rule is the same as the Federal rule?910 stated in11 stated by12 certainly13 as announced by Batson, which is the only question that14 matters because in Batson --15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what about Hanson, and16 is it Purkett v. Elem?17 MR. SCHALIT: Yes, Your Honor. In -- in Purkett18 and in -- I don't know whether it was Hernandez -- I may19 have misheard you -- the Court reiterated the three-step20 process. All of those cases, however, rely on the21 existence of a step one with a shifting burden of22 production before reasons must be given and they must be23 given when step one is met. The objecting party must make24 a prima facie25 shown that it1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400case.  That does not happen until he hasis more likely than not that there is27 Washington, DC 20005 1-MR. SCHALIT:  I think the Federal rule has beenmany different ways.  The Federal rule has beenlower courts in many different ways.  It isthe same as or consistent with the Federal rule￼1 discrimination.2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's in -- in the title3 VII context, certainly you don't have to show more likely4 than not to get past the initial threshold. All you have5 to do is to make four showings that -- that Federal courts6 have recognized are rather easily made. So the real show7 doesn't come until the pretext stage. But it's not that8 you have to show anything by a preponderance of the9 evidence, that -- you don't have to show discrimination by10 a preponderance of the evidence under title VII. You just11 have to show four things from which someone may but not12 must infer discrimination.13 MR. SCHALIT: Your Honor, in the title VII14 circumstance, you are correct. The ultimate, ultimate15 finding is, of course, made after the employer responds if16 the employer chooses to respond in light of all of the17 evidence. The employer may not respond, for example, if18 the employer does not believe those four elements have19 been established or the jury would find them to be20 established.21 However, if those four elements are established22 in the minds of the jury by a preponderance of the23 evidence, according to this Court in St. Mary's Honor24 Center and in -- in Burdine or Burdine, the obligation is25 on the fact finder at that point to find for the employee281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 if there's no response at step two because a presumption2 is established.3 And Furnco expressly states that there is a4 presumption because the prima facie case if established5 makes it more likely than not that there was6 discrimination. The prima facie case in the run of the --7 run of the cases we know the reason that those four facts8 are true is that there was discrimination in the face of9 silence.10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought all it did was11 shift the burden of production to the defendant. It12 doesn't -- the showing at stage one doesn't involve the13 burden of persuasion.14 MR. SCHALIT: Yes, Your Honor. It -- it shifts15 the burden of production, but the reason it does so is16 that, in the language of Wigmore, the employee, or in a17 title VII case, the objecting party, has gone further.18 The -- that party has not simply removed the obligation to19 present evidence from which one can infer a fact. But he20 has gone further and presented sufficient evidence to21 entitle that party to prevail in the face of his22 opponent's silence.23 And Justice Powell, writing the opinion in24 Batson, clearly referred to the Court's title VII cases,25 including the opinion that he wrote for the Court in291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 Burdine, which in the footnote expressly stated that the2 McDonnell Douglas presumption does not adopt the prima3 facie case in the sense of merely allowing the jury to4 make a finding. It stated that -- adopted the prima facie5 case with a shifting burden of production, and that is one6 with a presumption that entitles the party to prevail.7 The same is true --8 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you -- you can say that9 its words say that, but what it does doesn't say that. I10 mean, to establish a prima facie case, all you have to11 show is that -- that you were qualified for the job,12 you're a member of a minority, and you weren't hired, and13 somebody who's not a member of a minority was hired. Do14 you think that's enough to show that it's more likely than15 not that race was the basis and that's -- you know, that's16 how those17 case. Is18 that race19cases pan out?  That's enough for a prima faciethat enough to say it's more likely than notwas the reason?MR. SCHALIT:  It is enough to say that when20 unexplained, when there's no response from the employer,21 yes. The 222324jury is instructed that --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Really?MR. SCHALIT:  That --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you really believe that?  I25 mean, in -- in a large -- you know, large -- large 301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 operation, you -- you're a minority. You apply for a job.2 You're qualified for it. You aren't hired, but somebody3 who's not a minority is hired. That alone, without any4 other information, is enough to enable somebody to find5 that it is more likely than not that -- that race was the6 reason? My goodness. I -- I don't think that's an7 accurate description.8 MR. SCHALIT: Well, that is -- Your Honor,9 sorry. That was my reading of -- of St. Mary's when --10 and Burdine when a --11 JUSTICE BREYER: Hicks does say that. I think12 you're right.13 JUSTICE SCALIA: It does say it. I'm just14 saying --15 JUSTICE BREYER: All right.16 But suppose that -- but Wigmore says that the17 words, prima facie case, can be used either to describe18 the Hicks situation, which is the plaintiff produces the19 four elements. The defendant sits silent, and the judge20 says, directed verdict for plaintiff. That's what Hicks21 seems to say. And Wigmore says the words, prima facie22 case, can mean that. But then he says the words, prima23 facie case, can also mean a different thing, and the24 different thing is what the judge says then is, jury, you25 may find for the plaintiff, not you have to. And so I311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 guess our question is which of the two meanings shall we2 take here.3 And my question to be -- to you is, why not the4 second? After all, the whole point of Batson is in5 suspicious circumstances to explore matters further, and6 once you get to the point where you're willing to tell a7 jury, jury, you may, you have suspicious circumstances.8 MR. SCHALIT: Well, Your Honor, in the title VII9 case, I believe that what happens is that the case does go10 to the jury. It is not a directed verdict. It is --11 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if it's not a directed12 verdict, then a fortiori, then every analogy works against13 you.14 MR. SCHALIT: No, Your Honor. To be -- let me15 -- let me be perhaps slightly more precise. It is not a16 directed verdict. It is a requirement for the court to17 instruct the jury to make a finding if -- if in fact it18 finds all the four elements to be true. That is still a19 jury question.20212223 If you're 2425JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  Assuming the four --MR. SCHALIT:  Yes.JUSTICE BREYER:  -- elements, directed verdict.right --MR. SCHALIT:  Right.JUSTICE BREYER:  -- about that, which is what321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 Hicks says --2 MR. SCHALIT: Yes.3 JUSTICE BREYER: -- we have a choice, a fork in4 the road. Take it. All right.5 MR. SCHALIT: Yes.6 JUSTICE BREYER: Which fork? And I put the7 reason why. Your opponents will argue, it seems8 plausibly, take the second fork because we have the9 suspicious circumstance.10 MR. SCHALIT: Because that would upset the11 balance that -- that Batson has drawn. Suspicious12 circumstance was the same type of problem confronted in13 Rosales-Lopez and Ristaino. The Court adopted a14 possibility of a racial bias test for the purpose of15 inquiring of jurors on voir dire as to whether there's16 discrimination for use in a Federal system as a rule of17 criminal process and supervision over the Federal courts.18 It refused to apply that test, which is akin to the test19 adopted by the Ninth Circuit and advocated by petitioner,20 in Ristaino because it recognized that we should not adopt21 a divisive assumption that everything turns on race.22 It would be a very simple matter to inquire of23 jurors on voir dire about their racial biases on a mere24 possibility. The same argument about let us simply25 inquire and find out could be applied. After all,331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 these --2 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: On step one, I take it3 it's not enough to simply say, look, the person challenged4 is a member of a minority group. What more must be shown?56 that that7 that that8 blacks challenged, all four blacks in a case involving a9 black defendant. You must show under the totality of the10 circumstances at Batson -- as Batson says, that there's11 discrimination, and that includes circumstances that may12 refute the case because, as Batson says, the statements of13 the prosecutor and questions --14 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But I'm talking about15 step one.16 MR. SCHALIT: Yes, and this is step one, Your17 Honor.18 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: This is all step one?19 MR. SCHALIT: This is all step one. Batson, at20 page 97, states that a prosecutor's questions and21 statements on voir dire in exercising the challenges may22 support or refute an -- an inference of discrimination.23 The party who is making the claim is in the best position,24 any party who wants to be in, in terms of making a claim25 to a fact finder. He has the fact finder before him.341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-MR. SCHALIT:  No, Your Honor.  I would agreeis simply not enough.  And Batson demonstratesis not enough because in Batson there were four￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425That fact finder has witnessed the same thing as theparty.  They are all professionals and skilled in thisarea.  And if that single juror was struck because ofrace, the party can say that it was the same race as thedefendant if that may be a fact.  It may be that that --there's no apparent explanation because, let's say, it wasa -- another prosecutor who has struck --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why -- why is the defenseattorney in a better position to explain the -- themotives of the prosecutor than the prosecutor?          MR. SCHALIT:  Not --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I don't understand that.          MR. SCHALIT:  Not to explain the motives, YourHonor, but to confront the totality of the circumstancesthat are present in that courtroom that Batson requiresthat party to confront.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The question is what motivatedthe prosecutor.  Correct?          MR. SCHALIT:  Yes.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's hard for me to see howthe -- the defense counsel is in a better position thanthe prosecutor to show that.          MR. SCHALIT:  He's in a better -- he is in theposition to meet his obligation under Batson to explainwhy, given --351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SCALIA:  The question is not whatmotivated the prosecutor unless and until the step oneshowing can be made.          MR. SCHALIT:  Yes, Your Honor, and thank you.That is a more precise response.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But, of course, you can affordto be very rigorous at step two because your threshold atstep one is high.  The threshold is -- if the threshold atstep one is -- is easier to cross, then we could be morerigorous at -- at step two.          MR. SCHALIT:  Step two does not have anypersuasiveness component to it.  There is no rigorousnessto it in my mind.  It is merely a statement of a race-neutral reason or reasons.  It is not the time topersuade, and we know that from Purkett.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And here there was no reasongiven.          MR. SCHALIT:  Here, because there was no primafacie case, Your Honor, yes, there was no reason given.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So why shouldn't this operateas so many things do in -- in an unfolding proceeding?  Ifsomeone stands silent -- and we're not involved with aFifth Amendment privilege -- there's an inference -- anadverse inference.Worse, take a -- a discovery and one plaintiff 361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 asks for discovery from -- from the -- the defendant, and2 the defendant says, sorry, I'm not going to give you what3 you want. What is the consequence of that if the4 defendant, being presented with a opportunity or a5 requirement to give a reason or to produce something,6 says, I won't?7 MR. SCHALIT: There may be an adverse inference8 that would be drawn from that. There might be issue9 preclusion. There might be a termination sanction.10 There's a range, as I understand civil procedure, of -- of11 options that are available.12 In this context, of course, petitioner asserts13 that there could be an adverse inference drawn from14 silence. However, if the standard is, as he proposes,15 that there is simply a mere inference from which16 discrimination can be detected, the silence of the17 striking party may have no informative content.18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But one of the -- if we're19 going to continue with that analogy to someone who says I20 won't make discovery, is not just an inference but that21 you take what the opposing party says to be true on that22 issue.23 MR. SCHALIT: Yes, Your Honor. There -- there24 could be issue preclusion. I assume that's --25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is not -- not issue371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 preclusion. I mean, this is -- that is -- the defendant2 who stands silent is going to lose.3 MR. SCHALIT: Yes, but in -- in this4 circumstance, the -- the striking party's silence is one5 -- when the test is set at the inference level not at the6 more likely than not level, the -- the test is one -- I'm7 sorry -- not the test, but the -- the silence is one of8 strategic judgment. Let me balance the risk of having the9 adverse inference drawn against me against the risk of10 disclosing my trial strategy or my voir dire strategy.11 JUSTICE STEVENS: I must confess I'm a little12 puzzled about the discussion of the trial strategy because13 is it not correct that whenever the judge thinks step one14 has been met, the prosecutor always answers the question?15 MR. SCHALIT: Does always answer the16 question because it is understood that, having shown at17 step one it is more likely than not that there's18 discrimination, silence at step two will result in an19 adverse finding. And --20 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well -- well, whatever it is,21 he -- generally they are not silent when the judge says I22 think step one has been met.23 I want to be sure understand California's24 position on one point. Is it your view in -- in25 California that the judge must decide himself that it is381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425more likely than not that -- that discrimination ispresent before you proceed to step two?          MR. SCHALIT:  Yes, Your Honor.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Now, that is not the test inan ordinary tort case in California, is it?          MR. SCHALIT:  In a case of -- of --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  In an ordinary tort case --          MR. SCHALIT:  No.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- if the judge, at the end ofthe plaintiff's case, says I'm not sure what the answeris, but there is enough evidence here to submit to thejury, so I'm going to overrule the motion for judgment --judgment at the end of the case.  Now, that's a differenttest than you say is appropriate under Batson, is it not?          MR. SCHALIT:  Yes, Your Honor, because in thatcircumstance in deciding --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  So you -- so you have two --in California you have two definitions of a prima faciecase, one for Batson and one for all normal tortlitigation.          MR. SCHALIT:  In California, we like every otherjurisdiction, as far as I know, probably has twodefinitions, just as this Court does.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  And is it not true that thedefinition that your opponent asks for is the same391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425definition that would apply in tort litigation inCalifornia and in most States of the country?          MR. SCHALIT:  Yes.  That is my understanding.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  So you're asking for a specialrule for California's application of Batson.          MR. SCHALIT:  No, Your Honor, because in thatcircumstance --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  It sounds like you are inthat it's a tougher standard than normal.  Here you had asituation, did you not, where there were three blackprospective jurors and the prosecutor struck all three?          MR. SCHALIT:  Yes, Your Honor.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  And could that present enoughevidence that the fact finder, if it were referred to thefact finder, could find a Batson violation?          MR. SCHALIT:  Yes, Your Honor.  Acould make a -- a conclusion from that, but          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  So why is thatfact finderthe --not enough tosatisfy the standard to require the prosecutor to give ananswer?appellatemake thatdraw thatMR. SCHALIT:  Because, for example, theperspective as to whether a fact finder couldconclusion, could any rational finder of factsconclusion.JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Is it because the judge could401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 imagine reasons that the prosecutor might have had?2 MR. SCHALIT: It is not a question of -- of3 imagining reasons, Your Honor. It is a question of the4 judge bringing his or her observation to what has occurred5 in the courtroom, and to return to the example --6 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Would your answer here be7 exactly the same if there had been 12 African American8 prospective jurors and all 12 were struck? Does that make9 a difference?10 MR. SCHALIT: Yes, it might in that the -- the11 inference would be probably -- it would be much stronger12 the greater number you have. But, for example, those 1213 could theoretically all still be defense attorneys.14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but your test is -- is15 that the judge under California law is required to find16 that there's a strong likelihood or a reasonable17 likelihood, but he must do that without hearing the18 prosecutor's reasons. That's your position. Right?19 MR. SCHALIT: Yes, Your Honor. Step one,20 because you do not hear reasons until, under JEB, you've21 gone past step one and get the reasons at step two. Under22 Batson, you do, however, consider information that may23 refute the inference. Batson tells the judge to do that24 and to consider the totality of the circumstance.25 And Justice Stevens's observation about the411111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 difference between the two tests is true, but in the -- in2 the circumstance in which the question is whether it goes3 to the jury to avoid, for example, non-suit, that is4 because there is a fact finder for the case to go to5 separate from the judge, and that fact finder does not6 have to make an intermediate determination. Here the7 court has --8 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but it would be the same9 rule if it was a bench trial. The judge could say to him10 -- say, I think you may have enough but I'm not 10011 percent sure yet. I'd like to hear the defense -- hear12 the rest of the case. He doesn't -- it does not really --13 the -- the definition of a prima facie case does not14 depend on whether it's a jury trial or a bench trial.15 MR. SCHALIT: But it does also turn, Your Honor,16 in part on the nature of the interest at issue, and the17 particular process that the Court set up in Batson to18 create an order -- order -- system of proof and to allow19 the proper balance to be struck between the importance of20 peremptory challenges and their use in selecting a fair21 and unbiased jury and the interest in assuring that there22 has not been a constitutional violation, much for the same23 reason that in Ristaino we do not inquire on mere24 possibility. There are countervailing interests. In25 Ristaino there has to be much more than a mere421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 possibility.2 In Batson, the Court sought to move away from3 the difficult-to-establish standard of Swain to something4 that would be more flexible yet still maintain the State's5 interest in having a peremptory challenge system.6 Your Honors, California does not stand alone in7 its interpretation of this test. As I mentioned earlier,8 there are very few States that have considered this issue.9 Connecticut, Maryland have done what this Court said it --10 they should do, what all courts should do and look at the11 title VII cases. California has done that.12 It has not announced a standard that is13 inconsistent with Batson. It has announced a standard14 that follows from this Court's direction in Batson. It15 has required a shifting burden of production which does16 not occur until there has been either a presumption or a17 strong mass of evidence, to use Wigmore's term.18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think that the19 steps in this case have to be determined by what20 title VII, that whatever we do here should be --21 be, must be the same as what we do in title VII?22 MR. SCHALIT: I think it provides a close23 analogy. It is not -- it is not a perfect fit, no, Your24 Honor. But it does -- but the Court very carefully25 directed parties and courts to look to title VII for 431111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1--- thewe do inshould￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425understanding of the operation of the proof rules.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but perhaps only for --for the operation of, you know, what the various stepsare.  You have to go step one first, step two next, and soforth.          MR. SCHALIT:  Well, Your Honor, I believe thephrasing was that it's explained the operation of primafacie burden of proof rules, and that's the footnote onpage 94, sort of the operation of the burden of proofrules that is at issue here.  And the burden of proof andburden of production rules --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  A lot of people don't readfootnotes.(Laughter.)          MR. SCHALIT:  Well, Your Honor, California'sSupreme Court did.  Connecticut did.(Laughter.)          MR. SCHALIT:  And given the -- given the -- anoccasion to do so, I think that's the appropriate path totake.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could I -- I just confirm myunderstanding of how the jury selection process inCalifornia works?  All the for-cause challenges are -- aremade and ruled upon.  Then there are 12 jurors in the box,and then you make the peremptory challenge juror by juror.441111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 Is that correct?2 MR. SCHALIT: Yes, Your Honor. There may be3 more jurors that have been subject to voir dire if a six4 pack is used, but challenges are only made to those in the5 box when the box is full, there's a full complement of jurors.67 have been 8910JUSTICE KENNEDY:  After the for-cause challenges--MR. SCHALIT:  Yes, Your Honor.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  been exhausted.MR. SCHALIT: Yes, Your Honor. And, of course, 11 in California like elsewhere, peremptories are used12 sometimes13 challenge1415 proper balance between protection interests and the16 State's and parties' interests in using a venerable tool17 for selecting a fair and unbiased juror.to remedy a failure to properly grant afor cause.Your Honors, California's system maintains a18 19 2021 thing? I22 didn't understand it from your brief, that California23 doesn't have any different standard, that they are24 following the same standard that would be applicable in25 Federal court on a Batson challenge. Or did IJUSTICE GINSBURG:  May -- may I just --MR. SCHALIT:  Oh, please.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- ask you to clarify one-- I take it from what you've said, although I451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 misunderstand you?2 MR. SCHALIT: California is following the3 standard that we believe Batson has identified. Now,4 there are certainly Federal courts, such as the Ninth5 Circuit, that disagree with that. And so all Federal6 courts do not do what California believes Batson allows to7 be done. The Ninth Circuit has concluded that8 California's standard is contrary to and an unreasonable9 application of Batson. That's Wade v. Terhune, 202 F.3rd.10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you're not arguing that11 States have flexibility to apply Batson according to12 different procedural rules. You're arguing that the Ninth13 Circuit is wrong about what the Federal standard is.14 MR. SCHALIT: We're arguing, first, the Ninth15 Circuit is wrong and that California's rule is consistent16 with Batson.17 Now, as to whether other rules may apply, Batson18 has a footnote stating that it was not going to attempt to19 instruct courts on how to apply its process. That might20 leave room for other States to come up with alternate21 systems of proof.22 What is important here is that California's23 system is consistent, and as respondent, we are not24 seeking to require all States to do something. Rather, as25 the respondent, it is sufficient that California's process461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 is acceptable just as California's process was acceptable2 in Smith v. Robbins for handling cases in which there are3 no nonfrivolous appeals on issues. A variety of standards4 perhaps could be tolerated.5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Schalit, can you give me6 some reason why I should care a whole lot about this?7 What's the big deal? I mean, so what if we adopt a very8 minimal standard. So what. It just means you have a9 bench conference and the -- and the judge asks, you know10 -- you know, you struck three -- three blacks. It, you11 know, looks suspicious to me. I'm not sure it's more12 likely than not. I'm not sure it's even enough to go to a13 jury, but it looks suspicious to me. Why just -- how come14 you -- you struck all three blacks that were in the15 venire? What is such a big deal about adopting a very --16 a very low standard?1718 interests 1920212223 parties' interest and work product and opinion work24 product and attorney-client privilege and perhaps even the25 defendant's Sixth -- Sixth Amendment right because it mayMR. SCHALIT:  Because it intrudes on otherthat our State --JUSTICE SCALIA:  What?MR. SCHALIT:  It intrudes on --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Like -- like what?MR. SCHALIT:  I believe it intrudes on the471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425require divulgence of those types of confidences.          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  So the State has aninterest in exercising peremptories.          MR. SCHALIT:  Absolutely, Your Honor, yes.Using peremptory challenges to select a fair and unbiasedjury is very important to the State.  Having confidencethat the juries are fair and unbiased is important becauseit allows parties to accept the results of verdicts asbeing a product of a fair and just system.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I agree.  Of course, theState has a -- has an interest in -- in exercisingperemptories.  But -- but why is it important that whetherthe State is doing it in a biased fashion be decided upfront at step one instead of having the parties come tothe judge and say, you know, why did you do it?          MR. SCHALIT:  Because --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's whatwhy that is so important to the State.          MR. SCHALIT:  Because the --essentially cease being peremptory andI can't understand,the challenges                                       become quasi-challenges for cause.  The State has an interest inmaintaining the system as a peremptory challenge systemand in maintaining Sixth Amendment privileges and workproduct.  And it has --JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it still could be -- I 481111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425mean, you're not taking away the peremptory.  You'resaying the -- the prosecutor can give a reason and thejudge says, okay, that passes.  It wouldn't pass for achallenge for cause, but as a peremptory, it's okay.          MR. SCHALIT:  Well, the challenge does ceasebeing peremptory because the Equal Protection Clause hasoverturned the State statute that provides that challenges-- peremptory challenges are challenges for which noreason need be given.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  But Batson overruled that.  Imean, those days are gone.  Tell California to stopworrying about that.(Laughter.)          JUSTICE SCALIA:  You cannot make peremptorychallenges for any reason anymore.  You can't do it forany reason.          MR. SCHALIT:  Absolutely not.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  So they're gone.  Now, once youacknowledge they're gone, what's the big deal about --about having the parties come up to the judge and justexplain to the judge, we didn't do it for a racial reason?          MR. SCHALIT:  Because Batson could have chosento adopt a Connecticut-style strict objection system.  Itdid not do that.  The Court has made a judgment about thenature of peremptories as peremptories as still being491111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 important. Preserving that interest in using those and2 not disclosing trial strategy is important. Having --3 avoiding the risk that a party may respond with4 unarticulable reasons that erroneously won't be believed5 is important. We do not want to chill the exercise of6 challenges for those reasons that are not based on7 discriminatory reasons but are unarticulable.8 JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, in avoiding that9 chill, you're in effect saying the prosecutor10 to one or two free discriminatory challenges.11 MR. SCHALIT: Well, certainly there12 a somewhat different consequence in -- in the13 articulated by petitioner in that the striking party does14 get perhaps a freebie. And California doesn't accept15 that. We've recognized that in State supreme court cases16 there are 1718 bite.192021 one bite. 22232425no substantial free challenges.JUSTICE SOUTER:  The dog is entitled to oneMR.

SCHALIT:  Thank you, Your Honors.  Unlessany further questions.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.Mr. Bedrick, you have 4 minutes left.REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. BEDRICK      ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. BEDRICK:  Here the prosecutor perempted all10 three black jurors and left a black defendant to be tried11 by an all-white jury in a racially tinged case. These12 facts indisputably present an inference of discrimination.13 The -- my opponent suggests that silence may be14 a strategic decision. But we have yet to locate any --15 any case where any prosecutor anywhere in a situation16 remotely like this has chosen silence as the proper17 strategy. The purpose of Batson is -- is to elicit18 reasons from the prosecutor and then for the trial court19 to evaluate those reasons and determine whether or not,20 looking at the -- all the circumstances and the21 prosecutor's credibility and the type of case, whether or22 not their challenge is race-based. Reasons are crucial.23 In the appendix to our opening brief, we24 examined 84 cases in the last couple years where25 discrimination was found in violation of Batson. In511111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 virtually all of these cases, the decision turned on the2 evaluation of the articulated reason. In some of those,3 the articulated reason was unsupported by the record.4 From that, there was an inference and a finding of5 discrimination. In others of those, the articulated6 reason applied to many white jurors who were not7 challenged. All those facts existed here.8 The goals of Batson, which are admirable and9 important, which should apply in all 50 States, not just10 in 48, require -- need the reasons to be elicited because11 Batson won't work unless reasons are known and examined12 and ruled on on the merits and a record is made.13 We'd ask this Court to bring California into the14 mainstream and ask that reasons be called for in15 California under the same standard that they're called for16 everywhere else.17 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.18 Schalit.19 The case is submitted.20 (Whereupon, at 11:46 a.m., the case in the21 above-entitled matter was submitted.)22 23 24 251111 14th Street, NW Suite 40052 1-Washington, DC 20005￼1531111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-
