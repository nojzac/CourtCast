D. Warren Company versus Maine Board ofEnvironmental Protection.          Mr. Kayatta.       ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. KAYATTA, JR.,                ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER          MR. KAYATTA:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it -- and may it please the Court:          The Presumpscot River is a single body ofwater, as that term was used in last year's Miccosukeedecision.  Warren's position is that the flowing ofthat single body of water through Warren's five dams isnot a discharge into that same single body of water.In arguing that certification under section 401 of theClean Water Act is, therefore, not required, we are notmaintaining that the State either has, or should have,no voice on matters of water quality in connection withthe relicensing of these dams.          In 1986, Congress took care to ensure Statesa forceful, but not controlling, voice on environmentalissues, including water quality issues, in allhydropower relicensing proceedings.  Congress was veryspecific about its intent in 1986, and it intended to31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425give States a strong voice, but not a veto.  So, wefeel the case -- that the States clearly have thatvoice.Now --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Kayatta, if Itook a drum of water out of the river and put it in thegarage next to the river for 5 years, and, 5 yearslater, came out and poured that drum of water back intothe river, is that a discharge into the river?          MR. KAYATTA:  Yes, that would be a dischargeinto the river.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How is it differenthere, where you have the dam restraining the waters fora certain period, and then it's being released later,at a subsequent time?  Why --          MR. KAYATTA:  Yes.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- isn't that also adischarge?          MR. KAYATTA:  There is -- we draw adistinction -- and I'm referring just to discharge, I'mnot addressing the issue that the Court could get to inanother case of whether you actually need a dischargeof a pollutant, as to just a discharge into the river -- we draw a distinction between actually removingsomething entirely from the river, exercising control41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 over it. Your hypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice, had it2 for 5 years. In that situation, one could say that3 there may be a discharge into the river when an4 activity is proposed to pour that back into the river.5 In a -- in the dams -- the dams, the water6 continuously flows down. The water never leaves the7 single body of water called the Presumpscot. And8 that's the distinction that we would draw.9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though it's10 retained in a -- what -- an impoundment pool, or11 whatever, behind --12 MR. KAYATTA: Well, the dams slow down the13 water as it comes down the Presumpscot. And because14 the dams slow down the water, then the river widens in15 an area called an impoundment area. But the -- there16 is a continuous motion leaving the dam in the same17 amount of 181920 different21 other words, that the water is released --22 it's released on the weekends, but, during23 has to build up in the -- you would draw a24 and say there's a discharge, in that case?25 MR. KAYATTA: Mr. Chief Justice,51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  1-water that comes into the area above the dam.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, this --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, you think it's acase if it's not a continuous motion; inyou know,the week, itdistinctiontheWashington, DC 20005￼1 distinction we would draw would be when the exercise2 over the water, and the separation of the water from3 the river, reach the point where it could be said that4 we're no longer dealing with one unitary body of water,5 as that term is defined in Miccosukee. If we --6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But this is an important7 point for me, and I wasn't quite clear what the briefs8 told me about it. My understanding was that there is9 an argument that when the water stays in the reservoir,10 the impoundment area, that there's a stratification,11 and the oxygen components at different levels change,12 so that when the water goes back into the dam, it's13 qualitatively different. It's the same water, in a14 sense, but it's also qualitatively different in its15 oxygen and other characteristics. And that sounded to16 me like a discharge.17 MR. KAYATTA: Yes. The -- there is -- there18 is no dispute that when one changes the movement of19 water and its flow, then characteristics of the water20 can change. For example, in the impoundment area you21 can have not a change, overall, of temperature, but a22 stratification of warmer water going to the top, colder23 water going to the bottom. Similarly, you can have24 changes in other aspects of the water. All of those25 have been classified by the EPA as nonpoint source61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 pollution. And it is undisputed that 401 does not2 cover nonpoint source solution -- pollution. So --3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't --4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, if --5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't --6 JUSTICE STEVENS: But is it --7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, if it were established8 in this case that the water is qualitatively changed in9 a significant degree because of its oxygen component,10 that would be irrelevant to the question you're asking?11 MR. KAYATTA: The water, as it comes into the12 dam and in the impoundment area, there is a -- there13 are findings, that we are not here challenging, that14 that water changes as it comes into the impoundment15 area. The discharge of that water -- that water then16 flows through the dam on its way down the river. There17 is nothing -- there is no nexus between the water18 exiting the dam and any of the changes that Your Honor19 has pointed to.20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you --21 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying the changes22 occur in the river, above the dam; and, therefore,23 what's left -- what's let back into the river below the24 dam is the same river, unchanged.25 MR. KAYATTA: We're saying that the river71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425flows continuously down.  It changes at various pointsas it goes down a river.  As it goes through rapids, ariver changes.  The nature of a river changes as itgoes over rapids.  As it comes --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Now, let me just be sure Iunderstand one point fully.  But the character of thewater is different above the dam and below the dam.          MR. KAYATTA:  No.  The character of the water--          JUSTICE STEVENS:  I thought you agreed thatthere was a different -- a different oxygen content inthe water.          MR. KAYATTA:  The water -- take the -- Mr.Chief Justice's barrel of water that has not beenremoved from the river -- it comes down the river.  Itchanges as it goes down the river.  It is potentiallychanged in the impoundment area.  It then flows throughthe dam.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  No.          MR. KAYATTA:  The same water that went intothe dam --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes, but it's the samewater, with a slightly different chemical composition,isn't that true?MR. KAYATTA: It's the same water that went 81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 into the dam as comes out of the dam.23 different 4567891011 to Justice Kennedy's question, you said that there was12 nothing, I think, as you put it, in the exiting of the13 water that was significantly different that -- or that14 we could peg as significantly different. But that15 seems to me to be at odds with your answer to the Chief16 Justice's question about the barrel, because the17 exiting of the water from the barrel and the exiting of18 the water from the dam are exactly the same. And if19 one is a discharge, I don't see why the other isn't a20 discharge.21 MR. KAYATTA: Well, the difference, we would22 say, is that, in the barrel hypothetical, the water has23 been -- the water that is put into the river from the24 barrel that has been in someone's garage for 5 years --25 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then it isn't the exiting91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-JUSTICE STEVENS:  But with a slightlychemical composition.MR. KAYATTA:  Than it was further --JUSTICE STEVENS:  Am I correct --MR. KAYATTA:  -- up the river.JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- when I say that?MR. KAYATTA:  Yes, you are.JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you.JUSTICE SOUTER:  But you said -- in response￼1 that you're getting at. And I --2 MR. KAYATTA: Well, we --3 JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, it seems to me --4 and I don't want to make a joke, but I think you're on5 to something when you talk about the exiting, because6 the word "discharge," as we commonly use it, is a word7 that describes how you get rid of something. And how8 you get rid of something, it seems to me, is exactly9 the same, whether you're pouring the barrel over the10 bank or whether pouring the barrel, as it were, through11 the turbine after impounding it, it is the --12 everybody's been quoting dictionary definitions -- it's13 the "flowing out." The flowing out is the same with14 the barrel as it is with the dam.15 MR. KAYATTA: The difference --16 JUSTICE SOUTER: And that seems to me where I17 have trouble with your argument.18 MR. KAYATTA: Yes, Justice Souter. The19 difference is the "discharge into." To have something20 "discharge into the river," you need something21 different than the river to go into the river.22 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, as I understand it, in23 some or all of these dams, at the point of discharge,24 there isn't any river down there. It's dry. It's --25 the bed, in effect, has been deprived of the river by101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 the impoundment, so that you're not simply, as it were,2 taking, you know, one spoonful out here and dropping it3 into a river -- putting the spoonful back into a river4 that's flowing there, because it isn't flowing there,5 as a result of your dam.6 MR. KAYATTA: But the -- if you accept the7 proposition that the river is divided into two8 different things, then you can start to talk about a9 discharge of one thing into the other. But Miccosukee10 makes clear that the structure of a dam does not keep11 us from viewing this as a single body of water which12 flows through a dam. It does not flow "into the13 navigable waters"; the navigable waters themselves flow14 through the dam.15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Miccosukee assumed that --16 the soup ladle example from the Second Circuit; you17 took out the ladle, you held it up, and you put the18 same thing back. But if I understand what happens as a19 result of the impoundment of the water and then its20 release, what comes out is quite different from what21 was put in. It's kind of like you had a pot boiling22 with vegetables, and then you put it through a food23 processor, and then what you got out would be quite24 different from what went into the food processor.25 MR. KAYATTA: Yes. And, again, we don't111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 dispute that there are nonpoint source changes in the2 water as it flows down the river, before it goes3 through the dam. The water that then goes in and emits4 --5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the descriptions6 that we had was, it is a result of the impoundment and7 the subsequent release that the water emerges in this8 unnatural state, in this striated state that Justice9 Kennedy was referring to.10 MR. KAYATTA: Yes. The -- it is the11 impoundment that changes the nature of the water.12 JUSTICE SCALIA: And not the release. You13 contest that the release makes any change.14 MR. KAYATTA: The release simply continues15 the flow of that water, albeit however it has been16 changed by mechanisms other than discharges into the17 river.18 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's true, but --19 so, you said it's conceded in this case? I thought, in20 answer to Justice Kennedy, you said something that -- I21 was surprised, if it's conceded. I thought it wasn't22 conceded -- tell me if I'm wrong -- that the States23 have water quality standards. Those water quality24 standards may or may not have something to do with25 point source discharges. They don't have to. They121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425want water to be good enough for recreation.  They wantwater without algae so there are more fish.  They havea lot of things.  And this statute seems to say the F--- what used to be the FPC.  I -- is it now FERC?          MR. KAYATTA:  Yes, it is, Your Honor.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, okay -- used to be theFederal Power Commission -- tells them, "You have toget approval to build your dam.  And we're not going togive you approval unless you comply with State waterquality standards."  This seems to me to go back intoancient history, like 1920.  And of course you have tocomply.  And so, isn't the purpose of -- is thereagreement that it only concerns point discharges, ordoes it concern water quality standards?          MR. KAYATTA:  The consistent position of theEPA all along has been that 401 requires a dischargefrom a point source before it applies.          JUSTICE BREYER:  Really?          MR. KAYATTA:  Yes.          JUSTICE BREYER:  In other words -- dischargefrom a point source, what is -- well, then EPA concedesyou win?          MR. KAYATTA:  No.  EPA is claiming that thedischarge from a point source occurs as the water exitsthe dam --131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, fine.2 MR. KAYATTA: -- not in the --3 JUSTICE BREYER: So, what's --4 MR. KAYATTA: -- impoundment.5 JUSTICE BREYER: -- the problem? So, they're6 saying, as I thought was true since 1920, that you're7 going to get your dam only if you comply with State8 standards, including standards about fish, algae, junk9 in the water, all kinds of things that might be put10 there by the dam.11 MR. KAYATTA: Well, the -- 401 is a12 triggering, or a threshold determination, as set forth13 in one of this Court's prior decisions, that gives the14 State not just a voice, but essentially a mandatory15 veto over a very broad area. The question in this case16 is, have we triggered -- have we stepped over that17 threshold? The point that there is no disagreement18 between the parties on is that to step over that19 threshold, to trigger 401, one has to have a discharge20 into the navigable waters --21 JUSTICE BREYER: Right. And they're saying,22 "Of course there is a discharge. The discharge is a23 discharge of water." Okay? The water runs into it.24 Now, that's enough for you to have to comply with the25 State standards before the F- -- FERC is going to give141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 you a license.2 MR. KAYATTA: No, their position is precisely3 that the water is running into the water.4 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, have you got anything -5 - I've heard you argue about the word "discharge"; and6 you say "discharge" doesn't mean "discharge of water,"7 it means something else. And I think that's a very8 logical argument. Is there any other argument that9 you'd have, related to the purpose of the statute for10 the objective?11 MR. KAYATTA: Yes. Let me refer to the12 purpose. There's -- as is always the case, there are13 general pronouncements about purpose. And the14 Respondents have taken those general pronouncements to15 basically say, "Anything that allows the States greater16 control or improvement over water quality is the17 direction in which the statute should be interpreted,18 to achieve that general purpose." However, we know19 that, notwithstanding the general purposes, that20 Congress, when it turned to approve specific words in21 401, did not simply say "anything that affects water22 quality." It divided a line. And that line, for23 example, means that Federal permits for grazing, or24 Federal permits for logging roads, do not trigger 401;25 and they do not trigger it, because there is no151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 discharge from a point source.2 So, we know a line has been drawn by Congress3 in pursuit of its purpose, as compared to other goals4 that Congress has in mind. The question is, Where was5 that line drawn? We think you look to the statute to6 see where that was drawn, and it was "discharge into7 the navigable waters." Otherwise, what we're left with8 is, we're left with trying to, sort of, almost9 metaphysically think of the water discharge --10 water discharging into the same water in order11 a conclusion that the real way you should read12 statute is just as if it says, "If one does anything at13 all to the water, you need to get certification." And14 we don't think it says that. It would --15 JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Counsel, I keep16 thinking of this example, and I want you to comment on17 it. Out West, of course, there are a lot of dams where18 there are salmon in the -- in the river, going down,19 and a lot of salmon get killed if they go through the -20 - through the dam, so that the water before the dam has21 live salmon, and the water after that has dead22 And say that happened in Maine. Would that be23 a discharge if that happened?24 MR. KAYATTA: The --25 JUSTICE STEVENS: If there were live 161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  1-salmon.fish --Washington, DC 20005the sameto reachthe￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. KAYATTA:  Yes.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- above the dam, and theyall -- they get killed going through the dam, and theywere dead when they --          MR. KAYATTA:  Yes.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- came out, would that bea discharge in --          MR. KAYATTA:  Actually, the record here wouldindicate that that -- that could happen with some eels,not salmon.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes.          MR. KAYATTA:  So, your point is well taken,Justice Stevens.  The fish that, as the water flowsthrough the dam, may be killed by coming in contactwith, and getting hit by, the turbine, are notdischarged into the water; they're in the water as itgoes into the dam, they're killed as it goes throughthe dam, they remain in the water.nothing.would not                          The dam dischargesIt puts nothing  --JUSTICE STEVENS:  So, youMR. KAYATTA:  -- into theJUSTICE STEVENS:  -- evenbe a statutory discharge.MR. KAYATTA:  That's correct, Your Honor.  Wethink that --171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-would say --river.in that case, that￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you don't2 dispute that FERC could impose the same conditions that3 Maine has imposed in this case, as a matter of FERC4 authority.5 MR. KAYATTA: Exactly. And we would --6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could they even7 impose something in the condition to your hydroelectric8 power license saying, "You must comply with State water9 quality standards"?10 MR. KAYATTA: I think they could -- I'm not11 sure they could word it that way, but they could12 effectively -- FERC could effectively do it. In13 effect, Congress has told FERC that in a -- in a14 Federal -- in a FERC proceeding, it not only has to15 listen to the State, but it has to give considerable16 consideration to the State's arguments. And it has to17 --18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, you're concerned19 about conditions -- I mean, as a practical matter, in20 terms of how the result in this case would change21 things, it's a question of whether FERC has to more or22 less accept what the State does, or whether FERC simply23 considers and decides whether it wants to impose those24 conditions.25 MR. KAYATTA: That's correct. And it's a181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 very substantial issue, because essentially what FERC2 proceedings are -- under the hydropower sections of3 FERC, essentially what they are is environmental4 proceedings, where there's a determination made about5 water quality issues that are then balanced off against6 energy issues. If the -- under prior interpretations,7 the 401 powers have become quite robust. If we now8 take the threshold of "discharge into the navigable9 waters," and interpret that in a way so it essentially10 applies in all situations, FERC proceedings essentially11 will be a mail office, where they receive the12 conditions from the State and have no choice but to13 file them -- follow them. Our position is that14 Congress intended to leave some room --15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You would rather be16 regulated more aggressively by FERC than by the Maine17 Board of Environmental Protection.18 MR. KAYATTA: That's correct. It would have19 a uniform national energy and environmental policy, in20 that respect. And we believe that -- Congress, in '86,21 clearly thought that's what we had. That's the -- it22 would make no sense, in Congress in '86, to order FERC23 to give weight to what the States say in these24 situations if what we're now told is, "Congress was25 wasting your time, because the States already had a191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 mandatory veto on all of these issue -- issues in every2 single situation with respect to every single3 hydropower licensing" --4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does FERC --5 MR. KAYATTA: -- "proceeding."6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- as a regulator,7 tend to give greater priority to power considerations,8 as opposed to local environmental concerns?9 MR. KAYATTA: There was some concern prior to10 '86 by Congress that FERC was doing just that. And11 that's why Congress told, in 1986, long after the12 statute was passed, that FERC has to make specific13 findings if it disagrees with the State. Additionally,14 Congress gave to the Department of Interior, under15 section 18, certain powers to dictate to FERC, for16 example, fish passages. FERC has no choice on those.17 So, Congress -- this reference to cooperative18 federalism clearly was in Congress's mind, but it19 wasn't a cooperative federalism in which, on all issues20 in all proceedings, all the State needed to do is tell21 FERC what to do. But they --22 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, but it doesn't -- it23 doesn't say -- it says they have to comply with State24 water quality standards, doesn't it?25 MR. KAYATTA: It doesn't -- Congress did not201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 order, in 1986, FERC to always comply in all situations2 --3 JUSTICE BREYER: No, I thought -- it says4 that you have to get your permit. You have to be5 compliant with State water quality standards. Now,6 suppose a State has a nutty water quality standard.7 Doesn't EPA have some authority there to make sure that8 a water quality standard of a State, under the Clean9 Water Act, is -- makes sense?10 MR. KAYATTA: Well, EPA has some authority11 with respect to any State water quality standards that12 are less stringent than EPO's -- EPA's own13 requirements. It's not clear that EPA, under the Act,14 has the ability to go beyond that. Moreover, it's --15 if --16 JUSTICE BREYER: In other words, if a State17 were to say, "Our water quality standard is the18 following. We never build a dam in our State, no19 matter what." Okay? Now, there's no authority in the20 EPA to set that aside as it not being a properCleanCleanWashington, DC 2000521 Water Act 222324 Water Act 25standard.MR. KAYATTA:  If this decision is --JUSTICE BREYER:  It has to be just astandard.MR. KAYATTA:  Yes.211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  1-￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not an expert on the2 Clean Water Act. Is that a proper Clean Water Act3 standard?4 MR. KAYATTA: If this decision is affirmed,5 then you will have precisely held --6 JUSTICE BREYER: No, this decision -- I'm not7 asking you about this decision. I'm asking you if a8 State, under the Clean Water Act, were to say, "We have9 the following Clean" -- now you understand what I'm --10 MR. KAYATTA: Yes.11 JUSTICE BREYER: Does EPA, or anyone else,12 have authority to say, "That isn't a proper Clean Water13 Act standard, however good you may think it is"?14 MR. KAYATTA: I don't know, Justice Breyer,15 about the wording posed in your hypothetical, so I16 can't answer the wording. I can say this, that17 effectively the States can do precisely that by simply18 saying, "We want the river water quality to be like X,19 and X is inconsistent with there being any dam at all20 on the river." So, indeed, if this decision is21 affirmed, it truly does mean that States can entirely22 dictate everything having to do with any environmental23 aspects of dams, including to the point of requiring24 that the dams not operate; and FERC can do nothing25 about it. We do -- we do not see how that would leave221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 any sense of cooperative federalism, and it would tell2 Congress, "In 1986, you were just entirely wasting your3 time, because you had already, in '72, given them the4 power to control everything."5 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, has FERC said that this6 is a problem, that the States are interfering?7 MR. KAYATTA: Well, FERC has sort of been all8 over the place. They're sort of the odd man out,9 because it's their jurisdiction that's being taken10 away; and yet we're talking about a Clean Water Act11 case where EPA is the agency defined with that Act.12 FERC has argued to the courts, on several occasions,13 that 401 needs to be limited to discharge of14 pollutants. FERC, at one point, the first several dam15 proceedings that came up, it didn't even require16 certifications at all. It then promulgated17 certification requirements that said, "Either get a18 certification or otherwise comply with the law." And19 then, in the interim period, it is simply -- as we've20 been affected, simply said, "Go get your21 certifications." It then tried to say, "But we can do22 something about it if we don't like them." And the23 Circuit Courts, at least one, has said, "No, you24 can't."25 And when 401 applies, as this Court found in231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 Public Utility Districts versus Jefferson, it is a2 robust power. It is an awesome power that is given to3 the States under 401. And to -- giving that power4 greatly cabined-in FERC's authority to now extend that5 power automatically to any conduct that in any way6 "touches on the water" by turning "touches on the7 water" or8 water" --9"moving the water" into "discharge into theeffectively wipes out that balance entirely.I would note, too, that we don't even -- we10 can answer all of this without even getting into those11 by going back to the statute. We have a statute here12 that uses the word "discharge," in one form or another,13 on 421 occasions in 37 different sections of the14 statute. With the exception of the section that deals15 with the discharge of employees -- not into the river -16 - and the discharge --17 [Laughter.]18 MR. KAYATTA: -- and the discharge of board19 duties, in every single one of those instances, as you20 thumb through the statute, Congress is always clearly21 talking about "putting something into the water."22 There is no doubt. On the one occasion in the statute23 --24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I don't25 understand, linguistically, why this isn't "putting241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 something into the water," to the extent the dam holds2 back and restrains the water, then it "puts back into3 the water" the water that it had held back.4 MR. KAYATTA: Well, the water slows down,5 meanders around, as it would in an eddy, and continues6 on through the dam, down the river. If you take a7 water molecule, it comes down, goes through and out.8 If -- unless you get --9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Here's -- I'm10 thinking of the Hoover Dam, and it's got these huge,11 you know, discharge points.12 MR. KAYATTA: Yes.13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And every now and14 then they let the water come out. Isn't that a15 discharge?16 MR. KAYATTA: The -- I would say, in an17 ordinary dictionary definition, if you stand below the18 Hoover Dam and look up at it, you would say, "Water is19 emitting from the dam. Water is discharging from the20 dam," in an ordinary dictionary definition. I would21 agree with that.22 What I'm saying, though, is that if you keep23 in mind that it's not a reservoir emitting into a24 river, but it's a single river flowing through the dam,25 that water is not "discharging into" that water.251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425That's what we're saying.          JUSTICE ALITO:  Would it be fair to say that,let's say, the Missouri River discharges into theMississippi?  Is that consistent with ordinary usage?          MR. KAYATTA:  If you have two water bodies,then you could have one discharging into the other.Yes, Your Honor.          JUSTICE ALITO:  But they're two water bodies,only because people gave them two different names.          MR. KAYATTA:  Well, in Miccosukee, the Courtactually go into that and set forth -- in fact,remanded the case to decide whether the aquifer was onewater body or two.  If you look at that remand, it'sabsolutely clear that this water body, under anystandard discussed in that opinion, would be a singlewater body.  And the United States agrees with us onthat.  The United States agrees we're talking about asingle water body here.          JUSTICE ALITO:  But the --          MR. KAYATTA:  And I could --          JUSTICE ALITO:  -- the statute doesn't say"discharge from one water body into another waterbody."  It says "discharge into the navigable waters."          MR. KAYATTA:  Yes.          JUSTICE ALITO:  And if the portion of the261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 river below the dam is a navigable water, why is there2 not a pouring forth of the water into the navigable3 waters below the dam?4 MR. KAYATTA: Well, if one thinks of upstream5 waters and downstream waters, it -- our view is that6 upstream waters simply become downstream waters as they7 flow through the dam. One doesn't discharge into8 another.9 I would -- I would concede that very bright10 people working very hard with virtually any words in11 the English language can find some way to reach a point12 to say that perhaps something fits something. But, at13 some point -- at some point, I think we need to ask, is14 -- if Congress uses the same word throughout the15 statute to always mean putting something into water,16 then how do we get to the conclusion that what that17 really means is doing anything to the water is always -18 - because --19 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, isn't --20 MR. KAYATTA: -- the --21 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- isn't the answer to your22 question that a great number of those usages that you23 refer to are uses that refer to the discharge of24 pollutants? And there is a good -- there are good25 reasons in the statute -- and we have recognized them -271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 - to say that when you discharge a pollutant, you are2 adding something that wasn't there before? But when3 the statute, in this case, is using "discharge" without4 a reference to "pollutant," it makes perfectly good5 linguistic sense to construe it just as the Court has6 done.7 MR. KAYATTA: Well it makes -- it is8 linguistically logical to say that we're, therefore,9 going to assume that a pollutant is not needed here.10 But when Congress has replaced the "discharge of a11 pollutant" with a "discharge into," it seems to me12 Congress has actually moved in the other direction of13 reinforcing that we're talking about --14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, maybe it's --15 MR. KAYATTA: -- putting something into the16 water.17 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- "reinforcing," and maybe18 it's "changing." I mean, you're characterizing it one19 way. We start with a different canon of meaning, and20 that is that we look to the words around which, in21 connection with which, the word is used. In here, it's22 being used without certain modifiers or descriptive23 conditions. In other cases, it is being used with24 them. And that's a good reason to think that probably25 the word is intended to mean something different in281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 those situations.2 MR. KAYATTA: Well, I would -- I would3 hesitate, Justice Souter, to go from taking a specific4 word, like "discharge," and, therefore, saying that it5 meant something that is both more general and much more6 easily set.7 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but your argument, I8 thought, was simply this, that it uses "discharge" in,9 you know, X number -- I forget how many you had -- and10 it's perfectly clear that in most of those instances it11 requires an addition; and, therefore, it should be12 construed as requiring it here. My point was that in a13 great many of those instances, the statute is not14 merely using the word in isolation; it's using it in15 connection with a couple of other words, like16 "discharge a pollutant." And it, therefore, number17 one, makes sense to construe "discharge of a pollutant"18 differently from "discharge." That's the -- that's the19 only point.20 MR. KAYATTA: Yes.21 JUSTICE SOUTER: The only point is, you can't22 simply argue from the fact that the word occurs somehow23 X number of times to the conclusion that it has to mean24 the same thing every time it's used.25 MR. KAYATTA: I agree with you. And my point291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 is, I am including instances not just in which2 "pollutant" is used. A whole variety. And, in every3 single one of those, its common -- and I would submit4 that the word itself, when you use the word "into,"5 naturally suggests -- in fact, why would someone use6 the phrase "discharge into the navigable waters" if7 what they really meant was, "If you do anything to the8 navigable waters at all, you've got to get a permit"?9 JUSTICE SOUTER: Because that isn't what they10 mean. I mean, for example, if somebody puts a stick in11 the middle of the river, no one -- no one is claiming12 that the water that flows around the stick is being13 discharged. I mean, there are a lot -- I don't know14 whether anyone wants to put a stick in the river, but -15 -16 MR. KAYATTA: Yes.17 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- there are things you can18 do that clearly would not activate the Corps'19 interpretation here.20 MR. KAYATTA: I -- this logic, I think, would21 probably include virtually anything you do to the22 water, because it would separate the water, the water23 going around the stick. One would then say the24 dictionary definition means it's then discharging back25 into itself on the other side of the stick. There301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 would be, perhaps, no water quality concerns, but 4012 doesn't say "water quality concerns"; it says3 "discharge into."4 JUSTICE SOUTER: Would you agree that if the5 -- if somebody with property on each side wanted to6 build a dam -- I'm sorry, wanted to build a bridge to7 connect his property, and he needed to put a post in8 the middle of the river to support the bridge, that9 there would be no discharge of water occasioned by10 putting the post in there?11 MR. KAYATTA: Under the Government's12 interpretation, there would be. There would be a13 discharge into the navigable waters in that situation.14 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why, if -- you may answer.15 MR. KAYATTA: Because the post -- to put --16 well, in the first place, putting the post in might,17 itself, be a -- what we could concede to be a18 discharge. In the second case, though, is that we19 understand that you would be exercising control over20 the flow and direction of that water, it would separate21 the river into two portions -- of course, small. But22 if we're pursuing this line of logic that the23 Government has to its final extent, it would then24 discharge back into itself on the other side of that25 post.311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.          General Rowe?            ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. STEVEN ROWE                ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT          MR. ROWE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          The flow of water through Petitioner's damsinto the Presumpscot River is a discharge, undersection 401(a) of the Clean Water Act.  This finding issupported by the plain text of section 401(a), thepurpose, the history, and the structure of the CleanWater Act, in more than 30 years of administrativepractice and agency interpretation.  Under the CleanWater Act, Congress --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is there a --          MR. ROWE:  -- requires --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is there a dischargeif you have a simple waterwheel in the river?  Is thata discharge?          MR. ROWE:  Well, first of all, Your Honor,for 401 to apply there must be a federally licensedactivity.  In that case --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, so it's a oldhydroelectric plant, it uses a simple waterwheel.  Imean, is that -- does that fit your definition of a321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425"discharge"?  In other words, it restrains the watertemporarily.          MR. ROWE:  Yes, Your Honor.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And then it releasesit again as it passes by the wheel.          MR. ROWE:  Yes, Your Honor.  It --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, if you put awaterwheel in a flowing river, under your definition,that's a discharge into the navigable water.          MR. ROWE:  It could, Your Honor.  It coulddischarge.  It depends on the actual circumstances.Obviously, under the doctrine of de minimis non curatlex, it may not pose any problems, and it wouldn't bean issue.  But certainly to the extent that it used thewater and then it discharged the water, there wasemitting out or flowing out.     If you put a fishnet in the river, there would beno discharge.  Justice Souter's example of a simple --a post, probably no discharge.  But if you put ahundred-foot -- a post 100 foot in diameter into a 200-foot-wide river, then you may have a discharge.  So,Your Honor, I would suggest it depends on thecircumstances.  But, remember, 401 does require it tobe a federally licensed project.The point I was going to make, Your Honor, is 331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that, under the Clean Water Act, Congress requires2 States to 345adopt clean water standards --JUSTICE SCALIA:  I must say, this --MR. ROWE:  -- water quality standards.JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- this doesn't seem to me6 normal usage. I don't think if -- you know, if you see7 a rapids in a river, it would be strange to say the8 rapids of the Colorado "discharge" into the Colorado.9 You're usually talking about a different body of water.10 You could say the Green River discharges into the11 Colorado. Likewise, a waterfall, you wouldn't say, you12 know, "The waterfall on this river discharges into the13 river." It's part of the river. But if it were a14 waterfall that brought a tributary into the river, you15 would then say that, you know, "the waterfall16 discharges into the Colorado," or whatever river it17 enters at that point. It seems to me very strange to18 talk about a river discharging into itself.19 MR. ROWE: Justice Scalia, it's not strange20 at all. It's not -- it's discharging from the activity21 into the river. The water goes into the activity. The22 activity, in this case, is a -- an impoundment. There23 are five impoundments. These dams create impoundments.24 One's 197 acres --25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that doesn't --341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 but that --2 MR. ROWE: -- in size.3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that doesn't4 matter to your analysis. It's the one post, right? I5 mean, if you have just sort of a foot indentation on6 either side, would -- the flows, in -- under your view,7 suddenly becomes a discharge.8 MR. ROWE: Your Honor, my point is, that's9 not the case we have. We're talking about a10 hydroelectric dam here.11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but --12 MR. ROWE: But --13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- we're trying to --14 MR. ROWE: But --15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- define --16 MR. ROWE: I understand, Your Honor.17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- a statutory term18 that's going to apply in a wide variety of cases.19 MR. ROWE: Yes. In that case, Your Honor,20 I've said it could cause a discharge -- if the flow was21 interrupted, the flow regimen of the river, to such an22 extent that it -- that it increased, substantially, the23 flow on one side, and that was a federally licensed24 activity, then 401 would apply. It would be a25 discharge from the activity.351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          Now, I'm -- again, I'm using the de minimisrule here.  But what we have here, Your Honors, is adam, we have the water being diverted into a powercanal, then dropping down onto the top of the turbines. The turbines are using the water, they're taking theenergy from the water to turn the turbine, and then thewater is being released.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So, what's --          MR. ROWE:  It's being discharged.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So, what's the definition -- what's the general definition that you're giving usthat describes this result you've given?          MR. ROWE:  Justice --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It --          MR. ROWE:  -- Kennedy --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It is a discharge, becausea "discharge" means what?          MR. ROWE:  It means a flowing or issuing out. It's the -- it is the dictionary definition.  Mr.Kayatta mentioned the Hoover Dam.  It is that.  That'swhat it is.  It's the --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  But the --          MR. ROWE:  -- ordinary definition.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- the issue is not whetherthere is a discharge, as I see it. The issue is 361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 whether there's a "discharge into the river." And one2 does not usually speak of the "river discharging into3 itself." That -- it's the "into" that's the crucial4 part. How do you distinguish this case from5 Miccosukee, if I'm saying it right? -- yes, Miccosukee6 --7 89 pumping of10 and it was11 discharge?1213 that was a 14MR. ROWE:  Well, Your Honor, Miccosukee --JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- where we had, you know, a water from one polluted body into another, held -- we held that that was not aMR. ROWE:  Your Honor, the -- in Miccosukee, section 402 case.JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's right.MR. ROWE:  And this --JUSTICE SCALIA:  But the crucial --MR. ROWE:  -- Court held --JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- word was "discharge."JUSTICE SCALIA:  It --MR. ROWE:  It dealt with discharge of a1516 pollutant. 171819202122 The reason23 there was no pollutant. It was clear that there was a24 pollutant. But we held there was no discharge.25 MR. ROWE: No, Your Honor, you held thatwe held it was not covered is not because371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 there was no discharge of the pollutant. You held that2 it was --34 discharge5 - on both6 the case.7 did was that we held there was no discharge of a8 pollutant.9JUSTICE SCALIA:  Because there was noof a pollutant.  There were pollutants in -sides.  That -- I think that was conceded inThe reason that the case came out the way itMR. ROWE:  But there -- Your Honor -- Yourthat case, it required a discharge of afrom a point source.  The definition of10 Honor, in11 pollutant12 "discharge" in section 401 is much broader.13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wasn't it conceded that14 there was a pollutant -- that a pollutant was involved15 in that case?16 MR. ROWE: Your -- yes, Your Honor, but the -17 -18 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, what must have been the19 difference was that there was no discharge.20 MR. ROWE: There was no discharge of a21 pollutant, Your Honor.22 JUSTICE SCALIA: There was no discharge of23 anything. It was clear that if there was a -- if there24 was a discharge, it was a discharge of a pollutant.25 MR. ROWE: Your Honor, in -- with all due381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 respect, in that case -- and, in that case, you joined2 Justice Thomas in saying, "The term 'discharge' is not3 defined in the Clean Water Act, but its plain and4 ordinary meaning suggests a flowing or issuing out, or5 something that is emitted." In the case we have here,6 something is emitted. It is water. It is emitted7 from a facility. We have a federally licensed8 facility. And out of the turbines comes water, and it9 flows into the river. Miccosukee was a 402 case, Your10 Honor, with all due respect.11 And, in another point, I --12 JUSTICE SOUTER: Didn't -- didn't that case13 involved the -- a violation there -- involve the14 addition of a pollutant? And there was no addition of15 a pollutant, because the water was equally polluted on16 each side. Wasn't that the --17 MR. ROWE: That's --18 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- the case?19 MR. ROWE: That's correct, Your Honor.20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.21 MR. ROWE: The pollutant was already in the22 water when it -- when it entered -- the water from the23 pipe. And the point that Justice Ginsburg's mentioned,24 the quote, is, if one takes a ladle of soup from a pot,25 lifts it up above the pot and pours it back into the391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 pot, one has not added soup or anything else to the2 pot. Section 401, the word "discharge" in that section3 does not require an addition of anything. It can be --4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then -- but5 your focus -- in response to my question about what6 would constitute release, you focused on the fact of7 impoundment, a restriction of the flow. It seems to me8 that the ladle analogy that the Court has made part of9 the law of the land is -- refutes that, because if it's10 hold -- you're holding it up in the ladle, that's like11 an impoundment. You've separated it, to that extent,12 from the other body, and the Court said, when you pour13 it back in, that's not --141516 discharge 171819 dispute that there were pollutants, so it must mean it20 wasn't a discharge.21 MR. ROWE: Mr. Chief Justice, the Court22 didn't say that there was no discharge; the Court said23 that there was no addition of soup or anything else24 into the pot. The point is, there was not the addition25 of a pollutant. And you do not need the addition of aMR. ROWE:  It wasn't --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- that's not aof a pollutant --MR. ROWE:  No, Mr. Chief --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- and there was no401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425pollutant to find a discharge, under section 401.          I just want to remind the Court that section401 came from section 21(b) of the Water QualityImprovement Act of 1970.  That was the old section 401. It said, "Anytime that there's a licensed activitythat's going to create a discharge from a facility intonavigable waters, then the States are to enforce theirwater quality standards."  Congress requires States toadopt water quality standards, according to section303.  And we have.  All States have.  And those waterquality standards are consistent.  We have designateduses, water quality criteria, and an antidegradationpolicy.          The Court should know that, as part of ourdesignated uses, hydropower is one of those.  The Statevalues hydropower.  We understand the importance of it.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you --          MR. ROWE:  Most --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- you don't -- youdon't value it as much as FERC does, though, do you?          MR. ROWE:  Your Honor, I don't know.[Laughter.]          MR. ROWE:  You heard -- Your Honor, you heardearlier --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, isn't one way 411111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 to look at this -- I mean, the concern is that your2 constituents probably have a higher priority and a3 greater concern with the environmental consequences of4 generating power, while FERC's priority is to make sure5 that we have sufficient power. And you're likely to6 weigh these competing uses in very different ways.7 MR. ROWE: Well, Your Honor, you heard8 earlier about the -- 1986, the Electric Consumers9 Protection Act. That did require FERC to give equal10 consideration to the protection of the environment with11 respect to the production of -- hydropower production.12 But the States have a responsibility given to them by13 Congress. The States have the primary responsibility14 for the prevention, for the reduction, and for the15 elimination of pollution. The way we enforce that is16 through our water quality standards. And so, the only17 way we can enforce those standards with respect to18 federally licensed facilities is section 401. And if19 you should take that from us, it will create a gaping20 hole in the Clean Water Act.21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, only if you assume22 that letting out the same water into the same river is23 pollution. It seems to me you're begging the question.24 MR. ROWE: Your Honor --25 JUSTICE SCALIA: You --421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. ROWE: -- the --2 JUSTICE SCALIA: If there were a discharge of3 something into the river, you'd be able to move against4 it. But the question here is whether there's any5 discharge into the river when you stop the river and6 then let the same river out.7 MR. ROWE: Your Honor, the "pollution," as8 defined in the Clean Water Act, is the alteration of9 the physical, chemical, and biological integrity of the10 water. That's the pollution.11 The reason 401 exists, and the reason12 "discharge" is used broadly, and it's the trigger for13 the section to work, is because you look at the impacts14 of that activity on the environment. You look at the15 physical integrity -- Has it been altered? -- the16 chemical integrity, the biological integrity. We look17 at things like the impact on aquatic ecosystems, the18 thermal stratification in the impoundment areas,19 whether there is lower dissolved oxygen. And certainly20 we look at the fish migration issues. Has there been21 blockage?22 JUSTICE ALITO: Could you, as Justice23 Breyer's question to your adversary suggested, adopt24 water quality standards that would make any25 hydroelectric power impossible, in Maine?431111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. ROWE: Your Honor, we could. We have a2 number of classes of rivers. With respect to one3 class, that is not a designated use. With respect to4 all the others, hydropower is the designated use.5 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that's something6 that Congress intended when they adopted this, to allow7 a State to rule out hydroelectric power?8 MR. ROWE: Justice Alito, Congress did not9 give the States unbounded authority. Indeed, in10 section 401(d), there is a restriction. It restricts11 the conditions to those necessary to assure that the12 applicant will comply with conditions in our water13 quality standards. And if -- I mean, FERC does14 incorporate those standards into the license, but the15 applicant can redress that in court, as this one has.16 So, we -- I want to mention, again, that States care17 about hydropower. We care about fish migration. We18 care about recreation activities. We care about all of19 these things, and they're all incorporated into our20 water quality standards.21 JUSTICE SOUTER: So, I take it your ultimate22 answer is, no, a State could not, in effect, eliminate23 hydropower from --24 MR. ROWE: Well, Your --25 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- development.441111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. ROWE:  -- Your Honor, in our State it's adesignated use --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry --          MR. ROWE:  -- on most of our rivers.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  I'm not interested -- I'masking for an answer to my question.  I take it, basedon your further answer to Justice Alito, that youranswer to the first question is, no, a State could not,in effect, eliminate all hydropower from -- developmentfrom its rivers.          MR. ROWE:  Your -- Justice Souter, a State --a State could do that if it changed the designated usesfor its rivers.  But in the State of Maine, as in 45States --          JUSTICE SOUTER:   And you don't think therewould be any conflict with the FERC scheme if you didthat?  You don't think there would be any conflictbetween the Federal policy embodied in the Power Actand in the State law?          MR. ROWE:  Well, Your Honor, again, I want to-- under the Clean Water Act, the States have primaryresponsibility for the reduction and for theelimination and --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, I --          MR. ROWE:  -- prevention of pollution.451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: -- I think the question --2 maybe it just -- I don't understand, totally, how the3 Clean Water Act works, but I thought that what we're4 talking in this statute is a State rule that's called5 the State Clean Water Act rule. It's a creature of the6 Clean Water Act, isn't it? A water quality standard?7 MR. ROWE: Yes, Your Honor.8 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. And, therefore,9 a State, I would think, that had some totally bizarre10 Clean Water Act standard might find that it had a11 standard that didn't fit within the scope of the Clean12 Water Act. And, therefore, it wasn't going to be13 enforced here. Is that right, or not right? Maybe the14 Federal Government will explain this --15 MR. ROWE: Well, Your Honor, I'm sure the16 Federal Government will also address this question, but17 the parameters of the water quality standards are18 addressed in section 303 of the Clean Water Act. And19 there are parameters in there. And the States' Clean20 Water -- or water quality standards must conform to21 those standards. We submit our Clean -- our water22 quality standards --2324 minimums? 25JUSTICE SCALIA:  Are they maximums orMR. ROWE: Your Honor, it's simply categories 461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 in there. We submit --2 JUSTICE SCALIA: I expect that they're3 minimums.4 MR. ROWE: We -- well, they are minimums,5 Your Honor. We submit these to the EPA. The EPA6 approves the State water quality standards, and then7 those standards are how we evaluate these federally8 licensed activities as to whether they're in compliance9 or not. And they determine the certification, whether10 it's issued, and if it's issued, with what conditions.11 If a State -- if a State's rivers were not conducive12 to hydropower -- the question you asked, Your Honor was13 -- Justice Souter -- could a State prevent hydropower14 from occurring? Again, we have, with respect to a few15 rivers in the State of Maine; but most of the rivers,16 it is a designated use, because States, like the17 Federal Government, value hydropower. There is no air18 pollution. It's a clean source of energy. We value19 it. And, indeed, the antidegradation policies that are20 part of our water quality standards require us to look21 at the impact on Petitioner's dams, the power output22 that's going to be -- going to -- is going to result23 from these various conditions that we impose as a part24 of our certification.25 JUSTICE STEVENS: General Rowe, may I ask 471111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 this question? In the Miccosukee case, we sent the2 case back, as you remember, to decide whether or not3 there were one body of water or two bodies of water.4 In your view, are there one or two bodies of water --5 would it be five bodies of water -- in this case?6 MR. ROWE: There's one body of water, Your7 Honor -- Justice Stevens.8 JUSTICE STEVENS: So, you --9 MR. ROWE: And that's the --10 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- concede that.11 MR. ROWE: -- that's the --12 JUSTICE STEVENS: Okay.13 MR. ROWE: -- Presumpscot River.14 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.15 MR. ROWE: All the water is waters of the16 United States, navigable waters, but the water is being17 discharged from the facility into the navigable waters.18 You -- Your Honor has mentioned a storage dam. A19 storage dam creates an impoundment. In fact, one of20 these dams has a 50-foot-high wall that holds the water21 back, almost 200 acres of water. At times, there is22 water that goes over the top of the dam. That is,23 indeed, a discharge. It is caused by the activity. It24 results from the activity. It's not the free-flowing25 water. And I want to make that clear. I think,481111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 Justice Scalia, your question was -- that's not a2 discharge. That's a natural flow of water. What's3 happening here is, the flow is being altered. Because4 of the impoundment, because of the diversion, the flow5 is being altered. And in the case at hand here, you're6 actually taking a turbine, the water drops down into7 the turbine, turns the turbine blades or fans, it8 absorbs the water of its power, and then the water is9 released, discharged, into the tailrace channel, into10 the natural river.11 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, any significant12 obstruction in the river amounts to a -- creates a13 discharge.14 MR. ROWE: No, I'd -- no, Your --15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Indeed, if it's a small16 enough stream, I suppose just swimming in it or lying17 sideways so you impede the flow, you are causing a18 discharge into the waters of the United States. I find19 that peculiar.20 MR. ROWE: That -- Justice Scalia, that's not21 what I said. The question was asked about a post, like22 a bridge, the pilings for a bridge. In certain cases,23 depending on the size, it might result in a discharge.24 I'm not saying every -- a stick in the river is,25 certainly not a swimmer. We have a de minimis rule.491111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 We're not 23 the river 4saying that.  It needs to be --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it depends on how bigis, doesn't it?MR. ROWE:  Well, I'm -- if it's navigable5 waters, and you have a huge post that's holding up a6 bridge, there could be a -- there -- and it's federally7 licensed -- there could be a discharge resulting from8 that. I mean, I -- that is what a person would say,9 "There is a discharge," because suddenly you see --10 where water was naturally flowing, you see a diversion,11 in an impoundment, of sorts, moving the water over.12 But what we have here is not that case. What we have13 here is an impoundment. We have the water being14 diverted into a narrow channel, dropping down onto15 these turbines, being used, and then being discharged16 into the river.17 The word "discharge," again, in 1970, under the18 21(b), was given a broad definition. 402 and 404 came19 later, in 1972, as part of the Clean Water Act. In20 those, we're dealing with discrete conveyances of21 pollutants, 402. And 404 was dredge or fill discharge.22 And those were deemed necessary. But they're consumed23 in 401. In other words, if you get a 402, if you need24 a 40- -- a 402 application, certification, you also25 will need a 401. 401 deals with the effects of501111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425pollution, the effects of the activity on theenvironment.          I thank Your Honors very much.  And I justwant to remind the Court that the State very muchvalues the power -- the importance of hydropower.  Wevalue the -- our responsibility, as given to us byCongress under the Clean Water Act, to be the primaryenforcer of our water quality standards.  And the onlyway we can do that, with respect to federally licensedfacilities, is section 401.Rowe.Thank you very much.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, GeneralMr. Minear.ORAL FOR THEARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEARUNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,IN SUPPORT OF RESPONDENT          MR. MINEAR:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          The United States submits that the operationof Petitioner's hydropower facilities results in adischarge into the navigable waters within the meaningof section 401 of the Clean Water Act.  section 401uses the term "discharge" in its ordinary sense to meana "flowing out" or "issuing out."  The facilities at511111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425issue in this case, which divert water, impound it, andthen release it, produce a flowing or issuing out ofthat water into the navigable Presumpscot River.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Section 402 uses "discharge"in the same sense, I assume.          MR. MINEAR:  No, it does not, Your Honor.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why doesn't it?          MR. MINEAR:  Because it uses the term"discharge of a pollutant," which is --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes --          MR. MINEAR:  -- which is defined, under theClean Water Act, as a statutory term of art, to meanthe addition of a pollution -- of a pollutant from apoint source.  On the other hand, the Clean Water Actinterprets or defines "discharge" to include the"discharge of a pollutant."  So, it's clear that theterm "discharge" is broader than the term "discharge ofa pollutant," and does not include the requirement ofan addition.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  It is -- it is broader.  Butif -- the discharge of a pollutant into the same bodyof water does not constitute the addition of apollution -- of a pollutant.  It obviously is theaddition of a pollutant.  The only reason you could saythat taking it from one -- pumping it from one polluted521111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 body to another is not a discharge of a pollutant,2 which is what we said in Miccosukee, the only basis for3 saying that is that there has been no discharge.4 There's obviously been an addition of a pollutant to5 the -- to the other body of water. The only thing you6 can say is, there hasn't been a discharge. It's --7 because it's the same body of water.8 MR. MINEAR: I respectfully disagree, Your9 Honor, because, in Miccosukee, it addressed the10 specific question of whether or not there is an11 addition. And, in the much-quoted soup-ladle example,12 what it was talking about, in that instance, was taking13 a ladle of soup, removing it from the pot, and adding14 it back. The pouring back of the soup into the pot is15 a discharge, it's a flowing or issuing out. It's not16 an addition, because nothing is being added to the17 soup.18 Now, in this case, we're using the term19 "discharge," not "addition." And there is, obviously,20 a flowing or issuing out from the dam. Anyone who goes21 and observes a dam, and sees the water leaving the dam,22 will say that's a "discharge." That's common parlance.23 It's been repeated numerous times in this Court's own24 decisions in describing dam operations.25 Furthermore --531111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE SOUTER:  In other words, Miccosukeewas concerned not with molecules, but with chemicalcomposition.  The chemical composition was the same inthis body and in that body, and, in that sense, therewas no addition --          MR. MINEAR:  That's correct --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, that --          MR. MINEAR: -- that there was notransmission.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes.          MR. MINEAR:  But I think, Justice Souter, youare right in focusing on the exiting from the dam andwhy discharges are important here.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  If, in Miccosukee, liquid ofthe same composition had been taken from another bodyof water, and from -- not the body of water that wasadjacent and which we held was the same body of water -- with the same composition, and that had been added,do you think Miccosukee would have come out the sameway?          MR. MINEAR:  Yes, I think it would have comeout the same way.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Really?  That you could takepollutants from a different body of water and add it toan already polluted stream?  I thought that was clear541111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that that's not the case.2 MR. MINEAR: Your Honor, if we look to the3 Miccosukee opinion, at 541 U.S. 109 to 110, it4 discusses5 there two6 7this issue.  One of the issues there is, Arebodies of water or one body of water?JUSTICE SCALIA:  Exactly.MR. MINEAR:  And the Court -- that question8 was left unresolved in Miccosukee. That's what's being9 tried in Florida right now.1011 of water,12 water, it1314 this Court said -- it talked about the S-9 pump, which15 was central there, because it was moving the body --16 that the -- the water. It was transmitting it. And it17 was -- talked about pumping the water from one part of18 the water body to the other. That's a discharge, even19 though it's the same water body.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it would add pollutants21 to the other body whether it comes from the adjacent22 body or whether it comes from some distant body. The23 only reason that the pumping from the adjacent body did24 not qualify is -- not because there no addition of25 pollutants. There would be an addition of pollutions551111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-JUSTICE SCALIA:  Because if it was one bodyit was okay, and if it was two bodies ofwas bad, right?MR. MINEAR:  Yes, but in -- at page 109, what￼1 from a distant lake, and you -- we'd be able to hold a2 person liable. The only reason there was no addition3 here was that there was -- there was an addition here,4 but there was no discharge, because it was the same5 body of water.6 MR. MINEAR: With --7 JUSTICE SCALIA: And I --8 MR. MINEAR: With respect --9 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- it seemsto me that's -- 10 MR. MINEAR: -- I think you have --11 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- what you have here.12 MR. MINEAR: -- it exactly backwards with13 what the position of the United States was in14 Miccosukee, and it explains why our -- we took that15 position. And the Court upheld our position in16 Miccosukee. And we're taking the different position17 here. Because here we're talking about a discharge,18 not an addition. The dictionary definition of19 "discharge" nowhere speaks of "addition." Petitioners20 have not pointed to any dictionary definition that21 speaks in terms of an addition. It talks about a22 flowing or issuing out. What it connotes is that the23 water has, in some sense, been contained or confined,24 to some degree.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I was --561111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. MINEAR:  And it's issuing out --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- surprised, in acase involving a FERC license condition, that no onefrom FERC signed on to your brief.          MR. MINEAR:  Well, Your Honor, as people inthe office are familiar with, in the SG's office, thenames in the brief tell very little about who hasparticipated in the discussions and the writing of thebrief.  The Rapanos case --involvingit says aCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But if it's a casea FERC license, and FERC isn't there, I thinkgreat deal.MR. MINEAR:  Well, Your Honor, this isa case about the Clean Water Act.  I wouldprimarilypoint to the Rapanos case, immediately before.  TheCorps' name is not on the brief, and EPA's name is noton the brief.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you know whatFERC's --          MR. MINEAR:  So, we can't draw --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you know whatFERC's position is --          MR. MINEAR:  I certainly --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- in this case?          MR. MINEAR:  -- do.  They join in the571111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425consensus position of the United States.  This briefhas been coordinated not only with EPA and FERC, butalso the Department of the Interior and the Army Corpsof Engineers.  This is the position of the UnitedStates.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I'm sure ofthat, and it involves a reconciliation of --          MR. MINEAR:  Right.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- competingpositions.  Is there anything that FERC has issued thatis illuminating with respect to their view?          MR. MINEAR:  I think what's illuminating istheir consistent position, since 1970, when thisprovision was first enacted into law, in the WaterQuality Improvement Act of 1970, 2 years before theClean Water Act amendments.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you agree that aState could adopt water quality standards that would,in effect, preclude hydroelectric power in the State?          MR. MINEAR:  I think it's certainly possible,on an individual river.  Imagine if a State had a riverthat is designated as a wilderness area or a wild andscenic river, and determined it did not --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Would they do --          MR. MINEAR:  -- want to have hydropower.581111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- it statewide?2 MR. MINEAR: If they did it statewide, I3 think --4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Saying, "It is of5 utmost importance to us to provide habitat for spawning6 salmon, whatever, dams interfere with that in a way we7 find objectionable, so we're going to go a different8 direction, as a matter of power policy for the State of9 whatever, and not allow hydroelectric power."10 MR. MINEAR: If they did it statewide, it11 would raise a question of whether or not that action is12 preempted under the Federal Power Act, not under the13 Clean Water Act. And that would -- that's obviously14 not the issue here. Maine, as you have heard, supports15 hydropower production. The question here is16 reconciling the competing roles of the hydropower17 company, on the one hand, and the State and Federal18 Governments, which, in the spirit of cooperative19 federalism, work together on these matters. We are20 very supportive of the States' approach of reviewing21 discharges to determine whether or not there has been22 the creation of pollution, and determining whether or23 not there is a violation of their water quality24 standards. This is a part of -- an important role that25 the State has under the Clean Water Act, that Congress591111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 gave to the State, and to which we defend.2 I'd like to point out that one of the things3 that's been talked about here is the oddity, supposed4 oddity, of a water discharging into itself. And that's5 not odd at all. One often talks about, for instance,6 the fresh water above the dam being discharged into the7 fresh waters below. That's -- there's nothing unusual8 about this, because we're talking about the9 characteristic of a water that might be shared by the10 water that's upstream and contained in the dam and is11 also a characteristic of the water below. Now, under12 section 401, the upstream characteristic doesn't13 matter, because it's -- it refers to "any discharge,"14 and it says "into the navigable waters." "Into" is15 significant, because "any discharge" is "out of16 something." And so, it can also be "into something."17 And by stating "into navigable waters", Congress18 indicated what it was concerned about, which was that19 discharges that go into the navigable waters can cause20 pollution, and, therefore, ought to be reviewed by the21 State to make sure the water quality standards are22 being met.23 There's nothing unusual in this at all. It24 simply indicates that Congress was not concerned about25 discharges that go elsewhere; for instance, into a601111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 municipal 234 think the5 possible you could say a word about why Congress would,6 or would not, have wanted, in effect, to incorporatewater system or onto irrigated land.What we have here --JUSTICE BREYER:  Just for the few of us whodictionary doesn't answer the case, is it7 all State water quality standards into a permission to8 build a dam?9 MR. MINEAR: The reason why, it was because10 Congress gave the States primary authority under the11 Clean Water Act to deal with pollution.
