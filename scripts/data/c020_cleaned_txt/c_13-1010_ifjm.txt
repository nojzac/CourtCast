Tackett.      Ms. Ho.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLYSON N. HOON BEHALF OF PETITIONERSMS. HO: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court:      A promise of unalterable, costly healthcarebenefits should be negotiated at the bargaining table,not imposed at the courthouse.  In a series of cases,the Sixth Circuit has required courts to infer fromcontractual silence a promise of vested benefits.JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the ­­ we're dealing with a case where there isn't silence. I mean, it's a matter of construing what the words mean, but for example, this collective bargaining agreement says that the employees will receive a full company contribution toward the cost of health benefits. That's not silent.MS. HO: Your Honor, respectfully, it is silent with respect to the duration of the full company contribution toward benefits. The word "receiving," which I understand Your Honor to be focusing on, indicates that the individual has to be retired; in3￼￼1 other words, and actually receiving a pension and2 receiving a benefits. It's not ­­ it's not a durational3 term. And so ­­4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what you say, but5 there was a hearing by the district court. You're6 recommending we apply ordinary contract principles, no?7 MS. HO: Yes. There's ­­ there's no8 disagreement and the courts of appeal don’t ­­ don't9 disagree that ordinary contract10 principles apply.11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:12 find those words ambiguous, you13 district court had a hearing, and it didn't ­­ I don't14 think the district court relied on a presumption. It15 relied on a bevy of evidence, including the fact that16 your company bought the predecessor company, assessing17 the health contributions at full value for retirees.18 Why ­­ why wouldn't ordinary contract19 principles permit the district court to do exactly what20 it did here?21 MS. HO: Justice Sotomayor, I want to go22 back to ­­ to the first part of your question which23 said, well, wasn't ­­ wasn't there a trial here? And24 our position is that it never ­­ it never should have25 gotten to that because the district judge initially, as4interpretationAssume ­­ assume that Ihave a hearing.  The￼1 a matter of law, looked at the contract language here,2 declined to apply Yard­Man, and said, I don't find a3 promise of vesting.4 On appeal, the Sixth Circuit said, we5 disagree. Under Yard­Man, there is at least an6 inference of vesting here and instructed the district7 judge to apply Yard­Man on remand, which the district8 judge did, and on page 20 of Petitioner's appendix, in9 the opinion on remand, the district judge says, "Those10 directives," meaning the Sixth Circuit's directions in11 Yard­Man, "require this Court to reach the conclusion12 That the part that the plaintiffs here obtained vested13 benefits."14 JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Ho, I'm wondering if you15 would agree with this. If we could start all over16 again, forget all the history that you just said, if we17 could start all over again, you, I think, just agreed18 that we would use ordinary contract principles; is that19 right?20 MS. HO: Correct.21 JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. So ordinary contract22 principles, we would ­­ first, we would look at the23 agreement, and if the agreement said something clearly24 either way, whether it was for vesting or against25 vesting, the agreement would control; is that correct?51 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MS. HO: That's correct.JUSTICE KAGAN: And if the agreement was ambiguous, we could take extrinsic evidence to clarify the terms of the agreement; is that correct?      MS. HO:that's correct.      JUSTICE KAGAN:Objective extrinsic evidence, yes,       Okay, so ­­        You acknowledge that?  See,      JUSTICE SCALIA:I wouldn't acknowledge that if I were you.JUSTICE KAGAN:MS. HO:JUSTICE KAGAN:       Yes, I hear you.­­ or extrinsic ­­ extrinsic evidence.       Yes, I hear you.  I was not6￼Well, Your Honor, I'm ­­        You don't believe in theMS. HO:      JUSTICE SCALIA:parol evidence rule?      MS. HO:evidence, Your Honor, would be ­­ in other words,admissible ­­ admissible on a finding of ambiguity.JUSTICE KAGAN: Custom, practice.MS. HO: But I ­­ but I think it's important, Justice Kagan, if I may, to point out that in the Sixth Circuit, and I think this is one way in which what happened here departs from ordinary contract interpretation , is that in the Sixth Circuit, the inference applies of vesting based either on text or ­­Objective ­­ objective extrinsic￼1 getting you to agree with Yard­Man and I was not getting2 you to agree to the Sixth Circuit.3 MS. HO: Certainly, Your Honor.4 JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes. But what ­­ what I5 want to ­­ is you look at the text, if the text says it6 either way, you go with the text; if the text doesn't7 say it either way, it's permissible to look at extrinsic8 evidence, like, the practice of the parties and, you9 know, what you sold this for and things like that.10 MS. HO:11 up to a point, and I12 company or maybe add13 that ordinary contract interpretation does say, I think,14 in McCutchen this Court referred to that, in15 Stolt­Nielsen this Court applied the principle that16 where a contract is silent, courts apply the relevant17 default principles; in other words, silence ­­ I just18 want to make clear that silence doesn't always equal19 ambiguity. And our position ­­20 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but then you get to21 Justice Ginsburg's question, don't you, which is that22 this is a case where actually the parties are disputing23 language. It's not really a case where there is24 silence. I mean, you've come in and you've given some25 language that's very good for your side, which is that7Well, I ­­ I would agree with youthink where ­­ where I might partto that discussion would be to say￼1 duration clause, and the other party has come in and2 focused on the word "receiving" and focused on the tying3 arrangement between this and pensions, and focused on4 the surviving spouse clause. So you have ­­ you have5 some language, they have some language.6 MS. HO: Well, I think, Your Honor, at a7 minimum, that's why we're entitled to reversal and a8 remand, if – if this Court declines to require a clear9 statement as ­­ as part of ­­ as part of ordinary10 contract interpretation. I think we would at a minimum11 be entitled to have ­­ have that look ­­12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where does ­­13 MS. HO: ­­ at the language without the14 Yard­Man inference.15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where does ­­ where does16 ordinary contract interpretation require a clear17 statement?18 MS. HO: Certainly, Your Honor, we think ­­19 we think ordinary contract interpretation says where20 there is ­­ where there is silence here, and there is no21 durational term, there's no indication of vesting,22 there's no indication of how long the full company23 contribution should last, that where there is silent ­­24 silence, as this Court did in McCutchen, this Court looks to25 see, well, what are the operative default rules that ­­ that819202122232425appeals case, they mention Yard­Man at least four timesand said the Yard­Man presumption controls, and that'swhat the district court thought.MS. HO: Yes.JUSTICE KENNEDY: And the question ­­ the principal question here is whether the Yard­Man presumption should have a ­­ play a significant part in9￼1234   and as I pointed out, one side is not silent.  There are5   always indicia that vesting was intended.we assume that if the parties didn't contract around ­­ JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you keep sayingwhen there is silence, and as Justice Kagan pointed out6 MS. HO: I think there ­­ there is 7   silence ­­ there is no question that there is silence in 8   the operative term of the promise, which is a full 9   company contribution toward healthcare benefits.  It's10   true that the other side has pointed to various textual11   cues that I think, if anything, Justice Ginsburg,12   underscore the lack of such terms in the one place in13   the contract where we would expect it to be.  And that14 is in the ­­15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I thought your –but I16   thought your position here was that what the contract says17   under ordinary principles of contract interpretation is not18   the point.  The point is, is that in the first court of￼1 the interpretation of this contract, and you say no.2 MS. HO: Correct.3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And there would be ­­ and4 presumably there would be ­­ we could make that decision5 in remand so that we don't interpret this contract6 initially without ­­ without the benefit of what the7 district court and ­­ and the court of appeals would say8 without the Yard­Man presumption if you prevail.9 MS. HO: Certainly, Your Honor.10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Unless, of course, the11 Yard­Man presumption is normal contract interpretation.12 That is, you know, the court of appeals could be saying13 that when you look at the totality of the contract where14 the benefits are being given for, as payment for work,15 you get them if you've worked so many years, they16 increase when you've worked more years. Where that is17 the case, it is a reasonable assumption, call it a18 presumption if you like, that any promise to pay those19 benefits continues after the termination of the ­­ of20 the union contract. In other words, I'm not sure that21 the court of appeals would agree that ­­ that this22 presumption is contrary to normal contractual23 interpretation. I think the court of appeals would say24 that is normal contractual interpretation.25 MS. HO: Justice Scalia, I think there's ­­10￼ 1   I think you're right that the Sixth Circuit would and 2   has said that all it's doing in these cases is applying 3   ordinary contract interpretation.  I think as Judge 4   Sutton and others have pointed out, saying doesn't make 5   it so.  And I think there can be no question when you 6   look at the ­­ when you look at the cases, and I think 7   this case is a good example of the work that Yard­Man is 8   doing.  And Yard­Man itself, Justice Scalia, in a 9   footnote in its opinion, acknowledges that ordinary10   contract interpretation rules apply with respect to11   interpreting the contract generally.  But with respect12   to the issue here, which is the duration of the –of the13   contract, the Sixth Circuit itself in Yard­Man said that14   the normal "strictures," was the word used, doesn't15 apply.16 So I think at least as an initial matter,17   the Sixth Circuit did not conceive of this as ordinary18   contract interpretation and that it's really its own19   policy­based rationales for why it's appropriate, in a20   sense, to put a thumb on the scales here in favor of21 retiree.22 But I think if you look at –if you look at the23   rules, maybe that's the most clear way to see that it's not24   ordinary, is saying to courts you can look at text or25   extrinsic evidence.  That's not normal contract11￼1 interpretation. To say to courts you ­­you can ignore a2 contract duration clause if it doesn't specifically refer3 to retiree health care benefits.4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, we know that5 contracts have certain assumptions about them, about6 what continues. Arbitration provisions continue after7 the expiration. We have found that, correct?8 MS. HO: Correct. In the labor context,9 that's correct, whether the labor ­­10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And Justice Scalia just11 said to you something that talks about retirement and12 the surviving spouse and her right to get things would13 ­­ I think could reasonably be viewed as a vesting14 provision.15 MS. HO: I would respectfully disagree with16 that, Justice Sotomayor, for two primary reasons: I17 think the first reason is that all of these other18 textual cues are reasonably read in conjunction with the19 contract, both with the contract expiration clause,20 which ­­which says that the benefits are for the duration21 of the agreement; but even without that clause, are read22 in the context of the background rule ­­23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: See, that's ­­24 MS. HO: ­­ with respect to the terms25 expiring with the agreement.128 91011121314151617seems to me that the full benefits or ­­ will receive areduced ­­ will receive a full company contribution,could suggest that that doesn't expire.MS. HO: We ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So long as the health ­­ as long as the company is providing health insurance. MS. HO: Our position is the full companycontribution language, as ­­as the district judge in thiscase initially held when looking at that language, doesnot have a durational term that's not sufficient to￼1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:2 the following reason, okay? I don't know whether there's a3   lifetime health benefit if this company stops providing4   any, meaning if the company some day says we're not5   going to give any whatsoever, the issue ­­ that, I6   think, is a more interesting question because then the7   contract has truly expired.  But if it chooses to, it18   imply vesting.  In this particular case, and I think19   Your Honor raised the issue of the term of the agreement20   and applying during that, in terms of going forwards, I21   just want to be clear, we have never sought to terminate22   the benefits, and, in fact, now the retiree benefits are23   the subject of mandatory bargaining ­­24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But could you have ­­ if25   the collective bargaining agreement has expired, you13­­ that’s the question for1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425have your duration clause, and the company instead ofsaying, retirees, we're going to make you contributesomething to the health care, says:  Well, the contractexpired; no health coverage at all for retirees.  Underyour theory, I assume they could do that.MS. HO: Well, under ERISA, where Congress said, unlike pension benefits, we're not going to require health care benefits to vest, the only way ­­JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the fact ­­MS. HO: ­­ the only way the benefits vest is by contract.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it your position that once the contract expires, the employer is free to say no health coverage for retirees, period?MS. HO: If there has been no vesting, yes. In this case, the company, each successor company and the union, entered into a series of agreements ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: But you answered the question. The answer is yes, right? The company can terminate. You're saying it hasn't terminated here, it's a nice company; but it doesn't have to be a nice company, does it? Isn't that your position?MS. HO: Our position ­­­ I'm just trying to be consistent with the record in this case, YourHonor ­­ is as a general matter, yes, the terms don't14￼￼1 outlest ­­ outlast the terms of the agreement, but there2 is a difference in this case.3 JUSTICE SCALIA: What I would like to hear,4 earlier you said there were two reasons: One was the5 termination clause and second that the contract had to6 be read in light of the background rule ­­ then you got7 cut off. And I really want to know what the background8 rule you were about to refer to was.9 MS. HO: Certainly, Your Honor. I think10 there are two background rules in play here. And the11 first rule is that we don't normally read into silence12 where parties have undertaken extra­statutory13 obligations or extraordinary undertakings. We don't14 read those terms into silence. We expect that if such a15 serious undertaking as a promise of health care benefits16 for life were to have been made, that we would expect to17 see it, just like this Court said in the Tern case about18 ­­19 JUSTICE SCALIA: What's the second one ­­20 before you get cut off again, what's the second one?21 MS. HO: Certainly. And I think the second22 background rule here is related to the first. And23 that's the extra­statutory obligation here, that where24 Congress has said in ERISA, it's explicitly exempted25 welfare benefits from automatic vesting. So, if the ­­15￼1 in other words, what's being asked for here is the2 exception to the rule. So we would expect to see that3 clear in the contract.4 JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Ho, Congress has said,5 yes, in pension benefits, there's vesting. And in6 health care benefits we leave it to the parties; is that7 right?8 MS. HO: That's correct.9 JUSTICE KAGAN: So it doesn't have any10 implication for health care benefits other than we leave11 it to the parties, isn't that right?12 MS. HO: I would respectfully ­­ maybe I13 would not so much disagree as take that a step further.14 I think it does have an implication here because it15 establishes a default rule that, unless as a matter of16 contract there is an agreement to vest, then the17 benefits otherwise do not vest. And I think we would18 expect, applying normal contract principles, would19 expect to see that clear on the face of the contract.20 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but then you're back21 to your first background rule, which is that we would22 expect to see this if it were there. But you can ­­ I23 mean, that seems ­­ that statement has its corollary,24 right? Which is that, you know, either party ­­ we25 would expect, we would expect to see if the union had16￼1 won, that it would say vested. We would expect to see2 if the employer had won, it would say unvested.3 And, indeed, I think that there's an amicus4 brief in this case that suggests that there was a survey5 done of all these agreements and about 60 percent of6 them say quite explicitly unvested. Yours doesn't do7 that. So there we are. We're left with this ambiguity,8 and you have some language and they have some language9 and some judge has to figure it out.10 MS. HO: Well, and I think ­­ I think your11 question raises two issues, one of which goes back to12 our previous discussion about the role that ERISA has to13 play here. And I think if you put the onus on the14 employer to say what's clear, you're in a sense saying,15 even though Congress doesn't require it to be vested,16 we're going to ask ­­17 JUSTICE KAGAN:18 care. Congress has said we19 MS. HO: Right,20 do it. So normally we would expect to see the21 obligation on the party who wants the benefit to seek22 the clear language, to seek the promise, as opposed to23 the party who doesn't. And I think24 that out in terms of as a practical25 in the context of negotiations, one17if you sort of playmatter, particularlywould also expect toCongress has said we don'tleave it to them.but there's no obligation to￼1 see the party who wants the benefit bargaining for the2 benefits.3 JUSTICE ALITO: This is an important benefit4 and an expensive one. Why is it that in this collective5 bargaining agreement and apparently many others ­­ I6 don't know whether the figure is 40 percent or whatever7 it is ­­ there isn't anything explicit one way or the8 other?9 MS. HO: I think ­­10 JUSTICE ALITO:11 something that didn't occur12 union. Why did they choose13 they choose not to address it expressly?14 MS. HO: I think there ­­ one could consider15 that they didn't express it directly or one could read the16 contract as saying there simply is no ­­ silence says17 there is no promise of vesting here, because that is an18 extraordinary obligation for a company to take on.19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about "Retirees will20 receive health benefits as long as they are eligible for21 and receiving a monthly pension"? Doesn't that sound22 like as long as they're getting the pension, they will23 get health benefits?24 MS. HO: No, Your Honor. Again, read in25 conjunction with either the express clause in this case18This certainly can't beto the employer or to theto leave it silent?  Why did￼1 or the background rule that the terms expire with the2 agreement, that doesn't indicate that those ­­ those3 extend. And I think what ­­ what the Sixth Circuit has4 done, and it did in this case, it instructed this Court5 that the mere fact that the retiree healthcare benefits6 were tied to receipt of a pension was sufficient to7 indicate vesting. I think that essentially undoes what8 Congress did in saying you ­­ you have to vest in9 pension; you don't have to vest in the welfare context.10 The Sixth Circuit essentially puts those11 things ­­12 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't think it's13 reversing that. I think it's ­­ it's an argument of ­­14 of contractual expression, contractual intent. It says15 if you tie the continuing receipt of health benefits to16 the continuing receipt of retirement benefits, and if17 you know that retirement benefits survive the18 termination of the contract, right? You acknowledge19 that.20 MS. HO: The vesting.21 JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to suggest that ­­22 that health benefits continue as long as retirement23 benefits do. Now, I mean, maybe there are other24 indications, but that one certainly seems to ­­ seems to25 tie health benefits to retirement benefits.19￼1 MS. HO: I don't think so, Your Honor.2 Because I think one con­ ­­ one consequence of that is3 essentially no matter what the parties contract or agree4 to, you're always going to have vesting, even though5 it's the exception and not the rule, simply by tying the6 healthcare benefits to ­­ to retirement status.7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why do you have to ­­ why8 do you have to do that? If you want to treat them as9 separate, treat them as separate. Don't tie them10 together. There was nothing that required these two to11 be tied together.12 MS. HO: Well, Your Honor, I think the13 practical reason for ­­ for linking those two is not to14 indicate vesting, but to ensure that the recipient is ­­15 is actually retired for purposes of receiving the16 benefits.17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I thought it was18 your position that whatever might be the outcome of19 these questions, the Sixth Circuit didn't think that20 that was the right analysis, that the Sixth Circuit21 didn't think the result could be reached without22 imposing the presumption of your argument, and so23 instructed the district court. And that's the issue24 before us.25 MS. HO: That's correct, Your Honor. And20￼1 the district court ­­ and the district court made clear2 on remand, and the Sixth Circuit in the second appeal,3 in Tackett II, explicitly approved, and the word the4 Sixth Circuit used was "presumption," that the district5 court decided correctly in applying the presumption to6 this case.7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the8 district court on remand said it would have come out the9 same way anyway. They said there are no facts that10 would defeat this same conclusion.11 MS. HO: Correct, Your Honor. And I ­­ and12 I think that's an important response to what Justice13 Sotomayor was pointing out earlier about the fact that14 there was a trial here. I think that ­­ that language15 makes clear that the trial here was about what ­­ what16 vested, and that's the district judge making clear that17 whatever facts there had been, it would have reached the18 same conclusion about vesting, which is the only issue19 before this Court based on the Sixth Circuit's20 directive, as Justice Kennedy was pointing out, to apply21 Yard­Man and to apply the Yard­Man presumption.22 JUSTICE SCALIA: You know, the nice thing23 about a contract case of this sort is you can't feel bad24 about it. Whoever loses deserves to lose.25 (Laughter.)211 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      JUSTICE SCALIA:obviously an important feature.  Both sides knew it wasleft unaddressed, so, you know, whoever loses deservesto lose for casting this upon us when it could have beensaid very clearly in the contract.  Such an importantfeature.

But I think under ­­ under either sort of ­­ however much clarity is required in these contracts, I think in this case you only get to a promise of vested benefits by reverse engineering language elsewhere in the agreement that only highlights the lack of it where you would most expect to find it, and that ignores the contract expiration clause here, which makes clear it's a full company contribution during the term of the agreement.      And if I may reserve the rest of my time forrebuttal.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.23￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MS. HO: Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Clark?      ORAL ARGUMENT OF JULIA P. CLARK       ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTSMS. CLARK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      As the Court has so aptly noted, this is acontract dispute, and our argument is simply thatcontract disputes relating to retiree health benefitsshould be decided like every other dispute under acollective bargaining agreement.  To determine what theparties intended without applying any presumptions ­­JUSTICE BREYER: Isn't that what Justice Scalia believes? I tend to agree with him. He said ­­ he said the other side is arguing the same thing, and ­­ and says since both sides want to argue the same thing, maybe we can just agree with them.(Laughter.)MS. CLARK: That's music to my ears, Your Honor.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it may be music, but it ­­ Yard­Man says that retiree healthcare benefits are not subject to the stricture of ordinary contract interpretation and ­­ I mean, that's what Yard­Man says, and so I think you would have to vacate24￼￼1 if we're going to say apply the normal principles of2 contract interpretation.3 MS. CLARK: I have two answers to that. Let4 me start with what Yard­Man actually did. If you read5 the entire opinion, and unfortunately it's rather long,6 it details a number of contract provisions in that7 contract which the Court found supported the intention8 of both parties to create a benefit that would last9 beyond the expiration of the collective bargaining10 agreement.11 There was, for example ­­ and this is kind12 of the ­­ the most obvious contrast, the retiree benefit13 was described with some words like "continues." The14 benefit for the surviving spouse of a retiree was stated15 to continue as long as this contract is in effect.16 Now, the Court took that, rightly so, to17 suggest that the retiree would have a lifetime benefit,18 but that a surviving spouse, who was still alive after19 the retiree died, would continue to have benefits until20 the next agreement ­­ I'm sorry, the agreement, because21 it kept ­­ it kept rolling forward in agreements. So22 the surviving spouse was limited to the term of a23 contract while the retiree was not.24 There are a number of other contract25 provisions that they note, which very clearly supported25￼1 the inference that the retiree's benefit was intended to2 continue.3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know you're4 saying that you win without Yard­Man, but ­­ but it5 still seemed to mean something to the Sixth Circuit.6 And the many other courts of appeals that have addressed7 the question have distinguished what they're doing,8 saying, you know, we're not going to follow Yard­Man.9 We're going to apply normal principles of contract10 interpretation.11 MS. CLARK: And, Your Honor, that was where12 I was getting to the second piece of my argument ­­ the13 second piece of my answer to your question. And that is14 that we believe, particularly based on the limited15 arguments that were made by Petitioner below, that this16 Court could affirm this decision on normal principles of17 contract interpretation, but if the Court wants to be18 sure that the judgment below is, in fact, based on19 normal principles of contract interpretation, we are20 perfectly comfortable with a remand for that purpose.21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, the only point of22 this that I'm unsure of is that almost all of the other23 circuits require either a clear statement of vesting or24 at least words clearly susceptible to vesting. One or25 the other. What do you ­­ How do you stand on those two26￼1 principles of statutory construction ­­2 MS. CLARK: Number one ­­ well, number two.3 I'm disagreeing with both parts of your ­­ of the4 premises of the question.5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm saying what other ­­6 I think other courts have done this, correct? They have7 presumptions against vesting, some of the courts.8 MS. CLARK: Some may. Skinner Engine is9 really the only one that flatly says we're going to ask10 for clear and express language. Even they will consider11 extrinsic evidence for the purpose of demonstrating an12 ambiguity. The Skinner Engine opinion itself says that13 it would consider that; it just found the evidence in14 that case not sufficient.15 But among the other circuits, I count five16 that apply traditional rules of contract interpretation17 and that only say ­­ not clear language, not specific18 language ­­ but say only we are looking, as in all other19 contract cases, for some language that is reasonably20 susceptible to the interpretation that's offered by the21 retirees. And that's the classic formulation. It's the22 one that we urge this Court to adopt. And indeed ­­23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that ­­ is that the24 Second and Seventh ­­ are you saying essentially you25 agree with the position of the Second and Seventh27￼1 Circuits?2 MS. CLARK: The Second Circuit, Justice3 Ginsburg, in the opinion in Joyce v. Curtiss­Wright,4 articulated that precise standard. It then, in a kind5 of a summary of its opinion, used the word "specific6 language," which has come to be cited to mean something7 more than language reasonably susceptible. To that8 extent we would not agree with the Second Circuit. As9 far as they went, relying on traditional principles, we10 agree with them.11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it a traditional12 principle of contract interpretation that if you're13 dealing with something as big a deal as healthcare14 benefits for life, you might expect that to be15 addressed ­­ addressed more specifically?16 MS. CLARK: Mr. Chief Justice, no. There17 are many contract provisions that are a bigger deal than18 this. I mean ­­ and it is not the traditional rule of19 contract interpretation that the courts look to see20 which party had a bigger stake and punish them if their21 language is ambiguous. Quite the contrary, it's treated22 like any other issue of contract interpretation: Is the23 language reasonably susceptible to more than one24 interpretation?25 JUSTICE KENNEDY:28You want us to write an￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425opinion saying that whether or not health care benefitssurvive in a collectivebig deal?      MS. CLARK:what I'm saying.      JUSTICE KENNEDY:I don't understand yourMS. CLARK:      JUSTICE KENNEDY:Justice.      MS. CLARK:contract issues that come before the courts that are abig deal.  This is one of them, particularly for theretirees.  It is a big deal.  But the point is simplythat traditional rules of contract interpretation don'ttreat ambiguity any differently when it is in a contractprovision that's a big deal for one side or the other,or both sides.JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's exactly contrary to what your argument instructs.MS. CLARK: Justice Kennedy, I think not. I think that the ­­ the essence of the Yard­Man inference, and that's the term that the court used, is not that different from what this Court recognized in the Nolde Brothers case and in the Litton case, which is that29bargaining agreement is not aNo, Justice Kennedy, that's not      Well, then I'm thinking ­­answer to the question ­­I'm simply ­­      ­­ posed by the ChiefI am saying that there are many￼1 there are some terms in collective bargaining agreements2 which by their nature are offering ­­ may be; let me3 rephrase ­­ by their nature may be offering something in4 exchange for service that's already rendered. So if the5 performance is complete on one side and all that remains6 is for the other side to keep its end of the bargain,7 the Court in Litton and in Nolde recognized that those8 promises, as a normal rule, will continue. They will9 not expire when the rest of the agreement expires.10 And accordingly the Court, dealing with an11 issue of severance pay in Nolde, where all that there12 was in the contract was a promise that there would be13 severance pay proportional to years of service, said14 that when the employer closed the plant after the15 contract expired, that there was a possibility that that16 severance pay was intended still to be paid to people17 who had earned it, and therefore ordered arbitration of18 the dispute.19 In Litton, the question was whether when the20 plant laid off a number of workers after the contract21 expired, was the employer obligated to arbitrate over22 the question whether seniority should have protected23 people in those layoffs. The Court reached the24 conclusion that there was not the same kind of character25 of deferred compensation about layoffs, seniority in30￼1 layoffs, as there was in the notion of a severance pay2 that people may have earned over time.3 So the Court was ready without any explicit4 language in the contract, without any presumption, to5 say this is an issue that has to be determined by the6 processes that are normally applied to determine7 ambiguous contract promises. Does this promise ­­8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the general9 principle of what custom or practice in the industry or10 something like that, which I guess ­­ I guess that's an11 ordinary principle of contract interpretation that could12 be applied.13 MS. CLARK: Mr. Chief Justice, it certainly14 is one of the principles that this Court has said must15 be considered in the case of all collective bargaining16 agreements. Transportation­Communications Union said17 practice, usage and custom should always be considered18 for interpreting collective bargaining agreements, and19 we are fully behind that.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there a practice on21 this ­­ on this subject?22 MS. CLARK: Yes, there is evidence of a23 practice on this subject, Justice Scalia. The ­­ in24 this case ­­ there are two things. One is the sales25 agreement, which Justice Sotomayor pointed out during311 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the Petitioner's argument, where ­­      JUSTICE SCALIA:I'm talking ­­      MS. CLARK:      JUSTICE SCALIA:      MS. CLARK:     Okay, I'm not talking ­­Okay.     ­­ about in the industry.￼                        Okay.  In the industry ingeneral, this is ­­ this is rubber industry language.You will see it in many of the reported decisions thatcome out of the Sixth Circuit that ­­ because there werea number of rubber companies headquartered in Ohio.  Andthe combination of "the retiree will receive healthbenefits" combined with "and the surviving spouse willreceive them until death or remarriage," is a verycommon formula in the ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but Sixth Circuit we can't rely on because of Yard­Man.MS. CLARK: Well, Your Honor, I would say, number one, that those two provisions combined certainly do say a lot about the duration of the promise that the employer was making. The sales agreement here specifically reflected that the credit on the purchase price which M&G received was calculated based on actuarial assumptions that these were lifetime benefits with no retiree contributions.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:This may be an unfair32￼1 question, but following up on what Justice Scalia is2 getting at, I don't know how many others of those rubber3 companies are requiring contributions of active4 employees that are different than the contributions of5 retired employees. Do you have any information about6 that?7 MS. CLARK: I do not, and it's certainly not8 in this record.9 So the second ­­ the second point of10 practice ­­11 JUSTICE KAGAN: Please.12 MS. CLARK: The second point of practice13 that I want to point out is this: The 1997 collective14 bargaining agreement omitted all reference to retiree15 health benefits for people who had retired before16 January 1, 1996. So beginning in '97 and in 2000 you17 have a collective bargaining agreement which says people18 who retire 1­1­96 and after will receive the following19 health benefit. The record is undisputed that, even20 though the contract was silent beginning in 1997, the21 employer continued to pay retiree healthcare benefits to22 those people who retired before 1997, and indeed that23 liability was transferred from Shell to M&G as part of24 the sale.25 That is a point that we made. It's33￼1 undisputed. Petitioner did not respond to it in any2 way. So we do have that kind of evidence of what the3 parties have done under this agreement.4 JUSTICE KAGAN: And is it right that5 Petitioners' original arguments were not that they6 didn't have to pay these at all, but only that these7 benefits were capped at8 MS. CLARK:9 that was the issue thata certain level; is that right?That is correct.  And, indeed,­­ on which the company moved to10 dismiss the complaint in the first instance. It was the11 issue on which the district court initially dismissed12 finding that there were cap letters that limited the13 amount that the employer had to pay; that, when it was14 tried before the district court, the district court15 rejected all of that evidence on credibility grounds and16 found that, based on the credibility of the witnesses,17 this was a lifetime obligation which everybody had18 understood until the employer found a way to try to19 reduce its costs, and ­­20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I ask you a question21 about retirees? I don't know if it's industry standard22 or just this contract. Are retirees eligible to vote on23 the agreements that are entered into by the union?24 MS. CLARK: They are not.25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:They are not.34MS. CLARK:JUSTICE SCALIA:MS. CLARK:That is one of the concerns.     Well, that's a cynical ­­￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      And is that generally true of retirees?MS. CLARK: Generally, that is true because they are not members of the bargaining unit once they retire, and only members of the bargaining unit are represented in bargaining or have any right to vote on the ratification of an agreement.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And do they ­­ does the union represent them in any other disputes they may have as retirees with ­­ because generally, the union represents employees, active employees?MS. CLARK: Yes, it does. It is the agent, and that in the statutory term, as well as the common law term, for the employees in the bargaining unit.Once an individual retires, the union is no longer his or her agent. The union no longer has any authority nor any obligation to represent the retiree.JUSTICE SCALIA: So ­­ so in a way, you would expect the union to give this away so ­­ so it can get higher benefits for the people that are still in its bargaining unit, wouldn't you?                        No.  That ­­ that, indeed, isone of the things that Yard­Man points out, is that ­­is that that is a reason to assume that the parties35￼1 would want to make this clear in the agreement.2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right, right.3 MS. CLARK: And ­­ and, in fact, you know,4 to ­­ to be clear, there are agreements in which the5 union and the employer agree in advance that the6 retirees will have these benefits until and unless the7 union and the employer bargain something else. And8 that's just a different species of contractual vesting.9 There is a condition. It's imposed at the time of10 retirement. The benefit is paid consistently with that11 condition.12 There are, at the opposite end of the13 spectrum, agreements, and I tried a case in which this14 was the ­­ this was the understanding. When the retiree15 went out the door, that package of benefits was exactly16 what that retiree was going to have for the rest of his17 or her life. No changes permitted by any means18 whatsoever.19 And ­­ and so the span and the spectrum of20 contractual vesting in this area is very broad. And our21 point to you is to say there is no one­size­fits­all22 solution here. It is what the parties agreed to. And23 if there is ambiguity in the collective bargaining24 agreement, as there plainly was here with provisions25 that could be read on each side, then it goes to the36￼1 processes which the common law has established over2 hundreds, if not thousands, of years to say we're going3 to consider the entire agreement.4 We don't compartmentalize some other5 provisions in the agreement and say, oh, wait a minute,6 they don't have anything to do with this. If they give7 a clue about what the parties had in mind with respect8 to the retiree health benefits, they must be considered.9 They must all be put into the mix of what the Court will10 determine.11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is ­­ is one of ­­ is one12 of the ingredients that goes into this mix the13 background rule that I ­­ I thought your friend would14 bring up, and that is it is the normal rule in contract15 interpretation that when the contract expires, so do its16 terms. If you start with that, contract expires, all17 its terms expire. Isn't that ­­18 MS. CLARK: This Court addressed that in19 Litton. And the clear ruling of the Court there was20 that exceptions to that rule are determined by normal21 contract interpretation.22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what about the23 arbitration context of Litton? I mean, the idea is,24 well, of course, it doesn't expire because you might25 have disputes, particularly disputes going in connection37￼1 with the expiration. So the idea in Litton, that the2 arbitration requirements continue, really can't be3 applied outside that context.4 MS. CLARK:5 Litton says we're going6 promise continues, that7 But the second level of consideration in8 Litton, you know ­­ so the first question was the Court9 says arbitration, we're going to presume it continues10 unless the parties have made it very clear that it11 doesn't, so that it can kind of clean up all the12 disputes under the parties ­­ that ­­ that the parties13 have.14 But then the second layer was is the15 particular contract provision in dispute here, there the16 seniority provision that I mentioned a moment ago, the17 kind of contract provision that we believe may have some18 post­expiration binding effect on the employer. And the19 Court contrasted Nolde, in which it was severance pay,20 noting that that was in the nature of a deferred21 compensation claim, and also pointed out that if a22 particular contract right may be deemed to have accrued23 or vested while the agreement was in effect, it would24 normally remain in effect.25 JUSTICE KAGAN:38Certainly, to the extent thatto presume that the arbitrationdoes not apply here.So is this the language￼1 you're referring to, "Exceptions are determined by2 contract interpretation, rights which accrued or vested3 under the agreement will, as a general rule, survive4 termination of the agreement"?5 MS. CLARK: That is one of the passages that6 we're referring to. We're also referring to a passage7 on page 203 of the Court's opinion, which says, "A8 similar duty, i.e., a constraint on the employer after9 the expiration date," which is the sentence before, "may10 arise as well from the express or implied terms of the11 expired agreement itself." Express or implied.12 JUSTICE KAGAN: Go back to something that13 you said earlier that I wasn't sure I understood from14 reading the briefs. You said that this was a standard15 form contract that arose in Ohio for rubber companies;16 is that right?17 MS. CLARK: That's close. I mean, the18 rubber industry bargained as a group. There were a19 number ­­ and there were pattern bargaining. It was20 just common in a number of industries, you know, one21 large employer might be the lead company in a round of22 bargaining. And Goodyear was involved, as you know, in23 the early contracts here.24 So there's a bargaining with one big25 employer, and it sets a pattern. And then the other39￼1 companies in the industry bargaining with the same union2 may adopt that pattern. And that goes for wages and ­­3 and all of the economic terms of the agreement, as well4 as benefits and working conditions and everything else5 in the contract.6 This language about retiree health benefits7 shows up in a large number of the rubber contracts, and8 because they were headquartered in Ohio, not to be9 surprising, they ­­ they ­­10 JUSTICE KAGAN: And did these contracts11 arise before or after Yard­Man?12 MS. CLARK: These ­­ the initial contracts13 were pre­Yard­Man. They've obviously been renegotiated.14 For instance, the 95­point rule in this agreement was15 post­Yard­Man. I mean, it was bargained to ­­16 previously, it was somebody with at least 10 years of17 service gets 100 percent paid, and they made that a18 little bit less generous for people who are hired after19 the change was made. They adopted the 95­point rule20 with ­­ as you know, it's proportional to that for21 people with less than 95 points in age and service.22 So it's ­­ there ­­ changes were made, but23 the basic pattern of retiree gets these benefits with a24 full company contribution, the language about the25 retiree receiving a pension, which, in my mind, very401 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425plainly does speak to duration, as does survivingspouse, until death or remarriage.  I don't know how youread those words to mean anything other than duration.      So there is enough in this contract tosupport the interpretation that the retirees placed onit.  The Court properly tried the case, receivedextrinsic evidence, ruled that it was, indeed, alifetime promise.  If this Court has any doubt whethertraditional principles of contract interpretation wereapplied without presumptions, as I said earlier, wewould be willing to welcome a remand for a determinationunder traditional principles of contract interpretation.      If the Court has no further questions, Ibelieve that concludes my argument.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. Clark.      Ms. Ho, you have four minutes remaining.     REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALLYSON N. HOON BEHALF OF PETITIONERSMS. HO: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Three points: First, I think at a minimumwe're not hearing a lot here today defending Yard­Man.I think there can be little serious question thatYard­Man infected every aspect of the proceedings below.Indeed, it was dispositive.  So I think at ­­ at a41￼MS. HO: Respectfully ­­￼1 minimum we're entitled to ­­ to a vacatur and remand for2 ordinary contract principles to be require ­­ to be3 applied.4 We think that requiring clarity is5 consistent with those principles, but even as a matter6 of sort of what ­­ what Respondent has suggested in7 terms of reasonably susceptible, the standard that8 Justice Sotomayor mentions, I think it will be important9 if this Court remands for consideration of ordinary10 contract interpretation, that it's clear that what the11 Sixth Circuit has been doing under that banner is12 anything but; that looking at putting text on a par with13 extrinsic evidence is not ordinary contract14 interpretation; that ignoring contract expiration15 clauses, unless they specifically reference healthcare16 benefits, is not ordinary.17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure that's18 true. I ­­ 19202122232425JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The language of vesting has to be reasonably susceptible from something in the contract.MS. HO: Correct, Your Honor. We ­­ we absolutely agree with that, and we ­­ and we believe here the full company contribution language, which is42￼1 the promise at issue, that's the language that the Sixth2 Circuit looked at.3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the contract as a4 whole.5 MS. HO: In other words, a full company6 contribution toward healthcare benefits, when read in7 conjunction with the contract's expiration clause, it8 says for the duration of this agreement.9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How about the spouses?10 MS. HO: We believe that those ­­ those11 provisions indicate when the benefits would ­­ would ­­12 would cease; in other words, until death, until13 remarriage. And if anything, Justice, they highlight14 the absence of such language in respect to the promise15 to retirees where ordinary contract interpretation would16 tell you if ­­ if ­­ if a promise were made, that's17 where it would have been made.18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you saying it does19 continue as to the spouse? I didn't get the point.20 MS. HO: No, Your Honor. Our point ­­ our21 point is that the benefits are for the term of the22 agreement until death or remarriage, both events that23 can happen during the term ­­ during the term of the24 agreement. And in all events, Your Honor, that's not25 language that the Sixth Circuit looked at or considered431 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425in making its determination here that the benefitsvested based on the Yard­Man presumption and inference.      So at a minimum we believe that we'reentitled to a vacatur and remand for the Court ofAppeals to apply proper principles of contractinterpretation in the first instance.If there are no further questions.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
