O'Brien.            Mr. Horwich.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN HORWICH               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER            MR. HORWICH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:￼1011121314151617181920212223   as well.  There’s sentencing stuff in (A).  You can't24   say that (A) deals only with elements and (B) deals25   with sentencing.3            Section 924(c)(1) starts by defining asingle crime of using or carrying a firearm during andin relation to a crime of violence or a drug traffickingcrime.            Next, it addresses sentencing, and it doesthat by giving the judge some rules to channel hisdiscretion in particular cases, and among those is arequirement that a, quote, “person convicted of aviolation” ... “shall be sentenced” to a greater minimumsentence when the firearm is of a particular type.And --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well wait.  There’s --there’s some sentencing stuff in -- in the first part4567   well.  To the extent a statute is going to direct a1               MR. HORWICH:  Well, no, and, of course --2               JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, (A) says, "shall be3   sentenced to 5 years."  Or to 7 years, or to 10 years.So there’s sentencing stuff in (A).            MR. HORWICH:  Well, I agree with you thatthe phrase "be sentenced" certainly appears in (A) as89 10 11 12 13 1416   the firearm is brandished”; “if the firearm is17   discharged” -- they all apply to a conviction for carrying18   the firearm.  There has to be a conviction before thoseparticular sentence, it’s going to use those words.            But I think the -- we’re relying a lotmore on the language in the beginning of subparagraph (B),that says, "if the firearm possessed by a person convictedof a violation," which necessarily presupposes, then, thatthere has been a conviction --￼                 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So does -- so does the language15   of (A)(ii) and (A)(iii), which is the same language:  “if1920212223   as (B).  And -- and you don't claim that the elements in (A)24   are just sentencing elements, do you?25               MR. HORWICH:  Well, I certainly don't claim4things apply.            MR. HORWICH:  Well, I agree.  That's true.That is certainly an accurate statement --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  So that makes (A) the same 1   that they -- that the elements in the principal 2   paragraph of (A) are.  The point I’m -- the point I'm 3   trying to make is that, with respect to firearm type, 4   which is at issue here, is that the firearm type 5   provisions are introduced by specific language that 6   says -- that tells the reader these are relevant to a 7   person convicted of a violation; these are not relevant 8   to whether -- 9               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, but you’re10   forgetting the words of this subsection.  I mean --11              MR. HORWICH:  Well --12              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- the subsection would be13   (B) itself.  If you're convicted of carrying a machinegun,14   you get -- I'm sorry -- a short-barrel rifle, et cetera,15   you get 10 years.  If it's a machinegun, you get 30.￼1617181920   "subparagraph."  And "subsection" certainly in21   conventional use in drafting would refer actually to22   924(c) as a whole.            What's -- what's irrational about readingthe statute that way when it uses the word "subsection"?It didn't use "subparagraph."MR. HORWICH:  Well, I agree it doesn't use23               But -- but looking to the word "this24   subsection," Justice Sotomayor, is not -- is not useful25   for distinguishing among the elements and the sentencing523 24 25agree with that.            But, of course, Congress has also used thatsame reference to “subsection” throughout -- throughout the6 1   factors, because of course there are, I think -- 2   certainly this Court's holding in Harris says that the 3   brandishing and the discharge provisions are sentencing 4   factors.  They are part of this subsection. 5               All the courts of appeals have held, and 6   it's the entirely natural inference of the recidivism 7   provisions in subparagraph (C), which is also part of 8   this subsection, are -- are themselves sentencing 9   factors.  So saying that something is in this subsection10   means that it might be part of a violation doesn't11   actually answer what is or is not part of the violation12 versus --13               JUSTICE SCALIA:  But still and all, if -- if14   Congress were being precise and if the statute is to be15   read the way you suggest, the introduction to capital16   (B) should have been "if the firearm possessed by a17   person convicted of a violation of paragraph (A) above,"18   and then pick it up, "is," so forth.￼1920   precise.2122   precise that we wouldn't be here discussing it today.  IRight?  I mean, that would -- would be moreMR. HORWICH:  That -- that I think would be so12345678   element.  The Court has held otherwise already.JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.entire statute, even if it's not being used in the mostprecise sense, in the sense that a violation of thissubsection appears in subparagraph (C), it appears insubparagraph (D), which is not --           MR. HORWICH:  -- which is not then to say thatthis subsection -- that everything in this subsection is an￼9 10 11 1214   traditional treatment of recidivism.15               But, more generally, the tradition that16   Congress is working within in this new statute -- which,17   I want to point out, is significantly different in -- in18   a very substantive way from the old statute -- that the19   new statute proscribes a statutory maximum of life in20   all cases.  That is different from the old statute.  The21   old statute --22               JUSTICE BREYER:  What is this to do -- I23   mean, the obvious question, to me, is -- since I wrote24   the -- I think I wrote the opinion in Castillo -- is we25   looked at the language of the statute, very similar to7            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I guess I agree with youthat if (B) is -- if (B) is an element, (C) would be anelement, too.                 MR. HORWICH:  Well, that certainly would be13   the inference.  And that would be quite contrary to the 1   this, and we said:  Machinegun means a separate crime. 2   And they recodified it.  And it looks to me as if all 3   they did was take the things that we previously said 4   were separate crimes and put them in (B), and take the 5   things that are obviously sentencing factors and put 6   them in (A) and (C). 7               All right.  Now, that's what it looks like 8   if you just read the statute.  I didn't find anything in 9   the history that suggested any other intent.  So why do10   you think that that change makes the difference?11               MR. HORWICH:  Well, I think there are --12   there are several specific changes that Congress made.13   And I think it would be, perhaps, useful to look at the14   old statute and the new one, the old statute and the new15   one together and see why the things that -- that the16   Court said in Castillo are gone in the new one.  So the17   old statute is in the petition appendix at 11a.18               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.19               MR. HORWICH:  And then the new statute is in20   the appendix to the government's opening brief at 1a and21   2a, so you can look at them side by side.22               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Isn't the old one in your23   brief, too, in your --24               MR. HORWICH:  It is.25               JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's 3a of the government's8￼1 brief. 2               MR. NORWICH:  It is, although, of course, 3   you have to turn the page, and I -- 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:  All right.  Okay. 5               MR. HORWICH:  Perhaps it's helpful to look 6   at them next to each other, because the differences are 7   quite stark -- 8              JUSTICE SCALIA:  All right. 9              MR. HOWICH:  -- when you do that.10               So the first thing is, as you suggested,11   Justice Breyer, the firearm type provisions were moved.12   But I think that that move signals something contrary to13   what this Court had perceived in Castillo.  In Castillo,14   the firearm type provisions were part of the initial15   sentence that defined the elements.  The sentence is16   rolling along, talking about using or carrying a17   firearm, and then in the same breath it goes on to start18   talking about specific weapons.  And that is what, in my19   reading of Castillo, drove the Court's impression that20   the they -- that the machinegun provision there should be21   an element.22               The difference in the new statute is -- is23   that Congress has moved it away, textually,24   conceptually, structurally, away from the elements,25   which ought to suggest that Congress doesn't think --9￼1               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But it didn't.  It kept2   in (A) the subdivisions of use and brandishing, which3   we all agree are elements of the crime.  So I don't know4   what it means to say that it moved it away from the5   elements.  It mixed up in (A) elements and sentencing6789   you:  What in the legislative history shows that?  Wherefactors, and so what we have to discern was, did itintend to make (B) sentencing factors or not?And I think what Justice Breyer was asking￼10   do we read, outside of Castillo, a conclusion that11   somehow Congress radically changed the assumptions we12   identified in Castillo, which is historically it's not a13   sentencing element?14               MR. HORWICH:  So a few answers there.15               First of all, in the new -- in the new16   structure of the statute, on the government's view, the17   elements finish in the principal paragraph, and then --18   then we're into sentencing factors.  So brandishing and19   discharge were held in Harris and acknowledged in Dean20   to be sentencing factors.  So we are sort of, at that21   point, on to sentencing factors.22               So I take from what this Court said in23   Harris, about the separation of brandishing and discharge24   from the elements in the principal paragraph to indicate25   that they are sentencing factors, would apply even more10 1   strongly to subparagraph (C), which is even farther 2   away.  There’s -- there’s a period, a structural break, 3   a new sentence.  The thought in the principal paragraph is 4   certainly complete.  We’ve already been through some 5   other sentencing factors, and now we’re -- 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, except that with -- 7   with (C), you -- you could say that traditionally 8   recidivism has been a sentencing factor, and you cannot 9   say with respect to (B) that whether it's a10   short-barreled rifle or a machinegun has traditionally11   been a sentencing factor.  To the contrary, it was an12 element.13               MR. HORWICH:  Well, I disagree with that,14   Justice Scalia, because the tradition, as I understand15   it, is relevant because it might indicate what Congress16   was thinking or what suppositions it had in mind when it17   passed a statute.18               And there’s a very -- there was a very19   different tradition at the time of the 1986 enactment of20   the old statute and the 1998 enactment of the new one,21   which is -- the big difference is that the sentencing22   guidelines came into effect in between those two times.23               And the sentencing guidelines -- sentencing24   guideline 2K2.1, the principal determinant of base25   offense level in the sentencing guidelines for11￼1   firearm-centric offenses in the Federal criminal law, was2   firearm type.  So it was unmistakably that -- it was3   unmistakable at the time in 1998 when Congress enacted4   these -- these firearm-type provisions, that the5   sentencing guidelines were already making firearm type a6   sentencing consideration for the judge.7               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let's -- let's talk about8   the guidelines.  Without the application of (B), the￼ 910111213141516171819202122232425guidelines would provide for a much shorter sentence,wouldn't they?            MR. HORWICH:  Well, the guidelines -- asbefore and as now for this offense, the guidelines levelis the minimum.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  The guidelines -- do youthink that if under the guidelines the sentence was30 years because of a machinegun, do you think that thatwould be upheld?            MR. HORWICH:  I'm sorry.  And your -- if Iunderstand you --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you think it would beupheld as a reasonable sentence under our Booker/Fanfantheory of -- of how the guidelines are to be applied?            MR. HORWICH:  A reasonable -- well,certainly courts have, since Booker, imposed even up toa life sentence for offenses that did not otherwise122021222324   about life, then these are not mandatory minimums.  To25   the contrary, they are -- they are new maximums.13 1   trigger the elevated minimums.  There’s at least one 2   case in the few years since Booker that implied a -- 3   that imposed a life sentence for a -- for an offense 4   that would have been subject only to the base 5-year 5   maximum.  There are several that imposed -- imposed a 6   life sentence for -- 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where -- where is the life 8   sentence maximum, by the way?  I -- you say this is a 9   minimum.  It's just a mandatory minimum because the10   maximum is specified to be life.  Where is that specified?11               MR. HORWICH:  The -- the maximum is not12   textually in the statute, but all courts that have looked13   at this have understood that.  Certainly, it seems to be14   the supposition of this Court's statutory holding in Harris15   that the nature of -- the structure of this -- of the16   sentencing provision here is that there's a life maximum,17   and then the firearm --18               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where -- where do you get19   the life maximum?  I -- I'm reading through, and there's￼-- it mentions nothing about life.            MR. HORWICH:  Well, it is certainly thecase, if we simply take (a)(1) --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And if it mentions nothing            MR. HORWICH:  I absolutely disagree.  If itsays “at least,” that can only mean that there can be some-- a sentence higher than that.12345 the --6               MR. HORWICH:  Or not less than.7               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- what the substantive8   crime was?  Is it the attempted robbery or whatever it was?JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is the life part of￼9 10 1113141516171819202122232425Is that -- because this is -- you're -- you’re saying thisis an add-on to an underlying offense.                 MR. HORWICH:  Well, I wouldn't describe it12   as an add-on.  It is a separate Federal crime, in -- inthe sense -- in the sense that it is bad enough anddangerous enough to commit a drug trafficking offenseor engage in a crime of --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, then -- then youwouldn't be relying on what might be a life sentencefor the underlying crime.            MR. HORWICH:  I -- oh, I'm sorry.  I -- Imay have -- may have misspoken.            In response to Justice Scalia's question, myanswer -- my answer was directed to imposing a lifesentence on the 924(c) conviction, separate fromwhatever sentence may have been imposed on the --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, but where do you get144 5 6 7 8 9            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But where is -- where isthe maximum?            MR. HORWICH:  The -- well, because there isno stated maximum, the -- the assumption then must bethat a sentence higher than 5 years is appropriate.There is no --1011121314151617   that the judge is finding the maximum.  The -- the18   implied maximum term here is -- is life.  Congress --19               JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't find that implied20   at all.  I don't see why it's implied.21 22 23 24 25            MR. HORWICH:  Well, the trouble,Justice Scalia, is then that I don't otherwise know whatthe maximum would be.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's right.  That’s --            MR. HORWICH:  The maximum --151   the maximum?  You say, oh, these are just minimums.2               MR. HORWICH:  Well, they are minimums3   because they say "not less than 5 years."  That applies --￼            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is there a SixthAmendment problem with reading a statute this way,with -- with reading a statute to provide for anunlimited maximum when Congress hasn't specified it, andnow you’re going to have the judge find the minimum andthe maximum?MR. HORWICH:  Well, I don't -- I disagree1234   to?  And then doesn't the minimum in that case sort of5678   impose a new sentence at all.  It just says there will9   be added to whatever the sentence is for the crime ofbecome de facto the maximum?            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think what you areJUSTICE SCALIA:  That's her question.            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But isn't there a SixthAmendment problem with not knowing what you are exposedexposed to, as I read the statute, (c)(1)(A) does not￼10   violence or the drug trafficking crime -- there will be11   added to that sentence.  Then it says you’ll add 712131415   crime to which (c)(1)(A) refers.  That way, the wholeyears; you’ll add 25 years; you’ll add 30 years.            Those are not mandatory minimums.  Those areadd-ons to the sentence provided by the substantive16171819   add-ons.  There’s no question that this -- that this20   statute defines an offense that someone can be convicted21   of.  That certainly is the implication of this Court's22   holding in Deal.  It is a separate offense which23   therefore should carry its own punishment.  And the24   contrast --25JUSTICE SCALIA:  I’ll amend what I said.16thing makes sense.            MR. HORWICH:  Well, I don't think it wouldmake sense to treat them, as you are describing them, as1   It is a mandatory minimum if the substantive crime2   referred to in (c)(1)(A) is above what is specified3   in -- in this statute.  But if it -- if it is below4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that, if the drug trafficking crime only provided for15 years, and you did the crime with a machinegun, youget 30 years, that's an add-on.            MR. HORWICH:  Well, I -- I think it would behelpful then to compare this to the -- the language ofthe prior statute, which describes exactly what you aredescribing.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I got it.            MR. HORWICH:  Which is -- which is thatwhoever during or in relation, et cetera, et cetera,uses or carries a firearm --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can you give us the page?            MR. HORWICH:  I'm sorry, this is at 11a ofthe petition appendix.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's also on 3a of thegovernment's brief.            MR. HORWICH:  Or 3a of the -- of thegovernment's -- the government’s brief.            The old statute said exactly what you aredescribing, Justice Scalia, which is that whoever duringor in relation to a crime of violence, et cetera, usesor carries a firearm shall, in addition to the17￼sentences.123456789   language.  It didn't.  It changed the language.  The newpunishment provided for such crime of violence, etcetera -- and then it specifies --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.MR. HORWICH:  -- particular determinateJUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.            MR. HORWICH:  If Congress had wanted tocontinue that approach, I assume it would have kept that￼10111213   the end of (c)(1)(A):  “Who, in furtherance ... possesses a14   firearm shall, in addition to the punishment providedlanguage says "be sentenced to a term of imprisonment ofnot less than 5 years," which leaves -- which leaves --JUSTICE SCALIA:  It says “in addition to” at15   for by such crime of violence, be sentenced to” 516   years, 7 years, 10 years.  And then if the17   firearm, blah, blah, blah, is blah, blah, blah -- since18   your -- I assume that that introductory language "in19   addition to the punishment provided for" is implicit in20   (B).  It's expressed in (A), but I think it's implicit21 in (B).22               MR. HORWICH:  That -- I understand that23   language, the in -- the "in addition to" language, to24   have -- to have been to make clear that this is a25   separate offense.  There is separate punishment for a18 1   separate conviction of this separate offense. 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes. 3               MR. HORWICH:  And that then it is a 4   separate -- then from there it is a question what is the 5   appropriate sentence for a conviction on the offense 6   described in 924(c)(1), which is to say, well, it's a 7   term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years, which 8   holds open -- 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:  In addition to the term10   that’s -- that exists for the substantive offense.11               MR. HORWICH:  I -- I agree.  And if you look12   in subparagraph (D)(ii) it says that the term of13   imprisonment imposed under this subsection shall run14   consecutive to the other one, which -- which again shows15   that -- that the considerations for sentencing in this16   -- in this law are distinct from the -- it is a -- it is17   a separate question what the sentence on the 924(c) --18               JUSTICE BREYER:  To make your life a little19   more complicated and difficult, though perhaps it makes20   it easier, we reach the questions that Justice Scalia21   was raising, I think, and they are important only if you22   win, only if we say that it is a sentencing factor.  If￼23 24 25it is a new crime, we don't have any problem, because ifit's a new crime, the jury has to find the fact.            But if it's a sentencing factor, then we get19 1   into the problem of Harris versus Apprendi.  And then you 2   have to decide whether it's maximum, minimum, et cetera. 3   But in Harris, I said that I thought Apprendi does cover 4   mandatory minimums, but I don't accept Apprendi.  Well, 5   at some point I guess I have to accept Apprendi, because 6   it's the law and has been for some time. 7               So if and in fact, unfortunately for 8   everyone, I was -- it was 5-4 in that, I think, so my vote 9   mattered, and I don't know what other people think10   but in -- on this Court.  But if that becomes an issue,11   if that should become an issue about whether mandatory12   minimums are treated like the maximums for Apprendi13   purposes, should we reset the case for argument?  Or do14   you feel, in your opinion that -- that you’ve had15   enough of an argument because you devoted two or three16   pages to this topic?17               MR. HORWICH:  Well, to answer -- well, first18   of all, there certainly has not been in -- in the19   briefing or argument here, any opportunity for this Court20   to consider what it would need to consider to overrule21   McMillan.  We’re not talking about overruling Harris.22   We’re talking about overruling McMillan.  And --￼23 24 25            JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I think basicallyApprendi did significantly change McMillan, but that’s --            MR. HORWICH:  Well, and that’s -- and that20 1   would be my -- my second point, is that -- is that since 2   -- I think it has been become clearer since Harris that 3   the rule in McMillan and the rule in Apprendi coexist 4   quite well and coexist in a principled fashion, and 5   that there is -- and that there is no -- Harris was 6   correct in light of Apprendi, which is -- which is in 7   the following respect. 8               JUSTICE BREYER:  Does the government believe 9   that it has sufficiently argued this, or would you suggest10   on the government's behalf that if it becomes an issue11   it's set for reargument?  That was really my question.12               MR. HORWICH:  Well, yes, we would certainly13   want to set it for reargument --14               JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's the right answer.15               MR. HORWICH:  -- obviously.16               (Laughter.)17               MR. HORWICH:  But -- but I -- again, I don't18   even think that's necessary.  Respondents have offered19   nothing in the way of a justification for overruling20   Harris.  And again, the distinction is --21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why can't we just say, as22   Judge Boudin did, they weren't -- this revision was on23   the books before Castillo was decided, so obviously24   Congress wasn't trying to adjust the statute in response25   to Castillo.  And they -- they made it read more easily.21￼ 1   We know the one thing Congress was concerned with was adding 2   possession, which was not there before.  So they added 3   possession.  They made it more readable. 4               Some of the concerns that were expressed in 5   Castillo are certainly present here.  There is a huge 6   jump from a 5-year add-on to a 30-year add-on for -- for 7   the machinegun.  So why don't we just say, well, this 8   statute has been revised, but it wasn't in response to 9   Castillo?  It's not all that different.10               MR. HORWICH:  Well, I disagree that it's11   not all that different.  And -- and for the following12   three -- for three reasons.  First of all, setting aside13   my disagreement with Justice Scalia, if you accept that14   the statutory maximum is life, as I believe every court15   to have confronted this understands it to be, then this16   statute belongs to an entirely different tradition than17   the tradition that Castillo belonged to, which is to18   say that this statute -- the -- the role of firearm type19   in this statute is to channel the sentencing judge's20   discretion by ruling out certain low sentences when21   certain facts are present, such as the presence of a22   machinegun.23               That is something that when Congress wants24   to channel --25               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't a minimum always a22￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9maximum?MR. HORWICH:  No, I --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In -- to the person whowould otherwise, in the judge's discretion, qualify for alower sentence, doesn't it become that person's maximumonce you have indiscretion?            MR. HORWICH:  I disagree with that becausethe principle -- the background -- the basic principlebehind Apprendi and our criminal law is that what youcan rely on is what Congress has said in the statute orin -- as Booker holds --￼101112131415   be, but a judge's discretion to start from zero.  If16   that judge was inclined to give you zero, isn't the17   minimum then your statutory maximum?  You're -- because18   that's what the judge has to give you.            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What you can rely on inan indeterminate sentencing regime without a minimum isthat you’ve got a statutory maximum, whatever it may19               MR. HORWICH:  I disagree with that, because20   it is not the only thing the judge can give you.  The21   full range of punishment above those minimums is22   available.  I was indicating earlier that --23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel -- counsel,24   I think you had said you had three responses to Justice25   Ginsburg --23 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   channel his discretion with minimum sentences.  We 9   observed this in our opening brief, and Respondents said10   nothing in response.11               As far as we know, every time Congress wants12   to channel a sentencing judge's discretion, it does it13   with a sentencing factor.  That is a difference.14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  All right.  Number two?15               MR. HORWICH:  Number two is that the -- is16   that the -- the -- the linguistic change here, the17   textual change, the fact that subparagraph (D) says "a18   person convicted of a violation of this subsection."19   That presupposes there has been a conviction, that the20   jury has been charged with whatever the elements of the21   offense are and that now what's going to be stated in22   clauses (B)(i) and (B)(ii) are things that are relevant23   at sentencing.24               And then the third -- and then the third25   point is -- is that -- is essentially the structural24MR. HORWICH:  Yes.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- and only got one out.            MR. HORWICH:  Right, and perhaps onlyhalf of that one, which is -- which is that in the -- onthe question of -- of tradition, Congress apparentlyexclusively uses sentencing factors when it wants to donothing more than give some rules to the judge to￼ 1   change from -- that I alluded to earlier, of moving 2   firearm type wholly away from the elements of the 3   offense.  That made a difference to this Court in 4   Harris.  It is -- it would be, I think, irreconcilable 5   with this Court's holding in Harris to say that 6   brandishing and discharge have been moved far enough 7   away from the elements to make them sentencing factors, 8   or rather are stated far enough away from the elements, 9   structurally separated enough to make them10   sentencing factors, but then to --11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Those are all -- all12   three of those are -- are pretty subtle ways for13   Congress to change the view in Castillo.14               MR. HORWICH:  Well, I would agree that --15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Moving something16   from the body of the paragraph to a separate section and17 so on.18               MR. HORWICH:  Well, I would -- I would point19   out -- of course, one has to -- one has to recognize what20   Congress had before it when it -- when it made the21   change, which is to say, when it -- when it embarked on22   these revisions, there was a one-to-one circuit split on23   the question.  And by the time it had finished making24   the changes, it was actually three to one in favor of25   sentencing factor interpretation in the old statute.25￼7 8 9further should not be a reason to -- to not payattention to the structural and textural changes that itdid make.            Now, I agree that if Castillo had been onthe books and Congress had said nothing about it, thatmight be a basis to say that Congress was acquiescing in1234   that interpretation.  But it's -- it's -- Congress was5   certainly concerned with much more substantial issues in6   the revisions.  And the fact that it did not comment￼101112131415161718192021   the context for this case.  The government cannot point22   to a single defendant under this provision for the23   conduct at issue who has ever received more than24   10 years in prison absent the use of a machinegun.25               We cited a long string of cases in the26I’d like to reserve.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.JUSTICE SCALIA:  We have tall lawyers today.What is this, tall lawyer day?            (Laughter.)CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Fisher.ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSMR. FISHER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:            I think it's important at the outset to set 1   O'Brien brief and the government's response in its reply 2   brief was silent.  So, therefore, the government is here 3   today claiming that it is entitled, based on the fact of 4   a machinegun, to get 20 years more than any defendant 5   that perpetrated this conduct has ever gotten, and 6   indeed 18 more years than the government itself asked 7   the district judge in this case for, once the machinegun 8   provision was off the table, under the guise that this 9   is nothing more than a sentencing factor.10               We think that this Court's statutory11   interpretation jurisprudence as well, if necessary, this12   Court's constitutional jurisprudence foreclose such a13 result.14               Let me start with statutory interpretation.15   On the government's theory in 1998, Congress stepped in16   and took a statute that made machinegun use an element17   and transformed it into -- into a sentencing factor.  In18   other words, Congress, without a peep, a mutter, or19   anything, and in -- in the course of doing something20   entirely different, which was reacting to this Court's21   Bailey decision, stepped in and took a fact that22   formerly had to be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable23   doubt to trigger a 30-year sentence and left that same24   sentence in place but now allowed it to be proved to a25   judge by a preponderance, based on a presentence report,27￼ 1   and, indeed, according to the government, also stripped 2   away the mens rea requirement that attached to the 3   statute when it was an element. 4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How about the short -- 5   what is it, the one that gets 10 years, the 6   short-barreled rifle?  That's -- that's -- those two 7   are together in the statute, and you said that it would 8   be startling because of the difference between 10 years 9   and the 30 years, but the short-barreled rifle is the10   same amount of time in discharging, and discharging is a11   sentencing factor.12               MR. FISHER:  We think, Justice Ginsburg,13   that if this Court had to construe that statute in a14   different case, that provision, it would find it's still15   an element.  Now, I grant that it’s a difference, a16   very significant difference between 10 and 30 years, but17   structurally it is an element.18               And I think an -- a good way to go about19   understanding this -- I heard my -- my opponent today say20   that this would be indistinguishable from Harris or fly21   in the face of Harris.22               Well, there's three very important23   differences between the machinegun provision at issue24   here and the discharge provision in Dean and the25   brandishing provision in Harris.  The first difference28￼ 1   is that this an entirely separate subparagraph. 2               Now, if you imagine somebody amending the 3   statute and wanting to accomplish what the government 4   says was accomplished here, why wouldn't the firearm 5   type provisions just have been (iv) and (v) under 6   capital letter (A)?  They’re not. 7               What the draftsperson did instead is break 8   them out into an entirely separate, stand-alone 9   provision.  As the AUSA described it, when he charged10   them in the alternative in the district of11   Massachusetts, he said I think it's a greater and lesser12   offense situation.  And that's what we think.13               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, I guess I'm not14   following the ball here.  I thought the government had15   conceded that sub (i), sub (ii), sub (iii) under (A) are16   not sentencing factors but are elements.  Is that not --17               MR. FISHER:  I don't understand that to be18   what the government has said.  I believe the￼19202122232425government's argument is that the big paragraph withcapital letter (A) sets forth the elements, and then sub(i), (ii), and (iii) are merely sentencing factors.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Now, they have to becausethat's what Harris said, brandished --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That’s -- yes, that’s Harris.           JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- brandished is a2912345   then.  I agree with you.6 7 8 9(Laughter.)sentencing factor.           MR. FISHER:  That's right.  That's right,Justice Ginsburg.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's even worse,            MR. FISHER:  So what sub (B) does, as Isaid, is it creates a greater offense, and so, it’sbroken out in a way that incorporates the earlierelements up above in the main paragraph by using the￼1011   phrase:  If a “firearm possessed by a person12   convicted of a violation of this subsection.”13               That phrase, we believe, incorporates the14   earlier elements.  Remember in Harris this Court15   emphasized that the brandishing provision just kept16   going in the sentence and did not incorporate earlier17 elements.18               So when the government stands here today and19   says, well, when you incorporate the earlier elements,20   that shows it’s a sentencing factor, too, it seems to me a21   situation of heads, I win; tails, you lose.22               JUSTICE BREYER:  No, their -- their -- their23   basic argument is look at the statute.  (A) has what is24   undoubtedly a set of sentencing factors.  Brandishing and25   discharging are as traditional as they come.  Then look301 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425at (C), and you find some other ones that are sentencing factors, because recidivism is as traditional as it comes. And between those two they put (B).So since the neighbors, (A) and (C), are certainly sentencing, they must have meant (B) to be a sentencing factor, too. I -- as I understand it, that is one of their basic arguments.MR. FISHER: Right. And let me -- let megive two responses to that. First of all, if you --if you look again at the appendix of the government'smain brief, which is 1a and 2a, the guts of thestatute is the “use or carry” language or “possesses a firearm” language in the main paragraph.And then, the -- from the “possessed” language down through sub (iii), what you have is the Bailey fix right there. So, then what happens --JUSTICE SCALIA: And you believe there is a background of life sentence? You agree with thegovernment that --MR. FISHER: I don't think that’snecessarily the case, Justice Scalia. This Court -- JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it either is orisn't. You --MR. FISHER: -- has said a couple of timesthat this is a theoretical maximum sentence, but, surely,31￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425if nothing else, the Sentencing Reform Act sets a maximum sentence here if it's not just a straight determinant sentence.And we've argued at length in the O'Brien brief that the reasonableness requirement under 3553 of the Sentencing Reform Act would have to set a maximum sentence. And for the reason I said at the outset, given that no one has ever received more than 10 years absent a machinegun here, certainly that maximum sentence would be far less than life and far less than 30 years. But --JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's the -- I don't want to interrupt your nice organization here. But what is the principle, the general rule, that you articulate to support the distinction between 30 being necessarily an element and 7 a sentencing factor? What's the general rule here?just --MR. FISHER: Let me answer it -- JUSTICE KENNEDY: Other than, this isMR. FISHER: If I might say one more --JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- other than how awful this is.MR. FISHER: If I might say one more sentence to Justice Breyer, and then I’ll answer that.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Please.32￼                 Now, Justice Kennedy, you asked the general10   principle.  The general principle is this, at least in1               MR. FISHER:  Justice Breyer, the other thing2   I'd point out is that, so therefore, once you make the3   Bailey fix, you just come -- in the old statute, then4   you come to the machinegun provision, and you just leave5   it where it was.  And, in fact, there are plenty of6   statutes that we’ve cited in both briefs where there are7   elements in the middle, sandwiched between sentencing8 factors.9￼11   terms of this Court's Sixth Amendment law, is that:  The12   critical question to ask is whether the defendant could13   receive the sentence the government seeks without the14   fact at issue.15               Seven years is a sentence the defendant here16   could receive without the machinegun finding.  Thirty years171819202122232425is absolutely off bounds.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is that just based onempirical studies or is there guideline support forthat?            MR. FISHER:  There is both, Your Honor.  Ofcourse, the guidelines are not binding --that.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I understand.  I understandMR. FISHER:  -- but the guideline sentences335 6 7 8 97 years is a sentence he could otherwise receive.            MR. FISHER:  Under the facts that either weprove to the jury or are admitted by the defendant.So -- so in this case, the defendant could receive 7years, and we've conceded that.as -- as to this statute are pegged exactly to themandatory minimums.1234   otherwise receive under what?  The sentence -- you sayCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  Could￼101112131415161718   defendants had admitted that they did.  Seven years --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  There must be somestatutory provision that you -- that you -- that yourely upon.MR. FISHER:  Oh, certainly, Justice Scalia.JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where does 7 years comefrom?from the statute, for brandishing, which is what bothMR. FISHER:  Seven years comes from -- comes1920212223   sentencing factor.  We're willing to concede that.  But24   then you go to the guidelines, which sets a25   7-year -- a 7-year recommended sentence.34            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, but we knowthat's a sentencing factor.            MR. FISHER:  But they've admitted it.  Sothey've waived any Sixth Amendment right as to that 1               Under this Court's jurisprudence following 2   Booker, we know that we take that recommendation and we 3   plug it into section 3553(a), which, if you want the 4   statutory language, directs that a sentence “no greater 5   than necessary to serve the following factors” be 6   introduced -- I'm sorry, be imposed.  And when you look 7   at those factors, disparity is a factor this Court has 8   left in place and emphasized at every term since Booker, 9   and the guideline sentence.  And when you put -- plug10   those things into the facts here, we simply suggest11   there is no way that it would be upheld as substantively12   reasonable if the defendant got 30 years absent the13   machinegun fact here.14               And we’ve also cited in our brief several15   places where the government itself makes this -- the16   mirror image of the argument that I'm making in the17   post-Booker, Gall, Rita world, when judges deviate18   downward from the guidelines.  They emphasize -- we19   quoted one Eleventh Circuit case in our brief where the20   government got overturned, as substantively unreasonable,21   a downward variance from a guideline recommendation,22   because no defendant had ever received such a low23 sentence.24               But I don't have to, of course, hang my hat25   on this -- on the strict application of Apprendi here.35￼ 1   We think there's also an even deeper problem that 2   predates this Court's Apprendi jurisprudence, which was 3   flagged by this Court as early as McMillan, where this 4   Court said that if what Congress does is step in 5   and manipulate the elements of a crime in order 6   to relieve the government of its obligation to prove 7   ordinary and traditional elements, then we have a pure 8   due process problem, irrespective of any Sixth Amendment9 problem.10               Now, this Court has never found such a11   problem, but I would emphasize that the --12               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do we find it with13   this statute, if there’s a 10-year minimum/maximum14   under (A) subdivision (iii) if the firearm is15   discharged, and it's 10 years; and if it's a16   short-barreled rifle under (B), it's also an equal17   amount, of 10 years?  I think that's what￼1819202122232425Justice Ginsburg was pointing to.            So the question I have for you is:  How dowe find substantive unreasonableness?            MR. FISHER:  How do we find substantivelyunreasonable after Booker?            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Unreasonableness, thatthere was an act of manipulation here, or intent tomanipulate.364 5 6 7 8 9principle this Court first articulated in McMillan, andyou apply it here --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly.1               MR. FISHER:  Well, if you’re asking me the2   question -- I want to be sure I understand and answer the3   question.  If you’re asking me how applying the            MR. FISHER:  I don't think you have to lookany further -- well, there is two places you can look.You can look both at the intent of Congress and theeffect of what it did.￼10111213   page 33 of its merits brief, where it says:  What14   Congress was intending to do here is, quote, "simplify15   and streamline guilt-stage proceedings" by relieving the16   government of its burden to prove this case -- this fact17   beyond a reasonable doubt to the judge.  So that strikes18   one as, as this Court put it in Harris, an intent to            The intent of Congress, at least ashypothesized by the Solicitor General, is laid out at19   evade the ordinary requirements in the Fifth and Sixth20   Amendments.21               Then, as to effect, you can look at what22   I've also -- what I've already emphasized, which is that23   this sentence simply is not otherwise available, absent24   that fact.  And that, on its own, ought to tell this Court25   that it's dealing with an element.371 But if it wants to dig even deeper, it could2 -- it could describe it in terms of a 20-year increase3 over what the defendant would otherwise get or what,4 indeed, as we’ve said, anyone has ever gotten for this act,5 absent a machinegun. It could do it in terms of percentage6 and say it's 83 percent higher; the Court used the phrase once,7 "tail wagging the dog." I don't think it matters8 exactly what exact avenue this Court would pick. Again,9 if it were doing a constitutional analysis -- I’m10 speaking right now constitutionally instead of11 statutorily -- it would all end up at the same place.12 But I want to make sure that I understood13 your question also, with due respect to you, Justice14 Ginsburg, because what I was talking about was 10 years under15 (A)(iii), of course, is a sentencing factor, as this Court16 held in Dean, whereas under (B)(i), the same length of a17 sentence might be an element. That was a matter -- that18 was a statutory answer, and I think, as a matter of19 statutory construction, which is, of course, the first20 thing you're going to address in this case, what we21 think we can win on without even reaching the22 constitutional questions. And the differences would be,23 apart from the same sentence, you have the structural24 difference that I've emphasized. You have the tradition.25 And let me say a word about tradition, if I38￼little bit of a bait-and-switch to say that, well,Castillo decides this case. 1   might.  The government emphasizes the guidelines and 2   other kinds of statutes.  When this Court applies the 3   tradition canon that it established in Almendarez-Torres 4   and Castillo, I don't know why you have to look any 5   further than Castillo itself to answer the tradition 6   question.  In Jones, as this Court put it, the reason we 7   look to tradition is because if it's a close case, we’re 8   going to not assume that Congress intended a radical 9   departure from past practice.  Well, the past practice10   here is absolutely unequivocal.  This Court held in11   Castillo, 9-0, that Congress intended this to be an12 element.13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, the Court's --14   the Court's opinion in Castillo quite carefully noted15   that it wasn't addressing this statute.  I think it's a￼16171819   absolutely decides the case.  My contention that I was20   trying to make is that when this Court looks toMR. FISHER:  I don't contend that Castillo21   tradition for purposes of construing the new amendments,22   that Castillo gives the answer on -- at least on23   tradition, at least as applying that particular24   question.  Because Congress, we know, intended it to be25   an element at least until 1998.39 1               But I think that even -- even if you were to 2   step back from the Castillo analysis itself and the 3   Castillo factors themselves, you would also, I think, do 4   well to give -- again, not dispositive, but -- but 5   careful treatment to Castillo, because Congress steps 6   in, of course, and amends statutes all the time.  They 7   step in and they amend one portion of a statute, and 8   while they are at it, we know from the manuals that we've 9   cited and from the examples in the back of the O'Brien10   brief that Congress often, while they’re amending one11   part, they reorganize or reword other parts of the12 statute.13               And this Court, across its statutory14   interpretation jurisprudence, within criminal law and15   outside, has always said that once we say the law means16   something, we're not going to assume that Congress17   changed the law unless we get some sort of clear18   indication from Congress that it -- that it intended to19   change the law.20               Now, here, as I think has been emphasized,21   but I’ll just reiterate, there’s not a peep of22   anything in the legislative history or anything to23   suggest that Congress was -- was intending to change the24   law here.  And, in fact, it's not even a mere silence25   case.  We know quite clearly and affirmatively that40￼ 1   Congress was intending to do something entirely 2   different, which was respond to this Court's Bailey3 decision. 4               But even in the language -- and the only 5   thing I think the Solicitor General even has for it in 6   this case is the language and structure, which are some 7   different words and different placement that it can at 8   least build an argument off of, because the other four 9   of the five Castillo factors are entirely unchanged.10   But even the language, we submit, is a far cry from the11   kind of change this Court ought to require before it12   does a 180-degree switch as to what it had said the13   prior law meant.14               Just for purposes of stability in the law,15   if nothing else, I think this -- it behooves this Court16   to take its prior decisions seriously and to -- and to17   engage in a dialogue with Congress that encourages18   Congress to be clear when it wants to change what the19   prior law is.20               JUSTICE SCALIA:  The prior statute -- which21   was 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(1), right?  That did deal with22   short-barreled rifle, short-barreled shotgun,23   machinegun, and so forth, but that's -- that provision24   didn't say anything about brandishing or discharge.25   Where -- what was -- how were they treated under the41￼ 1   prior law? 2 3   not in the statute itself.  My understanding is that 4   judges as -- on an ad hoc basis, would have treated 5   those as sentencing factors. 6               And what Congress did -- when it came in to 7   respond to this Court's Bailey decision, I think it 8   codified all of the different manners of using the gun 9   in the context of one of these crimes.  So it not just10   dealt with, yes, possessing ought to be covered, but it11   talked about other manners, brandishing and discharging.12   In Castillo, this Court emphasized again the big13   difference between manner of using a gun and the type of14   firearm which lies at the core of this offense.15               If I would turn -- if I would leave the16   Court with nothing else, let me emphasize again to the17   Court the difference between this statute, which I think18   the government wants you to think is no different in19   intent, effect, or operation than the two that this20   Court prior -- dealt with in Harris, as a matter of both21   statutory construction and constitutional law, and in22   McMillan, as a matter of constitutional law.23               What this Court emphasized in both of those24   cases was that there was a preexisting law on the books25   that criminalized certain activity.  And then a42MR. FISHER:  They -- as you say, they were￼ 1   legislature later stepped in and set a mandatory minimum 2   for a particular fact that could accompany the crime at 3   issue.  And it did so in a very minor way.  For example, 4   in Pennsylvania, the various crimes covered by the 5   firearm mandatory minimum in that case gave 10-, 20-year 6   sentences routinely, and all the Pennsylvania 7   legislature did was step in and say:  If he uses a gun, 8   we want at least 5 years.  And in Harris, as I've 9   just emphasized, I think, in discussing with10   Justice Scalia, the Court dealt with a bump of just 211   years.  Again, what judges were already customarily12   doing, I think, under the statute.13               Here, this is entirely and dramatically14   different.  Here, the fact allows a sentence -- indeed,15   requires a sentence -- that is 20 years longer than16   anyone has ever gotten for this conduct at issue.  That17   is a difference not just -- it's not a minor difference.18   It is a categorically different difference that we think19   is enough, combined with other principles of statutory20   and constitutional interpretation, to -- I'm sorry,21   statutory interpretation to resolve this case on the22   statute alone.23               But if you need to look to the Constitution,24   we think that the Sixth Amendment, either as the25   bright-line rule articulated in Apprendi dictates that43￼1 any fact that allows a greater sentence than the2 defendant could otherwise receive is subject to the3 Sixth Amendment, or sort of plain, pure due process,4 tail-that-wags-the-dog analysis, that this Court5 emphasized in McMillan -- either of those would be6 enough, and indeed require, a finding of7 unconstitutionality here and a finding this Court8 can avoid.9 And if nothing else, Justice Breyer, I would10 say that we think that this case can be resolved on statutory11 grounds. We think there are narrower constitutional12 arguments that would either require reading it narrowly13 or striking it down if you had to, on even narrower14 grounds. But if nothing else, then we would ask this15 Court to revisit Harris, if necessary.16 We don't think it's necessary to resolve the17 case for us here, but we think that would be appropriate18 if it -- if it needed to get there.19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a collateral point:20 Does the government have to show, or does the -- don't21 you have to find that the machinegun is operable?22 MR. FISHER: I assume so, but I don't know23 the specific answer to that, Justice Kennedy. What24 there is a dispute about, of course, is whether the --25 if it were a sentencing factor, whether the government44￼ 1   has to prove knowledge.  And we do emphasize that that 2   would be an alternative basis for this Court to decide 3   this case, by saying you at least have to prove 4   knowledge even if it’s a sentencing factor. 5               And let me just leave you with this, unless 6   there are any further questions:  The government makes a 7   couple points in its reply brief suggesting that certain 8   arguments were not preserved or made properly in this 9   case.  The knowledge argument that I just referred to is10   raised in the brief in opposition for Mr. O'Brien at11   pages 23 to 25.  So under rule 15 of this Court, that12   argument was properly presented at the cert stage.  You13   will also find that argument at pages 34 to 37 of the Joint14 Appendix.15               Also with respect to the Sixth Amendment16   substantive reasonableness as-applied argument, the17   government suggests that for some reason, that would be18   inappropriate for this Court to reach or rely on.19   Again, we disagree.  First of all, we can't understand20   why it would be inappropriate to reach or rely on that21   constitutional argument, whereas it is apparently22   appropriate for this Court to address the McMillan23   argument or the “overrule Harris” argument.  They’re24   all three constitutional arguments that are present in25   this case.  And, again, if there were any doubt they45￼1   were raised below, pages 38 and 39 of Mr. Burgess's2   First Circuit brief, pages 32 to 35 of Mr. O'Brien's3   First Circuit brief, and in the brief in opposition,4   which the government, in its reply brief at the cert5   stage, responded to without claiming any error or any6   waiver problems.  So we think absolutely all the7 8 9111213141516171819   question:  The definition of "firearm" in 921(a)(3)20   includes a weapon that is designed to expel a21   projectile, so one that can be restored to do so also22   qualifies as a firearm for purposes of the statute.23               My friend made the comment that brandishing24   and discharge would have been treated, under the old25   statute, as sentencing factors.  But they couldn't be,46arguments that are made in the blue -- in the red briefsare clearly before you.￼                 If the Court has any additional questions, I10   would be happy to entertain them.  Otherwise, I amprepared to submit the case.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,Mr. Fisher. Mr. Horwich, you have 4 minutes remaining.REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN HORWICH    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. HORWICH:  Thank you.Justice Kennedy, just to answer your12131415   is that it's sort of an instruction manual.  The first16   thing that comes up is the elements; that's what the17   judge uses to charge the jury or take a plea.  That18   ends.  The statute takes up the next topic, which is19   sentencing.  The judge needs to ascertain the limits of20   his discretion.  And then the statute ends with some 1   because the old statute had determinant sentences, and 2   brandishing and discharge weren't relevant to it.  So 3   there wouldn't be a higher sentence for those. 4               And that -- that reveals sort of a basic 5   flaw in this notion that somehow those can be treated as 6   sentencing factors, but Congress wasn't embarking on a 7   general litany of sentencing factors.  Congress inserted 8   those to be sentencing factors, as the Court recognized 9   in Harris.  Then what it did is move the firearm-type10   provisions next in line, because that's what it thought11   of them as, not as elements.  It moved them away.  And￼then it goes on to recidivism, which is also a sentencingfactor.So the overall result, then, of the statute21222324   that seems to be what Congress intended.  But my friend's25   understanding of the statute is sort of this disorganizedtechnical considerations.            That -- that approach is entirely in linewith the sentencing factor tradition, and that's --47 1   jumble, and he's making very much of the idea that when 2   Congress revises a statute, it tries to confront -- it 3   tries to make it better, on his view. 4               JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there anything 5   other -- do we have anything other than the statute 6   itself?  When I looked at the statute itself, I thought, 7   well, all that's happened here is nobody's thought of 8   this issue at all; nobody's read Castillo.  What really 9   happened is somebody in the legislative drafting section10   was focusing on what he said they were focusing on,11   Bailey, and then they have a form manual.  So they￼12131415161718   for how to do it.  But it doesn't tell you -- it does19   not tell Congress substantively what it should do.20   Someone had to make a choice to write that introductory21   language, "a person convicted of a violation."  And that22   is what Congress passed, and so Congress intended that23   those things, firearm type, that follow that are24   relevant after the person has been convicted of a25   violation.48followed the form manual.            Now, is there anything to suggest that isn'twhat happened?            MR. HORWICH:  Well, there is no legislativehistory, but there is the fact that the form manual saysif you’re going to embark on this, here are some ideas 1               One final answer to your question 2   Justice Scalia, about the life maximum.  This Court 3   held -- in Custis v. United States interpreted the same 4   language, “not less than” a certain number of years. 5   That's in 924(e) of the Armed Career Criminal Act.  The 6   Court held that to have a life maximum sentence there. 7   So I think the same would apply -- the same would apply8 here. 9               And so the final thing I would want the10   Court to take away then from this is that Congress is11   using firearm type to channel a sentencing judge's12   discretion.  The life maximum exists in all cases.13   There have been cases sentenced up to life even where14   that was far above the minimum.  And when Congress does15   that, it uses a sentencing factor.  It doesn't create16   greater and lesser included offenses for the jury; it17   does it by addressing the person who is in charge of18   sentencing, which is the judge, and giving him a rule of19   decision.  That's what the text and the structure￼202122232425indicate here and that's what the Court should hold.            Thank you.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
