FISHERON BEHALF OF PETITIONERMR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      Local governments violate the in­writingrequirement of Section 332 when they fail to issue adocument separate from the administrative record thatspecifies the reasons for denying an application toconstruct a personal wireless facility.  Any otherconstruction would flout the very purpose of thisprovision, which is to enable meaningful judicialreview.  Indeed, allowing local governments to denyapplications without specifying their reasons wouldrequire district courts across the country to embark ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's not actually what the court below said. It said that it could discern the reasons from the record. That's a very different statement than saying there are no reasons set forth.MR. FISHER: Justice Sotomayor, I'm not sure3￼￼1 the Eleventh Circuit did actually specify what the2 reasons were. It did pronounce that it believed that3 the administrative record contained reasons. We don't4 deny that there are a bevy of potential reasons in the5 district courts ­­ I'm sorry, in the administrative6 record. I counted nine or ten as I read the transcript7 and the minutes. The problem is we don't know which one8 of those were the City's real reasons for denying the9 permit, and therefore, we can't have the expedited10 proceeding that Section 332 contemplates.11 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, how far does your12 argument go? Suppose the ­­ suppose the instrument of13 denial, the letter, does not list any reasons, but it14 incorporates by reference or makes reference to some15 other document that sets out the reasons. Is that16 sufficient?17 MR. FISHER: We think that if the denial18 letter was clearly ­­ clearly directed us to some other19 document and said ­­ and said where the reasons were,20 and that document was contemporaneously available, we21 think that would be enough.22 Now, neither of those things are present23 here. There's no explicit reference to any particular24 reasons in the minutes. It just simply says the reasons25 are available, and of course, as the Solicitor General4￼1 has pointed out, the minutes were not available.2 JUSTICE ALITO:3 that ­­4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:5 JUSTICE ALITO:6 to interrupt. Suppose the letter doesn't make a7 specific reference to some other document, but there is8 some other document known to the parties that has been9 approved by the town council and sets out the reasons,10 that would not be sufficient. There has to be an11 express reference in the instrument of denial.12 MR. FISHER: Right. I think the question13 is, what does the decision say? That's the statutory14 term. And so, the decision needs to provide the15 reasons. Now, you could have a situation like the16 Omnipoint case in the Sixth Circuit where instead of17 getting a separate letter like we got in this case, you18 get a resolution from the city council specifying the19 reasons, and we think that would be enough as well. All20 we want to know is why ­­ why the application was denied21 so that we can decide, first of all, whether to bring a22 suit or try to negotiate with the local government. And23 second of all ­­24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, that's not ­­25 I'm sorry, go ahead.5All right.  Well, suppose        Justice Alito.Just to follow up, I'm sorry1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9MR. FISHER: And second of all, so the district court can do the streamlined work that Section 332 contemplates.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's not all you want. Let's say on Monday you get a letter that says your application is denied. And on Friday the city council says the reasons we denied the application were because of this, this, and this. Is that enough for you?MR. FISHER: No, it would not be enough ­­ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No.MR. FISHER: ­­ because the letter needs to10111213141516171819202122 it ­­ 2324 25CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know.MR. FISHER: ­­ needs to be in a single document.6￼tell us why.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't matterthatis athe reason we denied it is this.  That's not goodenough?four days or three days, whatever is later, thereresolution that doesn't say it's denied, it saysMR. FISHER: Well, I think you'd have it in a timing question, the Solicitor General frames, whether that was substantially contemporaneous. We think that￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It has to be in asingle document.  What if it's stapled together?know, here's one, it says denied.  And here's onesaying, the next day, the reasons we denied it isthese.MR. FISHER: I think stapled together be just fine.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. What they're not stapled together?MR. FISHER: Oh, I'm sorry. I misunderstood.(Laughter.)You­­ arewouldifMR. FISHER: Make it easier for myself. No, we think that the statutory term is definition ­­ sorry, is decision, is a singular. So it needs to be put together.JUSTICE GINSBURG: But decision ­­ decision, Mr. Fisher, often means just denied. There ­­ there is one statute was mentioned in the brief at ­­ this is 47 U.S.C. 546 (c)(3), "The franchising authority shall issue a written decision." That's one sentence. Next sentence, "Such decision shall state the reasons therefore." So the requirement of a decision alone doesn't necessitate that reasons be given.MR. FISHER: Justice Ginsburg, we think it's7￼1 fine to look at other provisions of the Communications2 Act. That one particular provision stands apart from3 the several other provisions that the Chamber of4 Commerce cited around page 10 of its brief and that we5 cite in our brief where the word "decision" is used by6 itself and in context clearly to mean a specification of7 reasons. Where the Communications Act contemplates no8 statement of reasons, it uses words like "notify" or9 "order." And so we think it's perfectly fine to look at10 the whole Act. That one provision is the only11 countervailing piece of evidence.12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Your bottom line is13 because of this supposed default, you get your ­­ your14 application is granted, and that seems odd when the15 thrust of this arrangement is that the decision should16 be in the hands of the local governing board or the17 local council or something. And then to say because of18 the procedural lapse, then you emerge the winner and it19 doesn't matter what good reasons the town might have20 had.21 MR. FISHER: Well, there's two important22 things about that, Justice Ginsburg. First is the23 ordinary remedy is an injunction. We think that's the24 ordinary remedy. That's an equitable remedy that, of25 course, isn't absolute. And the second reason is, is8￼1 why that's the remedy. Remember, the whole purpose of2 this Act is to defeat local intransigents. In other3 words, process is the problem, not the solution. So4 simply requiring additional process, additional time,5 additional reasons, that's exactly what the Act is6 designed to solve, that problem that existed before7 1996.8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I suppose that could9 be left up to the district court on remand.10 MR. FISHER: Of course, Justice Kennedy.11 The Eleventh Circuit didn't reach the remedy question.12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me ask you, I think we13 would have a much different case if at the time of the14 written notice, they appended the official copy of the15 transcript. Is the problem here that the transcript was16 too late?17 MR. FISHER: That's one problem, but it's18 not the only problem.19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because it seems to me you20 don't make the lateness part ­­ you don't make the21 lateness argument that the government makes in your ­­22 in your question presented. You do say that there has23 to be a ­­ whether documents stating the application24 been denied but providing no reasons. So I suppose we25 can imply from that that you think that the later copy91 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425of the transcript is ­­ is just not applicable.MR. FISHER: That's right, Justice Kennedy.We think that's one problem, but it's not the onlyproblem.  Even if the ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But do you ­­ I'm sorry.MR. FISHER: Even if the transcript had been attached, there still wouldn't have been, based on this letter, a specification of reasons. And I'd be happy to walk the Court through exactly why that's so if youhave a question.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, before you do so, why is the transcript required? They had minutes that summarized the testimony. Your position is not that the transcript had to be attached.MR. FISHER: No, it's not. I think Justice Kennedy asked me if the transcript had been attached, and so I was saying that ­­ taking ­­ taking that question as ­­ as I got it.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if the ­­ I'm sorry.MR. FISHER: The minutes would be enough ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I may not have followed this. If the transcript were attached, what? MR. FISHER: Then that would not be enough10￼￼1 on its own ­­2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:3 MR. FISHER: ­­4 still need to tell us where5 reasons were. And I'd like6 JUSTICE KAGAN:7 all this from the word "decision" and "decision" as even8 the dictionary you principally cite, Blacks Law9 Dictionary states, "decision," you know, can mean one of10 two things. It can mean an opinion or it can mean a11 judgment, and people refer to it ­­ use that word to12 refer to either. So why should we interpret it your13 way?14 MR. FISHER: For two reasons, Justice Kagan.15 One is because the overall context of the Act and the16 substantial evidence review requirement and the overall17 purpose tell us that "decision" needs to specify18 reasons. You can't conduct substantial evidence review19 until you know what the reasons are.20 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that only suggests21 that you need reasons. It doesn't suggest that the22 reasons have to appear in a decision as opposed to some23 other document.24 MR. FISHER: Fair enough. So one other part25 of the Act, which is the expedited review provision, I11        Oh, okay.because the letter wouldin the transcript theto walk the Court through ­­Mr. Fisher, you're deriving￼1 think, also is instructive. The idea that Congress had2 in mind was that parties could show up in a district3 court and go straight to the question whether evidence4 in the record supported the city's decision. Congress5 did not contemplate what we would have under the City's6 approach or even the Solicitor General's approach, which7 is an entire first phase of litigation devoted to8 figuring out what those reasons are.9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the larger problem10 here, of course, is that under your view, the Federal11 statute says that a local legislative body has to act12 like an administrative agency, and that raises very13 serious concern under Federalism. In the ­­ in the law14 of zoning, generally ­­ forget this Act ­­ in the law of15 zoning generally, if you go to the board of supervisors16 and want to rezone the property from agriculture to17 multi­family residential, do we say that due process18 requires them to give some reason? Is there anything in19 the law of zoning generally that says you have to give20 reasons?21 MR. FISHER: I don't think generally. If22 there were a liberty interest or a property interest at23 stake ­­24 JUSTICE KENNEDY:25 v. Kelley for – zoning.12It would be like Goldberg25 JUSTICE GINSBURG:Then what would ­­ then￼1 MR. FISHER: Right. And we cite in our2 brief the Wolff v. McDonnell case, which says that when3 liberty or property interests are at stake, minimal due4 process requires a specification of reasons. And it's5 not the only time that cities provide specifications of6 reasons. They do it on their own. If you look at J7 (a)(84) and if you look at Footnote 4 of our reply8 brief, we cite numerous instances where the city takes9 it upon itself already to provide reasons for denials of10 permits. They do it ­­11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Fisher, could you12 explain how you are disadvantaged? Now, first of all,13 what happens on remand to the district court in your14 view? The Eleventh Circuit rendered its decision, the15 case is remanded, what happens on remand?16 MR. FISHER: Well, as the case stands now,17 we prevailed in the district court and the district18 court gave us an injunction allowing the site to be19 constructed. The city took an appeal to the Eleventh20 Circuit which reversed on the question of whether the21 Act was violated. So I think what would happen, after22 this Court rules, it would go back to the Eleventh23 Circuit with the case in that ­­ in that posture.24 If I could say a couple more things about ­­13￼1 if this Court should uphold the Eleventh Circuit, then2 what happens?3 MR. FISHER: If you uphold the Eleventh4 Circuit, then we go back down to the district court and5 are going to ­­6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what happens there?7 MR. FISHER: And I think there we're going8 to have to have one of these prolonged proceedings to9 decide what ­­ first of all, what the reasons are. The10 city has already filed one brief in the district court,11 before this case started to go up on appeal, where it12 took the position that there were three reasons for its13 denial: Property values, the fact that T­Mobile14 allegedly already had sufficient service in the area,15 and compatibility with the neighborhood.16 The city, in this Court, has offered some17 different reasons. The Solicitor General offers a still18 different take on the transcript and the minutes. And19 so, first we have to have in the district court one of20 these first mini hearings that I've been describing.21 And then we would, perhaps, then be able to litigate the22 question Congress contemplated, which is substantial23 evidence followed by some other arguments we might make.24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Fisher, assume, and25 just for the sake of argument, that we do say that a143 say that this is not adequate4 presumably; am I correct?5 MR. FISHER: Yes.6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:because it's not clear  Under this board'sboard has to be unanimous,￼1 separate writing that clearly sets forth or sets forth2 the reasons for denial is adequate. I understand you to7 rules, do ­­ I'm assuming the8 majoritarian voting rules, but why does every council9 member have to have the same reason? Can't different10 people say no for different reasons?11 MR. FISHER: I think, Justice Sotomayor,12 they might be able to. The ordinary course would be a13 letter that provides reasons that speak for the entire14 council. But I wouldn't deem it impossible for a letter15 to come to us that says two city council members voted16 to deny the application for this reason and two others17 voted to deny the application for another reason. We18 can still use that to go into district court and the19 district court could still do its job.20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Oh. So your ­­21 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you say you can't use22 it in this case. You say that that factor renders23 the ­­ the giving of reasons inadequate.24 MR. FISHER: No, Justice Scalia, it's not25 just the multiplicity of people on the board stating15￼1 different things. It's the fact that we don't know2 whether those statements constitute reasons. And this3 is one thing I really would love to give you a couple of4 examples.5 There are many problems, first of all,6 arising out of the first question whether or not what7 citizens and experts say can constitute reasons. The8 Solicitor General says: Well, there has to be a clear9 indication that the voting members agree with that.10 Well, what if somebody just says, that's a good point,11 we'll take it into consideration? Or, thanks, you know,12 I'll ­­ I'll think about that? What about the fact that13 a member, him or herself, might say something with an14 equivocal tone. For example, Dr. Price said: I'm not15 sure how to assess property values here.16 JUSTICE KAGAN:17 MR. FISHER:18 JUSTICE KAGAN:19 examples, don't they only suggest that a State or a20 locality would be well advised to write up a little21 paragraph that clearly states its reasons? But, you22 know, if they want to take the risk that a district23 court is going to say, gosh, I just can't find the24 reasons in this record, it's all too muddled. If they25 want to take that risk, what in the statute prevents it?16   Well, doesn't that ­­Does that count as a reason?All of these kinds of￼1 MR. FISHER: The nature of substantial2 evidence review, which has a limiting principle ­­3 JUSTICE KAGAN: No. But I mean, substantial4 evidence review requires reasons. If they want to take5 the risk that their ­­ that their minutes or their6 transcript will not allow the district court to do7 substantial evidence review, then, you know, they'll8 lose.9 MR. FISHER: But, Justice Kagan, substantial10 evidence review requires them to defend only on their11 actual reasons. And what the city wants to do is have a12 record of over a hundred pages where anything it can13 find a foothold in, the lawyers can come in and make an14 argument that that's why they denied something. That15 not only frustrates process, but even, Justice Kennedy,16 to your question about Federalism, it starts to17 frustrate Federalism, because now Federal courts are18 deciding why local government ­­ local governments ­­19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'm surprised that ­­20 that you're willing to accept that there does not have21 to be a reason or a number of reasons that ­­ that the22 city council agrees on, that, you know, seven members of23 the city council, each ­­ each one of them has a24 different reason, and that's okay. Do you think that25 that's what the statute means?17￼1 MR. FISHER: Well, I'm not sure, Justice2 Kennedy ­­ Justice Scalia. It ­­ you don't have to3 decide that in this case. The Solicitor General4 reserves it in a footnote. I'm not sure that just like5 this voting body can reach a decision without a single6 reason ­­ you know, these local government boards I7 think are really acting in an adjudicatory posture here,8 so I wouldn't want to preclude that.9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. But one can interpret10 the statute as demanding that they have a reason. Now,11 to be sure, that's contrary to normal legislative12 action. Congress doesn't have to have a particular13 reason for a statute. Every ­­ every congressman can14 have a different reason, and it's still valid. But I ­­15 I would read this as saying the city needs to ­­ when it16 denies, it has to have a reason for denying. I don't ­­17 I don't know how else you read it.18 MR. FISHER: I certainly won't argue with19 that.20 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, then what's the21 disagreement? I mean, what's the disagreement between22 you and the Solicitor General? Justice Brandeis said23 years ago, which I thought was a great statement of law24 which doesn't ordinarily appear: Before we can say25 whether an agency decision is right or wrong, we have to18￼1 understand what it means.2 MR. FISHER: Uh­huh.3 JUSTICE BREYER: You get some piece of4 paper, you can't figure out what it means, well, then5 they'll send it back or they say no. That's what judges6 do with administrative agencies all the time. Your7 question says, do they have to have reasons? Yeah.8 Their question says can it appear in a separate9 document? Why not, as long as the document is given10 about the same time? So what's the problem?11 MR. FISHER: The problem ­­ we do agree with12 the Solicitor General, you need reasons. We also agree13 with the Solicitor General that they need to be clear.14 Where we part ways with the Solicitor General is on the15 proposition that the ordinary administrative record can16 meet that clarity standard.17 JUSTICE BREYER: Sometimes it could,18 sometimes it couldn't. It depends on what it says.19 MR. FISHER: Well, let me ­­ let me just20 talk about the record in this case, Justice Breyer.21 JUSTICE BREYER: But that's the ­­ I know.22 You want ­­ that's what you really want to say. You23 want to say the record here isn't good enough. But it24 seems to me that the one thing we're not deciding is25 whether the record here is good enough. Rather, the19￼1 questions have been put to us in general terms; we can2 answer them in general terms. We probably even might be3 able to write an opinion in three paragraphs, clear.4 MR. FISHER: What I want to use is the5 record here to be illustrative, Justice Breyer. There's6 nothing unusual about this record in the sense that ­­7 JUSTICE BREYER: Ah, yes. But to do that, I8 would have to know quite a lot, wouldn't I, about ­­9 about the situation of your client, about the situation10 of the city council, about what was actually meant by11 what they said about the12 problem.13 MR. FISHER:14 give you a few examples.15 the parts of the minutes16 General rely on. And they say things, for example, in17 equivocal ways, as I was describing. We don't know18 whether that was a reason. We also have a temporal19 problem that arises sometimes.20 JUSTICE KAGAN: As I understand the SG's21 position, the SG says there were five members of the22 council, three of them talked about the incompatibility23 of this tower with the neighborhood. So what in that24 statement do you contest?25 MR. FISHER: That statement is ­­20context.  You understand theWell, let me ­­ let me just At JA 336, 338, and 340 arethat the city and the Solicitor￼1 JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think that three of2 them did not base this on the incompatibility of the3 fake tree with the neighborhood?4 MR. FISHER: I'm not a hundred percent5 certain they did, because the motion, as is set forth in6 JA 340, comes after all of those statements. There are7 many other statements, Justice Kagan. One ­­ one ­­ one8 council member said: I don't think cell towers should9 ever be able to be built in a residential neighborhood.10 Another asked whether T­Mobile could use different11 technology to establish the cell site.12 So we don't know whether these statements,13 which also were right around the same time, also are14 things the city could defend on. And I'm not sure the15 Solicitor General even has taken a position as to16 whether or not there are any other reasons in the17 record. The Solicitor General has told us there's one18 thing we can consider.19 JUSTICE KAGAN: The Solicitor General only20 needs one.21 MR. FISHER: Well, no. They don't22 necessarily need one, Justice Kagan, because in the23 district court we're going to challenge for substantial24 evidence those reasons. So it's going to be very25 important if in the district court we can show, as we21￼1 think we can, that substantial evidence does not support2 the city's incompatibility argument. Then the question3 is going to be is there another reason in the record,4 and we haven't ­­ we have, perhaps, conflicting answers5 from the ­­ from the other two lawyers in the room6 today.7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, then you're going to8 reach the question that Justice Scalia had a view of,9 which was, you know, if two people think X and two10 people think Y and one person thinks Z, is that11 sufficient? But as long as you have something that12 three people think, why isn't that sufficient?13 MR. FISHER: It's not sufficient because we14 can't guarantee that that is why they voted. These are15 statements that come before a vote. And just like in16 this oral argument today, there's going to be many17 concerns and questions that precede the vote. The vote18 may be for a different reason. You don't know ­­ I'd19 like to think that every answer I give today is going to20 assuage any question that I get, but that's not21 necessarily the case. And it's not necessarily the case22 that something a local council person says for a round23 of applause in the room is exactly why they're going to24 vote 10 minutes later on the application.25 If I could reserve the remainder of my time.22MS. O'CONNELL:The ­­ the primary reason￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Ms. O'Connell.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL     FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAEMS. O'CONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      It's our position that a local governmentmust provide reasons when it denies permission toconstruct a cell tower so that a court can conductsubstantial evidence review as contemplated by thestatute, but those reasons don't necessarily need to beincluded in the same document as the city's writtendenial of the application.  It's fine for the city togive its reasons in some other document like meetingminutes.  If the local government relies on a separatedocument, that document must be available at the timethe written decision is issued.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where does that come from? There's nothing ­­ Ms. O'Connell, there's nothing in the statute that says that the decision doesn't have to have the reasons, something has to have the reasons. It has to be, you say, fairly contemporaneous. I don't see anything ­­ you ­­ you are inserting something into the statute that is not there.23￼1 why we're saying it has to come out at the same time is2 because otherwise it would frustrate the judicial review3 provision, where the applicant has 30 days under the4 statute to decide what action to take based on the5 denial.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But wouldn't it more7 sensible, then, to take a suggestion that has been made8 that we run the 30 days from when reasons are given, run9 30 days from when the minutes are available? I don't10 know why you have chosen a route that would say this11 applicant wins automatically, no hearing, no nothing.12 It doesn't matter that town's council had good reasons13 for it, they weren't contemporaneous, that's the end of14 it.15 MS. O'CONNELL: I think one reason why,16 Justice Ginsburg, is because it's difficult to read the17 statute that way. The 30 days runs from the final18 action of the local government, and the local government19 has to issue a decision in writing. It would be20 difficult to say once you have a letter in hand that21 says, dear applicant, your application has been denied,22 that you don't have a written decision.

That's arisen in18 the course of the last 100 years, something like that.19 How do the courts handle that?20 MS.

And we think that makes sense here because the statute gives reasons why you can't deny an application.

It's ­­ it's notmaking laws that would apply prospectively, but takinga ­­ a specific ordinance that already exists andapplying it to the facts of this case.

Under that7 circumstance, is it ­­ can it be inferred that the final8 vote of those who previously expressed the view that9 this was bad for aesthetic reasons was the reason for10 their vote? That seems to be Mr. Fisher's argument, and11 what's your answer to that?12 MS. O'CONNELL: I think ­­ I want to make13 clear that we're not saying that when you look through14 the written administrative record to determine what the15 reasons are, that you read through the whole transcript16 and that anything that came up during the hearing, like17 what happens when the power goes out or can't you make18 these things smaller or something like that is the19 reason why a particular council member voted, just as we20 wouldn't think questions at oral argument are your21 reasons for voting to affirm or reverse.22 But in this case, you can pretty easily see23 that at the end of the hearing, the mayor said, okay,24 now, if everybody is finished giving their testimony,25 let's hear from the council, and they went down the line30￼1 and everybody said what they thought about it. It's2 those that we think are the reasons that each person has3 given.4 JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. O'Connell, I think part5 of Mr. Fisher's arguments is that if everyone agrees6 that reasons have to be given, what sense does it make7 to require judges to scour the minutes and to scour the8 transcript and to try to make these judgment calls9 about, you know, when an individual council member has10 given a reason? Why not at that point, once we're in11 the mode of requiring things, why not just require that12 the reasons be stated in the two or three sentences that13 the council or other body promulgates?14 MS. O'CONNELL: It's not our position that15 such a requirement would be difficult to comply with.16 The reason we oppose it is because we don't think17 Congress went that far. By requiring that decisions be18 supported by substantial evidence and providing for19 judicial review, we think Congress imposed a requirement20 that reasons be given. But other than that, they have a21 savings clause that says that, other than what they22 specifically said, nothing else should interfere with23 the decision­making process of local governments. And24 so if it's part of that decision­making process to25 normally talk about it at a meeting and give the311 decisions orally and then write up a summary that's2 written, then we don't think that the statute should3 be ­­ 45678910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SCALIA: I think Justice Kagan isnot disagreeing with you. She is saying, yes, reasons must be given. And reasons aren’t given if there's just this exchange in which a congressman ­­ a councilman expresses a certain fondness for a particular view.What ­­ what is the big deal of requiring either thatthe full council give its reasons or if you think it's enough that different councilmen have different reasons, each councilman say, I am voting against this for this reason?

CAROTHERS: Justice Scalia, that is13 essentially correct, but what we are saying is we14 believe that the 30 days should run, as Justice Kagan15 suggested, from the approval of the minutes.

But I think you made the suggestion,12 which I then put to counsel, that just have the 30 days13 run from when the reasons are available. So instead of14 having it run from when they send you a letter that says15 denied, treat that as not final until the reasons are16 given. I thought that was your position.17 MR. CAROTHERS: Justice Ginsburg, that is18 exactly what we're saying, and for three reasons. One,19 the approval of the minutes ­­ we've talked about20 substantial evidence, we've talked about the substantial21 evidence has to be affirmed by reasons given somewhere22 in the record. The way to know what that is, it doesn't23 talk about a letter. It talks about final action in24 (B)(iv) and, therefore, the final action of those25 minutes is the approval of those minutes.35The 30­day period is so1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      Secondarily what that does is, when theminutes are approved, the applicant, if unsuccessful,has the opportunity to have 30 full days, knowing what'sin the record, in order to file the appeal, and thatdovetails with the recommendation of the SolicitorGeneral about the contemporaneous minutes.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:MR.

Because, as this Court hasreferred to it and other courts have referred to it,this whole telecommunications jurisprudence across thecountry is a patchwork, and in this particular instance,there are jurisdictions that don't require anynotification, there are jurisdictions that requiresomething be entered on the minutes, there arejurisdictions that require a letter, there are36Yes.                      That is correct.The letter is a more or less, while theMR.

CAROTHERS: That is correct, Justice Kennedy. The only ­­ the only impediment to any of this is the shot clock, and I think that ­­ and I think that if the 150 days starts to run, there's going to be a problem if the local government hasn't approved their minutes by that time.

That's what this means to37Nobody likes towers,So Congress passes a law.towers, I'm sorry, and thebut they can't stop it for￼1 me.2 Now, your clients and others aren't used to3 being agencies, but they're being treated like agencies4 and, therefore, the simplest thing is to read this two5 things together, just what Justice Kagan said, write the6 decision and give your reasons because otherwise there7 is no way to know whether there's substantial evidence8 or not. It's in the same clause. It's in the same9 phrase. The words are right there. It says "decision10 supported by substantial evidence." I know ­­ that's, I11 think, the basic argument.12 The Solicitor General doesn't go that far,13 but if we don't have simplicity, we'll have 2 million14 different ways of going about this between different15 cities and counties.16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why couldn't the city17 council or this legislative body have waited until its18 official minutes and sent the letter that day with the19 minutes?20 MR. CAROTHERS: That they could have, and I21 think that is what the Solicitor General is22 recommending. That was certainly not the law at the23 time, but that that is ­­ the way to have24 contemporaneous minutes is to have the writing be25 basically at the time that it's approved.38￼1 One of the problems is ­­ and one of the2 problems with this decision to deny a request is in3 order to state those reasons, it has to have the very4 minutes approved in order to look at it and say, these5 are the reasons.6 Now, I would suggest to this Court that that7 will only start a new inquiry, and that is the minutes8 ­­ excuse me, Justice Scalia.9 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand ­­ I10 don't understand what you're saying, it requires a11 written decision. Okay. And the city council here12 issued a written decision to the phone company saying,13 we have decided to deny your request.14 Now ­­ and you're saying that is not a15 written decision, you have to wait until the minutes are16 written up. So, what, were17 we've decided?18 MR.

I'm not an expert on that area of city government. I don't know whether you want to call the document "minutes" or whether you want to call the document "written decision." That seems to be not before us, but what is before us is whether thedecision has to have in it the reasons so that we cantell if it's supported by substantial evidence.  Youagree on that one?40￼1 MR. CAROTHERS: Again, I agree, Justice2 Breyer, as you have stated it. I disagree that that3 particular decision is the one that is sent out right4 after the hearing, and in my proposal it wouldn't be5 sent right after the hearing. It would be sent after6 the minutes, so you would have the collective record7 which is referred to by the Eleventh Circuit, which8 could be ­­9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that endorses more10 or less the SG's position. What you're saying, I think,11 in answer to the question presented, the written denial12 doesn't have to itself as a document, provide the13 reasons, but when it's sent it has to have attached to14 it, referenced, something that is available telling you15 the reasons.16 MR.

And the simple straightforward10 answer is yes.11 So now you're changing your position.12 MR. CAROTHERS: Justice Kennedy, I don't13 believe I am stating the position. What we're saying is14 it satisfies that portion of the statute. It doesn't15 satisfy the substantial evidence in the written record16 which has got to be ­­ which we contend, separated by17 the word "and," the conjunctive, that is a separate18 requirement. And one of the things I think that I want19 to ­­ the point I want to make is ­­20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But where ­­ but surely,21 under your view ­­ I'm not convinced that your position22 hasn't radically changed ­­ but surely under your view,43￼1 think when we use words like "notice" and "decision,"2 the letter ­­ or the statute says, "Decision in writing3 of the denial." That doesn't mean that is elevated to a4 decision by this Court or a decision by a lower court5 that has all of the findings and conclusions and the6 reasons, because the reasons are going to come from the7 minutes, and that's why we're advocating that the8 minutes be the start of the 30­day period, and there can9 be a confluence of the letter ­­10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you ­­11 JUSTICE ALITO: That may be what the ­­ what12 the statute means in light of the practicalities of the13 situation. Now, since it talks about substantial14 evidence review, there's an argument that a15 municipality, when it makes a decision like this, should16 be treated pretty much like a Federal administrative17 agency. But on the other hand, municipalities are18 sometimes very small. These ­­ these bodies are ­­19 consist of lay people who are not learned in the law,20 they may not have attorneys available to them who are21 very knowledgeable about Federal telecommunications law.22 So can you say something about that23 situation? Is any of that true with respect to ­­ to24 Roswell? And what do you think Congress may have had in25 mind in a situation with respect to the treatment of44￼1 local governing bodies like Federal administrative2 agencies?3 MR. CAROTHERS: Well, Justice Alito, that is4 a multi­tiered question. Let me see if I can answer it.5 Number one, the amicus brief that was filed6 on behalf of the City of Roswell basically lays out the7 fact that you are exactly correct, there are lots of8 municipalities and local governments throughout this9 country that have trouble dealing with a pretty10 sophisticated Federal statute. The City of Roswell has11 a relative degree of sophistication, it has attorneys,12 and it has planners and can do that.13 But no court has ever held, including this14 Court, that the Chenery­type analysis for what needs to15 be an administrative decision has an application to a16 local government. If you look, for instance, that ­­17 that ­­ there is lots of argument from Petitioner that18 there's something wrong with what Roswell did. And if19 you just look at, specifically, they had evidence in the20 record, they had people who said this, this, this, this,21 and this. You had four council members, three of whom22 said aesthetics, not right for the area, diminution of23 property value, and the other one ­­24 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Carothers, I wonder25 whether what Justice Alito pointed out about the nature45￼1 of local governments, which you agreed with, whether2 that doesn't suggest that we should try to keep our rule3 quite simple. In other words, given that nobody in4 small local governments has access to great lawyers or5 knows a lot about communication, that we should just set6 up a rule that enables them to comply simply.7 And that rule, honestly, would be8 Mr. Fisher's rule. It would just say, in your decision,9 write a sentence or two saying why. Because otherwise,10 if we don't have that rule and every judge has to look11 through the minutes and the transcript and anything else12 in the record to decide whether a reason is clear13 enough, there are going to be a lot of local governments14 that are going to get kind of caught, and the judge is15 going to say, I'm sorry, it's not clear enough, even16 though if the government had spent just five minutes, it17 could have made it clear enough. And maybe we should18 just say, do that so that you don't get caught.19 MR. CAROTHERS: Well, Justice Kagan, I ­­ I20 don't object to that as long as the minutes are the21 final decision and so the 30 days can run from there.22 But then you're going to have that decision that's not23 going to come out for a couple months until the city24 attorneys and the planners have time to digest the25 decision of the record in orders to formulate that.461 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      And I will suggest to the Court that if, infact, that occurs, it starts the process over becausethen the challenge is going to be the statements in theletter do not accurately reflect the minutes, theymisstate the minutes, they mischaracterize the minutes.In fact, they're a post hoc rationalization of what wasin the minutes.  We are going to have yet another lineof inquiry and challenge which could be avoided if wesimply waited for the letter and approve the minutes ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that inquiry and challenge will be left up to judges to figure out what the minutes say, don't say, and what the reasons were.MR. CAROTHERS: Well, Justice Sotomayor,as ­­ as I read the jurisprudence, the fact is the substantial evidence in a written record and to see the reasons is pretty much left up to the district court.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Let's go back to, we had five members here. One didn't talk. Do you agree we don't count that person?MR. CAROTHERS: Correct.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All need a majority rule, a majority of giving a reason?MR. CAROTHERS: I don't case, Justice Sotomayor, and I will47right.  Now, do wethe council peoplebelieve that is thesay it because of￼￼1 this. It could be, but let's leave that situation. The2 situation we have here was we had three persons of a3 pretty like mind, the aesthetics, the land use, the4 diminution of property values, that made a determination5 and said, we ­­ we think that these are real bad. Then6 you have a pretty long motion by Dr. Price ­­7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they said that before8 the vote. We don't know why they voted. What ­­ what's9 the big deal of having a city council say, we deny this10 request for the following reasons: One, two, three?11 That would be very clear; there'd be no problem at all.12 MR. CAROTHERS: Justice Scalia, I think that13 is exactly what happened in that ­­ in this case by the14 majority vote on Dr. Price's motion. Now, I will15 concede to you that the council members did not stand16 and say I'm voting for Dr. Price's motion because of17 this, this, and this.18 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose we issue an19 opinion in this case that says that the ­­ the formal20 instrument of denial must say in simple terms the reason21 or reasons for the denial. All right? Let's say we22 issue that opinion, and six months later something like23 this comes up in some rural municipality. Let's say24 they've got 1,000 people. And how likely is it that the25 members of the governing body there, or their attorney,481 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425if they have an attorney, will be familiar with ourdecision in T­Mobile South v. City of Roswell?MR. CAROTHERS: Well, I don't know the answer to that exactly, Justice Alito, but I will say that whatever the decision is in this case ­­JUSTICE ALITO: You know, I know that everybody in the country hangs on our every word.(Laughter.)JUSTICE ALITO: And they're all going to read this opinion.MR. CAROTHERS: What everybody in the country has, Justice Alito, is they have people knocking at the door to put up cell towers. So this is a topic that many, many cities are attuned to.      But what I am attempting to say and urge theCourt is to adopt, I think, all of the concerns theCourt raises.  If the 30 days runs from the approval ofthe minutes, then you have the opportunity to have awriting ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Please articulate your rule, because you just said to us earlier that not every body of this type has ­­ has minutes, or minutes that become the statement of reasons. So what's the rule, a general rule about what's the final decision and when the time starts to run, assuming ­­49￼￼1 MR. CAROTHERS: Justice Sotomayor, what I2 would ­­ what I would craft and ­­ and what I believe to3 be the appropriate rule is the denial letter simply says4 denied. That's what the statute says. It doesn't5 require any reasons. It could have required reasons.6 So put that issue aside. And then that the approval of7 the minutes be the final action that triggers the8 running of the 30 days.9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How does that rule ­­10 now we're forcing minutes on every ­­ on every city11 council to have contained the statement of reasons?12 MR. CAROTHERS: Justice Sotomayor, I don't13 know how to answer that. I don't know of a jurisdiction14 that does not have some form of minutes or ratification15 of the previous actions and discussions they've taken,16 which are generally approved at the next meeting.17 I think, in fact, if they're going to have18 substantial evidence in the written record, whenever19 those minutes are approved, they had better get into20 doing minutes because that is what's going to be21 required.22 JUSTICE BREYER: Why ­­ why do we have to23 say? Why don't we take word for word almost what the ­­24 what the court said? What this statute requires is that25 there be a written denial ­­ well, we can forget whether50￼1 it's separate or not ­­ describing the reasons for the2 denial and containing a sufficient explanation to3 the court to evaluate the evidence, period.4 Now, that's what the city has to do.5 they produce something that's a mess because it's6 98­page thing of minutes and the court can't figure out7 what it is, you'll get a decision like this. If, in8 fact, somebody summarizes at the beginning, these are9 the reasons that we have denied and therefore we do deny10 it, it won't be a problem.11 MR. CAROTHERS: Well, Justice Breyer, I12 simply would argue that the minutes have to have13 substantial evidence, which is ­­ or have to have the14 reasons, which is supported by the substantial evidence.15 And if the court can't discern what those are, they're16 not going to survive the substantial evidence test.17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, you ­­ you spoke18 of the ­­ the statutory requirement of a denial letter.19 Where ­­ where is that?20 MR. CAROTHERS: Justice Scalia, the ­­ the21 statute indicates that in (B)(iii), any decision by a22 state or local government or instrumentality therefore23 to deny a request ­­24 JUSTICE SCALIA:25 MR. CAROTHERS:51 Right.­­ shall be in writing.permitAnd if a1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425That is what I referred to as the denial letter. JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not the denialletter.  That's what you're referring to as the minutes.You say it's the minutes that comply with that.MR. CAROTHERS: No, Your ­­ Your Honor, I am saying that the minutes do comply with this ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, and constitute it.MR. CAROTHERS: But a simple notification letter of the denial does not comply with it.JUSTICE SCALIA: There's no requirement of a notification letter, whatever. There's just that provision that any decision shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence. So why are you imposing this obligation of a denial letter on these poor, ignorant council members?(Laughter.)MR. CAROTHERS: Your Honor, I am not trying to impose that on them, but we ­­ I think we have to take the statute as it's written. We have to have some meaning to what that is.JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm taking it as it's written. You're making up a denial letter. There's ­­ there's no requirement of a denial letter. So if, indeed, the decision is the minutes, you ­­ you don't have to do anything until the minutes are published.52￼￼1 MR. CAROTHERS: And I ­­2 JUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose you have to give3 a copy of the minutes to ­­ to ­­ to the loser.4 MR. CAROTHERS: That ­­ that is correct.5 And, Justice Scalia, to the extent we're6 talking about the same thing, I believe that the7 decision from when the time should run is, in fact, that8 approval of the minutes, which has the reasons based9 upon the substantial record. I don't see that that,10 whether it's a denial, whether it's a notification,11 whatever it is, it doesn't have to have reasons. So12 really, it doesn't help the applicant and doesn't help13 the city, but we're trying to give the words in the14 statute some effect. We do not want to give them the15 effect that it is a decision and glorify something16 because a decision can be no.17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Everybody else like you18 thinks that there has to be a denial letter, right?19 Is ­­ is that a unique perception that ­­ that you have20 come to, or is it generally thought that you have to21 have a denial letter?22 MR. CAROTHERS: I think ­­ I think there is23 a perception, because of what the statute says, that24 there has to be a denial letter, but it doesn't have to25 have reasons. And if you don't have the reasons in the531 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425denial letter, you ­­ it's not fair to the applicant tostart the appeal time running for the 30 days.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did you take that position in the district court?MR. CAROTHERS: Justice Kennedy, I'm struggling to answer that question because we didn't get very far in the district court. We never really got a chance to talk about substantial evidence because the court decided: I'm not going to reach that prong of (B)(iii); I'm going to say that I can't understand ­­ excuse me. Thank you very much.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.      Mr. Fisher, you have 4 minutes remaining.    REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHERON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. FISHER: Thank you. I would like tomake a point about our rule and then turn to thepracticalities.      First, to ­­ to ­­ I think that what camebefore me helped under ­­ helped explain why a separateletter specifying the reasons for denial is not onlyrequired by the statute, but is the only way to make itwork.      If you look at the minutes that the cityissued here, and they're in the back of the Joint54￼￼1 Appendix ­­ remember, as I think it's been noted, cities2 don't have to issue minutes, and so you're not always3 going to have minutes. But on the theory that the4 minutes here would have been enough, look at the5 minutes, and if you want to look later at J.A. 338,6 J.A. 336, and J.A. 340, there are some of the reasons,7 as the Solicitor General put it, potential reasons,8 offered by various council members before the vote.9 But if you look at J.A. 340, you'll see that10 all of those are separated from the motion, so the11 motion doesn't incorporate any of the reasons, not even12 what Dr. Price said before she made her motion.13 So imagine yourself a district judge getting14 this set of minutes. You don't know what the city's15 reasons were for denying the permit, and that's the16 problem that T­Mobile has and that's the problem the17 district judges have.18 And I want to turn to Justice Alito's19 question ­­ and, Justice Kennedy, I think you also asked20 about the Federalism implications for local governments.21 First of all, let me start with the City of22 Roswell. The City of Roswell's own code, and this is at23 J.A. 84, requires it to give a separate document with24 reasons if it denies an application to construct a cell25 site on city­owned property. All we're asking the city55￼1 to do is do what it already does with respect to2 applications for city­owned property.3 Now, you also point out there are rural4 areas in the country that have smaller staffs and5 jurisdictions. At ­­ at page 13 of our reply brief we6 cite statutes from other States like New Hampshire,7 Nevada, Idaho, that already have as a matter of State8 law the rule that we pronounce ­­ I'm sorry, the rule9 that we propose. The rural jurisdictions in those10 States don't seem to have difficulty doing it, and I11 think the reason why is because, as has been said a few12 times today, it just requires a few sentences usually.13 Just tell us what the reasons are and tell the district14 court what the reasons are, so that when we get into15 court we can have the streamlined proceeding that16 Congress imagined, and that it can be done, as the17 statute itself requires, on an expedited basis.18 That's all we're asking for today, and we19 think that any other rule is going to create problems at20 the lower ­­ I'm sorry, before you ever get to court and21 even more problems once we get to court.22 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fisher, suppose that I23 think that you're right about that, but then the24 question is did Congress require that. And I take it25 that the SG is really saying, no, Congress required56￼1 reasons, it required that by saying that there was2 substantial evidence review, but that it didn't require3 the reasons to be in any particular form, and, indeed,4 there's a savings clause which says that all doubts go5 to the State and local governments in this area. So6 notwithstanding that this is going to actually get State7 and local governments into some trouble, and8 notwithstanding that district courts are going to9 struggle with it, we should go with the SG's rule rather10 than with yours.11 MR. FISHER: We think the best reading of12 sub (iii) is that Congress actually did require this.13 As the city itself pointed out, it separates14 the notion of a decision in writing from whether it has15 substantial evidence in the record that supports it. So16 when you ask what the decision in writing is, you17 need ­­ we think the best reading of that is that's the18 reasons. The reasons have to be supported by19 substantial evidence, and you can't ask the substantial20 evidence question until you know what the reasons are.21 And I think also, for the other reasons that22 we've pointed out and the Chamber of Commerce pointed23 out, how the Communications Act uses the word "decision"24 in a particular way. It uses the word "decision" in25 other statutes to signify that an explanation is ­­ is5723 24 25￼1 something embedded in that, not as ­­ as ­­ as is often2 the case, and the city itself characterized the denial3 letter today, I think aptly, as a notification.4 Well, the Communications Act uses the words5 "notify" and "notification" to refer to other kinds of6 advisements that need to be given. That's not the word7 Congress chose here.8 So, Justice Kagan, I agree, but if you look9 at this statute you might wonder to yourself if you10 misread the words in a vacuum which are ­­ which rule11 comes out of it, ours or the SG's.12 But we know from City of Arlington, as this13 Court said, that the limitations in sub (iii) are14 limitations that Congress did intend to impose and the15 best reading of those limitations are the ones that we16 have given.17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.18 The case is submitted.19 (Whereupon, at 11:06 a.m., the case in the20
