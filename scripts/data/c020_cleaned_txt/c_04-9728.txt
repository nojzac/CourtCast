LONG, JR.,                ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER          MR. LONG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          The search in this case was not based onindividualized suspicion, and no other adequatesafeguards limited the police officer's discretion tosearch Petitioner.  For this reason, the search, whichwould not be permitted by virtually any other State orby the Federal Government, was unreasonable.          The Court has reaffirmed many times that theFourth Amendment does not permit the individual officerin the field to exercise unconstrained discretion tosearch.  The Court has said that the Fourth Amendmentis primarily directed at the evil -- it was primarilydirected at the evil of general warrants and writs ofassistance, and the evil of general warrants and writsof assistance was that they gave individual officersblanket authority to search where they pleased andplaced the liberty of every man in the hands of every31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425petty officer.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Long --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Long --JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- with respect toliberty, as it -- it's not disputed, is it, that your client could have had his parole revoked even thoughthe search was suspicionless? So, what we're talking about the difference between revocation of parole, on the one hand, and a separate criminal offense. Is that right?MR. LONG: Well, a parolee has conditional liberty. But, at the time of this search, Mr. Samson was on parole, there was no suspicion of any wrongdoing --JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought that evidence seized could be introduced, could be a basis to revoke parole.MR. LONG: Oh, well, the Court held, in the Scott case, that the exclusionary rule does not apply at parole revocation hearings. So, if there is an unreasonable search of a parolee that violates the Fourth Amendment, the evidence could not be admitted at a criminal trial, but it could be admitted at a parole revocation --JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, the -- what the -- the consequence here is whether --41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. LONG: I --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- he will have his parolerevoked --MR. LONG: I --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- or he will have aseparate criminal offense.          MR. LONG:  I understand your question.  InCalifornia, Justice Ginsburg, a nonviolent drugoffense, the possession of a small amount of an illegalsubstance, is not a basis for revocation of parole.  Itis not possible to revoke parole in California for thisoffense.  So, parole revocation would not have been apossibility here.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, Isuppose, can pursue her own line of questioning, butlet me ask you this, because I -- her question suggeststhis, to me at least.  Suppose the parole officer said,"Now, look, I'm going to search you.  If you don'tconsent, then I'm going to revoke your parole."          MR. LONG:  Well, this, of course, was apolice officer, not a parole officer.          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I --          MR. LONG:  But if --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- my question wasa parole officer, and I'll get to police officer next. 51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. LONG:  All right.  I think if a paroleofficer said, "You must consent to this search" --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  When you see the --          MR. LONG:  -- "this particular search" --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- person on the street, etcetera, et cetera.          MR. LONG:  "And, if you don't, I'll revokeyour" -- I mean, the consent is not, in this case,first.  I mean, California has said, the Supreme Courthas said, parole, in the parole search condition, isimposed as a matter of law.  Your hypothetical poses aquestion of, could there be knowing and voluntaryconsent to a search if the consequence of refusing isrevocation of parole?  I would argue, in thatsituation, that the consequences of refusal are so direthat, effectively, the parolee would have no realchoice but to consent.  So, it would be, in a sense, acoerced consent.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why are they dire?  I mean,he's just back in the situation he would have been in,did he not comply with the conditions of his parole.  Idon't see that that's dire.  He has a choice.  He canstay in prison and --          MR. LONG:  Well --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- and suffer the reduction61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 of privacy there, which is much,2 being subjected to -- I mean, he3 to the toilet in privacy. Or he4 subject to the condition that --5 MR. LONG: Well --much greater than-- he cannot even gocan go out on parole,6 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that he --7 MR. LONG: I mean --8 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- he can --9 MR. LONG: I --10 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- be searched.11 MR. LONG: I have two answers to that,12 Justice Scalia. I mean, first, in California, you13 finish your prison sentence, and then parole is a14 separate period that happens. The California Supreme15 Court said, in People v. Guzman and other cases, parole16 is not a part of the sentence --17 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but it's --18 MR. LONG: -- in California.19 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- but it's also clear from20 the California statute that it is not a right, that21 it's a privilege, that you get the privilege of parole22 in exchange -- in exchange for agreeing to the23 conditions, one of which is that you can be searched.24 MR. LONG: Well, it's -- in California, every25 inmate gets parole. It's a matter of law. It's not a71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425privilege -- in Morrissey against Brewer.  The Court --in other cases, the Court rejected the rights privilegedistinction anyway.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  California statute says it'sa privilege, doesn't it?          MR. LONG:  Yes, in section 3067.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  It does.          MR. LONG:  But it is -- it is also a --section 3000 of the California penal code says everyprisoner gets parole.  It is imposed on the prisoner as--          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Even if the --          MR. LONG:  -- a matter of law.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- prisoner -- oh, I thoughtthat he can turn it down, and that some prisoners do,if  --          MR. LONG:  Well --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- if they decide that theydon't want to be subjected to searches.          MR. LONG:  The California Supreme Court hasheld, in People v. Reyes, and in other cases cited inour brief, that, in California, parole is not a matterof choice, it is imposed as a matter of law.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is -- and you mean peopleare put out on the street when -- kicking and screaming81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425when they say, "No, I want to stay in jail.  I don'twant to be" --          MR. LONG:  Well, it's --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  --rather stay in jail"?  And --          MR. LONG:  Well --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  --          MR. LONG:  That --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  --"searched.  I wouldthey are dragged out --into the street.  Is thatwhat happens?          MR. LONG:  That is what the CaliforniaSupreme Court has said.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, I --MR. LONG:  And what the statutes say is --JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- I don't think so.MR. LONG:  That -- the statutes say thata -- is a transitional period, and that everyparole isinmate should undergo a period of parole.But coming back to your earlier question, thesaid that the condition of a parolee is veryfrom the condition of a prisoner.  The Courtin Morrissey against Brewer.  And the CourtCourt hasdifferentsaid thatsaid, in Griffin, as to probationers, that while theFourth Amendment rights of probationers -- and so,parolees, too, we concede -- are reduced, there are --91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 the State can go too far. And if the State exceeds --2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but --3 MR. LONG: -- the permissible limits, it's a4 violation.5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- their condition is6 very different, in a broad range of areas. They -- you7 give up First Amendment rights. For example, it's8 typical to have a condition of parole that you don't9 consort with known criminals or gang members. You --10 often it says you must refrain from alcohol. Sometimes11 they say you can't go near particular places, if they12 think that's going to tempt you to return to a life of13 crime. Those are all First Amendment rights that are14 sacrificed while you're on parole. Why is this any15 different?16 MR. LONG: Well, there are many rights that17 are sacrificed. What the Court has said about the18 Fourth Amendment rights is, because parolees have19 conditional liberty, they will have a reduced, but not20 eliminated, Fourth Amendment protection --21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about a drug --22 what if you're convicted of a drug offense, you're on23 parole, and one of the conditions is, every week you24 have to go in25 MR.1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400for a drug test?LONG:  Well, that --10 Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you --2 MR. LONG: -- that would be --3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- do you -- is that4 acceptable?5 MR. LONG: That would be different in several6 respects, Mr. Chief Justice. First of all, there would7 not be discretion. You wouldn't have the individual8 officer deciding --9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it would be a10 Fourth Amendment right that you would be giving up --111213 otherwise 1415 -- we're arguing there is a broad spectrum of searches16 that States can undertake of parolees, and I'm, by no17 means, arguing today that all of them, or even most ofMR. LONG:  Yes.  And --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- that you wouldhave if you weren't on parole.MR. LONG:  And I want to be clear, we are not18 them, are 1920 condition21 you just have to submit yourself to a drug test22 whenever a police officer asks you to?unconstitutional.  This is a --JUSTICE STEVENS:  What would you say about athat you must -- not a regular drug test --23 MR. LONG: Well, you know, that would be much24 narrower, because it would simply be a drug test. I25 think it would have the problems of -- the officer111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425would have complete discretion.  If it were like theCalifornia --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but it's -- Imean, the point --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Do you think it wouldvalid?  That's what I was asking you.          MR. LONG:  I think, because that's a muchnarrower test, that that could pass muster if -- but Iwould think there really ought to be some guidance tothe officer.  I think our ultimate submission today is--          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, so that a --          MR. LONG:  -- this is so --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- so that a burglar couldbe searched for burglar tools --          MR. LONG:  Well --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- but not for drugs?  Andthe drug addict can be searched for drugs, and notburglar tools?          MR. LONG:  If it were -- if it were tied tothe crime that the parolee has committed, you know,that would give it some limitation.  This is acompletely unlimited search, for anything, any crime.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But Justice Stevens'squestion highlights the point that you criticize about:121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the randomness of it is often a critical element.  Isuppose it makes much more sense to say you're subjectto a random drug test than that you have to come in ata scheduled time, when you -- presumably, you couldrefrain from using drugs prior to the test.  And, tosome extent, it's the same, even if you're not talkingabout a drug test.          MR. LONG:  Well, in all --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The search is onlygoing to be effective if it's not announced or --          MR. LONG:  Well, in --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- scheduled.          MR. LONG:  -- and in this Court'ssuspicionless search cases, you can have a random testwhere you draw names at random.  There's some otherprocess that doesn't leave it up to each individualofficer to decide who gets the drug test or which carto stop to check the driver's license and registration.What the Court has consistently held is really at thecore of the Fourth Amendment is this notion of: theindividual officer in the field has complete discretionto decide, "Do I search this person?  Do I not?  What'sthe scope of the search?  What do" --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Are you relying --          MR. LONG:  -- "I search for?"131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- on the differencebetween -- you said "officer in the field."  Would thisbe okay if it had been his parole officer?          MR. LONG:  Well, I think --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The parole officer waswalking along the street, saw this guy, and said, "I'mgoing to search you."          MR. LONG:  I think it's a very different setof circumstances if we have a parole officer.  ThisCourt has said, at least twice, in Griffin and inScott, that a parole officer has a different function. They are not in an adversarial, or a purelyadversarial, relationship.  They often think of theparolee or the probationer as a client.  They're tryingto see that the person succeeds.  In some sense, theparole officer fails when the parolee goes back toprison.  The parole -- the parole officer can act ontheir entire knowledge and experience with the client,or the parolee.  So, all of that makes a difference.And the Court has noted that several times.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  When he's in prison, isthere any problem about the prison guards intrudingupon his privacy, willy-nilly, whenever they choose?--MR. LONG: The -- as I understand the Court's 141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, walking --2 MR. LONG: -- holding --3 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- by his cell, which is4 always opened, and checking in on him to see what's --5 what he's doing.6 MR. LONG: As I understand the Court's7 holding in Hudson against Palmer, the Fourth Amendment8 does not apply in a prison cell. And --9 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, he's better off on10 parole than -- well, at least no worse off on parole11 than he would be when he was in prison.12 MR. LONG: But, Your Honor, that's not the13 way this Court has analyzed the Fourth Amendment14 issues. It's a different situation. It is conditional15 liberty. It's the -- that sort of active grace theory,16 or right, privilege, distinction, or greater power17 includes the lesser, all those arguments have been18 rejected, 192021 Gagnon -- 2223 24 25in --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Are --MR.

No, please.          MR. LONG:  It's --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  What do you make of thepragmatic argument that seems to cut through all of yourobjections?  The pragmatic argument is both in favorof complete discretion and of suspicionless search,that the in terrorem effect of knowing that thesesearches can occur at any moment, in fact, discouragesrecidivism.          MR. LONG:  Well --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  What's your response tothat?          MR. LONG:  -- I have a pragmatic argument,and then I have an argument just based on the FourthAmendment.  Pragmatically, no other State, as far as wecan tell, and not the Federal Government, authorizesthis kind of search; that is, blanket suspicionlessdiscretionary searches by police officers.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Apart from --          MR. LONG:  So --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Apart from the lack ofpopularity of the State's view --          MR. LONG:  Well --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- do we have -- do we haveany empirical evidence that bears on the in terrorem161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 argument?2 MR. LONG: The -- well, the empirical3 evidence is that all the other States don't seem to be4 having a harder time --5 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I --6 MR. LONG: -- with recidivism.7 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- I realize that. But,8 beyond that, do we have any empirical evidence, one way9 or the other?10 MR. LONG: Well, the California -- I think11 that's a pretty powerful demonstration, but we do have,12 beyond that, empirically, California was with all the13 other States until the People against Reyes decision.14 Now they've moved to suspicionless searches. They seem15 to have about the same rate of recidivism --16 17 18 19 2021 empirical22 the fact that California stands out in its system. Is23 that correct?24 MR. LONG: Well, I -- I'm -- think I'm25 offering you evidence that counts as empirical in my171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-JUSTICE SOUTER:  I take it --MR.

Thatis, why is it unreasonable, say, not for lawprofessors, but business school professors, managementconsultants, to say, "You have a lot of prisoners in181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-you step back andnot -- it's notWell --￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425California, hundreds of thousands -- I don't know,maybe more than 100,000 -- and we'll tell theLegislature that they can cut the terms, save money,release them early, but we want to have managementchecks.  And the management checks are, you might besearched at any time.  And we catch a few.  And that'shelpful."  Now, if the --          MR.

LONG:  Because --          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- says the Legislature.          MR. LONG:  Because, Justice Breyer, it has tobe a balancing analysis, and --          JUSTICE BREYER:  And what's on the otherside?  The other side --          MR. LONG:  Well --          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- is, you'd rather not havepolicemen search you, but your alternative is going tobe in jail.          MR. LONG:  Well, I mean, the other side is asearch condition that says you have -- you could be191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 searched at any time, any place, by any police officer2 for evidence of any crime, is a breathtakingly broad3 invasion of privacy.4 JUSTICE BREYER: But, of course, that's how5 it happens when he's in prison.6 MR. LONG: Well, but he has come out of7 prison. The State has seen fit to release him on8 parole into society. He has conditional liberty. And9 the Court --10 JUSTICE SCALIA: But there is a11 breathtakingly high probability that he is committing a12 crime. The statistics cited in the Government's brief13 say that in an April 2001 report prepared by the14 California Criminal Justice Statistics Center, 6815 percent of adult parolees are returned to prison -- 6816 percent; 55 percent, for a parole violation; and 1317 percent for the commission of a new felony offense. I18 mean, it seems to me a breathtaking statistic like that19 may call for breathtaking --20 MR. LONG: Yes.21 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- measures to try to police22 the matter closely.23 MR. LONG: It is a very serious problem. We24 don't want to minimize it. I mean, it is a fact that25 many -- many parolees -- and this is true especially in201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 California -- end up being returned for technical2 violations, like not showing up to meetings with parole3 officers. Some of the offenses are not as serious as4 others. But it is a very serious problem. We5 recognize that. But what the Court has said is that6 the gravity of the problem cannot justify any means.7 There has to be a balancing of the invasion of privacy8 against the State's need to undertake this.9 And coming back to my second answer to the10 question you asked several minutes ago, Justice Scalia,11 I mean, ultimately this search is a -- it's a general12 warrant. It's a writ of assistance. It's limited to13 parolees, but if the Court is going to stand by what it14 has said in Griffin and other cases, that their15 parolees and probationers have some modicum of Fourth16 Amendment rights -- reduced, we recognize that -- this17 is -- this is the core of what the --18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the --19 MR. LONG: -- framers of --20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- California --21 MR. LONG: -- the Fourth Amendment22 prohibited.23 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The California24 Supreme Court said that the Fourth Amendment applied to25 these searches, but it only protected in a limited way,211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 along the same lines as we said in Griffin. And the2 standard they applied was, it protected against3 arbitrary or harassing or capricious searches --4 MR. LONG: Yes, but --5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- which seems to go6 to your argument, which is centered around the7 unbridled discretion of the officer. And the8 California Supreme Court is saying it's not unbridled.9 MR. LONG: That is their answer to my10 argument, and I want to be very clear about "arbitrary,11 capricious, and harassing." That's the California12 Supreme Court's standard. So, of course, they get to13 define it. And they have not defined it the way this14 Court perhaps would define "arbitrary." It's not15 arbitrary, capricious, or harassing if it has a16 permissible law enforcement purpose. So, as long as17 the officer says, "Well, I don't have any reason to18 think there's evidence of any crime here, but that's19 what I'm looking for. Perhaps there's evidence of20 crime" --21 22 2324 turns out25 he has a pretty strong case that this is forCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's --MR. LONG:  -- that's enough.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- fine.  But ithe stops the guy every hour of the day, then221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425harassment, and it's not --          MR. LONG:  Well --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- for the speciallaw enforcement --          MR. LONG:  Well, and --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- need thataccompanies releasing parolees.          MR. LONG:  And I take it the Fourth Amendmentitself would prohibit that sort of thing.  But it --you couldn't -- you couldn't justify a general warrantby saying, "Well, yes, the officer can search anybody,without any suspicion, and he can choose."  But it --you know, the search can't happen too often, or itcan't last too long.  That would not be -- and you --and you -- similarly, it would not be an answer to say,"Well, as long as he's looking for evidence of crime."          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, but your pointwas that this is the core of the Fourth Amendment, andthey're taking away all of the protection and leavingit to the unbridled discretion.  And that turns out tobe not the case.  Under the law that authorizes theprocedure, the California Supreme Court interpretationis that the Fourth Amendment provides protectionagainst harassment or arbitrary and --MR. LONG: Well -- 231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- capricioussearches.          MR. LONG:  -- I mean, my argument is thatwhat is left of the Fourth Amendment under theCalifornia approach is not the core.  It's the farperiphery.  There has never been a case -- and we wereable to find over a hundred, and perhaps over 200; itdepends on how you count -- of cases where parolees orprobationers have said, "You know, this search wasarbitrary or capricious or harassing."  It is alwaysrejected, for the same reason it was in this case.  TheCourt says, "Well" --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Then which way do youthink that cuts?  There's --          MR. LONG:  It --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- never been a caseof a harassing search of a parolee.MR. LONG: I --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I mean, that's what -- or 200 cases in the --          MR. LONG:  I --          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- in --          MR. LONG:  -- I think it cuts in thedirection that it is an empty, vacuous standard.  It'sa standard --241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why?          MR. LONG:  -- that's always --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why?  If it -- if it -- ifit -- it doesn't go to the suspicionless character ofthe search, but it does say it has to be reasonable intime, place, or manner.          MR. LONG:  Yes.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And maybe the --          MR. LONG:  Yes.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- officers are reasonablein time, place --          MR. LONG:  Yes.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- or manner.          MR. LONG:  And -- but it's -- it had -- therehas never been a case in which a court has rejected aparolee search as unreasonable in time, place, ormanner.  And you could --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How many times has it beenchallenged --          MR. LONG:  As --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- on the --          MR. LONG:  -- we said -- we found over a hundredcases in which it's been challenged in the Californiacourts.  And it --JUSTICE ALITO: Well -- 251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. LONG: I mean, if you think about it, if2 the search is, say, at night, the argument is going to3 be -- well, if we said we'd not -- "never going to4 search you at night," then you would commit crimes at5 night. We had a very extreme case in our brief about6 body-cavity searches. And they said, "Well, that -- of7 course, that" -- you know, the suggestion was, "Of8 course, that would be too extreme." But you could see9 an argument if parolees and probationers knew that that10 was off limits, that -- you know, that would become a -11 -12 JUSTICE SCALIA: You say there was a case in13 which, without any special reason, they did --14 MR. LONG: No. Let --15 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- a cavity search --16 MR. LONG: No, let me be -- I am not aware of17 any actual case. We posited that. We said -- you know,18 because you don't need to know anything about the parolee,19 except he's on parole, and you can search for evidence20 of any crime. You don't need any suspicion that -- so, you21 could have somebody, a sort of white-collar criminal,22 or you'd check someone who's written a bad check. And23 if you say, "Well, I think perhaps you're involved in24 drugs. Maybe you're one of these balloon-swallowers" -25 - you don't need any actual reason to think that's261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425happening, you can simply say, "I want to investigatethat."  And the way -- you have to investigate that by xrays or something else quite intrusive.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  The California Supreme Courtmay -- might well hold that it's arbitrary to conductsuch an extreme search as a body-cavity search, or to -- I don't know --          MR. LONG:  Well --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- to decide to search theperson when he's in the men's room or something.  Imean, there are --          MR. LONG:  But --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- there are a lot oflimitations that the California court --          MR. LONG:  They might, and --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- could put on it, withinthe context of harassment or --          MR. LONG:  But our principal submission,Justice Scalia -- I mean, if California said, "We havea terrible problem with crime in California; and,therefore, we're authorizing every police officer tosearch every person anytime, anywhere, for any crime,"that would be, I would submit, the clearest sort ofFourth Amendment violation you could imagine.  It wouldbe a general warrant or a writ of assistance.  It271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425couldn't possibly be justified by saying, "Well, if itgets too extreme, if it gets into body-cavity searches,we won't allow it."  We are talking about parolees,yes.  Their Fourth Amendment rights are reduced, yes.We recognize that.  But saying that this sortabsolutely unguided discretion --          JUSTICE BREYER:  But the reason ---          MR. LONG:  -- there's no sort of --          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- the reason thatofpeople, Ithink, are saying that is because they have aprisoners, they're trying to create a category ofpeople who don't have to stay in prison, where theyhave no rights.  And the real question is, canCalifornia, in trying to create this interim category,reduce the Fourth Amendment right in the way youdescribe?          MR. LONG:  They --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Of course they can't do it,but the justification is not that there is somethingbad about this particular individual or he's in somekind of limbo.  The reason is that there's a policytending towards release, which California has decidedthey want to introduce this as a condition.  Now --          MR. LONG:  Yes.          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and so, what -- and the281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-lot of￼1 question is, what's unreasonable about that?2 MR. LONG: Well, what's unreasonable about it3 is that it goes so far in the direction of eliminating4 the Fourth Amendment rights of people who are not5 prisoners -- they are -- they have conditional liberty6 -- that it is simply not consistent with the Fourth7 Amendment. And on the empirical side, California is an8 outlier. All the other States --9 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I -- may I ask you --10 MR. LONG: -- and the Federal Government --11 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- this question? Part of12 your appeal of your case is, you talk about the13 corporate offender or tax dodger, something like that.14 It seems quite unreasonable, I agree with you. But15 what if you defined the class much more narrowly and16 limit it to people who have been convicted of violent17 crimes of a very serious nature and so forth, and said,18 as to those, they can have a totally suspicionless19 search? Would that --20 21 2223 wanted to24 States can do. They could certainly --25 JUSTICE STEVENS: But I wonder whether --MR. LONG:  Well --JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- be permissible?MR. LONG:  -- I -- one of the things wemake -- I think there are many things that291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. LONG:  -- there's the possibility of --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- whether you think theycould do that.          MR. LONG:  There's the possibility ofindividual determinations, based on the individualcircumstances.  If you went --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, what I'm --          MR. LONG:  -- category by --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  I wanted to see if there is away that the class could be defined narrowly, because Iwant to ask the other side if they would allow thesearch for any ex-felon, for example.  You could divideit in a way that seemed obviously too broad.  But is ---MR. LONG:  Right.JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- there a narrower class -MR. LONG:  Well --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- that you think would beacceptable?          MR. LONG:  I think this could be muchnarrower.  And, in my view, it would become a muchcloser constitutional question if it were limited tocertain crimes where the legislature or the State madea finding that there's a particular need to have --JUSTICE STEVENS: Say you were a -- 301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. LONG:  -- suspicionless --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- terrorist, for example.          MR. LONG:  And --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  It's just limited toterrorists, convicted terrorists.          MR. LONG:  Yes, perhaps convicted terrorists. You know, that -- and it -- that's very different fromwhat we have here, because --given theJUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about drug offenders,high rate of recidivism?MR. LONG:  Well, I -- you know, we -- I thinkhave to see the facts of that case, but ifyou wouldthey madedrug offenses, we need suspicionless searches ratherthan simply reasonable suspicion, and we need policeofficers, not parole officers" -- and there could beother regulations.  The Federal regulations, we think,are a model, really.  They have lots of limitations on--a finding that, "Because of the nature of          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Long, is it -- is itfair to compare California to other States?  Theassumption would have to be that other States grantparole as liberally as California does.  MaybeCalifornia has made the decision, "We have too manypeople in prison.  We're going to let a lot of them311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 out, but we're going to keep them on a very tight2 leash." Why shouldn't it be able to do that? To3 have tighter controls, but let out many more people on4 parole, which is -- which is exactly what I think5 they're doing.6 MR. LONG: Well, and I -- I think they can7 have tighter controls, Your Honor. They can -- they8 can have -- they could have -- they could make this a9 special condition of parole --10 JUSTICE SCALIA: But my only --11 MR. LONG: -- rather than a general condition12 --13 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- point is --14 MR. LONG: -- of parole.15 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the fact that other16 States aren't as tight doesn't prove anything, because17 other States --1819202122 thing -- 232425MR. LONG:  Well --JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- may not be --MR. LONG:  Well --JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- be trying to do the sameMR. LONG:  I mean --JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- to empty their prisons --MR. LONG:  This Court has said, generally,321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that what the Court has found to be reasonable for oneState is reasonable for all.  And when a practice isnot well established -- and here, it's far from wellestablished; California's virtually unique -- the Courthas taken that into account for --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose you were in ahalfway house, and the State says, "We're creating astatus.  One is, you're a prisoner.  Another is, you'rea halfway house.  Another is, on your -- parole.  Butwe want to subject you to suspicionless searches at --in all three stages -- prison, halfway house, parole." Could they do it for the halfway house?          MR. LONG:  Well, they might -- halfwayhouses, as I understand it, Justice Ginsburg, arelargely now a thing of the past.  But if the idea isyou would actually be in a custody situation at night,perhaps in lockdown, then perhaps Hudson against Palmerwould come into play --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This person goes --          MR. LONG:  -- which --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- out to work, comes backat the end of the day, and is checked in.          MR. LONG:  And so, your hypothetical is,could there be suspicionless searches by --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, while the --331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. LONG:  -- police officers --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- while the --          MR. LONG:  -- at work?          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The person who is in thissemi-custody state, he's going to work, and, while he'sat his workplace, the police officer shows up and says,"I'm going to pat you down, and then I'm going to" --          MR. LONG:  It's --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- "see if you havedrugs."          MR. LONG:  It's a -- it's a harder case.Again, our bottom line is, there would need to be somelimitations on that individual officer's discretion.That's the core of the Fourth Amendment.          If there are no further questions, I'd liketo reserve the balance of my time.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. Long.          Mr. Niver, we'll hear now from you.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD E. NIVER                ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT          MR. NIVER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it --may it please the Court:          Alarmed by the State rate of recidivism andrevocation of the more than 100,000 parolees,California enacted a statute which authorized the341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 search of2 parolee.3 under the4a parolee based solely on his status as aWe submit that such a search is reasonableFourth Amendment.As this Court held recently in United States5 versus Knights, to determine the validity of the search6 we balance the State's need to search against the7 privacy interest affected. Here, the need is8 overwhelming, and the privacy interest is dramatically9 reduced.10 Turning first to Petitioner's expectation of11 privacy, it is greatly diminished. Even if it exists,12 it is far less than that enjoyed by the average law-13 abiding citizen. No one outside the confines of a14 prison has a lesser expectation of privacy than a15 parolee.16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that? Doesn't17 that kind of beg the question? I mean, if we say he's18 got the normal Fourth Amendment rights, his -- I mean,19 the expectation-of-privacy analysis seems to me to be20 totally circular.21 MR. NIVER: That's what the --22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You say he doesn't23 have an expectation of privacy, so it's not protected.24 Well, if we say he does have a -- if we say it is25 protected, then he does have an expectation of privacy.351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. NIVER: Well, this Court spoke to that in2 Knights and said, unanimously that the -- in Knights,3 it was a probation condition, but I think that it --4 obviously, the same analysis applies here -- that the5 imposition or acceptance of a -- of a search condition6 by a parolee or a probationer results in the severely7 diminished expectation of privacy enjoyed by the8 parolee or probationer. And this Court said that9 unanimously in Knights.10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Knights11 involved a situation where reasonable suspicion was12 required, so it addressed the problem that Mr. Long has13 of unbridled discretion. You still had to have an14 articulable reasonable suspicion with respect to the15 individual.16 MR. NIVER: That is true, Your Honor, but the17 threshold question was whether he had an expectation of18 privacy at all, or to the -- the extent of that19 expectation of privacy. And the Court, in Knights,20 before it discussed the balance, had to identify the21 factors in the balance. In terms of the probationer's22 interest in that case, by virtue of the search23 condition, this Court said that his interest in -- his24 expectation of privacy was severely diminished, and25 left open specific --361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why -- and why was2 his expectation of privacy severely diminished?34 me -- the5 virtue of67 practice that's being challenged here today, right?8 MR. NIVER: Well, yes.9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because he sawMR. NIVER:  Because of the parole's -- excuseprobation search that was imposed upon him bythe --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Because of the very10 something -- you -- he signed something that said,11 "You're subject to searches." Well, that's what is at12 issue. It seems to me that it's -- I guess I've said13 it before, he's -- it's begging the question to say,14 "You can do this, because he has a diminished15 expectation of privacy." How far do you push this?16 Can you have parolees come in and take a lie-detector17 test every week? Do they have -- do they have18 diminished expectation with respect to their Fifth19 Amendment 2021 Amendment22 or even if they are -- I don't think that that would23 necessarily -- the -- any expectation of privacy would24 preclude the imposition of a lie-detector test, no.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Was that a yes, yourights?MR. NIVER:  With regard to the Fifthrights, if they are not in custody, then --371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 can have them --2 MR. NIVER: Yes, Your Honor.3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can.4 MR. NIVER: Yes. But in this case, the --5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is --6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about --7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is --8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about --9 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that right? I mean, even10 in prison, I -- what -- I'm not sure you could even do11 that if they were still in prison. Can you subject12 people in prison --13 MR. NIVER: Well, of course, that would not14 be a Fourth Amendment claim.15 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. No, I --16 MR. NIVER: It would be a different --17 JUSTICE SCALIA: The Chief Justice was trying18 to get out of the Fourth Amendment into the Fifth.19 MR. NIVER: That failing -- well, in terms of20 the lack of a precedent from this Court, you know, at21 this point we can only speculate, but it seems to me22 that if a person can be required to submit to a drug23 test by virtue of the status as a parolee or24 probationer, I don't think that it is an extravagant25 step to say that they could be required to submit to an381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425interview.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Would you say the samething if the offense he had committed was tax evasionor price-fixing or speeding?  Would the -- would aperson on parole for any one of those offenses have --be subject to the same risk of a suspicionless search? And would it be justified?          MR. NIVER:  Suspicionless search?--JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well --MR. NIVER:  Where we're back to --JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- applying this statute toMR. NIVER:  Yes.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- a price-fixer, tax-evader, speeder.  Do you think it's justified?          MR. NIVER:  If he's on parole, Your Honor, ifhe's -- look, this applies to parolees in Californiawho have been convicted of felonies, served time inprison, and have been --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  And if it's to be --          MR. NIVER:  -- released on parole.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- applied to the taxoffender and so forth, how about just applying it toall ex-felons?  Would that be permissible?MR. NIVER: On parole, or not on -- 391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, just the very fact that2 there's -- they're an ex-felon. And let the person3 know, at the time of his discharge from prison, that4 this is one of the things that the State is going to5 exact from you as a punishment for your crime.6 MR. NIVER: If the person is on parole, the7 answer --8 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, I'm saying --9 MR. NIVER: Oh --10 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- he's not on parole.11 MR. NIVER: -- he's no longer on parole?12 Than the entire balance changes. The reduction of the13 expectation of privacy --14 JUSTICE STEVENS: But I'm hypothesizing a15 case in which the law will destroy the expectation of16 privacy, because it will provide that all ex-felons are17 subject to search. So, they would know, the same as a18 parolee now knows, he's subject to search. Would that19 be valid?20 MR. NIVER: My answer to that is, it would21 not be valid, Your Honor, because a person, having22 served his time on parole, the State's overwhelming23 interest in supervision has ended. The State has24 determined that that person, having successfully25 completed his period of parole --401111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE STEVENS: But -- so you don't --2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Most --3 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- rely on --4 JUSTICE SCALIA: Most States --5 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- the fact that --6 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- don't let felons vote. I7 mean, that's a punishment that they impose after8 they're out of prison.9 MR. NIVER: Yes, but this is not -- yes, Your10 Honor, but this is really not about punishment, this is11 about supervision. And if a parolee has successfully12 completed this parole, has been discharged from parole,13 then the balance --14 JUSTICE STEVENS: But then we're not relying15 on the elimination of the expectation of privacy,16 because, under my hypothetical statute, the ex-felon17 would know he's subject to it. So, it has to be18 something other than the absence of an expectation of19 privacy. Is that correct?20 MR. NIVER: Not -- a person who is no longer21 on parole, there is no longer the overwhelming State22 interest in supervision. The balance changes. Our23 position would be that that would not be a permissible24 search.25JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me that the 411111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 principal difference, Mr. Niver, is that when he's on2 parole, it's in lieu of being in jail. If that's not3 the difference, you don't persuade me. He has4 voluntarily accepted the parole in exchange for his5 getting out of jail. And he'd be in worse condition if6 he were in jail. That's what, seems to me, makes the7 difference.8 MR. NIVER: Well, that's -- I think that's9 exactly right, Your Honor. The ex-parolee, no longer10 on parole, is no longer in custody of the -- of the11 California Department of Corrections. There is no12 longer an overwhelming need to supervise the person,13 who, having successfully completed parole, is14 presumptively not the threat to society that he was15 that he -- when he was a parolee. The balance changes,16 and such a condition -- that is to say a suspicionless17 search of an ex-parolee, I think would offend the18 Fourth Amendment.19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Niver --20 JUSTICE BREYER: But what do you achieve by21 this system that you have that you couldn't achieve by22 a system that more carefully worked out the rules and23 conditions of a random search? I mean, rules, so that24 you avoid the totally discretionary element. And if25 you want to have management consultants, as I was421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425imagining, have 'em.  They're not just going to tellyou, "Go and ask anybody to search anytime he wants."They'll have a system worked out.  So, why not at leastrequire you to think it through that much?  And,otherwise, it is unreasonable.          MR. NIVER:  Well, we have disputedPetitioner's position that this is a search, althoughsuspicionless, that it is -- that discretion is notcircumscribed is our position.  And it is, because --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, are there manuals --are there any -- here is the cop on the beat.          MR. NIVER:  Yes.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  He sees someone that heknows is a parolee.  Is there any instruction that he'sbeen given so that his discretion can be guided insteadof rudderless?  In practice in California, are all --          MR. NIVER:  In -- I'm sorry, Your Honor.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.  What is thepractice?          MR. NIVER:  In practice, the -- a search -- aparole search may not be arbitrary, capricious, orconducted solely for the purpose of harassing --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I'm asking you about whatinstruction, what training, if you know, are officersgiven?  Or are they given no training, just the law431111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 that says, "You can search any parolee"?2 MR. NIVER: No, they are not told that they3 may search any parolee, Your Honor. Rather, they are4 told that the search must be to rehabilitate, reform,5 or have some other law enforcement purpose. And they -6-7 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. The officer says,8 "I'm searching to see whether the person has any9 evidence of crime on him." For example, whether he has10 any drugs on him. Law enforcement purpose:11 supervisory, I suppose. They want to know whether12 their -- whether their parolees are committing13 offenses. And yet, that reason would apply to everyone14 virtually all the time. So, it doesn't seem to be a15 limitation at all. What -- am I -- am I missing16 something?17 MR. NIVER: It does apply -- it is a18 limitation. It is not a limitation that would protect19 the expectation of privacy of a nonparole --20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, how does the21 limitation work? The guy is on 1st Street, and an22 officer says, you know, "I recognize this person is a23 parolee, and I have a law enforcement objective. Is24 the person committing a crime? Is the -- is the person25 a recidivist? Is the person violating parole?" So, he441111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425searches him.  The person gets to 2nd Street, anotherofficer does the same thing.  Three hours later, athird officer does the same thing.  In each case, itseems to me, their justification would not fall afoulof the arbitrary, capricious, or harassment standard.It's not coordinated.  They have a -- both a paroleand a law enforcement objective.  Why is there anylimitation, then, on the right to search?          MR. NIVER:  If these are, as I understandYour Honor's hypothetical, three independent searches --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Uh-huh.          MR. NIVER:  -- to the extent that that couldhappen, and I suppose it could, the -- again, thelimitation is it be, as Your Honor states, for avalid law enforcement purpose, and it would require --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  No.  No, but let's getbehind the rhetoric.  Is there any reason myhypothetical could not, in fact, turn out to be true?          MR. NIVER:  There is no --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Apart from the unlikelihoodof all those police officers out there.  But, leavingthat aside, is there -- is there any reason, in thestandard, that my hypothetical could not be true?MR. NIVER: Well, Your Honor, no, there is no 451111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 reason, but it would -- it requires more than testimony2 by the officers. If the officers at -- each testified3 that they conducted the search, they're -- also4 requires5 searches6 purpose.7a finding of fact by the trial court that thewere, in fact, for a valid law enforcement              JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.  I mean, let's assume8 the police are telling the truth, and the judge says,9 "Sure." So, there is no limitation. And it sounds to10 me, then, as though about the only limitation that11 would be enforceable would be the limitation against12 harassment. If one officer did it every 15 minutes to13 the same person, or if there were a departmental14 systematic policy saying, you know, "Get so-and-so,"15 that I can understand as being a limitation. But I16 don't see any other limit.17 MR. NIVER: Well, the limitation is, as Your18 Honor states, if it's a -- for a valid law enforcement19 purpose or to promote rehabilitation or --20 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I realize --21 MR. NIVER: -- recommend --22 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- but do you --23 MR. NIVER: But --24 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- do you agree that there25 is not any practical limitation, other than the461111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425harassment limitation?          MR. NIVER:  I -- well, that harassmentlimitation is sufficient to protect the residuum of anexpectation --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, maybe --          MR. NIVER:  -- of --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- maybe it is.  But what'sthe answer to my question?  Is that, in practicalterms, the only limitation?          MR. NIVER:  It is a -- but it -- yes, YourHonor, that is the protection.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought you said thatmaybe cavity searches would not -- would not be allowedwithout some special reason for them.  And thatwouldn't necessarily be harassment.          MR. NIVER:  I think it depends on thecircumstances of the search.JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes --MR. NIVER:  There's an --JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean --MR. NIVER:  -- overarchingFourth Amendment, that the                           principle here,JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 47under thereasonable, in terms of manner and scope.1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-search be￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. NIVER:  That applies equally to asuspicionless search as it would to a search based onindividual suspicion.  To that extent, it's really notan issue that arises from the fact that this issuspicionless.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What would be arbitraryand capricious?  You told us harassing would be therepeated searches by the same officer.          MR. NIVER:  Or an -- or a needlessly intrusivesearch, as has been just described, or --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, let's assume -- let'sassume that the cavity search is demanded at the busstation, and the officer says, "We know that drugs gettransported by people who ingest them in the balloons,and they get on buses and they travel back and forthfrom city A to city B."  Any reason that that would runafoul of arbitrary and capricious?          MR. NIVER:  Depends on the circumstances ofthe search.  Again, Your Honor --          JUSTICE SOUTER:  All I'm telling you is, he'sat a bus station.  The facts are that a lot of peoplewho travel on buses are drug couriers.  This person isa parolee.  Would that run afoul of the -- of anyarbitrary and          MR.capricious limitation?NIVER:  It would, for example, if it were48 Washington, DC 20005 1-1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400￼1 done in public view. If the officer didn't, then --2 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, sure, but the officer3 says, "All right. I'm taking you down to the station4 for a cavity search."5 MR. NIVER: Again, the office -- if the6 officer did it under those circumstances, it's for the7 finder of fact to decide whether it was done for a8 legitimate purpose or --9 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you're -- I'm asking10 you to be the finder of fact for me. This is the11 officer's explanation. This is the factual -- set of12 factual premises on which he acts. Has he violated the13 arbitrary and capricious limitation?14 MR. NIVER: If, in fact, it was for the15 purpose that you state, a legitimate law enforcement16 purpose, and he has been removed from public view, and17 it's reasonable, in terms of manner and intensity, then18 it would be permissible.192021 - 22232425JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I have one --JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, suppose you couldn't -JUSTICE KENNEDY:  IJUSTICE SCALIA:  --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  IJUSTICE SCALIA:  --have one --you couldn't --have --conduct cavity searches491111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 without some special reason, even in prison. Wouldn't2 that be -- isn't there some remnant of a fourth-3 amendment4 know, the56 the prison, the prison regs, the State. I can't answer7 that question --right in prison that you cannot subject, youwhole cellblock to cavity searches?MR. NIVER:  That would depend, Your Honor, on8 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I --9 MR. NIVER: -- in --10 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- I thought the assumption11 of your answer to my question a moment ago was that12 there was no such limitation, so far as California is13 concerned.14 MR. NIVER: No, there is a limitation, in15 terms of manner and scope.16 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, sure. But we -- the17 manner, in this case, is, they take him down to the18 station, so that they're not going through this in the19 middle of a crowded bus terminal. But the point of the20 question was, any parolee at a bus terminal could be21 subjected to this demand for search, and I thought your22 answer was, yes, he could be. And now, in response to23 Justice Scalia's question, you're saying, "Well, there24 may be some limitation." So, which is it?25 MR. NIVER: That if the search is a -- for a501111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 valid law enforcement purpose, and it is reasonable in2 scope and manner, then it is a permissible parolee3 search, in California.4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it depend -- I5 mean, what if he's on parole for transporting drugs in6 balloons from bus stations? Does that make a7 difference? -- as opposed to, he's on parole for tax8 fraud.9 MR. NIVER: It certainly might, Your Honor.10 And, again, that would be -- that -- an additional bit11 of evidence to present -- to be presented to the12 suppression court to determine whether the scope of the13 search was reasonable.14 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But all this is on a case15 -- would be on a case-by-case basis. There are no16 going-in guides for the officer on the street.17 MR. NIVER: It's necessarily determined on18 the -- any search has to be decided -- the19 reasonableness of any search has to be decided on a20 case-by-case basis.21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do we --22 JUSTICE BREYER: But the reasonableness here23 would be unreasonable, unless there are some checks.24 We're talking about suspicionless searches. And you25 could have checks. But what about saying -- why is it511111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 reasonable to do it without any rule-based controls on2 the behavior of the police? That's the question.3 MR. NIVER: Okay. And the answer is, in4 terms of the competing interests, the lowered5 expectations --6 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. But what interest7 does it serve not to have some rules, manuals,8 regulations that help make sure it really is random, or9 help make sure it isn't harassing, or help make sure10 that it's serving the very ends that you hope to serve11 with the suspicionless searches?12 MR. NIVER: If a State13 rules, those would -- may comply14 Amendment. The question is not,15 The question is, What was done?16 whether California's rule, which17 searches that -- with the -- absolute prohibition of18 arbitrary, capricious, and harassing suits, and which19 must be conducted under the Fourth Amendment, in terms20 -- reasonable, in terms of time, place, manner, and21 scope -- the question is whether that system, the22 California scheme, is constitutional under the Fourth23 Amendment. And here, the system was designed to24 address an overwhelming problem that the Court, this25 Court, has well defined.

MARCUS:  Thank you.  Mr. Chief Justice,it please the Court:CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. Niver.Mr. Marcus.ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN L. MARCUS          Concerned about the threat that parolees poseto public safety, the California Legislature, in 1996,authorized both police and parole officers to searchthem without individualized suspicion.  Whetherevaluated under the special-needs doctrine applied inGriffin, or the totality-of-the-circumstances approachapplied in Knights, the search of Petitioner in thiscase, pursuant to his search condition, was reasonableunder the Fourth Amendment.          JUSTICE ALITO:  Do we have --          JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But not the consent --531111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- to decide --2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- not the consent3 approach, I take it. I didn't get an opportunity to4 ask the counsel who argued just previously. Seemed to5 me that he argued consent when he answered Justice6 Stevens's question about the tax-evader. But he argued7 the overwhelming practical needs when he argued the8 rest of the case. And I thought I saw some tension in9 the argument there. And I take it the Government does10 not embrace the consent argument?11 MR. MARCUS: No, we do embrace it. We -- but12 we briefed --13141516171819202122232425 couple of541111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you --MR. MARCUS:  -- the --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- just --MR. MARCUS:  It --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- put it in number --MR. MARCUS:  We --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- you put it --MR. MARCUS:  We --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- in number three?MR. MARCUS:  Right.  It --JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In --MR. MARCUS:  -- well, primarily -- for areasons.  First, Your Honor, the California￼1 Supreme Court has not had a chance to interpret2 3067(a), you know, after the Reyes decision. They3 weren't interpreting it there. And so, they haven't4 had a chance to revisit their ruling that, as a matter5 of State law, it's not -- there's no consent when it6 comes to a parolee. And that's -- so, we thought maybe7 that would be a reason this Court, prudentially,8 wouldn't want to reach that issue.9 And, secondly, the -- while the joint10 appendix contains a portion of the agreement that the11 Petitioner signed, it doesn't contain the whole content12 of the agreement. The appellate record doesn't contain13 the whole content of the agreement. So, we didn't --14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in your view, if the15 consent was straightforward in the documents, would16 that be the strongest argument or the weakest argument?17 MR. MARCUS: Well, I think --18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, I take you'll win19 on any --20 MR. MARCUS: We --21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- argument --22 MR. MARCUS: Right, we think all --23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you can take.24 MR. MARCUS: -- we think all three arguments25 are strong. I don't think -- one isn't necessarily551111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 stronger than the other. And -- but -- and this Court2 -- but if the Court -- I mean, the Court certainly, at3 a minimum, can look at the statutes under California4 law, and can certainly conclude from the statutes that5 if a -- if some -- if an inmate doesn't sign the6 papers, he stays in prison until his sentence basically7 terminates. And then -- and then, at that point, when8 he's released, this -- another provision, section9 3060.5, kicks in, and his parole -- his parole is10 revoked. And he eventually will -- he ultimately will11 serve his whole term of parole in prison, so that the12 Court can see by the statutes that it is, effectively,13 a choice, statutorily, that he -- someone who does not14 want to be on parole does not have -- does not have to15 sign the condition, and will never go on parole.16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Long seemed to have --17 tell us something different about that. It's -- they18 had -- they must go out. He seemed to say they didn't19 have the choice of staying in.20 MR. MARCUS: Well, I think it's fairly clear,21 Your Honor, under -- if you look at the appendix to the22 Petitioner's brief, if you -- if you look at a23 combination of section 3067(b), and then -- which --24 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think he said he was25 unaware of anybody who was dragged out kicking and 561111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 screaming.2 MR. MARCUS: Right. And then if you look at3 3067(b), and then you also look at -- 3067(a) and (b),4 and then you look at section 3060.5, which provides for5 revocation if the -- if the inmate is -- or the parolee6 is unwilling to --7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it really --8 MR. MARCUS: -- sign the --9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- it really isn't.10 MR. MARCUS: -- agreement.11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's -- this is not like12 you sign an agreement and you're -- you can do it or13 you can not do it. I mean, this is a real Hobson's14 choice, isn't it?15 MR. MARCUS: Well, you know, again, if you16 think that --17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You can't --18 MR. MARCUS: -- there19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: --20 MR. MARCUS: There --21 JUSTICE GINSBURG: --22 MR. MARCUS: There undoubtedly are adverse23 consequences to not signing the agreement.24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you --25 MR. MARCUS: But --571111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1---negotiate, "I don't" --"want this part."￼12 could you 345 Amendment6 you're going to go back into a very cruel and unusual7 prison, not the one you left.8 MR. MARCUS: Well, I mean, I think -- I think9 the test would be whether it's -- whether it'sCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- waive your --waive --MR. MARCUS:  But --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- your Eighthrights?  You know, if your parole's revoked,10 reasonably the consent -- what they're asking you to11 agree to is reasonably related to the purposes of12 punishment. And, in this case, the -- you know, the13 supervision of the parolee, rehabilitation, protection14 of public safety. And so, we think the consent15 argument works very well here.16 But, if I could, I'd like to also address our17 arguments under the totality of the circumstances and18 special needs. Faced with a serious recidivism19 problem, California has made the reasonable judgment20 that subjecting parolees to suspicionless searches is21 necessary to protect public safety and to promote22 rehabilitation.23 JUSTICE ALITO: What if it's the case --24 MR. MARCUS: But --25 JUSTICE ALITO: -- that this program would581111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 allow some searches that are -- that violate the Fourth2 Amendment, but that this particular search would not?3 How closely can we focus just on what happened here, or4 do we have to consider all the -- all the types of5 searches and the circumstances of searches that the6 California program might permit?7 MR. MARCUS: Well, I -- no, I mean, I think8 typically this Court applies a very, sort of, narrowly9 tailored approach to Fourth Amendment questions, and10 focuses narrowly on the context in which the search was11 conducted. In this case, for example, you wouldn't --12 you wouldn't have to reach the question of whether a13 search of a home was constitutional. This -- I mean,14 the question here is whether a search of the Petitioner15 on a public street was constitutional. And the Court16 does typically limit its Fourth Amendment cases to the17 facts presented.18 So -- but, at the same time, in analyzing19 that, I think you do have to consider what the Fourth20 Amendment standard is. And we believe the Fourth21 Amendment does impose -- the Fourth Amendment itself22 imposes restrictions on the discretion of police23 officers and parole officers that are meaningful, that24 -- as the Reyes Court said, there are restrictions on25 the timing, the frequency, the duration, and the591111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 oppressiveness of the search. So, police officers and2 parole officers are on notice that courts will review3 suspicionless searches very carefully. They're on4 notice that there are limits to what they can do. And5 they're --6 7 8 91011 supposing12 this particular search didn't seem very offensive.13 Would you still defend it?14 MR. MARCUS: If there were no -- no, we --15 no, we think there are -- the Fourth Amendment imposes16 restrictions -- time, place, and manner restrictions --17 on the suspicionless searches.18 JUSTICE SCALIA: No.19 MR. MARCUS: And so, that --20 JUSTICE SCALIA: He's asking you, I think,21 Justice Alito's question, "Do we have to get into22 that?" So long as this one's okay, why do -- why do we23 have to get into whether there might be some other ones24 that aren't okay?25 MR. MARCUS: I -- that's correct. I don't --601111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-JUSTICE STEVENS:  But following --MR. MARCUS:  -- on notice that --JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- up on Justice --MR. MARCUS:  -- if a search is --JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- Alito's thought,there were no restrictions whatsoever, but￼1 I mean, I 234--JUSTICE STEVENS:  And it --MR. MARCUS:  -- I think you just --JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- it was assumed5 California --6 MR. MARCUS: Right.7 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- didn't say if they had8 protection against harassment and so forth. Suppose9 they just said, "Cart blanche, you can search any10 parolee at any time, any place." And then you'd ask11 whether this search was reasonable.12 MR. MARCUS: Right. And I think, in determining13 that, you would -- in determining it and looking at the14 facts of this case, you would -- you would apply a Fourth15 Amendment standard to determine whether this search was16 objectively reasonable. And you would look at factors17 like the time, place, frequency, and manner to18 determine 19202122 2324 unreasonable the California statute might be in other25 applications.611111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-whether a search was, in fact, reasonable --JUSTICE STEVENS:  So, it would uphold this.MR. MARCUS:  -- and objective --JUSTICE STEVENS:  There's --MR. MARCUS:  -- objective --JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- no matter now￼1 MR. MARCUS: That's correct. And it's to see2 whether it's objective -- whether the search in this3 case was objectively related to the purposes of4 supervision, to protect public safety, and to promote5 rehabilitation. That, we think, is the test under the6 Fourth Amendment. And while Petitioner points out that7 there are a hundred cases out there where the standard,8 you know, hasn't been used to throw out a search, at9 the same time, he hasn't pointed to any cases where a10 prosecution has been based on an abusive search that11 this standard has been too toothless to throw out. And12 we think that's significant, given that this type of13 condition has been in place for over 20 years for14 probationers, since the Bravo decision in 1987. And15 the parole condition has been in place since 1996, when16 the Legislature authorized this and made a considered17 decision to switch from a reasonable-suspicion standard18 to a suspicionless standard for parolees.19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The Government -- is the20 Government of the United States somewhat behind the21 State of California? It's not efficient in -- as22 efficient as California in supervising its parolees?23 Because you don't have this rule.24 MR. MARCUS: We don't have this program.25 There are -- I mean, District Courts have the authority621111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 to impose a suspicionless search condition. And some2 have. I think the important thing to keep in mind here3 is that this is a -- the Court has traditionally given4 a lot of deference to States in dealing with convicted5 felons in their criminal justice system, in making6 sentencing determinations, reasonable sentencing7 determinations, as this Court emphasized in the Ewing8 decision. And so, California clearly has a big problem9 on their hands. The recidivism rates are demonstrated,10 they're in the record. The -- California was11 responding to those high recidivism rates. They were12 also responding to some high-profile crimes involving13 parolees. And the -- and, on top of that, we do have a14 brief that's submitted by 21 States who say that they15 do need this authority to effectively supervise16 parolees.17 18 1920 gone down21 this is suspicionless search, as opposed to reasonable22 suspicion?23 MR. MARCUS: Well, I -- I mean, I'm not sure24 if the studies have been -- statistics have been, sort25 of, documented up to this -- to this date, but I think631111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Has --MR. MARCUS:  But --JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- the recidivism ratein the years since the Reyes decision, since￼1 it's fair to say that it would be difficult to draw2 conclusions from those statistics, because, of course,3 this gives -- this provision gives the California4 parole and police officers more authority to conduct5 searches; and so, there's -- to the extent it's6 increasing the detection of crime, and so more people7 are actually being, you know, put back in prison on a8 parole violation or a criminal violation, it wouldn't9 necessarily mean that it's -- this isn't, you know,10 being successful in reducing recidivism, because11 there's --12 JUSTICE SOUTER: Do --13 MR. MARCUS: -- I mean, there's that side to14 it, too.15 JUSTICE SOUTER: Even apart from the -- what16 -- the lack of evidence for any change since the Reyes17 decision, do we have any empirical evidence, perhaps18 involving a control group, about the likelihood of the19 -- this liberal search policy in reducing recidivism?20 MR. MARCUS: May I answer the question, Your21 Honor?22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead.23 MR. MARCUS: I think, you know, traditionally24 this Court has been very deferential to State decisions25 on -- you know, on efficacy, on whether a particular641111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 program is going to be efficacious -- I mean, cases2 like Martinez-Fuerte and the Sitz decision involving3 checkpoints for drunk driving -- in a court. Even4 with, you know, very strong, you know, low efficacy5 rates -- in, you know, a program that's showing very6 low efficacy rates, the Court said that these are7 judgment that -- judgments that the States need to8 make, and they ought to be given a lot of deference,9 even if, you know, their -- the numbers, you10 know, of -- don't show, by clear and convincing proof,11 that the problem isn't being ameliorated.12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.13 Marcus.14 Mr. Long, you have 2 minutes remaining.15 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR.,16 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER17 MR. LONG: In answer to Justice Alito's18 question, this search is unconstitutional, because the19 officer was completely at liberty -- he had complete20 discretion to decide whether to search. And it would21 not be acceptable if California said, "You can search22 anybody on the street," if the answer was, "Well, it23 wasn't a particularly invasive search." Granted,24 parolees have far less Fourth Amendment rights than25 others, but this is so much the core of the Fourth651111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Amendment.  This is what the framers wrote the FourthAmendment to stop, these general warrants and writs ofassistance.  One --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  But we --          MR. LONG:  -- consent --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- we normally don't lookinto the mind of the officer to decide whether hisaction was okay or not.          MR. LONG:  Well, and we're not asking you tolook into the mind of the officer.  It's --California's system, it's quite clear -- they admittedit here -- leaves it up to -- the officer can have anyreason for doing the search.  It's arbitrary, in thesense this Court would use, but not California.          On consent, very quickly, footnote 16 of ourreply brief, the California Supreme Court has saidrepeatedly that -- including very recently, since thissection 3067 -- that parole is not a matter of consent;it is imposed Perhaps thisdifferently.State Supremeof State law.on you.  This is a question of State law.Court would read the State lawBut, as the Court said in Griffin, theCourt is the last word on the questions          As to abuses, there are a number.  One thatI'll just mention, the California Supreme Court has661111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 held that it's perfectly okay -- if the officer knows2 somebody in the house is on parole or probation, they3 can use that as a lever to go in and search to try to4 find evidence about somebody else who's in the house.5 That is permissible under the California standard.6 But the bottom line here is that this type of7 search regime is at the core of the prohibition of the8 Fourth Amendment. It's what the framers wrote the9 Fourth Amendment to prohibit. So, if parolees have any10 Fourth Amendment rights, other than, you know, an11 essentially useless arbitrary-and-capricious standard12 that's never going to work, the Fourth Amendment has to13 prohibit this search. There are many other things the14 States can do. They have many options. This is at the15 endpoint on the spectrum.16 Thank you.17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Long.18 The case is submitted.19 [Whereupon, at 11:18 a.m., the case in the20 above-entitled matter was submitted.]21 22 23 24 251111 14th Street, NW Suite 40067 1-Washington, DC 20005
