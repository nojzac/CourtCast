Alabama, and Case 13­1138, the Alabama Democratic Conference v. Alabama.      Mr. Pildes.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD PILDESON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTSMR. PILDES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      Alabama employed rigid racial quotas, rigidracial targets to design all its black majoritydistricts based on mere racial statistics alone, andthen used only racial demographic data to meet thosetargets with astonishing precision.  These targets werenot based on any consideration of what's required undercurrent conditions in Alabama as Section 5 actuallyrequires.      Racial quotas in the context of districtingare a dangerous business.  They can be a way of givingminorities faced with racially polarized voting a fairopportunity to elect, but they can also be a way ofunnecessarily packing voters by race in ways thatfurther polarize and isolate us by race.4￼￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you want, on the2 one hand ­­ they obviously had to move new voters into3 the majority­minority districts because they were all4 underpopulated, and they need to move enough so that the5 minorities have an opportunity to elect candidates of6 their choice, but they can't move too many because that7 would be packing, correct?8 MR. PILDES: Your Honor, we understand that9 States are in a bind in this situation as has been true10 under Title VII and under the Voting Rights Act under11 Section 2.12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So ­­ but they have13 to do that. They have to hit this sweet spot between14 those two extremes without taking race predominantly15 into consideration?16 MR. PILDES: They don't have to hit a sweet17 pot ­­ spot. This Court has marked out a legitimate18 path that States can take and must take to comply both19 with their Section 5 obligations and with their equal20 protection obligations not to use the excessive and21 unjustified use of racial categories.22 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I thought the23 Section 5 obligation, gee, it ­­ it used to require that24 there ­­ that there be no regression in ­­ in ­­ in25 majority black districts. So if a district went from 695￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425percent black to 55 percent black, you would be introuble.MR. PILDES: Your Honor, Section 5 has always required no retrogression based on the ability to elect under current conditions.      JUSTICE SCALIA:      MR. PILDES:polarized voting ­­      JUSTICE SCALIA:that's all we did.  You know, these ­­ these districtswere underpopulated with respect to other ones, so wehad to move new people in them, and we had to do it insuch a way that there was still the 69 percent blackpopulation that they're used to be in order to avoidretrogression.MR. PILDES: Your Honor, retrogression has never meant merely reproducing racial statistics purely for their own sake. It's meant preserving the ability to elect, preserving majority­minority districts.JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, you can say that, but it meant you're ­­ the only way to be sure you're not doing that is maintaining the same ­­ the same percentage. And that's certainly the way the Justice Department, in the bad old days, used to interpret it.MR. PILDES: It may be in the first decade6    Right.So if there's no raciallyAnd ­­ and they're saying￼1 or so of the application of Section 5, DOJ employed2 various kinds of practices as you describe. As our3 brief documents in detail, the Department of Justice has4 routinely precleared plans that reduce black populations5 as long as they don't reduce the ability to elect.6 And, indeed, in Alabama in the last round of7 redistricting, if you look at the blue brief of the8 Black Caucus at the chart at 8A, you will see that9 Alabama dramatically reduced black populations in all of10 its districts in the Senate and in virtually all of its11 districts in the House. And if you look at that chart,12 you'll see numbers like a 12­point reduction, a 19­point13 reduction, a 10­point reduction, 16­point reduction.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that? Why1415 is ­­ 16171819202122232425MR. PILDES: They reduced districts down to 56 percent.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that? Why do you no longer need as high a percentage of minority voters to maintain a situation where minority voters can still elect their candidates of choice?MR. PILDES: For the reasons that this Court adverted to in Shelby County and the reasons that Alabama rightly celebrates in its briefs. Black turnout and black registration rates in Alabama now routinely7￼1 equal or even exceed white registration and white2 turnout rates.3 JUSTICE SCALIA: You realize, I assume, that4 you're ­­ you're making the argument that the opponents5 of black plaintiffs used to make here. They ­­ they ­­6 they said, you know, by requiring packing of ­­ of7 minorities into certain districts, you're reducing their8 influence statewide so you ­­ the representatives in ­­9 in other districts can ignore what ­­ what ­­ what the10 minority wants because they're all packed into ­­ that's11 the argument the other side used to be making.12 MR. PILDES: Yes, Your Honor. And when the13 Voting Rights Act legitimately requires the use of race14 in the face of polarized voting, then there's a national15 political judgment that reflects the tradeoffs, the cost16 and the benefits, as there are, to designing these17 districts. You can ­­18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose ­­ suppose there19 are Party A in 2001 takes minorities out of heavily20 minority districts and puts them into opportunity21 districts for political purposes. It's for partisan22 gerrymandering purposes. Assume that.23 MR. PILDES: Uh­huh.24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Party B then gets into25 power ten years later. It wants to undo what Party A8MR.

PILDES: Right. But the line thisCourt's precedents have drawn is precisely the linebetween partisan motivations in districting and racial.JUSTICE KENNEDY: In both of my hypotheticals, it's partisan. In either case, is there a violation?MR. PILDES: If it's purely partisan in motive and they don't use race, then there's no problem. JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but ­­ but they do userace, but it's purely partisan.  Your ­­ thehypothetical is, Case 1, they find minority voters and9that's the legitimate path States havehas marked out.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did they partisan purposes?that this Courtdo this forMR.

Then thenext party comes in and simply undoes it, and it usesthe same calculus, race.MR. PILDES: Your Honor, the ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you going to tellme ­­ is it your position, and I think it may be your position, that in the first case it's permitted and the second case it isn't?MR. PILDES: No, Your Honor. Our position is that race can't be used excessively and unjustifiably in either case. And the three­judge court found ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was it unjust ­­ was it unjustified in ­­ in ­­ in Case A when they were trying to have more minority opportunity districts?MR. PILDES: If they exceeded their obligations under Section 2 and Section 5, if they went beyond the limited leeway this Court has said that States have, if they have the strong basis in evidence that's required, if they properly interpret the Act,JUSTICE ALITO:So if you ­­ if they want to￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      JUSTICE KENNEDY:can then undo it for partisan purposes, because I sensethat there's a one­way ratchet here.MR. PILDES: I don't think that's correct, Your Honor, and I understand the concern.      If, for partisan purposes, a legislaturepassed a race­based barrier to voting, that would surelybe unconstitutional.  They can't use race in the waythis Court's cases ­­ in the Shaw line of cases indicateare beyond the parameters the States have.  They have tohave a strong basis in evidence.      In this case, Alabama didn't even ask therelevant legal question.  Alabama didn't ask what isnecessary to preserve the ability to elect, what mightbe necessary to preserve the ability to elect.  Theyjust reproduced numbers, statistics, and the way theydid it is they just used racial data.JUSTICE ALITO: Well, you began by ­­ by criticizing Alabama for supposedly imposing quotas. But listening to your argument, it sounds to me that you are just as interested in quotas. You're just interested in lower quotas.Justice Alito: Is that right?MR. PILDES: Your Honor, ­­11And I'm asking if Party B1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425keep it at 70 percent, that's ­­ that may beillegitimate in your view.  But if they take it down tothe minimum that would be required in order to producethe desired result, that's a ­­ that's a ­­ apermissible quota.  So why are you using this"quota" at all?￼      MR. PILDES:"quota."      JUSTICE ALITO:      MR. PILDES:word "racial targets."  Judge Thompson used the word ­­We don't have to use   Well, why did youI actually meant to use theJUSTICE ALITO: You think there's a difference between the two?MR. PILDES: Well, there's a lot of rhetorical and inflammatory power in the word "quota."      But, Your Honor, the point here is thatthere must be at least legitimate basis for racialclassification.JUSTICE BREYER: So that's to Justice Kennedy's question, I thought your answer would be there isn't a one­way ratchet. That's Cromartie 2, isn't it?MR. PILDES: If you're using ­­JUSTICE BREYER: Doesn't Cromartie 2 say if you're doing this for political reasons, because many, many African­Americans vote Democrat, all right? And so12termthe worduse it?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425what they're doing is they're trying to help theDemocrats.  So, yeah, we're trying to help theDemocrats.  Okay.      If that's what you can ­­ are doing and theycan't really prove the contrary, the burden is on theone attacking the district, whether they are doing it byremoving some African­Americans from this one or byputting more into it, it's the same issue.  Am I right?MR. PILDES: Yes, you're right. And that's ­­JUSTICE BREYER: Right. Then it's not a one­way ratchet.

And that's ­­ your answer is exactly the answer I was trying to give to Justice Kennedy, which is partisan manipulation, this Court has said, may be fine and constitutional, but the one thing you cannot do is use race as a proxy for politics or political affiliation.

PILDES: Yes.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG:7 presentation, you're saying we are attacking the8 statewide plan. We are not picking one district or the9 other. And you have been attacked on that point. The10 attack is that Shaw claims have to be district by11 district; they can't be statewide. So I would like your12 answer to that question. There hasn't been a Shaw13 claim, as far as I know, that was statewide. They have14 all been district by district.15 MR. PILDES: Your Honor, our claim is that16 the exact same policy was applied in every black­17 majority district, which is we will use racial data to18 repopulate as close as we can possibly do it to the19 exact same black percentage. That's a policy applied in20 every ­­ in all 36 districts.21 JUSTICE SCALIA: And how ­­ how are your22 clients hurt by that?

PILDES: But many of the districts are wholly contained within the county. They occupy the full county. We demonstrate in our brief a number of senate districts and many house districts that are whole county districts.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you waivingyour district by district challenge? Does your claim rise and fall solely on this statewide point you make?MR.

SCHNAPPER: Mr. Chief Justice, and mayit please the Court:      This Court's Shaw jurisprudence channels theconversation that we're having today.  This Court hasidentified two constitutional claims that could beraised with regard to the use of race in districting.One is intentional dilution of minority votes for thepurpose of minimizing their effectiveness and the secondone is Shaw.  This is ­­ we're advancing a Shaw claim.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You lost on the dilution claim.MR. SCHNAPPER: We did. We did. The facts material to the Shaw claim are ­­ were not in dispute at trial. The question is whether they fall within the concept of predominance in this Court's line of decisions.JUSTICE ALITO: Did the district court understand you to be asserting a district­specific ­­ district­specific claims?MR. SCHNAPPER: I think it understood us to be challenging each of the districts.17￼1 that in the ­­ in the opinion of the district court? I2 thought the district court interpreted you not to be3 making that claim.4 MR. SCHNAPPER: I ­­ we ­­ we advanced5 evidence as to the motive that was a motive common to6 all the districts and then we advanced ­­ offered7 evidence about particular districts to illustrate how8 that was played out. But this is not ­­ there's no9 conceptual difference between challenging all 3610 districts and challenging 36 districts. It ­­ it's the11 same claim.12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you mean had specific13 ­­ in your proposed findings, you dealt specifically14 with certain districts and not specifically with others.15 MR.

That's ­­ that's thestanding doctrine that this Court has announced in thosecases.      Predominance involves, under this Court's ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand what you just said. They have a claim because there are too many19￼￼1 blacks in their district?2 MR. SCHNAPPER: No. It's not about the3 number. The theory of the Court in Shaw is that if race4 is the predominant purpose in putting blacks into a5 district, that that will likely result in6 representational harm in terms of the way the elected7 officials will act. And that's been the theory of the8 Shaw claims ever since Shaw.9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you think it's10 possible for the State to navigate between not enough11 minority members in the district and too many minority12 members in the district without taking race into13 account.14 MR. SCHNAPPER:15 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:16 into account.17 MR. SCHNAPPER:18 that taking race into account raises a constitutional19 question in all cases, particularly in ­­ in the wake of20 this Court's decision in Easley, which made it clear,21 finally resolving an issue that had been kicking around22 for some time, that the fact that race was a factor in23 drawing a district doesn't trigger strict scrutiny. A24 majority of the Court held there that for Shaw purposes25 to trigger strict scrutiny the plaintiff would have to20No, we do ­­ we do not.        Race predominantlyBut Shaw ­­ Shaw doesn't say￼1 show predominance, that race was the predominant,2 overriding purpose, meaning it was the criteria to which3 ­­ that couldn't be put aside for any other purpose.4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So ­­ so they have5 to navigate between too many and too few, but without6 race being the predominant consideration.7 MR. SCHNAPPER: If race, if ­­ in terms of8 the Constitution, if race isn't the predominant purpose9 and dilution isn't involved, then there's no10 constitutional claim. With regard to Section 5, let11 me ­­ I think it would be helpful to understand what the12 government's interpretation is and has been for sometime13 about what Section 5 requires. This is reflected in the14 government's brief at 22 and 23 and in the 201115 guidelines.16 The government's view, and this is how ­­17 this has long been understood, is that the black18 proportion can be reduced to the point where blacks no19 longer have the ­­ the ability to elect a candidate of20 their choice. Until you get to that point, changes are21 not retrogressive, and that's not the way ­­22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think ­­ what23 do you think ­­ well, it's speculative. But I think24 that if Alabama had reduced the number of minority25 voters in majority­minority districts in any significant211 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425way, the Attorney General would have come down on themlike a ton of bricks.MR.

I see nowhere any indication that the13 district court construed your pleadings and your other14 submissions to raise a claim about any specific15 district.16 The third point is we construe the filings17 of the Democratic Conference plaintiffs as arguing that18 certain senate districts constitute racial gerrymanders.19 There's nothing with that with respect to your client.20 Maybe I'm missing something. So if that's how the21 district court understood your position, then maybe it22 was wrong, but that would be the threshold question we'd23 have to decide, wouldn't it be, that if you have to be24 district­specific, we would have to say the district25 court misunderstood the claims that you were asserting?24￼1 MR. SCHNAPPER: I think in the context of2 the way the case was litigated and tried and the briefs3 at the time, it was ­­ everybody understood the4 plaintiffs were challenging all of the majority­black5 districts.6 JUSTICE ALITO: The district court7 understood that? Then why did it include this paragraph8 and why did it not go through any districts that it saw9 you as challenging? It went through some that it saw10 the other plaintiffs as challenging, none with respect11 to you.12 MR. SCHNAPPER: We think in the context in13 which the case was litigated, there was no conceptual14 difference between challenging all the 36 districts and15 challenging 36 individual districts. The reason the16 opinion reads the way it does is that the State didn't17 contend and we didn't contend that there was different18 district­specific purposes afoot. The State's account19 of this, which everyone accepted, was that the State had20 a common purpose in adding those thousands of21 individuals to each district, which was to ­­ which was22 to continue the black percentage as it had been all23 along. It was a purpose common to all of them.24 JUSTICE KAGAN: And, Mr. Schnapper, isn't it25 right that after trial, when you submitted proposed25￼ 1   findings of fact and conclusions of law, in fact, you 2   did reference particular districts?  You referenced 3   Senate Districts 18, 19 and 20.  In another place, you 4   talked about all the majority­black districts in the 5   State's black belt, and you explained how your theory of 6   the case related to each one of those districts.7 MR. SCHNAPPER: We did. This ­­ this is 8   somewhat analogous to the Teamsters decision from back 9   in the 1970s.  Where the government to prove racial10   discrimination in promotions, said it made out a pattern11   and practice case by offering evidence that was class­wide,12   that affected all the individual blacks and Hispanics,13   and then offered some individual stories.  But the claim14   was for all of the individuals who worked in those ­­ in15   those facilities.16 JUSTICE BREYER: To get there, we'd have ­­17   you're talking, about, second, we construe the filings18   of the Black Caucus plaintiffs as arguing that the acts19   as a whole constitute racial gerrymandering, so we'd20   have to say that was wrong, they didn't get the21   complaint right, send it back.22 So if we're going to have to send it back, I23   guess what you'd have to ­­ would there be anything24   wrong with saying this:  Look, tell the plaintiffs25   please to point district by district to the fact that26￼1 the primary motive here was racial. I don't think that2 would be too hard. We have loads of evidence on that.3 Now, if the primary is racial ­­ and this is4 the crucial part ­­ they then to justify this have to5 show that they are making a ­­ and I don't know what6 word ­­ reasonable attempt, good faith reasonable7 attempt, some other word, to comply with the section,8 old Section 5 requirements, with the Section 59 requirements. And now they have to do it over again10 anyway and so they do it over again, and if in fact some11 of the questions suggest that that is what they were12 trying to do; and you'd have evidence there that said,13 no, no, that isn't what they were trying to do. They14 didn't even read the guidelines of the attorney general.15 They didn't even look at what happened in the past.16 They made no such attempt. All right. So would there17 be, from your point of view, anything wrong with that18 holding?19 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, Your Honor, I think20 with regard to the question of justification, we think21 it doesn't make any sense, in light of this Court's22 decision particularly in Shaw 2, to send it back. The23 Court's decision makes clear that there are three24 parameters to the way you assess this: First, what they25 did is to be judged by the correct interpretation of the27￼1 statute, not what they might have thought in good faith2 it meant. Second ­­ and the word "correct" is in a3 number of this Court's Shaw decisions.4 Secondly, that the purpose to comply with5 the correct interpretation has to have been their motive6 at the time; and secondly, at the time, not at trial,7 but back when they did this, they had to then, in 2012,8 have had a strong basis in evidence for concluding that9 not using all these different numbers would have10 violated the statute. They don't ­­ they can't satisfy11 any of those things. They can't go back ­­ you could12 send the case back to the district court, but you can't13 send the case back to 2012 and have them change the14 purpose or change the evidence before them.15 So, unless you're going to change the16 standard of strict scrutiny this Court has applied in17 Shaw and other affirmative action­related cases, you18 could not do that. It's just ­­ it's years too late for19 them to solve those problems.20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm still having a21 psychological problem with your point. There were three22 reasons. You're saying merely because it was one among23 the three, it necessarily was predominant as to each24 district created. The example or hypothetical I posited25 for you was the primary reason above all others that281 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425they said is the 2 percent district, and there may be districts among these 36 that, as I indicated, had contiguous populations that didn't make a difference about race. So it didn't ­­ they are not affected by this policy. Why should we undo that?MR. SCHNAPPER: Okay. Okay. If I might just answer the one last question. In fact, as theanalysis of the precinct­splitting shows, with perhapstwo exceptions, there is race­based precinct­splittingon the border of every one of the majority­black districts in question here. It wasn't a situation where they just took the neighboring districts and they turned out to replicate, to be just the ratio that they wanted. It was very, very calculated and race­based.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.      General Verrilli.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,     FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE        SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTYGENERAL VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:The key point in this case is that Shawclaims require district­specific analysis. The district court departed from that principle and in our judgment the plaintiffs' main theory also departs from that29￼￼1 principle, and I'd like to address ­­2 JUSTICE KAGAN: I don't understand why3 that's so, General. I mean, what the plaintiffs are4 saying is yes, we have common evidence, not all together5 usual in a Shaw claim, but here they have evidence.6 It's a policy statement that retrogression was going to7 be a very main priority. I think it was number 2. And8 retrogression was defined in a certain way, as requiring9 the maintenance of black voting population. And that10 was going to be taken into account in every single11 majority minority district.12 Now, the fact that there's evidence, the13 principal evidence in the case, that relates to every14 single district and so in a sense the evidence is15 statewide, does not make it any less a district by16 district case.17 GENERAL VERRILLI: That may be right,18 Justice Kagan, but it also doesn't prove that race19 predominated in the Shaw sense with respect to each20 specific district, and let me try to explain why. The21 test under Shaw is whether race predominates to22 derogation of traditional districting criteria.23 it may be that in some districts, the effort to24 the same African American population resulted in25 judgments that ­­ to draw the districts in ways that30theAnd somaintain￼1 derogated from traditional districting criteria, such as2 compactness and maintaining communities of interest, but3 it may be in other districts that it didn't, and I can4 provide specific examples of that.5 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I guess I would6 appreciate specific examples, because it seems to me as7 sort of a going­in matter that when you say this is the8 most important thing except for the Reynolds inquiry,9 this is the most important thing, that necessarily it's10 going to affect the way you redraw or who you put into11 the districts.12 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well ­­13 JUSTICE KAGAN: You might not reach the14 target in every single district, but necessarily you're15 saying we are prioritizing this race­based ­­ this16 race­based thing, criterion, in a way that's going to17 affect every judgment we make.18 GENERAL VERRILLI: But the question under19 Shaw, Your Honor, as we read the Shaw line of cases, is20 whether that is done in derogation of traditional21 districting criteria.22 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how can it not be? If23 you have three priorities or three criteria and you say24 this is the absolute most important criteria, it's just25 the natural effect of that is going to be to minimize31￼1 the other two criteria.2 GENERAL VERRILLI:3 necessarily true. Sometimes they will conflict,4 sometimes they won't. And I think the example ­­ I can5 give you examples I think that would illustrate that6 from the record.7 For example ­­ now, there weren't specific8 findings about these districts in the district court's9 opinion, so I'm not trying to say this is what the10 district court found. But with respect to some11 districts, for example, House District 67, the State12 argues that that was a district in which you are going13 to have essentially an African American percentage at14 the percentage that the district was drawn at no matter15 how you drew it, and that was because the surrounding16 populations around that district were all of comparable17 African American percentages.18 made in order to get to the 219 one­person­one­vote threshold20 moving African Americans. And we'd submit that's not a21 situation in which race predominated over traditional22 districting criteria. It's a ­­ it's situation in which23 traditional districting criteria drove the decision.24 There may, however, be other districts ­­25 and Senate District 26 is one that comes to mind, in32No, that's not  So whatever choice youpercentwas going to involve14 based on economic data?15 GENERAL VERRILLI:16 be a problem, Your Honor.17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then I think it would notBut it results in the same18 thing.19 GENERAL VERRILLI:20 ­­ it wouldn't be race predominating over traditional21 districting criteria. And I will go back and try to22 answer the question that Your Honor posed earlier about23 when partisanship can be a justification and when it24 isn't. I think it's a very technical answer, but I25 think if a State were to move electoral precincts from33￼1 which, where you had this movement of 14,500 people into2 a district, which was in the City of Montgomery and3 surrounding areas, all but 35 of whom were African4 American. And if one looks at that map ­­ and actually,5 it's very difficult to discern on the small maps that6 are in your materials. But if you can get a blow­up of7 it, what you will see in that map is that the so­called8 "crab claws" that the parties describe that extend out9 from the district capture African American populations.10 But what they do is carve out the white part of the City of11 Montgomery and attach it by a very narrow land bridge to12 the next ­­13 JUSTICE KENNEDY:Suppose they did thatRight.  But it wouldn't67 just8 know9 knowBut when you split a precinct and you movebased on census block information, there you don't how the people in the census block voted. What you is their race. And so at that point if you're￼1 one district to another, the entire electoral precinct,2 because there you would have the data on how people3 voted in that precinct, that would ­­ that would not4 raise a problem under the Shaw analysis because you5 clearly would be making a decision for partisan reasons.10 using race as a proxy ­­ and I think that's what11 Mr. Pildes was trying to describe to Your Honor, when12 you're using race as a proxy in that circumstance, that13 would violate what this Court has said in all of its14 Shaw cases is the constitutional norm at stake here15 because you're making an assumption. You're16 stereotyping in that situation, so it's ­­17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's true at the18 outset if you move them by race in order to increase19 their capacity to influence districts?20 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, that's a difficult21 question, Your Honor, but I think if you're ­­ if you're22 ­­ if you're moving people by race in order to ensure23 that you're not violating the Voting Rights Act that24 seems to be one thing.25 JUSTICE KENNEDY:34But then it's a one­way￼1 ratchet.2 GENERAL VERRILLI:3 one­way ratchet, Your Honor, because you can move in4 both directions, just move precincts and not ­­ and not5 census blocks.6 JUSTICE ALITO: General, you say that the7 district court erred in addressing the claim of racial8 gerrymandering on a statewide rather than a9 district­specific basis. I would assume that that was10 an error on the part of the district court only if a11 district­specific claim was asserted by the plaintiffs,12 but you don't address that issue.13 GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. I'm happy to14 address it now, Your Honor. I actually think this is15 quite a murky question. I think, Your Honor ­­ we agree16 Your Honor is quite right that the district court did17 appear, and JSA 128 is the place where it seems clear18 that they did to19 statewide claim.20 why, because the21 influenced every22 on that basis.23 So it would24 would be to say that Shaw ­­ the proper understanding of25 Shaw is that claims have to be made on a35No, I don't think it is aappear, to assume that this was a  In some respects, one can understandbasic theory is that the motivedistrict and it did adjudicate the caseseem to me that one outcome here￼1 district­specific basis and that the plaintiffs here2 didn't ­­ didn't propound cognizable claims under Shaw3 and that would be one resolution here. But I have to4 say, the record is somewhat murky on this. Judge5 Thompson in dissent did say that he thought that the6 claims were district­by­district specific. Justice7 Kagan has identified some information in the record. So8 another option might be to articulate the correct9 district­specific standard and leave it to the district10 court on remand to sort out whether the plaintiff has11 his facts ­­12 JUSTICE KAGAN: But you don't deny that a13 statewide policy can refer to every district or every14 majority minority district in the State?15 GENERAL VERRILLI: No. No, we don't deny16 that, but that's not enough ­­ our point is that's not17 enough to trigger strict scrutiny. You have to look and18 see whether it's implemented in a manner that is in19 derogation of traditional districting criteria district20 by district.21 JUSTICE KAGAN: But again ­­ and I don't22 want to press it if you've given me your best answer to23 it ­­ if a policy says we're going to prioritize this24 particular criterion, which here was the mistaken25 understanding of retrogression, if a policy says, we're36￼1 going to prioritize this over everything else, it seems2 to me that that's pretty good evidence of a violation.3 GENERAL VERRILLI: Only if again ­­ I guess4 I am just going to repeat myself, but if it's in5 derogation of traditional districting criteria ­­6 JUSTICE KAGAN: But if the policy says that7 it's going to prioritize it over everything else, that8 means it going to be in derogation of tradition9 districting criteria.10 GENERAL VERRILLI: When they conflict ­­11 JUSTICE KAGAN: Sometimes they might fail.12 Sometimes you're not going to be able to prioritize it13 over everything else, but the intent is still to14 prioritize it over everything else.15 GENERAL VERRILLI: But the question is ­­16 let me take a step back because I think it might help to17 put it in this context.18 A challenge, a Shaw challenge, is a19 challenge to a facially neutral government action. The20 lines on the map are what are being challenged here.21 That's the government action. Those lines are facially22 neutral. They may, in fact, reflect a violation of the23 Constitution under Shaw if race predominated in the24 placement of those lines in derogation of traditional25 districting criteria. But that's what you've got to3725 GENERAL VERRILLI:Yes.￼1 prove, and the mere existence of this motive doesn't2 prove it for each district, and that's our point.3 If I could, I just would like to raise one4 point in my remaining time going back to the question of5 what Section 5 retrogression required. Mr. Chief6 Justice, you asked that question.7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And when you do that,8 will you also tell us what effect, if any, the9 preclearance should have.10 GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. So ­­ and the two11 are quite related. I think Professor Pildes referred12 you to this chart, but the key thing is to look at not13 the difference between 2001 and the current plan, but14 the difference between the 1993 plan and the 2001 plan.15 The Justice Department cleared the 2001 plan16 that Alabama submitted, and you will see for every17 single district listed there, with maybe one exception,18 there were significant reductions in the minority19 percentages in those districts. So Alabama knew20 perfectly well that it was completely consistent with21 its obligations under Section 5 to reduce the districts.22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You asked for a23 remand. The result of the remand may well be Alabama24 has to redistrict; is that right?38￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And when they do so, that would not be subject to Section 5, correct?     GENERAL VERRILLI:That's certainly correct.     CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:concern for you?GENERAL VERRILLI:for us. It is what it is, Mr. Chief Justice. If on remand the district court concludes that some of these districts violated the Constitution, then Alabama will have to ­­ the legislature will get its first chance to a legislate a fix and Section 5 won't be a basis for them to take any action.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.     Mr. Brasher.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. BRASHERON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTSMR. BRASHER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:     I think the Court should begin with thedistrict court's fact­finding, because the districtcourt expressly found that race did not predominate andthe Court can affirm on that basis and avoid addressingquestions about Section 5 and redistricting that areunlikely to arise again because of this Court's decision39Certainly correct.     And that's not aWell, it's not a concern￼1 in Shelby County.2 On page 144 of the jurisdictional statement3 appendix, the district court expressly found that we did4 not impose a quota. The court said that we imposed,5 quote, "no bright­line rule," and what the court meant6 is that we preserved the core of existing districts, we7 followed preexisting district lines, we followed roads,8 we followed county lines, municipal lines, we met the9 needs of incumbents, and we preserved communities of10 interest.11 The plan that we proposed ­­ the plan that12 we passed is a status quo plan. The whole point of this13 plan was to preserve the status quo because the14 Republican Party had won a majority in the legislature15 for first time in 130 years.16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the other side17 says it was impermissible for you to preserve the status18 quo because the opportunity for minority voters in the19 majority minority districts to participate in the20 electoral process had improved to the extent that21 maintaining the status quo would be characterized as22 packing.23 MR. BRASHER: Well, actually, if you look24 at ­­ well, two responses to that, Your Honor. The25 first is that if you look at the amicus brief filed in40￼1 support of neither party by political scientists, they2 show that black voter turnout and white voter turnout3 and registration actually equalized in 1998. So ­­ so4 there actually isn't some difference between the5 districts in 2010 and ­­ and the new ones that we6 propose with respect to those criteria.7 The second point, I guess, I would make to8 that is that our ­­ our redistricting criteria ­­ our9 nonracial redistricting criteria were coextensive with10 the objective here to preserve these majority­black11 districts as they have been. And what I mean is that12 the objective of these nonracial redistricting criteria13 was to preserve the status quo. And so I think that's14 what the United States Solicitor General was getting at,15 is that it's difficult to disentangle the notion that we16 should preserve the status quo with the majority­black17 districts.1819 read20 case21 on the basis that it was for partisan purposes, but that22 it was to comply with Section 5?23 MR. BRASHER: I don't ­­24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that ­­ is that a fair25 reading of the ­­ A, of the red brief and, B, of what41JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is ­­ is it fair to ­­ to the pleadings and ­­ and the submissions in thisas saying that the State did not defend this plan25 MR. BRASHER:I do not believe that is a￼1 the district court found?2 MR. BRASHER: I don't think it's a fair3 reading of either, Your Honor, and this is the reason4 why. Certainly, with respect to specific districts5 here, when they were actually challenged, we were able6 to respond and say this was for partisan political7 reasons. One of those districts, for example, was8 Senate District 11, which was specifically challenged by9 the Alabama Democratic Conference, and the district10 court held that the changes to that district were based11 on politics.12 Now, with respect to the plan as a whole,13 our response has always been that there is a lot of14 factors that went into drawing the plan as a whole and15 when it's drawing any specific district. And I think16 it's important here that the Plaintiffs have never17 proposed a redistricting plan that actually meets our18 race­neutral redistricting criteria, especially the19 2 percent deviation in population that the legislature20 adopted. And I think that's important for three21 reasons.22 JUSTICE KAGAN: Are you really saying that23 that's a pleading requirement, that they have to come in24 with a plan that meets all the rest of your criteria?42￼1 pleading requirement. I believe it's an evidentiary2 issue and I think the Court held that much in Cromartie.3 And I think it's important for three reasons. First,4 the legislature adopted that 2 percent deviation to end5 the previous partisan gerrymander that the Democrats6 adopted in 2001, where they systematically7 underpopulated majority­black districts and8 overpopulated majority­white districts in Republican9 areas of the State, and that's why the Plaintiff's10 brought a partisan gerrymandering claim in the district11 court below.12 And the second reason is what I was alluding13 to earlier, and that's in Easley v. Cromartie, the Court14 held that the first step of a racial gerrymandering15 claim is to show that there's some conceivable way to do16 this differently that creates greater racial balance.17 And the facts that they ­­ they've never produced a plan18 that actually does that is a serious problem. And that19 makes sense, because if you want to see if race was20 predominant in redistricting, you take race out and then21 you run it again and you see what happens.22 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Brasher, I mean, let me23 just give you some numbers here from ­­ from some of24 these districts. Right? HD 52, you needed to add 114525 African Americans in order to maintain the percentage of43￼1 African­American voters, which was your number 22 criterion. You added 1143. You missed by 2. HD 55,3 you needed to add 6981. You added 6994. SD 23, 15,069.4 You hit at 15,185.5 I mean, those numbers speak for themselves,6 don't they? That in each of these cases, you were7 determined, come what may and disregarding other8 criteria, to maintain the black voting age population.9 MR. BRASHER: I don't think that shows that10 for two reasons. First, I agree with the United States11 Solicitor General that the question here is whether we12 subordinated race­neutral redistricting criteria to hit13 these targets.14 JUSTICE KAGAN: That was just a coincidence?15 MR. BRASHER: No. But that goes to my16 second point, is those House districts that you were17 reading off are in the City of Birmingham. The City of18 Birmingham has over 200,000 people in it, 73 percent19 black.20 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, it's 73 percent, and21 you hit that 73 percent exactly.22 MR. BRASHER: Well, and that's my point.23 There are at least going to be some of those House24 districts in Birmingham that are 73 percent black and I25 do not believe that in a place where there's more than44￼1 200,000 people and 73 percent of them are black you need2 to subordinate race­neutral redistricting criteria to3 draw a 73 percent black district.4 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I think you kind of do5 actually, because, I mean, you're trying to repopulate6 these districts, and many of these districts, yes, there7 are many, many, many African Americans. But as you just8 suggested, there are also white people. And you did it9 so that you, you know, completely replicated the exact10 percentage figure.11 MR. BRASHER:Well, I'll give you another mean. House District 67, which we briefs, is a single­county district.12 example of what I13 talk about in our14 It's always been a single­county district. It's a15 single­county district in our plan, and it's a16 single­county district in every plan that the Plaintiffs17 propose. And it's always going to be 70 percent black18 because that county is 70 percent black.19 And I think the same thing could be said20 about many of the neighborhoods in Birmingham, is that21 these neighborhoods are 73 percent black and that's how22 we hit the numbers. And they certainly haven't proven23 otherwise.24 I also think that the 2 percent ­­ the25 failure to propose a 2 percent plan is important because45￼1 a 10 percent plan, the plans that they actually have2 proposed, are drastically different from a 2 percent3 plan. It's like comparing a plan with 100 districts to4 one with only 80 districts. Their Senate districts can5 vary by 14,000 people, and ours can only vary by around6 2,000 people.7 And ­­ but even though these ­­ these plans8 are drastically different with respect to the criteria9 that the legislature adopted here, many of their10 districts have exactly the same black population11 percentage as our districts. This is clearest if you12 look at on page 36 of our brief where we lay out the13 Senate districts and their own proposed plans next to14 the Senate districts and our proposed plan. And you'll15 look and you'll see Senate District 18, 19, 20, some of16 the Senate districts that Justice Kagan was talking17 about earlier, are almost exactly the same in all three18 plans.19 If you look at Senate District 33, it's20 exactly the same in our plan and in the Black Caucus's21 proposed plan. The evidence was that the only way you22 could draw Senate District 33 with a different black23 population percentage ­­24 JUSTICE KENNEDY:25 Senate District 26?46What about District ­­￼1 MR. BRASHER: Senate District 26 was above2 70 percent black in the previous plan and it's above3 70 percent black in our plan and in the Black Caucus's4 plan. Now, it's not exactly on target, but the5 Plaintiffs testified in this case that the area of6 Montgomery City that we're talking about here is7 99 percent black.8 And because that was one of the Senate9 districts that they actually challenged, we have10 actually good­faith credibility determination from the11 trial court because the drafters actually testified12 about why they made the changes to Senate District 2613 they made, and they said that because of the way14 populations shifted, they had to change an adjoining15 district, Senate District 30, which required changes16 to ­­ to all of the rest of the districts. And that17 left a county, sort of an orphan county, Crenshaw18 County, that is a rural county south of Montgomery.19 They explained that what they did is they took part of20 Senate ­­ former Senate District 26, took it out to make21 a way to connect the rural Crenshaw County to the rest22 of Senate District 25, which is already predominantly23 rural.24 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the Solicitor General25 just said that if you look at that district, it has a47￼1 very bizarre shape and the effect of the bizarre shape2 is to pull in predominantly African­American areas and3 exclude predominantly white areas. Is he correct on4 that?5 MR. BRASHER: Actually, I respectfully6 disagree with him about that. I ­­ if you look at the7 comparison map, it's in the Joint Appendix on 197, you8 can see a comparison between the former district and the9 current district. And what you'll see is up at the10 right ­­ I'm sorry, the ­­ let me try and orient11 myself ­­ the left ­­ the left part of Montgomery12 County, that's where the former district used to be. It13 was part of Senate District 25 that came into the middle14 of that district, sort of a ­­ kind of came in the15 middle of it. And what the drafters did here is they16 drew the lines closer to the City of Montgomery, and17 they preserved that part of Senate District 25 that came18 in the middle of it. What they ­­ the only thing they19 did is they took some precincts and some parts of20 precincts, kind of along those lines, and they moved21 them 2223 that24 didn't just move black voters into that district. We25 also moved Hispanic voters into that district, we movedfrom Senate District 25 to Senate District 26. And I want to also just correct somethingthe ­­ my friend the Solicitor General said. We48￼1 white voters into that2 that ­­3 JUSTICE KAGAN:4 usually in these cases5 funny­shaped districts6 from the shape and from other matters whether race has7 been used instead of traditional districting criteria.8 But this is a very sort ­­ you know, sort of sui generis9 Shaw claim, because here the principal evidence in the10 case is not all the circumstantial stuff that we usually11 do. It's a policy statement from the State that says12 race non­retrogression is going to be our principal13 criterion except for Reynolds, and then a clear14 testimony from the people who were applying that policy15 statement that they thought that that meant maintaining16 the black voting age population, something which is a17 mistaken understanding of what retrogression entails.18 But, you know, you don't have to look at all19 the circumstantial evidence about the shape of districts20 when you have a policy statement from the State saying21 this is our number one criterion except for Reynolds and22 this is how we understand it in such a way that it's23 going to ensure that a 68 percent district stays a24 68 percent district and a 52 percent district stays a25 52 percent district and so on.49district. We made changes to      Mr. ­­ Mr. Brasher, I mean,you're looking at theseand you're trying to figure out￼1 MR. BRASHER: Well, just two quick responses2 to that, Justice Kagan. And the first is that the State3 is always going to say that complying with Federal law4 was a top priority because Federal law is supreme. And5 so if simply ­­6 JUSTICE KAGAN: But this is much more than7 that. This is very specific saying where the ­­ the ­­8 the two legislators principally in charge of this said9 this is what we understand the requirements are, that10 we're going to maintain the black voting age population11 in each district.12 MR. BRASHER: Well, that brings me to my13 second point, which is that imagine had we done the same14 thing that the plaintiffs are suggesting, and we had15 hired a political scientist to tell us that 55 percent16 should be the target. I don't think that we could say17 race predominated in that circumstance, just because we18 had a different target. And so I think they are19 bringing effectively a circumstantial case here. They20 have the fact that we said that this was our objective21 under Section 5 ­­22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, Justice Kagan's23 question points up the fact that the defenders of this24 plan did not rely on the fact that it was a political25 gerrymander and, of course, they said it was the50￼1 2 percent call, but the basis was race in order to2 comply with Section 5.3 MR. BRASHER: And my point about that is4 certainly with respect to specific districts, they were5 based on partisanship, and so had they challenged6 specific districts, we would have responded in kind with7 respect to those specific districts. But they never8 challenged specific districts below.9 And I think to answer Justice Alito's10 question, to my friends on the other side, I think you11 should look at document 194 which is the Black Caucus'12 posttrial brief. And although they certainly mention an13 occasional specific district, they didn't have any14 evidence. I guess this goes back to Justice Kagan's15 question. This is a circumstantial case because the16 only evidence ­­17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that there was18 considerable evidence on Senate District 26.19 MR. BRASHER: Senate District 26 was20 challenged by the Alabama Democratic Conference, which21 has now not brought a Shaw claim with respect to22 district 26. And because they specifically challenged23 that district, you actually have, like I said, a24 credibility determination by the district court about25 the testimony with respect to that specific district.51￼1 JUSTICE GINSBURG:2 Section 5 mistake. Isn't it so that both the district3 court and Alabama were laboring under the impression4 that retrogression meant you have to keep the same5 numbers?6 MR. BRASHER: The district court made an7 express fact­finding here that our goal was to prevent8 substantial reductions in black population in the9 preexisting majority black districts.10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And if that's a11 misunderstanding of what Section 5 requires, then the12 whole thing is infected by that mistake.13 MR. BRASHER: Well, I disagree with you14 respectfully about it being a misunderstanding, because15 I think in 2006, Congress told us that we could not16 diminish the ability to elect a black voters in a17 preexisting majority black district.18 My friend, Professor Pildes, testified19 against the inclusion of that language in Congress, and20 he told them that if they included that language, it21 would "lock into place" the majority black districts in22 the South. If you cannot diminish the ability to elect,23 that means if there's a safe majority black district24 where there's a 100 percent chance that black voters can25 elect their candidates of choice, you cannot drop that52Let me ask you about this￼1 to where they simply have a 50 percent chance, or a 602 percent chance. And that was what we were setting out3 to do. And this Court said that States get leeway in4 complying with Section 5 and the Equal Protection Clause,5 that we do not have to hit things right on the dot.6 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Brasher, I guess I don't7 understand your response to Justice Ginsburg. I mean,8 there are different interpretations of what those 20069 amendments mean, right? Under one interpretation, it10 was basically a codification of Justice Souter's11 opinion, and so majority minority districts could be12 transformed into influence districts.13 On another stricter interpretation, perhaps,14 no majority minority districts had to stay majority15 minority districts. But in no interpretation does a 7616 percent district have to stay a 76 percent district when17 circumstances change and when the ability to elect18 candidates of one's choice does not require it.19 MR. BRASHER: Well, this is what Justice20 Souter said in his dissent in Georgia v. Ashcroft. He21 said, "If racial elements consistently vote in separate22 blocks," which it's conceded that they do in Alabama,23 "decreasing the proportion of black voters will24 generally reduce the chance that the minority group's25 favored candidate would be elected."5321 that 2223 This24 don't know that that statement should automatically25 disqualify his plan. Maybe we should look a little￼1 The majority opinion in Georgia v. Ashcroft2 agreed with that as well. And the district court in3 Georgia v. Ashcroft, which I think that Congress was4 trying to go back to, said, "If existing opportunities5 of minority voters to exercise their franchise are6 robust, a proposed plan that leaves those voters with7 merely a reasonable or fair chance of electing a8 candidate of choice may constitute retrogression."9 And the testimony from the plaintiffs' own10 expert here was that majority black districts in Alabama11 that are only 55 percent black would only give those12 voters a reasonable opportunity to elect.13 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose we, I don't know, I14 want to know what you think about the practicalities of15 sending this back. Assume ­­ assume in the back of my16 mind just relying on State policy is this. A State17 legislator gets up and says, in our State, there's a18 history of discrimination against black people. There19 are very few black representatives in this body. I20 would like to find a way of drawing district lines sowe have a few more. Okay?That's the normal way this case comes up.is an obverse and odd situation. All right. I541 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425further into it and see what they actually did. Suppose I start there. And then I say,okay, you go proceed district by district. I suspect they will be able to prove that at least in some districts, at least in some, the statement of the legislator here did prevail and did make a difference.Now, if that's so, they don't have Section 5to rely on as a defense. So I don't know what the defense is possibly going to be. And since we can't even think what the defense is, why don't they just redo this plan over in the legislature and save everybody a lot of time and trouble. What's your response to that?MR. BRASHER: There are a couple of responses. The first is, I think ­­MR. BRASHER:Well, to respond to that￼     JUSTICE SCALIA:trouble to redo a plan.MR. BRASHER:     JUSTICE BREYER:is you want to go to that lot of trouble before a lot ofextra trouble in court proceedings, or do you want to goto that trouble right off the bat and get it over with?I expect you'd have an answer to that, andI'm not taking a point of view. I just want to know what your response is.55    I thought it was a lot ofIs it not a lot of trouble?It is a lot of trouble.   So my point of my question￼1 pointed question, this plan was passed after 21 hearings2 held throughout the State of Alabama. It was passed3 after extensive legislative negotiations. It was passed4 in a special session of the Alabama legislature that was5 called for purposes of enacting a redistricting plan.6 So we do not want to go back through that process ­­7 JUSTICE BREYER: Of course you don't, but my8 question is, is there going to be a defense left that9 could stop you from having to go back?10 MR. BRASHER:11 JUSTICE BREYER:12 MR. BRASHER:13 agrees with me that the question here is whether there14 was a strong basis in evidence for us to believe at the15 time that we passed this plan that we had to comply with16 Section 5, and I think we have that defense, even if we17 are litigating district by district. But let me ­­18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What does it mean to19 comply with Section 5? And that's where you can say it20 strongly ­­ it complies ­­ everybody agrees that that21 counts, compliance with Section 5, strong interest in22 doing that. But if you think Section 5 means you got to23 preserve the same numbers and that's not what Section 524 means, then the whole premise on which the district25 court based its decision was wrong.56Yes. What?I think the United States1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. BRASHER: Well, I don't think so, because I think the district court's decision was premised on the fact that race was not the predominant factor in this plan. But to go to that question about Section 5, we adopted a very reasonable Section 5 preclearance strategy here. It was the exact same thing that Georgia did in 2005 and that Congress said in the House report when it reauthorized Section 5 in 2006 ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: If that turns out to be wrong, I guess you're still not guilty of using race. You're still trying to comply with Section 5 as opposed to being racist; right?MR. BRASHER: That's exactly right. They did make intentional discrimination claims in the district court ­­     JUSTICE KENNEDY:that race was not thedistrict     MR.need forpurpose.                      If the district court said             purpose of this plan, what in thecourt's viewBRASHER:a district court to identify any one specific     JUSTICE KENNEDY:what did they say?     MR. BRASHER:     JUSTICE KENNEDY:    I'm asking in this case,Yes.    Was it the presumption￼was the purpose of the plan?     Well, I don't think there's a576 MR. BRASHER:7 JUSTICE KENNEDY:8 distinction.9 MR. BRASHER:Well, it was certainly ­­    That's a very fine￼1 that they wanted to assure preclearance under Section 52 and for that reason used race? So when you say the3 district court said, well, race was not the purpose, it4 was close to the purpose because they were trying to use5 Section 5 and use race for that reason.It was certainly a purpose 10 that went into the majority black districts, but it was11 not the predominant motive in the way these laws were12 drafted.13 JUSTICE SCALIA:14 to comply with Section 5?151617 with 181920 race21 Section 5 required you to maintain a 78 percent district22 and a 78 percent district was no longer needed with23 respect to a group's ability to elect a candidate of24 choice.25 MR.

BRASHER: There is not.JUSTICE KAGAN: But you don't have to usein this way, Mr. Brasher.Nobody would say thatDon't you have to use raceThat's right.   Is there any way to complyWell, I respectfully disagree￼1 with that. And once again, we followed the same2 preclearance strategy that Georgia followed in 2005.3 And that Congress ­­ remember, Congress made a record in4 2006 to try to reauthorize Section 5 and part of that5 record was them saying that Georgia's plan from 2005,6 which kept all of their majority black districts exactly7 the same was a good thing. We did the same thing in8 this redistricting cycle that other States did in this9 redistricting cycle. We actually did the same thing10 that the plaintiffs did when they were in charge of the11 legislature in 2001. There's been some inconsistency on12 that. The only difference is they tried to hit targets13 from the 1993 plan as they were in 1993, and we simply14 tried to keep the districts the same from 2010 to 2012.15 JUSTICE ALITO: Could I follow up on16 Justice Breyer's exploration of what would happen if17 this was done over?

BRASHER: That is correct.JUSTICE ALITO: And to what degree would or could ­­ to what degree would the legislature be justified in doing and to what degree would it be required to take into account the degree, if any, to which Section 2 imposes something like a retrogression requirement?MR. BRASHER:     JUSTICE ALITO:might be?     MR. BRASHER:how Section 2 would necessarily apply in thiscircumstance because by complying with Section 5 here,we ­­ we necessarily complied with Section 2 becauseit's a lesser standard.     But I do think that it's ­­ the fact that wecould have done, if we ­­ if the plans are vacated, theyare very likely to just be the same plansreauthorized ­­JUSTICE ALITO: What would happen if you ­­ if you're ­­ if on a do­over, the objective was to produce maximum Republican representation in both houses of the legislature. And the way in ­­ and in doing that, there was a drastic reduction in the number of African­American senators and representatives. Would60Well, I think ­­  Do we know what thatI really honestly do not know￼1 that be a violation of Section 2?2 MR. BRASHER: Not necessarily. There would,3 obviously, be a lot more that would go into that4 analysis whether that violated Section 2. You'd have to5 look at each individual district and see if they can6 make a Section 2 claim. I mean, one of the issues in7 this case is that this plan actually gives proportional8 representation to black voters in Alabama. There are9 about 25 percent black voting age population in Alabama,10 and they have about 25 majority black districts in the11 House and about 20 ­­ I'm sorry, about 25 percent12 majority black districts in the House and about 2513 percent majority black districts in the Senate. And so14 this is ­­ this plan meets Section 2 in that regard in15 the sense that it gives proportional representation.16 But I do not know what would happen, quite17 frankly, if this ­­ if the Court were to vacate these18 plans and the legislature were to just do a do­over.19 And I would ­­ to go back to the 2 percent20 deviation, these are very sophisticated parties21 other side of this case with very sophisticated22 The reason they've never proposed any way to do23 following our own race­neutral redistricting criteria is24 because they know that the 2 percent deviation here25 prevents them from gerrymandering districts to help61on thecounsel.this7 10 percent deviation8 And then we had9 them to come up withplans in the legislature.a year of litigation forown 2 percent plan, and they ­­￼1 white Democrats get elected because it would be very2 simple. The 2 percent deviation was adopted at the very3 beginning of this redistricting process, so the4 plaintiffs had a year, while they were on the committee,5 the reapportionment committee, to come up with their own6 2 percent plan. And instead, they just proposed these10 they didn't do that.11 was getting at when the district court said that ­­ you12 know, the district court said race did not predominate13 because we followed race­neutral redistricting criteria,14 and then the district court suggested, you know what,15 you know what this case is really about, it's about the16 2 percent population deviation. Because ­­17 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Brasher, you're18 suggesting that there's some necessity for a 2 percent19 plan, but there is no necessity for a 2 percent plan.20 States have routinely gone up to 10 percent without21 getting into trouble under Reynolds. So that can't22 insulate your plan from this kind of challenge, can it?23 MR. BRASHER: Well, I think it can, and for24 this reason, is because we're in charge of adopting our25 race­neutral redistricting criteria. And under Easley,62And that's what the district court￼1 if the plaintiffs want to prove that race predominated2 in a plan, the first step of that, and certainly the3 easiest way to do it, is to propose some other way of4 meeting race­neutral redistricting criteria that5 provides greater racial balance.6 And they haven't proposed any way to do7 that, and the plans that they did propose, even though8 they are 10 percent plans, are very, very similar in9 many of these majority black districts. So not only10 have they not proposed a 2 percent plan that's our11 criteria, but they actually ­­ the plans they did12 propose are not ­­ not that different.13 I think at the very least, the fact that the14 plaintiffs have never proposed any way to do this15 redistricting that actually meets the State's16 race­neutral redistricting criteria underscores that you17 cannot find that the district courts fact­finding here18 was clearly erroneous, that race did not predominate,19 and I think the Court should affirm on that basis.20 Let me address the question of remand for a21 second here. The United States has said that the Court22 should remand this case. But the United States'23 position on that is internally inconsistent because the24 United States agrees that the population percentages25 alone in the districts are not sufficient for the63￼1 Plaintiffs to have met their burden of proof to show2 that race predominated.3 But that's the only evidence they introduced4 about these districts, and that's why the district court5 said, to the best that I can tell, these are statewide6 challenges because the only evidence in the record,7 whatever they may have said, the only evidence in the8 record about these districts was just population9 statistics.10 JUSTICE BREYER: You'd look at the ­­ you'd11 look at the complaint, when I look at the complaint, I12 suspect I'll find something about districts. It's13 certainly true that, sort of taking the US point of14 view, the ­­ it's quite clear the ­­ to me anyway, that15 the court decided on the basis of a statewide plan. So16 if it's wrong about that, then they ought to have a17 chance to go back18 district and have19 MR. BRASHER:20 don't think ­­ they may have brought claims with respect21 to each individual district. I don't think they do. I22 think if you look at the complaint, you won't find that.23 But even if they did, the only evidence that24 they introduced about any of these districts are the25 statistics alone, and the United States agrees with me64and make their claim district bya decision on that basis.Well ­­ and once again, I1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that that's insufficient for them to have met their burden of proof. So I don't see how you could reverse the district's fact­finding as clearly erroneous that race didn't predominant, given that all they introduced was statistics.     I think The Court should affirm on the basisof the fact­finding and not reach questions aboutSection 5.     Unless the Court has any other questions,that ends my ­­ thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.     Professor Pildes, you have two minutesremaining.    REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD PILDES      ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTMR. PILDES: Thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice.     If I can, I'd like to address ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is he right on that last point? Earlier, one of the two of you said that if you looked at the division of precincts, it was done on the basis of this policy in almost every district. Was that shown below?MR. PILDES: We introduced all of that precinct splitting information below and in our proposed65￼￼1 findings of fact, Document Number 196, some of which is2 reproduced in one of the briefs. We made exactly this3 point, yes, Your Honor.4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What other ­­ besides5 the statistics, what other evidence did you present?6 MR. PILDES: Your Honor, we ­­7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I can go back to the8 Joint Appendix, but I just want a summary of it from9 you.10 MR. PILDES: Your Honor, the key fact we11 presented, I think, that hasn't been discussed here is12 that the Alabama Constitution prohibits the splitting of13 counties. And they say they had a Supremacy Clause14 obligation to meet these racial targets, and that meant15 they could override the Alabama's ­­ the Alabama16 Constitution's protection of county boundaries and all17 other State traditional districting principles.18 And the 2 percent rule works the same way.19 If that's actually a Federal constitutional requirement,20 they can also override the key protections against21 partisan gerrymandering. The very that few exist, the22 only hard constraints, the county boundaries are23 political subdivision boundaries, and it means they can24 manipulate the all­important county delegations in the25 Alabama legislature by breaking counties into multiple66￼1 districts and then deciding who runs the county by2 putting their district in there.3 Now, a second question we answered that I4 think has been very important in this discussion ­­ and,5 by the way, I don't want to lose track of the fact that6 on remand, the Alabama legislature will have to comply7 with the whole county provisions, or at least they can't8 use this Federal excuse to split them.9 The way most States do this is they either10 start with traditional districting principles in the11 core of existing districts and they look to see at the12 end have we maintained the same number of13 majority­minority districts, or if they start with a14 number at the beginning, which they're not required to,15 they ask what's necessary in current conditions to16 preserve the ability to elect today.17 That's what Alabama did in its 200118 submissions. It actually said that the number for the19 ability to elect was a 55 percent black voting age20 population. That's in its official submissions to the21 United States.22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.23 The case is submitted.24 (Whereupon, at 11:15 a.m., the case in the25 above­entitled
