John - Joseph R. Ramirez.Mr. Cordray.ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. CORDRAYON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. CORDRAY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court:I'd like to reserve 2 minutes of my time forrebuttal. This case concerns a mistaken description on the face of a judicial warrant that the court of appeals held deprived Agent Groh of qualified immunity, subjecting him to personal liability for damages in this Bivens action. The Ninth Circuit reached this result despite the fact that the record here shows Agent Groh's manifest good faith and reasonable course of conduct, including three key points.First, the record shows that the affidavit and application submitted to the magistrate were sufficient and comprehensive. Second, the magistrate personally reviewed and approved the application and expressly referenced the affidavit in the warrant he issued. And third, the search as executed conformed to the limits set3, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425out in the affidavit and -QUESTION: Mr. Cordray, what does theConstitution provide specifically about this?MR. CORDRAY: The Constitution provides thatindividuals will not be subject to unreasonable searches and seizures and that warrants will not issue except upon probable cause, and stating with particularity the items to - place to be searched, items to be seized.QUESTION: With regard to that last phrase, why don't we just apply it?MR. CORDRAY: I think you do apply it in this case and this warrant here -QUESTION: But the warrant refers to the house. MR. CORDRAY: Yes.QUESTION: It doesn't list anything that theywere searching for.MR. CORDRAY: The warrant itself - and if we turnto the petition for certiorari appendix, page 26a, specifically references the affidavit. The affidavit, application, and draft warrant form were submitted to the magistrate as one package. They were reviewed by the magistrate and resulted in an issuance of authority to search -QUESTION: Who prepared the warrant?MR. CORDRAY: The draft of the warrant form4, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425itself was done initially by Agent Groh. It was then signed and executed by the magistrate who approved it.QUESTION: Well, but on its face it referred to the house, not the items being looked for.MR. CORDRAY: It did, and that's the mistaken description on the face of the warrant. If you look at the application and -QUESTION: Well, you know, why not just apply the constitutional provision? I mean, why couldn't the agent be responsible for checking the warrant?MR. CORDRAY: Well, I - I think there's two questions there. I think if you - if you apply the constitutional provision here, the warrant here specifically references the affidavit. The magistrate says, I am satisfied, page 26a -QUESTION: But the affidavit was not attached to the warrant.MR. CORDRAY: It was attached to the warrant, accompanied the warrant when - when the materials went to the magistrate for approval - it was -QUESTION: Yeah, but not - not when it was taken to be executed.MR. CORDRAY: It - it also accompanied the warrant when the officers were briefed on the nature of the search. It did not accompany the warrant at the scene5, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 because it was placed under seal by the court, which is2 done routinely in many cases for - for a variety of3 important law enforcement purposes. But here -4 QUESTION: It - it - it seems to me that at - at5 some point in this analysis of - and specifically on the6 point that you're addressing with Justice O'Connor - that7 you have to confront the language in - in Leon in which8 the Court said, depending on the circumstances of the9 particular case, a warrant may be facially - so facially10 deficient that it cannot comply with the Leon rule. I was11 reading your - your brief and kind of waiting with12 suspense for you to address this point and it only comes13 up at the last few pages of the reply brief and you say14 it's a dictum. I think you have answers to the - to the15 point, but it seems to me rather central for what you're16 discussing right here. This was in one sense of the word17 facially deficient, no - no question about that.18 MR. CORDRAY: Yes, although this Court has -19 QUESTION: And it might be that the Sheppard case20 is what helps you, but -21 MR. CORDRAY: I think it does, Your Honor. The22 Sheppard case makes clear - footnote 7, the Court says23 that if the warrant says, has some sort of suitable words24 of reference, see attached affidavit or see affidavit,25 that you then can move beyond the four corners of the6, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425paper itself and look to the materials that are part of the document or your record in front of the magistrate that are subject to subsequent judicial review, and the contents of the affidavit can inform the contents of the warrant.QUESTION: Mr. Cordray -QUESTION: Well, did - did the warrant here and the warrant in Sheppard, were they on all fours insofar as a cross-reference?MR. CORDRAY: They were on all fours in two respects. First of all, the warrant in Sheppard was facially defective. It said that you would search for controlled substances. In fact, they were searching for evidence of homicide investigation.QUESTION: Right, almost as bad as the mistakehere.MR. CORDRAY: Yeah, in - in some ways worse, because it specified the search for different evidence. Here at least on the face of the warrant it's clear that there's some sort of discrepancy, and you can inform that by looking at the affidavit -QUESTION: But did the Massachusetts case have a cross-reference to an affidavit even though the affidavit wasn't appended?MR. CORDRAY: It did not, in fact, and the Court7, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 said that if it had contained some sort of cross-2 reference, then you could inform the contents of the3 warrant from the contents of the affidavit. That's what4 we believe -5 QUESTION: But doesn't it make sense to assume6 that the cross-reference has to be capable of informing of7 what is left out? And in this case, number one, there is8 nothing attached to the warrant. No one reading the9 warrant could possibly figure out what within this house10 was - was being searched for.11 MR. CORDRAY: I think that's -12 QUESTION: And once again I guess I go back to13 Justice O'Connor's question. Why don't we apply the - the14 Fourth Amendment the way it's written, and it says that15 the warrant shall particularly describe, not some other16 document under seal.17 MR. CORDRAY: I - I think that that's not true in18 the important respects under the Fourth Amendment. The19 affidavit was part of the documents given to the20 magistrate for prior judicial approval -21 QUESTION: The Fourth Amendment says it's the22 warrant that is supposed to particularly describe, not￼23 documents 2425 differentgiven to a magistrate.MR. CORDRAY: What I'm saying is there are three potential times that matter here. One is prior8, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 judicial approval of the search. The warrant and2 application and affidavit were all together to the3 magistrate. Second, in informing the officers of how to4 conduct the search, which they did here in accordance with5 the constraints, the - the material was provided to the6 officers. The third question is whether the homeowner at7 the scene has some independent constitutional right to see8 the warrant and the supporting materials before a search9 can proceed. This Court has never held that that's a10 constitutional requirement and would be flatly11 inconsistent with criminal -12 QUESTION: Whether - whether the homeowner has13 the right or whether the point is to make sure that the14 officers executing the warrant can check what's in front15 of them and find out how far to go, the fact remains that16 the Fourth Amendment says the warrant is supposed to17 particularly describe. This didn't, it had no document18 appended to it that did.19 MR. CORDRAY: That's not correct, Your Honor.20 This warrant specifically references the affidavit and the21 affidavit accompanied to the magistrate and to the22 officers before they searched -23 QUESTION: It may refer to it, but if it's not24 there, nobody can figure out what it says.25 MR. CORDRAY: Well, they can, in fact, because9, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 the documented record before the magistrate allows2 posterior judicial oversight of how the search -3 QUESTION: Not when the police are at the scene4 they can't.5 MR. CORDRAY: That is correct. At the scene -6 the Ninth Circuit made a fundamental flaw in its opinion.7 It assumed that the Fourth Amendment is about allowing8 homeowners at the scene to -9 QUESTION: It doesn't have to make that10 assumption in - in order to apply the Fourth Amendment as11 written.12 the point13 sure that14 could go.15It could perfectly well make the assumption that of the Fourth Amendment description was to make the officers at the scene knew how far theyMR. CORDRAY: Correct. And they had the warrant, 16 affidavit, and application -￼17 QUESTION: But there's some might not - some18 might not have been like the officer here, like Officer19 Groh, might not have even seen the attached affidavit. On20 the face of this, this does look like the hated general21 warrant. It says, here's a house and there's no bounds at22 all, so it looks like this is exactly what the Fourth23 Amendment was getting at. And with respect to Sheppard, I24 had a question, maybe you can straighten me out on that.25 Sheppard said the good-faith exception applies, but to10, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 apply - apply an exception, wouldn't you need to have a2 Fourth Amendment violation in the first place?3 MR. CORDRAY: This was a subject of discussion in4 Sheppard. The separate opinion by Justice Stevens states5 specifically, and presents an argument for why the Fourth6 Amendment was not violated in that case. The majority was7 willing to assume a violation on the record before it,8 didn't specifically decide the Fourth Amendment question9 but assumed such a violation and went on to apply the good10 faith -1112 question, 131415 question? 161718 Why do you have to establish, as you seem to be trying to19 establish, that this complied with the Fourth Amendment,20 which, if you read the Fourth Amendment, it clearly21 didn't. But what we're discussing here is what is the22 remedy for its failure to comply with the Fourth23 Amendment, aren't we?24 MR. CORDRAY: Well -25 QUESTION: If - if I disagree with you that there11, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005QUESTION: So that - that case doesn't answer the was there a Fourth Amendment violation?MR. CORDRAY: I would agree with you that - QUESTION: And why do you have to ask that￼MR. CORDRAY: Beg your pardon?QUESTION: Why do you have to ask that question?1 - that there is a Fourth Amendment violation, do I have to2 find that3 hold - to45 agree with Justice Ginsburg's point that Sheppard is6 probably more germane to the qualified immunity inquiry7 here than perhaps to the Fourth Amendment inquiry, given8 that the Court did not explicitly decide the Fourthit was proper as a remedy for that violation to hold this agent liable?MR. CORDRAY: Certainly not, Your Honor, and I do9 Amendment issue in Sheppard. But here, we would say that10 qualified immunity applies on two distinct grounds.11 First, the Court has adverted in Malley v. Briggs, it12 wasn't a specific holding, that if in fact the conduct of13 the officers is such that the good-faith Leon exception14 would apply in a criminal suppression hearing then, in15 parallel, qualified immunity should apply in a civil16 action against the officer. That would be one ground for17 finding qualified immunity here and a sufficient ground.18 In addition, if the law was not clearly19 established at the time that - a number of points that the20 Ninth Circuit decided for the first time in this case -21 that the warrant cannot, by suitable words of reference,22 incorporate the contents of the affidavit. Number two,23 that the officers are obliged constitutionally after a24 warrant issues to double check the magistrate's handiwork25 and correct any errors that they find. And number three,12, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 that they cannot at the scene, as Agent Groh attempted2 reasonably to do here, inform the homeowner of exactly3 what the nature of the search was. It was done verbally4 in person with the wife and over the telephone with the5 husband, and -6 QUESTION: Well, you - you say, the Ninth Circuit7 said they couldn't inform the homeowner?8 MR. CORDRAY: Said that that would not be9 sufficient to - to correct -1011 have, but12 homeowner13 did it not?14 MR. CORDRAY: Didn't specifically hold that, but15 certainly seemed to presume it, that the - not only the16 warrant but all the supporting materials so that the17 homeowner could exercise some self-help right at the18 scene, block the officers, and attempt to interfere with19 their execution of -20 QUESTION: The Ninth -21 QUESTION: What do the Federal rules say about22 the - what the police or the officers have to do with the23 warrant in the search of a house?24 MR. CORDRAY: Criminal Rule 41, which this Court25 has said incorporates or is certainly consistent with13, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005QUESTION: Yeah, it didn't say that they couldn't it's - it's - the Ninth Circuit said that the had a right to be shown the warrant, I take it,￼1 Fourth Amendment principles, says that a warrant needs to2 be left at the scene after a search is completed if3 property is taken along with an inventory of the property.4 There's no suggestion the rule does not require the5 warrant be given to the homeowners at the outset as6 as they're reasonably informed -7 QUESTION: Doesn't it talk - or correct me8 wrong - about serving the warrant?long if I'm of9 MR. CORDRAY: It - it talks about a number10 things. It talks about obtaining a warrant, keeping a11 documentary record in front of the magistrate so that12 subsequent judicial review is available. It also talks13 about executing the warrant at the - at the scene. If the14 Court wishes to refer to Criminal Rule 41, it's been15 amended a couple of times, I believe the current version16 is 41(f) -17 QUESTION: Where is that in the papers?18 MR. CORDRAY: It's not in the documents here. I19 apologize, Your Honor. But 41(f)(3), it's referred to in20 the Solicitor General's brief and in our brief, is that21 they must give a copy of the warrant, receipt for the22 property taken, after the search is completed, but not23 before the search begins, and that makes a great deal of24 sense. The Fourth Amendment is about making sure that25 there is - there is prior judicial authority to proceed14￼, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425with a search and that there is documentation available later to check the search and make sure it did not exceed the authority -QUESTION: You mentioned the later documentation, but isn't there an interest in letting the homeowner know that the man has authority to make the search?MR. CORDRAY: Yes, which Agent Groh -QUESTION: So, shouldn't - shouldn't he have to display it if - if requested?MR. CORDRAY: I believe that if - if he's asked for the warrant before he can enter, what would be reasonable in the circumstances would be to show the warrant.QUESTION: And he'd have a duty to do that?MR. CORDRAY: I - I believe that in many cases that would be the most reasonable thing, and therefore perhaps the Constitution would have required it.QUESTION: That's not my question. Would he have a duty to do that?MR. CORDRAY: I'm not certain of that, but I think it would be better practice and reasonable conduct.QUESTION: Go back -QUESTION: It doesn't say it in the rule at all. QUESTION: Could you go back to Justice Scalia'squestion?15, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. CORDRAY: Sure.2 QUESTION: I thought that this was a very simple3 case. Somebody really mucked up the warrant, okay? They4 made a technical mistake. Instead of saying, seize - look5 for and seize some guns, they said, look for and seize a6 house, all right? Now, nobody could think that that made7 any sense.8 MR. CORDRAY: Yeah, except that before printing9 the affidavit -10 QUESTION: Nobody. No - you don't think it does,11 I don't think it does. So you can say one of three12 things: A, that the warrant is constitutional, which is13 what you're arguing, which is a little tough, because I14 guess if we said this was constitutional, we'd have to say15 a warrant is constitutional. If it says seize and then it16 says I'm not going to tell you, look in vault three of the17 Kremlin, you know, to see what we're supposed to seize. I18 mean, that's a tough route that you're taking.19 The second route is what Justice Scalia20 suggested, which is to say, well, it isn't really his21 fault, the search team leader, because he was in good22 faith. For me, that's tough because I - if you cast his23 eye on this piece of paper and just glanced at it, he24 would have seen it was faulty. Route three is to say,25 they're right in their lawsuit, let them bring it,16, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 damages, by the way, are going to be pretty low, okay?2 Now you explain to me why it should be route two, which is3 Justice Scalia's question, rather than just route three.4 MR. CORDRAY: Sure. This Court said in Malley5 that if in fact the officers make a mistake of fact in6 good faith that, if in fact Leon would apply to avoid7 suppressing that evidence in a criminal prosecution, the8 parallel should apply and qualified immunity would be9 appropriate in a civil action. I think that that is what10 makes the most sense of the objective -11 QUESTION: Now - now tell me why, because as I've12 made my point, it sounds to me that this man did not13 behave sensibly, because if he just looked at the piece of14 paper he would have seen in 3 seconds it says, seize the15 house, and we're not out here to seize the house, we're16 out to seize some guns.17 MR. CORDRAY: The magistrate -18 QUESTION: So it wasn't like a minor, common19 mistake -20 MR. CORDRAY: The magistrate -21 QUESTION: - so why was that reasonable?22 MR. CORDRAY: The magistrate also looked at this23 piece of paper and failed to notice the error. The24 materials were made -25 QUESTION: So two people -17, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: How do we know that the magistrate did2 look at the piece of paper?3 MR. CORDRAY: Because he signed the piece of4 paper.5 QUESTION: Any magistrate who looked at that6 piece of paper would say your warrant - your warrant7 application or the form you've given me does not indicate8 what you're searching for, unless you really are going to9 put the house up on a flatbed truck and take it away,10 which we know you're not. It's - it's - the obvious, I11 think the obvious probability is that the - the agent did12 not read what his secretary had typed in and the13 magistrate did not read what the agent presented to him,14 and this sometimes happens. I've had it happen to me.15 You hand the magistrate the application and he says, where16 do you want me to sign? Isn't that probably what17 happened?18 MR. CORDRAY: It's hard for me to know exactly19 what happened subject with the magistrate. We do know20 that he signed the warrant. We also know that he signed21 the application, which was presented to him, that had the22 particular description of the items to be seized. That's23 at page 28a of the appendix.24 QUESTION: Maybe he should be liable too. I25 mean, except for judicial absolute immunity, I - I don't18, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 know, you2 What does34 immunity issue, if I may, on both counts. First -5 QUESTION: Before you do that, just one6 preliminary question. Justice Scalia suggested earlier7 you could go right to qualified immunity to get all the8 rest, but I thought the - that this Court's precedent said9 you have to make a ruling, did it violate the Fourth10 Amendment, before you get to qualified immunity.11 MR. CORDRAY: That's how we read the Court's12 cases, at least to the last 6 or 7 years. It's been a13 pretty consistent approach.14 QUESTION: That may well be, but you don't have15 to argue it. My point was that you -16 MR. CORDRAY: That's fine.17 QUESTION: - didn't have to argue it -18 MR. CORDRAY: That's fine.19 QUESTION: - not that we don't have to decide it.20 MR. CORDRAY: That's fine. Let me - let me say,21 under Massachusetts v. Sheppard, this is clearly in good22 faith here. Qualified immunity should apply. Why?23 Because this agent prepared all the materials, submitted24 it all to the magistrate, is the one who personally had25 the interchange with the magistrate back and forth,19, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005say, you know, the magistrate's just as bad. that prove? It doesn't prove anything.MR. CORDRAY: Let me bore in on the qualified￼1 whereupon the magistrate approves the search and executes2 a warrant. He did not catch the error, that's true.3 QUESTION: He didn't have a bad motive?4 MR. CORDRAY: No, I mean that he - he acted in5 good faith, objectively, reasonably on the course of the6 record. He - he knew what search he was asking for. He7 submitted those materials. There's a particular list of8 the items to be seized in the application and in the9 affidavit. It was omitted from the warrant. That's why10 we're here. Nonetheless, this is exactly the kind of11 case, and many court of appeals have held this, in which12 Leon would apply in a criminal suppression hearing.13 Also, the Ninth Circuit here reached this result14 by announcing a new rule. They said an officer has a duty15 to proofread a warrant even after it's issued by a16 magistrate. They had rejected that rule in Marks v.17 Clarke just a year earlier, and now they reversed ground18 and they announce a new rule. That is classically the19 basis for qualified immunity under this Court's strong20 precedents that the - the officer cannot be held to21 predict the future course of constitutional law. Should -22 do they know there's a Fourth Amendment? Do they know it23 contains a particularity requirement? Presumably they do.24 But do they know how that applies in all circumstances and25 that they have a duty to proofread a warrant even though20, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 they've made out the materials, they've submitted to the2 magistrate, they've been there with the magistrate and3 gotten the approval as they assumed that they saw it?4 Massachusetts v. Sheppard very strongly says5 that - that we do not hold the officers to have a further6 duty in that instance. If you hold it in this case for7 the first time and anew, the qualified immunity at a8 minimum should be appropriate for the officer here.9 If I may reserve the balance of my time.10 QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Cordray.11 Mr. Schlick, we'll hear from you.12 ORAL ARGUMENT OF AUSTIN C. SCHLICK13 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE14 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER15 MR. SCHLICK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it16 please the Court:17 This Court has rejected a technical perfection18 standard in construing a warrant. In Steele v. United19 States, the warrant authorized a search of 611 West 46th20 Street. This Court determined, in light of the21 circumstances of the case, including the affidavit that22 was submitted to the magistrate in that case, that the23 search properly was conducted for 609 West 46th Street, as24 well as 611, and the rules - the rules stated in Steele v.25 United States is that a warrant satisfies the21, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 particularity requirement of the warrant clause if an2 officer executing a search could determine with reasonable3 effort what the magistrate authorized.4 QUESTION: So do you say this is just a technical5 mistake? If it said, go to the Empire State Building and6 seize the Empire State Building, that's just a technical7 mistake? I mean, they may have made it for a technical8 reason, but you'd have no idea what they're supposed to9 look for.10 MR. SCHLICK: And it - the question in that case,11 Your Honor, would be, is it clear what the magistrate12 authorized? In this case -13 QUESTION: No, it isn't clear. How is it clear?14 MR. SCHLICK: In - in that case, if it is not15 clear, then there is a violation of the particularity16 requirement -17 QUESTION: But you're saying here it's clear18 because the affidavit said it, but the affidavit's locked19 away somewhere and nobody can look at it.20 MR. SCHLICK: No, it's - it - is - in fact it was21 unsealed, and typically when warrants are put - when22 applications are placed under seal, there's a provision23 for unsealing the application upon the indictment or after24 a period of time, or a motion to unseal can be brought,25 which could have been done in this case, but in fact, the22, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 motion was brought by the Government in the - in the first2 place.3 QUESTION: So, in fact, what a homeowner's4 supposed to do is if the warrant - he looks at it, by the5 way, it's blank, it's blank. And the officer says, don't6 worry, I'm not going to tell you what I'm looking for, but7 just go somewhere to a court house and make a motion8 unseal an affidavit and that will solve the problem.9 is that what the Fourth Amendment is about?to Is -10 MR. SCHLICK: The Fourth Amendment does not11 protect, contrary to the Ninth Circuit's belief, the12 Fourth Amendment does not protect the - a supposed13 interest in reviewing the warrant during the search.14 Mr. Cordray explained, that's inconsistent with Rule15 It also would render impossible electronic surveillance.16 The - there also would be a serious safety concern. WeAs 41.￼17 simply do not want citizens contesting18 search whether the scope - whether the19 is lawful. It is safer for everyone -20 QUESTION: Well, I don't want21 of appeals seemed to envision some sort of a collaborative22 proceeding where there's a conversation between the23 officers executing the warrant and the homeowner and - and24 that - that seemed to me without foundation. On the other25 hand, I suppose the homeowner has a right to look at the23, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005at the scene of the scope of the search- the - the court1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425warrant and to comment - to comment on it.MR. SCHLICK: Under Rule 41, the right attacheswhen property is seized, as part of the receipt for the property that's seized. There may, as with -QUESTION: Well, I - I know, but there's a knock on the door and the policeman says, I have a warrant. And I say, may I see it? He says, well, oh no, you can't see it until I leave. Is that - is that your position?MR. SCHLICK: No, again that would be analyzed under the law of knock and announce, and it may be reasonable under the circumstances -QUESTION: If they have a warrant, do I have a right to read the warrant?MR. SCHLICK: And the question would be - QUESTION: The homeowner.MR. SCHLICK: If - if the homeowner denied entryuntil a copy of the warrant is provided, the officer would be faced with the question, is this a constructive denial of entry? Is there some exigency for getting into the property? And it may be reasonable under the circumstances -QUESTION: No, there - no, there - there's no exigency because there's only one person there and he's at the door and that person says, I'd like to read this warrant. Does he have the right to do that before the24, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425officer enters?MR. SCHLICK: If there were no exigencies, thenordinarily the reasonableness principle probably would require that, but the purpose of the particularity requirement, it's very clear, is to ensure that the search is conducted in accordance with what the magistrate authorized.QUESTION: Why isn't that in our rule if - if you're willing to concede that that's a constitutional requirement?MR. SCHLICK: We - we are not conceding it's a constitutional requirement. We're saying that under certain circumstances -QUESTION: Well, that - you say - you say it's part of the reasonableness requirement to show it to the homeowner if he demands it.MR. SCHLICK: Under - under circumstances where there is no exigency where the request to see the warrant -QUESTION: Under normal circumstances, when there is no exigency. Under normal circumstances, if the homeowner demands to see the warrant, you think it is constitutionally required that you show the homeowner the warrant?MR. SCHLICK: If - if the choice - if the25, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 homeowner denies entry, there's no exigency, and the2 officer's faced with the choice of break down the door or3 show the warrant, then reasonableness may require showing4 the warrant. But - but no, there is no general - there is5 no general reasonableness requirement, and as I've said,6 this Court's cases, cases such as Dalia and electronic7 surveillance contexts make clear -8 QUESTION: Your - your point about electronic9 surveillance seems to me quite - quite forceful. You do -10 you do not have to give - give the person who's being11 electronically surveilled a - a warrant beforehand. He12 has no opportunity to see what's - what's being done. I13 don't see why the constitutional principle would differ14 with regard to a - to a physical search.15 MR. SCHLICK: Our position, Your Honor, is there16 is no general requirement of providing a copy of the17 warrant, and the Ninth Circuit asserted an interest in￼18 reviewing19 protected2021 in circumstances, you gave an example, the reasonableness22 requirement would result in an obligation to show thethe warrant during the search is simply notby the particularity requirement -QUESTION: But you - but you are saying that in -23 warrant.24 MR. SCHLICK: It - it may under circumstances,25 but not as a general rule.26, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 QUESTION: Well, let's - let's take - let's -2 let's go one step further than the - than the hypothetical3 you - you were dealing with a moment ago. Let's assume4 the homeowner comes to the door and says, I'd like to see5 the warrant. And they say, well, here it is, and the6 homeowner says, I - I'd like to read it, and the police7 say, no, you can't read it. And the homeowner says, look,8 I'll give you whatever you've got a right to seize under9 this warrant. You don't have to tear the house apart,10 just let me see what it is you want. The police answer,11 no, we're not going to tell you, we're going to go through12 the house ourselves. Do you think that would be13 reasonable execution of the warrant?14 MR. SCHLICK: Yes, I - I think it - it - in most15 circumstances would be reasonable, yes, that the -16 QUESTION: They would have a right to - to - to17 tear the house apart when the homeowner stands at the￼18 threshold19 seize and2021 in that case would be whether the search was conducted22 within the scope of the warrant. If so, it would be a23 valid search and -and says, tell me what you've got a right to I'll get it for you.MR. SCHLICK: The - the question - the question24 QUESTION: The question is whether it's a25 reasonable search, and that includes an - an issue about27, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 the manner in which the warrant is executed.2 MR. SCHLICK: A - a search would not be rendered3 unreasonable by virtue of a discussion between the4 officers and the citizen. The question would be how the5 search was conducted. I would like to discuss the law -6 QUESTION: Well, I - I suppose that the officer7 doesn't have to take the word of the homeowner either that8 I'm getting you exactly what you want, you know, if the9 guy's charged with some sort of fraud, maybe he's going to10 continue.11 MR. SCHLICK: That - that's true and, of course,12 the things that are seized may not conform to the warrant13 because of the plain view rule that the officer may seize14 things that aren't covered in the rest of the warrant.15 QUESTION: But -16 MR. SCHLICK: Now, under the law of qualified17 immunity -18 QUESTION: Mr. Schlick, as far as the rule is19 concerned, the rule - the heading is receipt, so the rule20 - rule doesn't address this problem. It goes to what you21 do in inventory and then you give a receipt, if you're22 going to take away property give a receipt, and by the23 way, give the warrant with it. So I don't think we can24 read this rule as saying you don't have to give the25 warrant if the homeowner requests it. It just says if28, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 you're taking away property then you give a receipt, and2 part of the receipt is the warrant.3 MR. SCHLICK: The only requirement to providing4 the warrant is if property is taken away. Agent Groh also5 is protected from suit under the law of qualified6 immunity. There was - there's no clearly established law7 that requires an officer to undertake particular8 procedures in the preparation of a warrant. The Ninth's9 Circuit novel proofreading requirement had not even been10 conceived at the time of this search. In addition, the11 law is in disarray concerning the circumstances under12 which an affidavit or an application may be considered in13 construing the warrant. Off - Agent Groh also was14 operating 1516 residence17 say, oh, this is a terrible mistake here, would he have18 the obligation to turn around and go back or have somebody19 bring him the affidavit out?under a reasonable mistake of fact.QUESTION: But if he had been on the way to the and 3 minutes before he got there, the residents￼20 MR. SCHLICK: Under Steele, the question would be21 whether it was sufficiently clear what the magistrate22 authorized. We believe under these circumstances it was23 clear, so he would not have had that obligation. But as a24 practical matter, and this is very important, officers are25 not going to conduct searches when there is a question29, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425about the scope -QUESTION: So - so that - so that even if he seesthe mistake before he makes the entry on the premises, he can - he can proceed?MR. SCHLICK: If it's sufficiently clear under Steele, yes.QUESTION: And under these facts?MR. SCHLICK: Yes, yes. And - and if - and again, this goes to the purpose of the particularity requirement, which is ensuring that the search is conducted in accordance with what the magistrate authorized. If that is - if that is satisfied, then there is no constitute - then there is no constitutional violation and there's no constitutional interest in having the officer delay the search. But again, as a practical matter, the officer is going to want to be sure that suppression remedy -QUESTION: Well, but - but then - but then you're saying this warrant is sufficient?MR. SCHLICK: Yes. The -QUESTION: So - so - you want us to write an opinion to say that we can have warrants like this all the time and there's no problem.MR. SCHLICK: Again, that's the constitutional rule, but as a practical matter, officers are not going to30, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425take risks when they're - when they don't face an exigent circumstance -QUESTION: Talking about a constitutional minimum - you say that a constitutional minimum - this warrant would - is - is adequate under the Fourth Amendment in all circumstances?MR. SCHLICK: Under these circumstances, which include particularly the references in the warrant, Agent Groh's application and affidavit, which include the clear lift - list - in his application and the magistrate's signature on the warrant without making any edits.This is not in the typed version that we have, but if you look at the actual warrant form, which is document number five in the district court, you can see that the - that the magistrate signed the warrant form and it's a typed form on which there are handwritten notes, so -so-QUESTION: I did see it. I did look at that and it occurred to me at that moment that all you're asking people to do is just glance at the document quickly to catch obvious mistakes, which this is.MR. SCHLICK: And - and in this case, if Agent Groh had glanced -QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Schlick. Mr. Kozakiewicz, we'll hear from you.31, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 ORAL ARGUMENT OF VINCENT J. KOZAKIEWICZ2 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT3 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it4 please the Court:5 The Ramirez home was searched pursuant to a6 nonsensical warrant. They were deprived of the7 protections of the essential function of the warrant,8 which this Court has said is to assure the individual9 whose property is being searched and seized of the lawful10 authority of the executing officer, his need to search,11 and the limits of his power to search. The particularity12 requirement has -13 QUESTION: Where - where do - where do we say14 that? Did we say that in a case that -15 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Yes, Your Honor, you say that￼16 in - it was actually quoted17 stated in Illinois v. Gates18 9 in California v. Acevedo.19 QUESTION: If - if20 purpose of the warrant, isn't it passing strange that the21 rules relating to warrants do not require that the warrant22 be served, be presented to the individual, unless and23 until something is taken, at which point the warrant has24 to be left plus a list of the things taken? I mean, I25 just find it remarkable that our rules of criminal32, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005in the McGrew case. It was and in citing Chadwick at page- if that is indeed the1 procedure would not require the service of a warrant, and2 indeed, if that is the purpose of a warrant, what do you3 do about warrants for electronic surveillance, for4 wiretaps? Does - do - do you have to serve the object of5 the wiretap with a warrant saying, we're going to be6 tapping your phone, so he'll say, oh, thank you very much,7 you know, I'll use another phone.8 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: With - with respect to a9 wiretap, you have some exigent circumstances there. What10 the - what the Ramirezes were facing were the search of11 their home -12 QUESTION: It's not - what's exigent - what's13 exigent about it? Not necessarily, I -14 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: There's no necessarily -15 there's - with a wiretap there's no invasion, a physical16 invasion of the home and the rummaging through their17 personal belongings.18 QUESTION: Counsel, I suppose you don't have to19 take the position that there's some right of the homeowner20 to examine the warrant before the officer is admitted to21 the home to win this case, do you?22 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: That's true, Your -23 QUESTION: Why are you taking that position then?24 That gets you into a lot of hot water, because it hasn't25 been clearly defined. I mean, the Ninth Circuit seemed to33, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 place a lot of weight on the point, but I'm not sure it is2 necessary for you to prevail in this case. I'd like to3 hear your views.4 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Your - Your Honor, that - that5 is correct. The - the warrant was - was facially invalid,6 it was plain to see, but the - the Ninth Circuit has7 established a very - clearly established rule to say that8 the warrant requires a particular description. We are9 willing to - if it's not contained within the four corners10 of that document - to go be - to look at documents outside11 the four corners, provided it meets certain criteria, that12 being it is specifically referenced into the - into - in13 the warrant itself and somehow accompanies or is attached14 to the warrant.15 Under those circumstances it would become part16 of the warrant and they would recognize that, and the17 court went on to say that that has - was the rule in the18 Ninth Circuit for a long period of time. Agent Groh19 should have known about that, and it was - it was the20 clear law and therefore a constitutional violation took21 place and he did not - could not have good faith in his22 belief that he complied with that requirement of the23 warrant.24 QUESTION: Why, when McGrew didn't issue until 625 months after the conduct in question? McGrew set the34, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 circuit law for the - at least for the Ninth. It said2 that the executing officer has to read the warrant, but3 that wasn't on the books when this search occurred.4 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Your Honor, McGrew was decided5 6 months after the search in this case. However, the6 events that took place in McGrew happened before this7 case. If McGrew had never occurred, this would have been8-9 QUESTION: But what made the law clear in the10 Ninth Circuit was not the timing of the McGrew search, but11 the ruling of the Ninth Circuit.12 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: The - the McGrew decision said13 that it was clearly established at - through their - their14 prior decisions of the requirement that the warrant refer15 to and either have attached to or accompany the affidavit16 ifyouwantedto-touseitasabasistomeetthe17 particularity requirement, and it - it looked at other18 cases besides just that one. This has been the law in19 this circuit for over - over a decade.20 QUESTION: I see that there is a serious21 question, I think, underlying what you're saying. You're22 saying that this is really a question of cross-reference.23 The Constitution requires the warrant to describe the24 things to be seized. Now, what the Government says is25 this - we have permitted in cases that requirement to be35, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 fulfilled where the warrant piece of paper is perhaps2 blank or erroneous, but it cross-references another3 document. And you've said, it can do that where that4 other document is physically attached or, let's say, at5 least in the car. There was one case that said in the6 car, but not where it's in a vault someplace. And Justice7 Scalia, I think, asked why - why is that? Because if the8 purpose of the Fourth Amendment is not to alert the9 homeowner, but simply to be certain there is a check on10 the searcher, why have the cases come out the way you've11 just described them?12 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Because it's a - not to have13 that warrant or the supporting documentation to the14 warrant present to meet the particularity requirement is15 an opportunity for abuse.16 QUESTION: What kind of abuse?17 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: To be abuse to - to the - that18 the officer can come to the home, say I'm planning - I'm19 planning to search for - for something, ransack the house,20 find nothing, leave no warrant, and the person has no idea21 of the legal authority of - of why the officer was there,22 what he was doing there. He could have the opportunity to23 decide he wants to go in and rummage through the personal24 papers and -25 QUESTION: But he didn't, and that goes back to a36, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 question that Justice Scalia raised earlier. Assuming2 there is a violation of the Fourth Amendment, you're3 bringing a Bivens action, and if we recall the facts in4 Bivens that - the police acted as rough as can be, they5 manacled the man, they told him they were going to arrest6 his wife and children, they hauled him off to jail and7 they strip-searched him. Nothing like that happened here.8 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: That's correct, Your Honor.9 However, Bivens 19 - in 1983 action, depending upon10 whether the11 same - same12 a violation13 reasonable.14 QUESTION: But the damages here, nothing happened15 here that would not have happened if the right portion of16 the application had been copied into the warrant.actor is State or Federal agent, follow the line of reasoning of whether - was the action of constitutional right and was it objectively￼17 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: The - the - the damages was to18 - to the - the homeowner's ability to be assured of the19 authority of the officer to be here.20 QUESTION: Well, I'm not sure about that. Does21 the homeowner say, well, I'd like to - this is a long22 warrant, I have to sit down and read this, and they sit23 down by the fire and read the warrant and discuss it?24 That's not the way it works.25 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Under the circumstances of this37, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 case, there was no opportunity ever for the - the2 homeowner to - to know what -3 QUESTION: Well, but we're asking what the4 general requirement is. Once - once the homeowner finds5 that the police have the authority to enter, then don't6 the cases teach us that the purpose of the warrant is to7 control the discretion of the officer, not the knowledge8 of the homeowner, and incidentally, I think you might be9 able to read Rule 41 as saying that when an officer leaves10 he has to give a copy of the warrant whether he takes11 anything or not. I'm - I'm not quite sure that that's the12 right interpretation.13 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Well, you're -14 QUESTION: Let's assume that that's done. I15 don't think the homeowner has the right to monitor the16 search. There's - there's no authority for that. The17 Ninth Circuit seemed to say - think that.18 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Yes, Your Honor, the Ninth19 Circuit said that and, in fact, in the Gant case, which20 was cited in - in McGrew, they said that there's a - a21 duty of the officer under the rule to provide the22 homeowner with the warrant prior to leaving the scene.23 QUESTION: Under the rule, they said? Under the24 rule? Well.25 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Yes, Your Honor.38, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: That's not true, is it? I mean, you - you can create such a duty -MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: No.QUESTION: - but it doesn't appear in the rule at all, does it?MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: The - the Gant decision that referred to the - to the rule was looking at the - the argument was made in that case by the Government that the rule only required it, and said that since the - the Katz decision says that it - the rule does not invariably require it to - the Government to serve the warrant, that it must usually require that it be done.QUESTION: Doesn't say anything at all about warrant when no property is taken. As far as - I have the text of Rule 41 in front of me. It talks about leaving the warrant when you've taken property. There's not one word in this that I can see about leaving the warrant when you haven't taken property.MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: That's correct, Your Honor, and that's the - the real problem in this - in this case, when if - if there is no duty to leave a warrant, as suggested by the - the United States in their - their brief when no property is taken, then it's the invitation to abuse that I - I talked about earlier.QUESTION: Well, but do you - do you have to - do39, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 you have to maintain that position to win your case? I2 mean, do you have to get us to accept your - that - that3 proposition in order to win your case?4 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: No. I think the plain language5 of the particularity requirement is all that is needed and6 this does not meet the particularity requirement.7 QUESTION: Can we get back to the question I8 think that you hadn't completed your answer to before?9 So, assuming that there is a violation of the Fourth10 Amendment, what harm to this family - I mean, the contrast11 with Bivens in that regard is stark, because the - the -12 what you recited, the same thing would happen if the13 warrant had copied the right paragraph of the application.14 There was no rough stuff.15 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: The damage is the fact that16 their constitutional right to have a - a properly executed17 and a properly written warrant prior to the invasion of18 the home.19 QUESTION: So -20 QUESTION: Of course, that's really not what the21 Fourth Amendment says, is it? It just - it doesn't say22 you need - you need - I mean, surely there's some play in23 the joints, isn't there? It's - it categorically24 prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, right?25 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Correct.40, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: And then it goes on to say, and any2 warrants, you know, where you need a warrant shall3 particularly describe the - the person or place to be4 searched and the items to be seized. But it doesn't say5 categorically that you can't - you need a warrant all the6 time, so there's some play in the joints. Why couldn't we7 say that at least in this case where there was a good-8 faith attempt to get a warrant and where the affidavit9 would have justified a warrant, it is not the one thing10 that the Fourth Amendment prohibits, an unreasonable11 search and seizure, to go ahead with this defective12 warrant?13 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Because there was no effort on14 the part of Agent Groh to comply with that particular15 requirement, and that leads to the opportunity for abuse16 because he - there is no evidence in the - in the record17 to show that he had any - did anything to comply - to see18 that he had a warrant that met the particularity19 requirement.20 QUESTION: But - but there's nothing in the21 Fourth Amendment that requires a warrant, even for the22 entry into a home, and as you know of, many entries into23 homes are done without a warrant when there are exigent24 circumstances. Now, if - if you can say that that is not25 an unreasonable search and seizure, why can you not say it41, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 is not an unreasonable search and seizure to proceed on2 the basis of a warrant that has a - a technical - clear3 technical defect, but nonetheless was sought and - and4 would have issued in perfect conformity with5 constitutional requirements. Why does that make it an6 unreasonable search and seizure? I can see that it makes7 it a search and seizure without a proper warrant as8 defined in Article IV - in the Fourth Amendment - but the9 Fourth Amendment does not require a warrant all the time.10 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: It does not require a warrant11 all the time if there are exigent circumstances. There12 were no exigent circumstances in this case.13 QUESTION: Well, that's not the only exception.14 I mean, that's one exception that - that we've developed.15 Why can't we say another exception is where you've done16 everything that is necessary to get a warrant, and the17 warrant you've gotten, yeah, it doesn't really comply with18 the description of the warrant there, but still to proceed19 that way is not unreasonable search and seizure? It's20 mistaken but it's not an unreasonable search and seizure.21 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Because I think the - that22 would trivialize the - the requirement of the23 particularity clause, because particularity as well as24 probable cause weigh into the - the general warrant25 situation and -42, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Are you - you suggesting that maybe it2 was unreasonable? Since there were no exigent3 circumstances this warrant could have been executed the4 next day for as far as we know from this record, to go5 back and say, oh my goodness, look at this, it's a general6 warrant, I better get it particularized.7 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: That - that's correct, and he -8 he should have done that, because the - the problem here9 is that there was - it was plain for everyone to see.10 This was the - the Leon - the warrant that was envisioned11 in Leon that was so facially valid that no reasonable12 officer could rely on it -13 QUESTION: With respect to Leon, Mr. Cordray14 urged that if you would meet the good-faith exception, in15 any case where the good-faith exception would apply so the16 evidence isn't suppressed, the officer would have17 qualified immunity. Do you agree that that's a - a proper18 equation?19 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Only if there is good faith20 that the officer attempted to comply with the21 particularity requirement, because if there was good faith22 that there was probable cause, that does not supply the23 particularity any more than the oath and affirmation to24 say that this was oath and affirmation. To have a valid25 warrant you need all legs of the stool, and the43, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 particularity requirement is one of those.2 QUESTION: May I ask you a question about the -3 QUESTION: So what you are saying is not because4 the - the same reason it's not a qualified immunity is the5 same reason it isn't an unreasonable search. It isn't a6 reasonable search, isn't a reasonable search, and there is7 no qualified immunity because he didn't even glance at the8 document, and for the head man not to glance at the9 document is not good faith and is unreasonable. If that's10 your argument - as I guess you're going to accept this now11 -12 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Yes.13 QUESTION: All right, fine. I'd like to go back14 for one second to Justice Ginsburg's - one of her initial15 questions, is, what is it you are seeking here? A dollar16 in damages and an apology? Because, after all, if you17 accept my argument, they would have just gone back and18 gotten a better warrant and it would have taken them a19 couple of hours and all the same thing would have20 happened. So - so what - what is it you're seeking in21 this lawsuit? An apology and a dollar or something else?22 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: We're seeking money damages23 thata-ajurywould-24 QUESTION: Well, is there any way it could be25 more than a dollar?44, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: It - it would depend, Your2 Honor, on -3 QUESTION: What have you asked for in the4 complaint?5 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: We didn't put - specify a6 dollar amount in the complaint.7 QUESTION: Is there any way it could be more than8 a dollar? I mean, you must have thought this through,9 because, after all, you have filed a complaint and they10 hired you and -11 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Yes, it is - yes, it is, Your12 Honor, because the trauma - the traumatization that Mrs.13 Ramirez went through by agents coming into her home and14 saying, we have a warrant to search for explosives -15 QUESTION: Is different from what it would have16 happened an hour later? Different from what -￼17 1819 corrected20 -21 22 2324 frame, and in this case it was a continue of a time frame25 that she was under - under the fright of people being in45, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Yes, yes.QUESTION: - would have happened if they'dthe error and gone back and done the same thingMR. KOZAKIEWICZ: That - that's correct - QUESTION: - because?MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Because there was that time1 her home, searching it, ransacking it, going - going2 through it. There was - we've alleged in the complaint3 damage to personal property. All this was done without4 her knowing and whether they had the right to be there,5 what they were looking for other than -6 QUESTION: But I - I thought the facts say that7 they correctly - at least in the petitioner's brief - they8 say that they correctly notified the homeowner about the9 purpose and objects of the search.10 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: That would be an oral11 notification, and there is no assurance given to the -12 through oral notification, he could make up anything he13 wants.14 QUESTION: You think when the Fourth Amendment15 was adopted or when the English tradition that underlaid16 the Fourth Amendment was - was formed, most people could17 read a warrant?18 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: I don't know, Your Honor.19 QUESTION: Then - then do you think the20 homeowners would have the right to exclude the constable21 until he could get somebody who was literate to read the22 warrant that the constable presented to him? Maybe call23 his attorney and say, you know, there's a warrant here I24 can't read, can you come over and read it for me?25 QUESTION: They didn't have telephones.46, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

I mean, this - this notion that this is part of the - of the warrant requirement, it seems to me, is based on a real misunderstanding of - people couldn't read, most of them.MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Well, that makes an assumption of what took place there. In today's society most people can read and Mrs. Ramirez can -QUESTION: Well, we might - we - maybe we should add that requirement to the Fourth Amendment. I assume we could amend the Fourth Amendment to say, in addition to what it used to mean, you have to present the warrant at least to people who are literate.QUESTION: Counsel, if we conclude that there is, in fact, no requirement, as the Ninth Circuit seemed to think there was, that the warrant be shown to the homeowner in advance, assume that's not a requirement. What are the damages left other than attorneys fees?MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: If the - the -QUESTION: Are you really - is it really a fight about attorneys' fees because it's taken so long to get up47, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

KOZAKIEWICZ: No. There's - there's - thathasn't even come up.QUESTION: I assume it will.(Laughter.)QUESTION: May I ask you another question about the warrant? Everybody's been assuming that there's only one particularity requirement in the Constitution. There are two. There's the - particularly describing the place to be searched and also the items to be seized, and I was wondering if one couldn't read this warrant as just satisfying the particularity requirement with regard to what was to be searched, because as I understand it, it was - the ranch was a very big ranch and they only wanted to search this one house with a couple of - the garage next to it, and they didn't search the entire ranch, did they?MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Yes, they did go to search the entire ranch.QUESTION: Oh, they did?MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: And they did look in various other buildings. There was a statement in the affidavits - in the complaint, which has not been denied that they -48, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 in some ways secured - they - there was admissions in -2 in answers -3 QUESTION: I see. I thought one might read the4 warrant as describing this particular blue - blue house5 and so forth as the particular part of the ranch that was6 to be searched for the guns and so forth, but that's not7 the case? They searched everything?8 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Yes, that's -9 QUESTION: I see.10 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: That's correct. But if you11 wereto-ifyouweretoreaditthatitwasthe-to12 search the ranch for the blue house, then -13 QUESTION: This would be - no, I wouldn't - you14 wouldn't obviously be searching for the blue house, but15 you might read this as having confined the search to the16 blue house as opposed to the entire ranch, which is￼17 described 181920 its face. 2122 taken all 2324 I suppose25 trespass,-butyou-butthat - that wasn't done.MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: No.QUESTION: So then it is really nonsensical onMR. KOZAKIEWICZ: That's the position that we've along.QUESTION: Well, so far as damages are concerned, your claim is analogous to a common lawthat someone has come on the - come on your49, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 property without any right to do so, and so you - you2 could analogize that to whatever damages you could get for3 a trespass.4 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: That would be correct, Your5 Honor. We - we haven't thought about damages in - in your6 - since the - the motion to dismiss was - was granted and7 we've been arguing the - the points of law.8 QUESTION: But I thought you did make some kind9 of enumeration. You mentioned Mr. Ramirez's drafting10 table was broken and you said she was frightened, and I11 think one other thing you alleged.12 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Yes, that's correct. There13 were - there were damages -14 QUESTION: Oh, yes, the reputation to the - the15 reputation in the neighborhood, but that would have been16 affected just the same if the police came there with an17 entirely proper warrant.18 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: That's - that damage would have19 been the - been the same. The - the damage to them is the20 fact that the search was done and there was no - since the21 search was under a illegal warrant, we contend that the22 search was illegal and any damages coming through from the23 illegal search are compensable, but that's to be decided24 down - down the road.25 The - the Marks v. Clarke case that was referred50, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 to earlier about - saying that there was no duty to read2 the warrant by the officers is not entirely correct. In3 the - in the Marks case, in the - the Ninth Circuit said4 that there was no duty for the officers executing the5 warrant to read it, as long as they be - they fulfilled6 their duty to become familiar with it before they went out7 there. However, the - the court did say that the officers8 who applied for the warrant had a duty to make sure that9 they had the valid warrant.10 If there are no further questions -11 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Kozakiewicz.12 Mr. Cordray, you have 2 minutes remaining.13 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. CORDRAY14 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER15 MR. CORDRAY: Your Honor, on the qualified16 immunity point, there is plain language in the17 Constitution as to what the Fourth Amendment says, but18 this Court said in Anderson v. Creighton, that is not the19 correct approach. It's not at the level of what the20 Constitution says in the abstract. It's how it's applied21 in particular circumstances. And here, the Ninth Circuit￼22 did move the law in23 being asked to move24 we either open, and25 courts as we speak.specific respects, and this Court is the law and to answer questions that in fact are controverted in the lower51, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 Sheppard had established that you can go beyond2 the four corners of the page of the warrant to look at3 supporting materials when there's any kind of suitable4 words of reference. The Ninth Circuit itself has5 clarified since this case, in U.S. v. Vesikuru, 314 F.3d6 1116, suitable words of reference can be that we're7 relying on the sworn complaint to supply probable cause,8 very similar, in fact indistinguishable, from the words of9 reference in this warrant in this case. You're being10 asked to retreat from Sheppard and to clarify when a11 warrant can or cannot incorporate accompanying affidavit12 materials and that's a question you're being asked to13 answer in this case and then apply against this officer14 retrospectively to give damages and deny qualified15 immunity. That's inappropriate under this Court's settled16 case law.17 Second, you're being asked in this case to say18 specifically an officer has a constitutional duty to19 proofread and re-check a warrant after it has been issued20 by the magistrate, which this Court has never held, and21 this Court has said in prior cases, including Illinois v.22 Gates, that the officers' sole duty once they apply for an23 order of authority is to execute the warrant faithfully in24 accordance with the constraints imposed upon them.25 McGrew moved the law in this case. It was52, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 decided 6 months after this search occurred. This2 decision below in this Ramirez case moved the law further,3 and yet the Court is being asked to deny qualified4 immunity to this officer here.5 As for the Leon dictum, Justice Kennedy, you6 asked, we believe that if in fact Agent Groh had noticed7 this error, if anyone had called it to his attention8 during proceeding to execute the search, the more9 reasonable course of conduct would be to stop and seek10 clarification from the court, as the officers did in11 Maryland v. Garrison. Having not noticed the error,12 having gone ahead and executed the warrant in good faith,13 having executed the search in compliance with the request14 made to the court, that is good faith and -15 QUESTION: Would they have had a duty to turn16 around if they'd noticed the error 5 minutes before they'd17 come to the property?18 MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: That is a debatable question.19 I think that the better approach would have been to stop20 at that moment and seek clarification from the court since21 there were no exigent circumstances. But here, the￼22 officer23 noticed24 error.25 readinghad not noticed the error, the magistrate had not the error, no one on the team had noticed the The next day, a lawyer sitting in his officethe page in the cold light of day noticed the53, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 error. Immediately Agent Groh responded, faxed him the2 face page of the application. His conduct here was3 clearly in good faith and - and to impose qualified4 immunity here would be wrong and would be in total5 violation of this Court's cases and clearly established6 law.7 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Cordray.8 The case is submitted.9 (Whereupon, at 11:00 a.m., the case in the10 above-entitled matter was submitted.)11 12 13141516171819202122232425￼54, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.
