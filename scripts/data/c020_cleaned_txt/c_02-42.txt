LEATHERWOOD: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:Respondent has prompted the Nevada courts to extend their authority over California's tax process. The Nevada court has said at Joint Appendix 138, the entire process, of FTB audits of Hyatt, including the FTB's assessment of taxes and the protests, is at issue in this case, end quote. This has been said to mean, at Joint Appendix 138, that the tax process is under attack.This lawsuit interferes with California's capacity to administer these taxes. The administration of taxes is a core, sovereign responsibility from which all functions of State Government depend on. It is protected by immunity laws of common-law tort lawsuits, like the kind presented by Respondent.California has invoked the protection of its immunity laws, but the Nevada courts have allowed31111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 respondents laws to proceed, not by extending full faith2 and credit. And this refusal threatens our constitutional3 system for cooperative federalism in violation of Article4 IV, Section 1 of the United States Code.5 QUESTION: Mr. Leatherwood, may I ask you a6 threshold question? Some of your friends in this case7 have invited an overruling of Nevada against Hall. Of8 course, California was favored by that decision. Do you9 join in the plea to overrule Nevada v. Hall, or do you say10 this case is different because it involves core sovereign11 functions?12 MR. LEATHERWOOD: Justice Ginsberg, we do not13 join in the chorus to overrule Nevada v. Hall. This case14 is different. This case goes to footnote 24 of Nevada v.15 Hall. It's our feeling that Nevada v. Hall is good law in16 the sense that it does -- it does not implicate another17 state managing another state's core sovereign function.18 It's -- Nevada v. Hall was strictly an automobile19 accident.20 QUESTION: But the comparison would be between21 the university, education, which was the -- which was the22 defendant, and the tax authorities. Both of those,23 education and tax, seem core. Or if you're going to24 compare the tort itself, it would be a comparison between25 negligent driving, on the one hand, and going into another41111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 state and committing -- you know, peering through windows,2 going through garbage, totally wrongly getting all the3 neighbors4 comparing5 comparing67 you, Your 89to reveal private information, et cetera. So the particular acts, what's the difference, or sovereign functions, what's the difference?MR. LEATHERWOOD: I mean, compared -- I thank Honor -- in comparing the sovereign functions -- QUESTION: Education versus tax.MR. LEATHERWOOD: Yeah, and driving an 10 automobile in another state's -- on another state's11 highway --12 QUESTION: That's not the sovereign function.13 MR. LEATHERWOOD: That's not --14 QUESTION: I'm saying that --15 MR. LEATHERWOOD: -- the sovereign function.16 QUESTION: -- it seems like that's apples and17 oranges to me. That is, in the one case, we're looking at18 the acts they're complaining of, and here the plaintiff is19 complaining of acts that took place in Nevada that were20 miles outside what would be reasonable. I'm not saying21 he's right, but that's his complaint. In Nevada v. Hall,22 they were complaining about negligent driving. So what's23 the difference there?24 Or, alternatively, in Nevada v. Hall, it was a25 driver who worked for a university, and here it is an51111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425investigator who works for the tax board. So what's the difference there?MR. LEATHERWOOD: Well, to answer the Court's question directly, the most significant difference is that the tax function is -- is much more significant than the education function.QUESTION: Well, that's -- that -- that --that would be a very difficult premise for us to say, that education is somehow secondary.MR. LEATHERWOOD: Well --QUESTION: You're -- you're saying Nevada can'thave a great university -- can have a great university by keeping its people within its own borders. They can't go to California to get information to solicit, to recruit students? That -- that would be a very difficult decision for us to write on that premise.MR. LEATHERWOOD: No, Your Honor, I would agree with you that that would be a difficult --QUESTION: For the State of California to argue that education is not a core state function is, to me, rather astounding.MR. LEATHERWOOD: No, Your Honor, I'm not arguing that education is not a core sovereign function. What I'm arguing is that taxation is an essential core sovereign function since that education cannot move61111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 forward --2 QUESTION: Well, Mr. --3 MR. LEATHERWOOD: -- to provide taxation.4 QUESTION: -- Leatherwood, we -- this Court5 tried to follow a core state function test under the Tenth6 Amendment. And in Garcia, kind of gave it up, didn't it,7 as being an unworkable thing. Now, why would we want to8 resurrect that here? And why is it that you don't say,9 well, if the Court wants to overrule Nevada v. Hall,10 that's fine; I'll win. I mean, I don't understand your11 position. You're asking us to go back to a test that we12 rejected under the Tenth Amendment in Garcia, but you13 don't want to say, sure, if you want to overrule Nevada v.14 Hall, be my guest.15 MR. LEATHERWOOD: Yes, Your Honor. Justice16 O'Connor, what we are attempting to say here is that this17 case is more analogous to this Court's jurisprudence in18 the area of the Federal Tax Injunction Act along the line19 of fair assessment -- the fair assessment cases, where the20 Court has directed that the Federal Government will back21 off on trying to manage state taxes.22 QUESTION: There you have a specific act of23 Congress that tells the Federal Government to back off.24 And I don't believe you have any such thing here.25 MR. LEATHERWOOD: But we do have the Full Faith71111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 and Credit Clause, which directs that a state is to2 recognize the public acts of another state. And we do3 have an immunity law applicable here, and this directs4 that Nevada should respect the immunity laws of the State5 of California. And the immunity law, in this particular6 instance, provide absolute immunity for conduct as7 undertaken in a -- in a tax audit. Anything that's8 associated with tax audit, is protected.9 QUESTION: But Nevada did recognize California10 law to the extent it was similar to Nevada's -- that is,11 saying you had immunity from the negligent acts. And then12 it went on to say, no, you don't have immunity from13 intentional acts, even though California law does give14 immunity from intentional acts. But surely you wouldn't15 go to the extreme that you would say someone could come16 over to Las Vegas from California and just beat up17 somebody because they haven't paid their taxes, would18 they?19 MR. LEATHERWOOD: Absolutely, I agree with the20 Court on that point. The --21 QUESTION: Why not?22 MR. LEATHERWOOD: -- the extension of that --23 QUESTION: Why do you agree on that point? I24 don't understand that?25 MR. LEATHERWOOD: Because the extension of our81111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425immunity law does not cover physical torts or torts -- QUESTION: Oh.MR. LEATHERWOOD: -- outside the scope -- QUESTION: I see.MR. LEATHERWOOD: -- of course, the scope of --of the -- the acts that are incidental to -- QUESTION: I see. So under California law,there would be -- that would be actionable; whereas, under Nevada law, here, what they're doing is actionable. You just want to use the California standard rather -- rather than the Nevada standard.MR. LEATHERWOOD: Well, in fact, Your Honor, if they would use the Nevada standard, use the same standard that Nevada applies to its own taxing agencies, then this case would be on a hold. What Nevada has done in this particular case is that it has gone outside its own precedent and applied a different standard to California taxing agencies, and it's not --QUESTION: But that's not what they're -- the Nevada court said, we're going to treat the tax collectors from anywhere who come in to our state and act here, and we're going to -- the Nevada Supreme Court said, we're going to apply our rule, and our rule is negligence, there's immunity; intentional, there isn't. So you're asking us to discredit or disbelieve the Nevada Supreme91111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 Court when it said, the law we apply to tax collectors who2 act in this state is the same as we apply to Nevada tax3 collectors.4 MR. LEATHERWOOD: Your Honor, I am not asking5 this Court to not believe the Nevada Supreme Court. But6 what I'm saying is that Nevada has published precedent, as7 recent as 1989, where it requires that a taxpayer forego8 bringing a lawsuit until they -- until there has been --9 until there's a resolution of all statutory procedures.10 QUESTION: Oh, but this -- but Nevada Supreme11 Court, I thought, made very clear that what they were12 dealing with is tortious conduct, harassing conduct.13 They, in fact, refused -- Nevada Supreme Court refused to14 decide where this man was domiciled, because that would15 interfere with the ongoing procedure in California on the16 tax liability. I thought that the Nevada Supreme Court17 had made it clear that they were dealing with the way18 their resident is being harassed and not with where he was19 domiciled on a magic date.20 MR. LEATHERWOOD: Your Honor, what has happened21 in this particular case, 97 percent of the conduct that22 occurred during the course of this audit occurred in23 California. And, quite naturally, what Nevada is -- what24 Nevada is doing is permitting Mr. Hyatt to go behind the25 actual tort and make a collateral attack on the tax101111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 itself.2 QUESTION: Well, that may be, but the that isn't3 the issue that we've got in front of us here. I mean, the4 question in front of us is not how far can the Nevada5 courts go in reviewing California's tax practice. The6 issue before us is, among others, in a claim of tort7 against your -- your operative in Nevada, for the manner8 in which the tax is collected is their absolute immunity.9 And, you know, maybe the Nevada courts are going too far10 in discovery, but that's not the issue in front of us.MR. LEATHERWOOD: I would absolutely agree with that the issue is whether or not Nevada wasto apply our immunity laws with respect -- QUESTION: All right.1112 the Court13 obligated14 1516 undertaken incidental to this audit.17 QUESTION: May I go back to Justice Stevens'18 question, because I'm not sure of your answer to it. What19 if the State of California passed a statute tomorrow20 morning saying the use of thumbscrews in tax collection is21 authorized? Is -- would your answer to Justice Stevens'22 question be that -- or wouldn't your answer to Justice23 Stevens' question be that if you went into Nevada and you24 used thumbscrews, you would be entitled, on your theory,25 to absolute immunity? Isn't that correct?111111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005MR. LEATHERWOOD: -- with respect to conduct￼1 MR. LEATHERWOOD: Your Honor, no. What I'm2 saying is that, under that particular theory, I do not3 think that you could pass law in the State of California4 that will essentially sanction a crime, and there was no5 crimes committed within the course of this audit.6 If the -- if an auditor commits an intentional7 tort, such as a burglary or a trespass in Nevada or in8 California, it's -- it's our position that that particular9 conduct is not incidental to --10 QUESTION: It doesn't matter. I mean, we're11 trying to get the -- we're trying to get the analysis of12 it, and I'm having exactly the same problem. Imagine that13 there, California did say there is absolute immunity, even14 if you beat somebody up, absolute tort immunity. Okay?15 Even for beating people up. Now, suppose they did have16 that; you could prosecute it as a crime. Now you're in17 Nevada, and they say, the plaintiff, he beat me up, he18 came across the state line, down from Lake Tahoe. He was19 in a bad mood, lost too much money at the casino, and he20 beat me up. All right? Now, can Nevada bring that21 lawsuit or not? That's, I think, what Justice Stevens'22 question was.23 MR. LEATHERWOOD: Well -- well, I understand24 that, Your Honor. My position is that even though that25 law does not exist in California --121111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Yes.MR. LEATHERWOOD: -- but applying -- QUESTION: If it did.MR. LEATHERWOOD: -- applying it -- my -- ourparticular theory -- QUESTION: Yes.MR. LEATHERWOOD: -- that, yes, we -- then Nevada would be obligated under the Full Faith and Credit Clause to apply that particular law. But --QUESTION: And, therefore, you could not bring the lawsuit in Nevada about somebody beating somebody up.MR. LEATHERWOOD: If --QUESTION: If that were the law in California. MR. LEATHERWOOD: -- if that were -- if that wasthe case. But --QUESTION: Yeah, okay.MR. LEATHERWOOD: -- in this particular case, that's illegal in California and that's illegal in Nevada.QUESTION: So how, then, do we reconcile that position, where we're back to our starting place, with the fact that he could bring an action if on his way down from Lake Tahoe in the state car, he happened to drive a little negligently and ran somebody over? I mean, that's Nevada v. Hall, just reverse the states.MR. LEATHERWOOD: No, and we're agreeing with131111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 Nevada v. Hall.2 QUESTION: I know. So this is why we're having3 a problem. It's clear that if our tax collector, on his4 way down from Lake Tahoe, runs over a Nevada resident, the5 Nevada resident can sue and apply Nevada law.6 MR. LEATHERWOOD: Yes, I --7 QUESTION: You say, if, in fact, that same tax8 collector beats up somebody, and the California law is9 that you cannot sue, Nevada cannot apply its own law.10 MR. LEATHERWOOD: That's not what I'm saying,11 Your Honor. I'm saying if that conduct -- if that conduct12 is connected to the actual audit itself, then it's13 protected. But what I'm saying, I cannot possibly see,14 under any possible theory, that a beating, that it -- that15 breaking into someone's house could actually be part of16 the assessment -- tax assessment process. If an auditor17 engages in that kind of behavior, the auditor is not18 covered under the absolute immunity. That is outside the19 scope of that --￼QUESTION: Okay.MR. LEATHERWOOD: -- of that statute. QUESTION: And is the reason that the answer is in the two cases, the reason that there is special about tax collection or is the reason20 21 2223 different24 something25 that there is a closer connection in the hypo of the141111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 beating up for tax collection than the driving the2 automobile for tax collection?3 MR. LEATHERWOOD: Well --4 QUESTION: Which is it? Is it the nature of the5 tax collection or the nature of the activity which leads6 to the tort liability?7 MR. LEATHERWOOD: Well, I think it's both, Your8 Honor. Well, first of all, tax -- tax collection, by9 definition, is an intrusion of someone's life. The10 allegations alleged here are principally invasion of11 privacy, disclosure of information, that sort of thing.12 Ninety-seven percent of that conduct occurred in13 California. You cannot possibly investigate or prosecute14 Mr. Hyatt's case without intruding into that tax --15 QUESTION: Mr. Leatherwood, if I understand your16 position, it would be exactly the same if a hundred17 percent of the conduct had occurred in Nevada.18 MR. LEATHERWOOD: Absolutely, Your Honor. That19 --but--but--20 QUESTION: But the problem I have -- may I just21 ask this question. Assume there is a -- there's a22 difference between Nevada law and California law, as I23 understand it. Some things are actionable against a tax24 people in one state and not the other. Why is it, in your25 view, that if the same conduct had occurred six months151111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 later, but by Nevada tax collectors instead of by2 California tax collectors, because he's been in both3 states and probably is subject to tax in both, Nevada4 would allow the suit against its own tax people but not5 allow it against the California tax people? Why does that6 make sense?7 MR. LEATHERWOOD: Well, Your Honor, in this8 particular case, as I've indicated, according to our9 reading of Nevada precedent, published precedent, that10 they would not permit this lawsuit to proceed until the11 tax process has been concluded. With respect to -- to12 directly answer your question, it does not appear that13 Nevada would prosecute its own -- would permit a14 prosecution of its own agents in the case where the15 allegations are principally that there is an intrusion16 into Mr. Hyatt's life or that there --17 QUESTION: Well, we understood the reasoning of18 the Nevada Supreme Court to say they would. I think -- I19 must have misread the opinion. Is that --20 MR. LEATHERWOOD: No, absolutely not, Your21 Honor. I don't think you misread the opinion. What I22 think the Nevada Supreme Court said is that they will23 permit intentional tort prosecution of government24 employees. This case does not involve a government25 employee. This case involves a government agency itself,161111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 a tax agency. And under Nevada law, you cannot proceed2 against the Nevada tax agency without first exhausting3 your administrative and statutory remedies to contest the4 underlying tax itself.5 QUESTION: But certainly this sort of thing6 isn't the kind of thing you could have exhausted your7 remedies on, is it?8 MR. LEATHERWOOD: Absolutely, Your Honor. In9 our -- in our -- it is our position that this entire --10 the entire lawsuit is linked up to our tax process,11 because the conduct that the Respondent is complaining12 about here is that the tax itself is -- the tax itself and13 the tax process is engaged in bad faith. And I would --14 QUESTION: Now, what is -- was your answer to15 the question? Suppose that this tax collector were16 driving negligently in Nevada --17 MR. LEATHERWOOD: Part --18 QUESTION: Suppose the tax collector were19 driving negligently in Las Vegas. It's very important for20 the tax collector to go examine the record, and he's21 driving negligently. What --22 MR. LEATHERWOOD: I think, under Nevada v. Hall,23 he would be -- he would be subject to negligent liability.24 It's not connected to a core silent function because the25 function here is -- the function here is a tax171111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 investigation, whereas, driving is something that you can2 investigate independent of the tax process itself.3 QUESTION: So suppose that we -- we conclude4 that footnote 24 does not provide sufficient guidance for5 us to have a stable jurisprudence and that you will lose6 unless Nevada versus Hall is overruled. Would you then7 ask us to overrule Nevada versus Hall?8 MR. LEATHERWOOD: Your Honor --9 QUESTION: I know you don't want to entertain10 that possibility, but suppose that's what we conclude.11 MR. LEATHERWOOD: Well, we -- we've thought12 about this, Your Honor, of course, and we would accept a13 win, if that's the Court's direction, through overruling14 Nevada v. Hall, but it's our contention that the Court15 doesn't have to go that far to get -- to get to this16 point. The Court can literally analogize to the special17 protections that are provided to state tax systems within18 the federal system itself.19 QUESTION: But then that, as I suggested20 earlier, is a difficult thing to do, because there are21 congressional statutes that mandate that here. And all we22 have is the Full Faith and Credit Clause. Now, perhaps23 you say that's sufficient, but isn't it possible that24 there might be other emanations of the Full Faith and25 Credit Clause, other than just footnote 24, or whatever it181111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 is, in Nevada against Hall. I'm not talking about2 overruling it, but developing it, perhaps.3 MR. LEATHERWOOD: Yes, Your Honor. I would4 agree with that. Of course, we think that Nevada's5 failure to recognize or give dignity to California's6 immunity statute is not only a violation of the Full Faith7 and Credit Clause, but is a hostile act, and this kind of8 hostility is contrary to our whole concept of --9 QUESTION: What -- what about a congressional10 statute? That is, suppose the opinion read -- what would11 your objection -- I know you'll object to this possible12 opinion, and I want to hear what your objection is -- the13 opinion says they're complaining here, as far as we're14 concerned, with a serious tort, invasion of privacy, you15 know, a whole lot of really bad behavior, et cetera --16 they're complaining about that taking place by a17 California official in Nevada, and we can't really18 distinguish that from the automobile accident taking place19 in Nevada. They're both torts. They're both very bad --20 you know, this is worse conduct. Now, it's true that our21 investigation of this may interfere with California's tax22 authority's ability to sort of run investigations in23 general. But if that turns out to be a problem, a big24 problem, Congress can legislate.25 MR. LEATHERWOOD: Well, that still creates --191111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 that still creates the situation where Nevada is2 supervising and managing California's tax practices.3 QUESTION: Back to activities happening in4 Nevada.5 MR. LEATHERWOOD: Yeah. In this lawsuit -- this6 lawsuit is -- is being prosecuted -- is being investigated7 almost exclusively in California. The -- the intrusion8 here, the interference here, is that Nevada has permitted9 Mr.Hyatttousethislawsuitbothasa--asawallanda10 battering ram. It has almost suppressed the entire11 California tax investigation. It's creating an entire12 class of possible plaintiffs that can sue California just13 for literally going across the state line and making an14 inquiry as to whether or not a former California resident,15 a former California taxpayer, actually owes any taxes.16 QUESTION: Well, they would have to show its an17 intentional -- whatever that means under Nevada law -- not18 just negligent wouldn't they --19 MR. LEATHERWOOD: Well, the intentional act here20 is that California created a tax system in bad faith to --21 bad faith to extort an exit -- an exit tax from -- from a22 taxpayer.23 QUESTION: I thought that, again, the Nevada24 Supreme Court said, we are not going to touch the question25 of where this man was domiciled. That's for California to201111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425decide. What we are dealing with is this new thing. One allegation was trespass and going through the man's trash, and another was calling -- maybe the calls emanated in California -- calling people in Nevada insinuating bad things about this person. And that has nothing to do with where the man is domiciled. It's a question that California is deciding and Nevada says it won't touch.MR. LEATHERWOOD: Yeah, and I would -- I would direct the Court to Joint Appendix 133, where -- where the Court would -- the Nevada courts have indicated that almost all the action in this -- in this lawsuit occurred in California. And --QUESTION: Well, you -- you recognized that there were two trips into California.MR. LEATHERWOOD: Actually, Your Honor -- QUESTION: I mean, to Nevada.MR. LEATHERWOOD: Actually, Your Honor, Ibelieve there were three trips, and they were short trips -- they were trips of extremely short duration.QUESTION: And what was there about -- on one of those trips, there was a trespass on his property and rummaging through his trash.MR. LEATHERWOOD: Well, that's not part of -- that's not part of the allegations of the -- of the complaint itself. The complaint is saying that --211111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: It was a more -- a more general interference with his privacy, but those were examples that were alleged, if not in the complaint, somewhere.MR. LEATHERWOOD: No, there has been deposition testimony that there -- on one of the trips, that the investigator looked at the timing of Mr. -- of Respondent's trash delivery and also looked at -- determined whether or not Respondent was receiving any mail at that particular location. That does not justify the pervasive nature and the extent in which this lawsuit has reached into California and literally attacked the tax process.And, once again, I will refer the Court to the Joint Appendix at page 60, where it is alleged that the California tax system itself is a -- is a fraud -- that is, put together in bad faith for the specific purpose of extorting an exit tax from former residents who -- as they leave California.Well, if the Court has no more questions in this regard, I would like --QUESTION: Do you want to reserve your time, Mr. Leatherwood?MR. LEATHERWOOD: -- reserve the balance of my time, thank you.QUESTION: Very well.221111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Mr. Farr, we'll hear from you. ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARRON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTMR. FARR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and mayit please the Court:In our federal system, it's recognized that thestates will sometimes have overlapping jurisdiction. When that happens, the Constitution allows each state to apply its own laws against the background principle of comity where they believe it would be appropriate to defer to the laws of another state. And I submit that the Nevada courts here have applied these principles very carefully.Nevada, of course, correctly held that they were not required to apply California's legislative-created law of immunity. At the same time, however, they have applied principles of comity to strike out the declaratory judgment count that would have gone to the very issue that is being contested in the Florida -- excuse me -- in the California tax proceeding, which is the date thatMr. Hyatt moved to Nevada. And they have also given California complete immunity for any negligence that it has committed.So in this case, it seems to me, the system is working --QUESTION: Mr. Farr, can I ask you, do you think231111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 they were compelled by the Full Faith and Credit Clause to2 grant immunity on the negligence claim?3 MR. FARR: That's an interesting question,4 Justice Stevens, because Nevada officials themselves have5 immunity. There would be a question, I suppose, of6 whether the Full Faith and Credit Clause requires that.7 My general feeling is probably not, but that is really not8 a question so much of whether -- a choice of law between9 California law and Nevada law, but simply a question of10 what Nevada law would apply. So I don't think that the11 Full Faith and Credit Clause itself speaks to that issue,12 but I do think principles of comity will traditionally13 reach that result. And, in fact --14 QUESTION: Well, are principles of comity15 dictated by the Constitution? Suppose --16 MR. FARR: They are --17 QUESTION: -- suppose Nevada said they were not18 going to grant comity?19 MR. FARR: That's correct, yes. And I don't20 think there is a federally enforceable law of state21 comity, but I think that is the system that has existed22 essentially between sovereigns for much longer than the23 United States is --24 QUESTION: Well, is it your position then the25 private plaintiff can always bring suit against a state in241111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 the courts of another state?2 MR. FARR: Well, the first question, of course,3 is whether the court has legislative -- the first Full4 Faith and Credit question is whether the court in which5 the suit is brought has legislative jurisdiction. So6 there is a requirement that that state have7 constitutionally sufficient contacts with the law --8 QUESTION: Well, then under due process. Well,9 that's easy to satisfy.10 MR. FARR: So11 that, they are entitled12 question is whether the13 that point the state is14 protect its own interests. I think that's what the Full15 Faith and Credit Clause allows. And it is the doctrine of16 comity that provides the acknowledgment of the state --17 the other state's interests. And that's typically, inassuming that they've satisfied to bring a suit. Then thestate -- and I -- and I believe at free to apply its own laws to￼18 fact, what's happened since Nevada --19 QUESTION: It's very --20 MR. FARR: -- versus Hall --21 QUESTION: -- it's very odd to me that22 California can't be sued in its own courts and it can't be23 sued in a federal court, but it can be sued in a Nevada24 court, which, if we follow that declension really has the25 -- has the least interest in maintaining the dignity of251111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 the State of California.2 MR. FARR: Well, there are two -- two factors3 here, Justice Kennedy. First of all, there is the fact4 that Nevada has some very real interests of its own, its5 own sovereign interests to protect here. I mean, there6 have been torts which were both committed in Nevada and7 directed at a Nevada resident. So, to begin with, before8 one gets to the immunity question, Nevada, as a sovereign9 state, has important interests in assuring compensation10 and also in deterring that kind of conduct. So the idea11 that a legislatively created immunity by another state12 should be13 interests1415 inherent immunity, the very idea that a state should have16 to be subject to sue in the courts of another state, I17 think, first of all, as you know, we don't believe that18 issue is properly presented on the question presented in19 this case. But if you would like me to address it just20 for a moment, I think there -- there are differences if21 one looks to the -- to the way that the -- essentially22 immunity has been resolved in -- in the course of -- of23 the United States.24 First of all, in its own courts, it has the25 common-law immunity based on the idea that it is both the261111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005able to prevent Nevada from protecting those seems inconsistent with the federal system. Now, if one goes beyond that to the question of￼1 king being sued in its own court, and also typically it is2 also the progenitor of the law, so to speak, to Justice3 Holmes' point.4 In the United States, there's -- the courts of5 the United States, there's a very specific situation. At6 the time of the convention, the states were, obviously,7 forming a new sovereign, and the question of whether that8 sovereign was going to grant them the immunity they had in9 their own courts or whether that sovereign would be in the10 same position essentially as foreign sovereigns typically11 were, which is that they did not have to provide12 sovereignty except as a matter of comity. That's The13 Schooner Exchange opinion.14 But -- so the states, at that point, had a very15 real interest in deciding that question, and they did, in16 fact, decide that question, as the court has recognized.17 That is not true with respect to the immunity that they18 have had in the courts of other states.19 QUESTION: Is -- how does Alden fit into this?20 In Alden, I take it the court now -- we've held that a21 citizen of Maine suing in the State of Maine's courts22 alleging that Maine had violated a federal law can't do23 it. Sovereign immunity. Right? That's Alden.24 All right. Suppose the citizen of Maine walks25 into a New Hampshire court and brings the same lawsuit271111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425against Maine, assuming New Hampshire has appropriate jurisdiction under its own laws.MR. FARR: Uh-huh.QUESTION: Do we get a different result?MR. FARR: Okay, I think that is not a questionthat is within the notion of the question in this case. QUESTION: No, no, well --MR. FARR: I'm sorry. I --QUESTION: -- you see, what I --MR. FARR: Excuse me.QUESTION: -- nonetheless, although --MR. FARR: No, I --QUESTION: -- what I'm trying to do is -- issort out what, in my mind, are a set of impossible anomalies, and that's why I ask you that question.￼MR. FARR: the wrong way.QUESTION:MR. FARR: point, always, that question presented. QUESTION: MR. FARR:I'm sorry. I started to answer inGo ahead.What I -- I reserve, of course, the I don't believe this is within theYeah, yeah, of course.But I actually was going -- what I meant to say is that I don't think it's the same kind ofquestion in the sense that I think still when you're281111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 talking about enforcement of a federal cause of action in2 another state, that3 question.4 QUESTION:5 MR. FARR:6 QUESTION:7 MR. FARR:8 QUESTION:9 Alden cannot be avoided simply by the Maine citizen10 walking into a New Hampshire court and bringing the same11 case.12 MR. FARR: That's correct.13 QUESTION: All right.14 MR. FARR: I think that is --15 QUESTION: And I would guess that's right.16 MR. FARR: -- still a federal-state --17 QUESTION: All right, assuming that's right --18 MR. FARR: -- I think that is still a federal-19 state issue.20 QUESTION: -- assuming that's right, now, look21 at the tremendous anomaly, which you were just about to22 address, and I want to be sure you do. Our citizen of23 Maine walks into the New Hampshire court and sues the24 State of Maine under federal law. And the answer is, he25 can't do it because of sovereign immunity. Our citizen of291111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005is still really a federal-stateSee, but --That's still ---- your answer, then -- -- an evolving question.-- your answer to my question is￼1 Maine does the same thing, but this time his cause of2 action is 345 two cases6 the first7 in the second case, and he can, which, of course, means8 that the law of New Hampshire binds Maine in a way that9 federal law cannot. Now, that, to me, I just can't --state law. And now you say he can do it.MR. FARR: That's right. And --QUESTION: And the only difference between the is that his cause of action is federal law in case, and he can't sue the state; but state law10 that, to me, seems so anomalous that -- that I'd like an11 explanation --12 MR. FARR: Well --13 QUESTION: -- if you can give it. And you see14 how I'm thinking of it as connected here, because the15 facts here are just part of that general anomaly.16 MR. FARR: That's correct. Actually, Justice17 Breyer, I think that's something that the court, to some18 extent, addressed in Alden itself --19 QUESTION: Uh-huh.20 MR. FARR: -- in distinguishing the opinion in21 Nevada versus Hall, when it noted that when you get into22 the situation of a state being sued in the courts of23 another state and, as in Nevada versus Hall, under a state24 cause of action, you have now implicated the sovereignty25 of a second sovereign. So when one is now looking at the301111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 -- at the issues of sovereign immunity, one is looking at2 a different platform of issues and also at a different3 historical base.4 QUESTION: But that seems to make their case5 even harder. It would be difficult to conceive that the6 framers thought that Virginia could be sued in7 Pennsylvania but not in a federal court. I would think8 that the presumption would be that this was an even9 stronger case for the exercise of sovereign immunity than10 when all of the citizens of the union are involved as in11 the Alden situation --12 MR. FARR: Well, I think that --13 QUESTION: -- in the Eleventh Amendment.14 MR. FARR: I mean, I think that there are two15 things going on. I mean, first of all, the question is16 not whether they can be sued, but if not, why not. For17 example, with Pennsylvania and Virginia, as I'm sure the18 Court is aware, had a -- Nathan versus Virginia is a case19 in which that very situation came up. But in the courts20 of Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Attorney General urged21 its own courts to recognize sovereign immunity. So that22 could naturally fit within the idea that Schooner Exchange23 has made clear, which is that when you're talking about24 co-equal sovereigns of that nature, one is talking about25 sovereignty that -- excuse me, immunity that is extended311111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 as a matter of comity, not as a matter of absolute right2 of the other sovereign. And the reason is -- excuse me --3 the reason is that if you don't allow the sovereign to4 execute its own laws within its own territory, you're5 depriving that sovereign of part of its sovereignty.6 QUESTION: Well, doesn't our original7 jurisdiction as the states between states bear something8 on this question?9 MR. FARR: It bears a little bit. But, of10 course, Article III itself is not a exclusive jurisdiction11 provision. The Section 1251 provides exclusive12 jurisdiction with respect to suits between states.13 QUESTION: The idea that the framers would14 provide for its original jurisdiction in the Supreme Court15 in -- for suits by one state against another suggests they16 thought it might be pretty hard to bring such a suit17 anywhere else.18 MR. FARR: Well, and they -- certainly as a19 practical matter, they would have been right, Mr. Chief20 Justice. I mean, as a practical matter, it has always21 been difficult to bring a suit against a state, either in22 its own courts or in the courts of another state. I mean,23 even since Nevada versus Hall, typically states have24 granted immunity to other states for when they're sued in25 their own courts. And if they haven't granted absolute321111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 immunity, what they have done, which I think is an2 important principle emerging -- emerging principle of3 comity, is they have tended to look at their own immunity4 to see what kinds of suits could be brought against them5 and to try, then, to grant to the -- to the outside6 sovereign that same type of immunity.7 QUESTION: Mr. Farr, have you found other8 examples around the country of suits by citizensof one courts?is it9 state against another state in the other state's10 MR. FARR: I --11 QUESTION: Is this relatively rare, or12 happening? And in what context is it happening?13 MR. FARR: It's relatively rare, and -- but14 there have been some suits. There are a few of them cited15 in our red brief, if I can find the page number, pages 3816 and 39. The -- there are suits, for example, negligence17 suits involving the release of dangerous persons within18 another state who have created injury to citizens --￼19 QUESTION: Uh-huh.20 MR. FARR: -- of that state. There are more21 commercial-type things involving contracts or -- one, in22 particular, is a it for invasion of privacy when someone23 who wrote a book disclosed information. In general,24 though, Justice O'Connor, as I say, some of those suits,25 the courts have just said, we're not going to hear them331111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425whether you have a valid cause of action or not. We're simply not going to -- going to recognize that in our courts because of the sovereignty of the defendant. Other courts have said, yes, we will open our courts, but we are going to look to our own immunity to try to have essentially a baseline to measure the sort of immunity that we are going to --QUESTION: Mr. Farr, are you saying --MR. FARR: -- accept.QUESTION: -- that that, too, is just a matterof comity?MR. FARR: I do think that that's --QUESTION: Doesn't --MR. FARR: -- just a matter -- QUESTION: -- doesn't the PrivilegesImmunities Clause of Article IV have somethingyou can treat a tax collector from California differently from the tax collector in Nevada, you're not giving theirtax collectors equalMR. FARR: that the question --QUESTION:only stopper was a notion of comity, and I'm suggesting that you might not be able to treat two officials, one from out of state, one from in state, to treat -- to favor341111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005privileges and immunities in Nevada.If one granted lesser immunity? IsYes. If one -- you said that theand￼to say? If1 the in-state official. But maybe Privileges and2 Immunities have -- has something to do with that.3 MR. FARR: If a state is entitled as a defendant4 to invoke Privileges and Immunities against the courts of5 another state, I would think that's right. Certainly in6 the case --7 QUESTION: Is it?8 MR. FARR: I --9 QUESTION: I mean, I thought --10 MR. FARR: I would have thought not.11 QUESTION: -- that would go to individual12 liability, but it would -- it would not affect this13 question, but I may be wrong.14 MR. FARR: Well, no, I -- that would be my15 assumption, also, Justice Souter. I think that the -- the16 Privileges and Immunities and Equal Protection are -- are17 provisions that apply to individuals who are claiming18 discrimination in -- in another state. I don't think they19 would apply directly to a state.20 But, as I say, the -- the notion that comity is21 -- is something that -- that doesn't have a force, even22 though it's not federal enforceable, it seems to me is a23 little bit of a misperception. Because, again, if one24 goes back to the notion of the law of nations or separate25 sovereigns, comity essentially has been the provision that351111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 governs their relations since well before the convention.2 QUESTION: Well, there is some reluctance to say3 that California officials can run amok in Nevada without4 Nevada being able to do anything about it. I suppose if5 it were a pervasive practice, Nevada might be able to sue6 California in the original jurisdiction under some parens7 patriae theory. I'm not sure about that.8 MR. FARR: Well, I mean, let me suggest a couple9 of other possibilities, Justice Kennedy, as well. I don't10 -- I don't know whether the court would take original11 jurisdiction of that question or not, but, I mean, the12 most direct example of something states could do,13 obviously, is they could reach agreements between14 themselves. I mean, there have been two cases before this15 court involving suits against states in the courts of16 other states. One was Nevada in California's courts.17 This is California in Nevada's courts. If those states,18 who are neighboring states, feel that this is an issue19 that they need to address, they could reach some sort of20 agreement and, therefore, have reciprocal legislation.21 And, for example, under the Full Faith and22 Credit Clause for years, as the Court may know, there is a23 doctrine that said that states didn't have to enforce the24 penal laws of another state, even though Full Faith and25 Credit, on its face, would make you feel that maybe they361111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425would have to.But, in fact, states eventually began, throughreciprocal agreements in decisions, and I think in legislation also, to say, you know, we essentially will enforce the penal laws or the tax laws of other states, so long as they do for us. So, again, the states --QUESTION: Penal laws or penal judgments?MR. FARR: No, no, penal judgments, the court said in -- in Milwaukee County, have to be enforced, but they -- they distinguished at that point, Mr. Chief Justice, the idea that a law itself would have to be enforced before it had been reduced to --QUESTION: Right, but what -- what -- what is the -- I don't want to -- I don't want you to get distracted, because I thought Justice Ginsberg and maybe Justice Kennedy and I were driving at the same problem, which is that imagine Nevada v. Hall is good law. All right, now, the question comes up, How do you prevent Nevada from going wild? All right. And so now we have several answers: (a), Congress can pass a statute --MR. FARR: Correct.QUESTION: -- (b) interstate compacts -- that was what you were suggesting.MR. FARR: And -- and -- QUESTION: All right.371111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. FARR: -- if I may --2 QUESTION: Yeah, the --3 MR. FARR: -- if I may intercede, it doesn't4 necessarily even have to be a compact. I'm not sure --5 QUESTION: Right, some --6 MR. FARR: -- it's agreements that have to be7 proven.8 QUESTION: -- kind of a voluntary action by the9 states.10 MR. FARR: Right, correct.11 QUESTION: (c) Privileges and Immunities, which12 has the problem that it refers to citizens and not states,13 (d) equal protection doesn't work, I don't think, because14 it says, again, citizens. A due process clause, is a15 state a person under the Due Process Clause?16 (e), what's (e)? I mean, you see? If Nevada --17 (e) is, of course, footnote 24, but then that gets us into18 the National League of Cities problem. And so National19 League of Cities --20 MR. FARR: Well, there could --21 QUESTION: -- that -- that -- that approach --22 equal -- no, Privileges and Immunities, due process of23 law, voluntary action states, Congress enacts a law,24 anything else? Have we got -- is that the exhaustive list25 that we must choose from?381111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 45 if -- if6 alternative is overrule Nevada v. Hall.7 QUESTION: Is --MR. FARR: It's --QUESTION: Or --MR. FARR: -- it seems exhaustive --QUESTION: And the only -- all right, that's -- nothing in that list works, then the only8 QUESTION: -- or, excuse me --9 QUESTION: -- is comity on10 MR. FARR: Well, comity --11 QUESTION: Well, I mean --12 MR. FARR: -- excuse me --13 QUESTION: Comity -- comity is not the answer to14 the problem, because -- well, it is, in a sense. It is,15 in a sense.16 MR. FARR: Yeah, I mean --17 QUESTION: Voluntary restraint.18 MR. FARR: Excuse me. I don't -- I certainly19 don't mean to minimize the theoretical possibility that20 suits in courts of one state could ultimately prove to be21 a problem, generally. What I'm suggesting is that there22 is nothing, first of all, in the history of the Full Faith23 and Credit Clause that would suggest that once a state has24 proper legislative jurisdiction, as I think everybody25 concedes that Nevada does here, that somehow that clause391111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005the list?ImeanI-- comity is --￼1 was intended to displace the law of that state simply2 because another state had made different policy choices3 about, let's say, here, compensation and immunity.4 QUESTION: But can you say that categorically5 and absolutely? I mean, there are all sorts of6 permutations of facts that could come up.7 MR. FARR: Well, what -- the permutations of8 facts, I think, go particularly to what constitutes9 legislative jurisdiction. So perhaps in that sense, my10 statement is broader, or seems broader in the context of11 thiscasethanImeanittobe. ButIdo--butIdo12 think, in general, that I don't see any warrant in the13 Full Faith and Credit Clause, given the fact that it was14 enacted with very little debate, and almost all of the15 debate was about judgments and not about enforcement of16 other states' laws, I think it would be stretching the17 clause beyond recognition to say that at some point it was18 -- it was telling states, you're going to have to set your19 laws aside and apply the laws of another state.20 QUESTION: There was a time in the '30s and '20s21 when this court came pretty close to that, the cases that22 preceded Pacific Employers.23 MR. FARR: That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.24 QUESTION: Clapper and Bradford.25 THE COURT Yes.401111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. FARR: That's correct. And as I think that2 as my argument might suggest, I think the Court was3 correct to essentially back away from that kind of4 balancing test and essentially go back to the principle of5 saying when a state is competent to legislate, then it may6 apply its own laws, leaving the additional questions about7 what might happen at that point to questions of comity8 where a state is the defendant. And, as I've suggested,9 Nevada courts have shown considerable comity already here,10 and the case, of course, is not yet concluded.11 QUESTION: Comity is something like a hearty12 handshake. I mean, it -- it's something that you can't13 put any -- any force to.14 MR. FARR: That's -- that's true in one sense,15 Mr. Chief Justice. I mean, when I say it's not -- that16 there's no federally enforceable state law of comity, I --17 that's true. But at the same time, I mean, the Court's18 decisions about comity since back in the late 18th century19 have emphasized that it is a serious doctrine. It's a20 doctrine built of respect for -- for other sovereigns.21 And in particular -- and I think this -- this is -- also22 goes to the practical problem that Justices Kennedy and23 Breyer are asking about -- it also does have a healthy24 measure of self interest in it.25 I mean, when -- when you are talking about co-411111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425equal sovereigns, any sovereign that is exercising jurisdiction over another sovereign understands that that's -- the first sovereign -- or the second sovereign has the same power and authority over it.QUESTION: Is -- is the question of comity one that has a federal component so that this court should weigh in on when it has to be exercised?MR. FARR: I don't believe so state versus state, Justice O'Connor. Or course, in the -- in the types of cases that the board was referring to this morning, like McNary, there are comity elements. And there -- and there is a jurisprudence of this court with respect to federal and state relations which does depend on comity, and that is, of course, federally enforceable. I don't believe that there is a concomitant enforceable doctrine --QUESTION: But you're arguing --MR. FARR: -- state to state.QUESTION: Even in the face -- even in the faceof some development by state -- a state court that seems totally out of whack with our constitutional structure?MR. FARR: Well, Justice O'Connor, I suppose I should --QUESTION: Are there no extremes? Is there no limitation?421111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. FARR: Well, I -- I mean, I'm -- I suppose I2 should pause in the sense that -- that if there is3 something that is so threatening to the constitutional4 structure and something for which there is no historical5 basis in -- in terms of the -- the way that sovereigns6 deal with each other. Now, see, that's -- that's where I7 think this case is very different, because even though8 there was certainly a practical tradition that states were9 not to be sued in other states, as I say, since Schooner10 Exchange, and, indeed, in Verlinden in 1980, this Court11 has always taken the position that when you're talking12 about relationships between sovereigns, and they're co­13 equal sovereigns, and the issue is immunity between them,14 that is a matter of comity.15 QUESTION: All right, but leave -- say, this16 case, I can easily see on your theory writing the part of17 the opinion that says the acts in Nevada, the acts in18 Nevada that were arguably torts are certainly up to Nevada19 to pursue. But the discovery commissioner here, they say,20 went way too far in ordering discovery and ordered21 discovery that would have been relevant only to negligent22 action and only negligent action, really, that took place23 in California, though a Nevada resident was at issue. And24 they can't do that, says the opinion, because -- because25 -- and now this is where it seems to me there -- something431111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425-- what do I fill that blank with. They can't do that. They can't go over and, in Nevada, complain about negligent action as this discovery commissioner may have done, negligent action in California aimed at a Nevada resident where it's a tax action. They can't do that because -- and now what? You see -- do you see what's bothering me?I -- at this point, it seems to me there has to be something in the Constitution that limits that, and this case may raise that problem because of the actions of the discovery commissioner. And, therefore, I think I need something to fill that blank with.MR. FARR: Well, as -- I don't think, to startwith, that the answer is the Full Faith and QUESTION: All right, what is it?MR. FARR: I mean --QUESTION: I --it'sanodd--an vehicle, Full Faith --Credit Clause.awkward￼MR. FARR: Right.QUESTION: -- but what is the answer?MR. FARR: Well, I mean, I still think that, inthe end, the answer is that this is a matter that one trusts to the judgment of states --QUESTION: So the answer is if they want to do that, they can do it.441111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. FARR: -- that if, in fact, there is a question about discovery, that --QUESTION: Uh-huh.MR. FARR: -- I mean, that I -- accepting the characterization, although I dispute it to some extent, but to the extent there's a question about discovery, that is simply part and parcel of the states being able to exercise their jurisdiction. I don't --QUESTION: I thought discovery was -- QUESTION: Okay.QUESTION: -- interlocutory. I thought that wecouldn't write in an opinion, as Justice Breyer has suggested, if I didn't think that that question was currently reviewable.MR. FARR: Well, there's certainly nothing specifically in the question presented about discovery. The -- the -- the -- again, to come back to the question presented, because we've discussed a wide range of issues, most of which I don't think are within the question presented, but when we come back to the question presented, the question is basically was the Nevada or the Nevada courts required to dismiss this action on summary judgment because of California's law of immunity? And -- and the reason for that is because, according to California, the Full Faith and Credit Clause requires451111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 Nevada to 234enforce California's law of immunity. QUESTION: Mr. Farr --MR. FARR: Our view is -- yeah?QUESTION: -- do I understand -- your comity5 argument basically is -- it's kind a self-executing thing,6 because each time a state has to answer the comity7 question, it asks the question, what would I do if the8 tables were reversed? And as history teaches us, they9 generally treat the other sovereign the way they would10 want to be treated themselves. And that's --11 MR. FARR: Well --12 QUESTION: -- well, that's the rule that seems13 to have been developed without any overriding14 constitutional command order here.15 MR. FARR: That's correct, Justice Stevens. And,16 in fact, they have become more specific in applying17 comity, I believe, in saying we want to treat the other18 sovereign as we do treat ourselves, not just as we want to19 be treated. We are treating the other sovereign the way20 we treat ourselves.21 QUESTION: What if the -- what if the case came,22 and they didn't do it? Justice Breyer's question, how do23 I fill in the blank? I -- if, let's say, through this24 intrusive discovery process, systematically applied, they25 really were interfering with California's taxation,461111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425couldn't California bring an original action to enjoin this interference?MR. FARR: I certainly think that's possible. And, of course, as I've said, I mean, California can try to talk to Nevada and try to reach agreement at a sovereign level about this, or if, in fact -- the Full Faith and Credit Clause has a specific express commitment to Congress of the right to declare the effects of other laws.QUESTION: What would be the underlying -- QUESTION: Underlying --QUESTION: -- substantive law in JusticeSouter's proposed original action?MR. FARR: The -- I suppose, I mean, based onwhat California has said before -- said up to now, itwould bring it under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, that it would say that there is some requirement --QUESTION: Well, but we wouldn't need an original action for the Full Faith and Credit Clause. If that's so, it could apply in this case.MR. FARR: That's correct. I mean, whether they're --QUESTION: So what's the -- what would an original action -- there was -- there's no underlying substantive standard to apply?471111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. FARR: I mean, the question would be, is there -- obviously, the question that's being raised. I am not aware of the federal substantive standard --QUESTION: We haven't --MR. FARR: -- that says --QUESTION: -- in boundary cases, though,adopted, as a federal rule, something maybe different from the law of either state.MR. FARR: That's correct. Now, you do have -- there are certain cases, in fact, in which you can't haveoverlapping jurisdiction, where you can't own the same water, you can't own the same land, you can't escheat the same property. So that's true. The court has addressed those kinds of cases.In a situation where you're simply sayinganother state is applying its laws, I prefer that they apply our laws, and I'm troubled by the discovery that they have -- they have allowed in applying their own laws, I'm not sure what the federal principle --QUESTION: It's not simply that --MR. FARR: -- is that entitles you to stop it. QUESTION: -- it's a prior action pending.That's what makes this case different, and one of the things that makes it different from Nevada v. Hall. Why is it -- is the California proceeding ongoing? Isn't it481111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425normal for a second court to stay its operations so it won't interfere with that prior action?MR. FARR: It -- in fact, the Nevada court dismissed the declaratory judgment action precisely because it didn't want to get into the question that was at issue in the California proceeding.QUESTION: Yes, but what about the intrusive discovery?MR. FARR: Well, most of the -- most of the other material -- with one exception, most of the other issues involved things that have nothing to do with the merits of the California inquiry. I mean, whether confidential information has been improperly disclosed has -- is not -- does not require you to adjudicate the California tax liability in order to understand that. The only thing that has any bearing that is close to that, I submit, is something that is roughly akin to like a malicious prosecution suit. And tort law itself, over time, takes care of that. We've not gotten to that issue yet in the Nevada Supreme Court.QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Farr.Mr. Leatherwood, you have five minutes remaining.REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF FELIX LEATHERWOOD ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER491111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. LEATHERWOOD: Thank you, Your Honor.2 In this particular case, I'd like to go back to3 Justice Breyer's thumbscrew example. I don't think the4 Full Faith and Credit Clause would actually force Cal --5 force Nevada to apply -- apply a California thumbscrew6 statute, because that would actually be outside the tax7 function.8 What I'm saying in this particular case what has9 happened is that Nevada's failure to give us back to10 California's immunity statute has resulted in interference11 with California's tax system. If this court does not12 intervene and give us back to our particular proposed13 test, which would look into California to see whether or14 not we would grant immunity, then essentially that would15 permit any defendant any form of taxpayer to run to the16 border and literally sue the State of California or any17 other state to prevent the enforcement of that particular18 statute.19 In addition, I pointed out that this gives20 another state the power to intrude into the actual21 operation of another state, and that's what has happened22 here.23 There has been some -- some discussion as to24 whether or not Nevada has legislative jurisdiction. We25 concede that they have legislative jurisdiction over the501111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425tort. But we -- what we complain about is that they won't respect our legislative jurisdiction or our tax process over our immunity laws, and that is our particular complaint.We submit the case.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Leatherwood. The case is submitted.(Whereupon, at 11:59 a.m., the case in the above-entitled matter was submitted.)￼511111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005
