Hurley Henson.Mr. Alsobrook.ORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY B. ALSOBROOK, JR.ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. ALSOBROOK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:In Kikkonen v. Guardian Life, this Courthypothesized the very situation that we have before you this morning because here we have a nationwide class action settlement where the court specifically by judgment retained jurisdiction to manage the settlement as well as enforce it. A critical part of that settlement was the dismissal of this case. However, when class counsel went to dismiss the case, as the Eleventh Circuit pointed out and as the district court pointed out, his efforts were thwarted and the case was not dismissed.QUESTION: Mr. Alsobrook, I see you've changed the question presented from the time in your certiorari petition to your opening brief. And the question presented, when we granted, referred to 28 U.S.C., section 1441, and now you have dropped your reference to that.31111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Does that mean you're abandoning reliance on 1441 or simply broadening the question?MR. ALSOBROOK: No, sir. We -- we're saying that under 1441 that because the district court retained jurisdiction, that that was original jurisdiction to remove the matter, and that actually, Your Honor, when we removed this, they -- the majority of circuit courts of appeals, namely the second, sixth, seventh, and eighth, had said that the proper vehicle to remove this was the All Writs Act. And that is what we are claiming today, as well as 28 U.S.C. 1367 ancillary jurisdiction, and we have set that out in our brief.QUESTION: But you have no right to remove under 1441 because there wasn't complete diversity in the Louisiana suit. Isn't that right?MR. ALSOBROOK: That is correct.QUESTION: So you can't rely on 1441 and that's conceded.MR. ALSOBROOK: We -- we can -- our reliance on 1441 was based on the fact that the Alabama court retained original jurisdiction and --QUESTION: But that's not -- nothing in 41 rests on that. It has to be a case that would qualify for original jurisdiction, and you don't have that.MR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, Your Honor, but we -- we41111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425construed that as being a venue rather than a -- a -- because the Alabama court had original jurisdiction.And certainly under 1651 --QUESTION: What did you construe as being venue? MR. ALSOBROOK: The -- the fact that we had totake it to a Federal court in the district where the State court suit lay, and then it was immediately transferred to the -- to the Alabama court.QUESTION: Yes, you -- you can't remove a case to a Federal court outside of the district in which the State court sat, is my understanding.MR. ALSOBROOK: That's right, Your Honor.We took -- we took our road map from Agent Orange Product Liability. There they had a Texas --￼Circuit.QUESTION: Who is they?MR. ALSOBROOK: There, there was a --QUESTION: What court are you talking about? MR. ALSOBROOK: We're talking about the Second And --QUESTION: Initially the Eastern District of NewYork, Judge Weinstein's -- MR. ALSOBROOK: Yes.QUESTION: -- order, which was in no way based on 1441. It was based on 1651.MR. ALSOBROOK: But, Your Honor, also in that51111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425case was the case of Ryan, and in Ryan, it was brought by to class members in the State court in Texas. And it was removed to the Federal court in Texas and then transferred to the Eastern District of New York. And that was our road map for getting this case to -- back to Alabama.QUESTION: But that was all done under the All Writs Act or what they thought was the authority granted by 1651.MR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, and we also, Your Honor -- in our removal petition, we pled the All Writs Act, as well as ancillary jurisdiction under 1367.QUESTION: Well, what is your theory under the All Writs Act? Is your theory that removal is itself -- comes under the All Writs Act?MR. ALSOBROOK: We contend that -- that in order for the Court --￼no?QUESTION: Can't you answer the question yes orMR. ALSOBROOK: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yes.QUESTION: I thought the All Writs Act required the existence of some sort of a common law writ like certiorari or prohibition or injunction or something like that. There -- there never was a common law writ of removal.MR. ALSOBROOK: That is correct, Your Honor.61111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425But the jurisprudence, particularly the Agent Orange case --QUESTION: Well, but can you cite any of our cases that support you in this respect?MR. ALSOBROOK: Well, I can cite the New York Telephone case where the Court said that -- that removal was -- not removal, but a writ under the All Writs Act was -- was proper to avoid the frustration of judgment, and that was -- that was certainly the situation here.QUESTION: But -- but that was a different -- that was an existing writ. Here -- here you're saying, in effect, that removal is -- is itself a writ. And I simply don't see how the cases support you there.MR. ALSOBROOK: I agree with that, Your Honor.QUESTION: Do you agree that the All Writs Act is not a source of original jurisdiction?MR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, ma'am. Yes, Your Honor, bythe --QUESTION: Why -- why then didn't you try to get an injunction in the district court in Alabama?MR. ALSOBROOK: There were two reasons, Justice O'Connor. First is that an injunction would not dismiss the case. An injunction would enjoin the -- the State court suit from going forward.QUESTION: Yes.71111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. ALSOBROOK: And we would have had -- our client would have had to carry this as a liability on their books ad infinitum.QUESTION: Well, couldn't the injunction have ordered the party to dismiss the case?MR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, they did -- they could, Your Honor, and --QUESTION: But then why -- why wouldn't that be sufficient?MR. ALSOBROOK: I suppose it would have been.QUESTION: But if that's so, then why don't -- why are we trying to read into 1441 language that isn't there and read requirements out of 1651, requirements that are there, when there was another way, totally consistent with the words, the statute, everything else, that you could have achieved any legitimate objective that you had?MR. ALSOBROOK: Well, Justice Breyer, at the time that we did this, as I said earlier, there was -- the majority of Federal circuit courts said that the proper vehicle was to remove the case and get it before the court where -- that had issued the judgment. Today with the number of class action settlements that are going on, there must be some kind of way by which a Federal court who issues a judgment can enforce that judgment across State lines.81111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: There is. Isn't that just in your2 answer to Justice O'Connor and Justice Kennedy? You3 provided the way.4 MR. ALSOBROOK: Yes.5 QUESTION: The -- the only loose end, it seems6 to me, that -- that you have left, after your answers to7 Justices O'Connor and Kennedy, is the problem you say your8 client would have in carrying liability on the books until9 the second action was somehow finally terminated. But10 isn't the answer to that that once you had gotten either11 the injunction or simply the -- the order to the parties12 under the retained jurisdiction, you then could have gone13 into court in the second suit and said, they cannot14 prosecute the suit? It has been enjoined. Therefore,15 please dismiss it. Wouldn't you have gotten your16 dismissal17 liability18 19and wouldn't that have taken the -- theoff the book?MR. ALSOBROOK: I don't know, Your Honor. QUESTION: Well, I -- I guess why wouldn't that the appropriate course?￼20 have been 2122 court under those circumstances would dismiss it, but we23 don't know that as a matter of fact.24 QUESTION: I -- I was thinking about different25 writs, and you've researched this more thoroughly than I,MR. ALSOBROOK: I -- I presume that the State91111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425I suspect. I thought the closest thing here was a writ of certiorari. This is like a writ of certiorari, but a writ of certiorari is from a superior court to an inferior court. And I -- I don't think that's the way we treat State courts and Federal courts.MR. ALSOBROOK: That is correct, Your Honor. And another reason --QUESTION: And -- and -- which -- and so that the absence of that kind of -- of writ indicates to me that the safer course, the more prudent course is to rely on the standard equitable remedies such as injunction that we've been discussing.MR. ALSOBROOK: That is correct, Your Honor.QUESTION: Except that a lot of other lawyers had -- had relied on the course that you relied on.MR. ALSOBROOK: That's correct, and a lot of --QUESTION: You were following what had been a successful course in the past.￼judges.MR. ALSOBROOK: And not only that, a lot ofQUESTION: Well, to be sure.MR. ALSOBROOK: And so there were a plethora of district court cases that allowed the removal under the All Writs Act and took jurisdiction where they had jurisdiction originally under the cases of NAACP, under101111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 the Agent Orange case, and the Sixth and Seventh Circuit2 cases.3 QUESTION: Were there any cases under the4 relitigation exception to the Anti-Injunction Act that5 used that device, the antisuit injunction, to accomplish6 the same thing?7 MR. ALSOBROOK: Well, Your Honor, no. The Tenth8 Circuit had ruled that the -- that the All Writs Act could9 not be used in this -- in the method that we used it. We10 are not unmindful of Rivet v. Regions, but we -- our11 situation12 different1314 of fighting it out in the State court, and it's not the15 antisuit injunction that we're discussing now. Rivet said16 it's an -- preclusion is an affirmative defense. You can17 raise it in the State court that prior Federal litigation18 precludes this case.19 The other way to go is to ask the court that20 entered the judgment, the class action judgment, the21 nationwide class action, to enjoin the party who was22 supposed to have settled the claim from proceeding in the23 -- in the original case when part of the bargain was to24 dismiss it. So I -- I'm just curious why you didn't25 attempt that route.111111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005there -- our situation in this case is much --QUESTION: But that was -- that was a question￼1 MR. ALSOBROOK: We didn't attempt that, Your2 Honor, because the majority of the circuits at the time3 approved the All Writs Act as the vehicle with which to4 remove the case and to get it back before the district5 court.6 Additionally, we felt that it -- State courts7 have cases removed all the time to Federal court. And we8 thought it would be less onerous to the State court judge9 to have it removed rather than being enjoined by a Federal10 court.11 QUESTION: I don't understand that because right12 -- built right into the removal provision is a command13 that the State court shall proceed no further. So the14 removal petition acts as -- as a -- an injunction against15 the State court proceeding further.16 MR. ALSOBROOK: Well, the removal petition --17 actually the court loses jurisdiction of it at that time18 because they -- it -- it is removed to -- to the Federal19 court. And there again, Justice Ginsburg, the -- we felt20 that it was less onerous and there was some jurisprudence21 or some dicta and some legal writing that indicated that22 it would be less onerous to the State court judge to have23 it removed rather than have it enjoined.24 QUESTION: May I ask this question? Looking at25 the language of the All Writs Act, which authorizes all121111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 courts established by act of Congress to issue writs2 necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective3 jurisdictions and so forth.4 Now, in this case, you removed from the Federal5 -- to the Federal court in Louisiana in order to protect6 the jurisdiction of the Federal court in Alabama.789 language,1011 had to rely on Agent Orange.12 QUESTION: You don't rely on the statute,13 though.14 MR. ALSOBROOK: Well, we relied on the statute15 because it says in the aid of their respective16 jurisdiction, and --17 QUESTION: Don't you think that refers to the18 court to which removal would take -- would occur? And19 here it's the Louisiana Federal court, not the Alabama20 Federal court.21 MR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, sir, and we -- it was our22 position that there -- there respective jurisdiction23 related to the Alabama court. That is our position.24 QUESTION: Even though you removed to the25 Louisiana court.131111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, sir.QUESTION: How do you square that with the respective jurisdictions?MR. ALSOBROOK: Well, Your Honor, there again we￼1 MR. ALSOBROOK: We had to, Your Honor. That --2 under 1441, we had no alternative but to remove it. We3 couldn't have removed it from the Louisiana court to the4 Alabama court because 1441 by venue says that it has to go5 to the Federal district court in the -- of the district6 where the case lies.7 QUESTION: But 1441 wasn't available to you. So8 as long as something new is being created in -- under9 1651, why not say that -- that the court that has10 jurisdiction over the class action can issue orders to11 stop inconsistent litigation?12 MR. ALSOBROOK: That could be done under the13 Anti-Injunction Act, Your Honor. There's no doubt about14 that. And as -- as --15 QUESTION: But do -- as far as -- you're16 creating a removal that doesn't exist by statute. So not17 -- why not go all the way and say, under the All Writs18 Act, we can remove to the -- from the Louisiana State19 court to the Alabama court? Why touch base with 1441 when20 1441 is inapplicable?21 MR. ALSOBROOK: Because 14 -- we didn't know of22 any other vehicle that would allow us to remove it from23 Louisiana to Alabama. Even the All Writs Act would not24 allow us to remove it across State lines or even out of25 the district. Certainly if this case had been brought in141111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Mobile, then we wouldn't be here today because the -- the2 court in Mobile would have authority to -- to remove it to3 that district. But it was brought -- brought across State4 lines. And again, we followed the road map that had been5 set out for us in Agent Orange.6 QUESTION: But you still have problems even if7 it were to the Middle District of Alabama, because you8 don't have complete diversity in the Louisiana action.9 Therefore, 1441 doesn't apply. You would still have to10 use your All Writs Act theory even if the case were11 pending -- if the Federal and State court were in the same12 State.13 MR. ALSOBROOK: Well, Your Honor, we feel that14 -- that under -- under the hypothet set out in Kikkonen15 that the Alabama court would have had jurisdiction to take16 that case.17 QUESTION: Mr. Alsobrook, what is -- what is18 this writ called? I mean, Lyndon Johnson is -- is once19 supposed to have asked somebody in the Justice Department20 to get him a writ of fixitatis.21 (Laughter.)22 QUESTION: What -- what is this writ called? A23 writ of removal?24 MR. ALSOBROOK: This could be a -- well, there25 is no writ for this, Judge -- Justice. There isn't any151111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425writ for this.QUESTION: Well -- well, then how can you do itunder the All Writs Act?MR. ALSOBROOK: Because in other cases, the AllWrits Act has been used to -- to remove cases to avoid a State court case from thwarting a Federal judgment.QUESTION: Certiorari I guess is the closest. Historically you could have sent certiorari -- a court to any other court and to any administrative agency. I guess that would be the closest historically. Would it?MR. ALSOBROOK: Well, I think Justice Kennedy brought that up and --QUESTION: Yes. As we've come to limit it, it's -- it's higher to lower, but if you go back into history, it wasn't, I don't think. I mean, has it come down to saying, look, you were in a situation where you thought that the signer of the stipulation was flat out violating it, and you didn't know what to do, so you read the precedent, and there was precedent that suggested, under the lower court precedent, that this was the right thing to do. So you did it.MR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, sir.QUESTION: Okay. Now, if you turn out to be wrong, what should we do next, assuming you're right about the stipulation? They just flat-out wouldn't follow it.161111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 And -- and suppose you were wrong about the route. Have2 youanysuggestionforusastowhattodo? Dowe--I3 guess we'd have to dismiss -- order this case dismissed4 without prejudice to your going to the Alabama court and5 -- and asking them to enjoin? Or what is your suggestion6 about what we should do --7 MR. ALSOBROOK: Well --8 QUESTION: -- if you're right on the merits of9 this thing?10 MR. ALSOBROOK: If we're right on the merits,11 Your Honor, what I suggest you should do is reverse the12 Eleventh Circuit.13 QUESTION: I don't mean the merits of the14 procedural issue. Suppose that you're wrong about that,15 hypothetically, but you're right about your basic16 instinct, that they signed a piece of paper saying, we17 promise to dismiss this case in the State court and then18 they didn't. They just didn't do it. That was your view19 of this. Right?20 MR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, sir.21 QUESTION: All right. So have you any22 suggestion for us about how we might help you achieve that23 ultimate objective, and by us, I don't mean this Court24 particularly. I mean the law. The law should provide a25 way that you get that objective if you're right.171111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. ALSOBROOK: I would -- the alternative I2 would suggest is to remand the matter to the Federal3 district court in Mobile with instructions for them to4 file an injunction or a contempt proceeding against the5 party --6 QUESTION: But that would be up to you to -- I7 mean, the court doesn't initiate an injunction. You'd8 have to ask for it. And I assume you would be free to do9 it. If all this Court would decide, if it decided against10 you, was that the All Writs Act is not available for this11 purpose, that would leave you as though you had never12 pursued that route and you could pursue another.13 There's something curious about this case, and14 maybe you can -- you can help me understand it. When the15 plaintiff's class counsel in Price went into the Louisiana16 court and said, Louisiana court, drop that case, dismiss17 that case, the defense counsel wasn't there.18 MR. ALSOBROOK: No.19 QUESTION: Why not?20 MR. ALSOBROOK: Your Honor, this is not in the21 record but I was that counsel, and I had talked with the22 class counsel days before, and he assured me that he would23 take care of it and there would be no problem. We didn't24 anticipate this happening because the language of the25 stipulation of settlement, which the respondent signed,181111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425was so specific that we couldn't imagine that the State court judge would not dismiss it on the motion of class counsel.QUESTION: So you were relying on plaintiff's counsel --MR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, ma'am.QUESTION: -- to do -- to do that job for you and felt you didn't need to appear in the State court.MR. ALSOBROOK: He actually told us we didn't have to appear, that he would take care of it.QUESTION: Mr. Alsobrook, if we disagree with you and reverse the -- and affirm the Eleventh Circuit, we would be affirming a decision that says in its conclusion, we accordingly vacate the district court's order dismissing Henson and remand with instructions for the court to remand Henson to Louisiana State court.We do not, however -- this is part of what it said -- we do not, however, imply that the district court may not by injunction force Henson's dismissal. So, you know, we wouldn't have to say that -- that our decision here was without prejudice. The decision of the Eleventh Circuit was said to be without prejudice. So you -- you'd be able to, as far as the Eleventh Circuit opinion is concerned, get -- get the injunction.MR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, sir, but the --191111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼12 efficient3 up here.4 5 6 78 bites at the apple than one. Right?9 MR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, sir. And --10 QUESTION: Even if you lose here, you can then11 seek the injunction.12 MR. ALSOBROOK: And also because the majority of13 the circuits have approved the procedures that we followed14 in this case. You have the Second Circuit; you have the15 Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth. And --16 QUESTION: Well, what was the reasoning of those17 circuits?18 MR. ALSOBROOK: The reasoning of those circuits19 were that they had retained jurisdiction to enforce their20 judgments. For example, if you take NAACP II -- rather,21 NAACP I, the court remanded the case to the circuit court.22 NAACP II, the court said that because they had retained23 jurisdiction in an order, that they could go forward under24 the All Writs Act.25 QUESTION: And what -- did they specify what201111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005QUESTION: I wonder why it wasn't -- wasn't more for you to seek the injunction instead of comingMR. ALSOBROOK: Well --QUESTION: I guess -- I guess --MR. ALSOBROOK: -- Justice Scalia --QUESTION: -- your answer is better to have two￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425kind of a writ it was they were talking about? MR. ALSOBROOK: No, sir.QUESTION: I should think that might have made you a little hesitant to rely.MR. ALSOBROOK: Well --QUESTION: It's a good defense to a malpracticeaction.MR. ALSOBROOK: Well, we had to rely on what the courts were telling us, Your Honor -- I mean, Mr. Chief Justice.QUESTION: Were those cases in which there were two -- two different districts involved?MR. ALSOBROOK: The Agent Orange case, there were two different districts, yes.￼remandingremandingQUESTION: But all of them were not, were they? MR. ALSOBROOK: No.QUESTION: Weren't some of them -- yes.It seems to me it's quite different if you're to the court where the problem arose thanto a different court.MR. ALSOBROOK: That's right. QUESTION: Yes. Or removing, rather. MR. ALSOBROOK: That's right. QUESTION: Do you wish to save the -- MR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, sir.211111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 QUESTION: -- remainder of your time for2 rebuttal?3 MR. ALSOBROOK: Thank you.4 QUESTION: Very well.5 Mr. Bederman.6 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. BEDERMAN7 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT8 MR. BEDERMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it9 please the Court:10 The All Writs Act may not be relied upon to11 remove an otherwise unremovable case. It is Congress's12 province to define the limits of removal, and chief of13 these is the requirement of original jurisdiction in14 Federal court.15 QUESTION: Mr. Bederman, I just asked your --16 your friend to -- to explain why he was up here. Why are17 you up here? Because even if you win, the case will --￼18 you know, 1920 apply, as21 injunction. Such an injunction could proceed because22 under this Court's decision in Parsons Steel, the State23 court has yet to issue a conclusive ruling about24 preclusive effect. And therefore, they're at liberty to.25 We are, by no means, conceding the -- the substantive221111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005don't you think that an injunction will issue?MR. BEDERMAN: Very likely Mr. Alsobrook will the Eleventh Circuit invited them to, for an1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425merits of the injunction motion whether they would have a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, but we would certainly agree that they have the ability to file an injunction immediately.QUESTION: Why -- why -- okay. What -- what is at issue on the merits?MR. BEDERMAN: The issue on the merits would be presumably the proper construction of the settlement agreement --QUESTION: Of the settlement agreement?MR. BEDERMAN: That's right. And, of course, whether an injunction, narrowly tailored to the parties, would, as -- as the Justices have already indicated, be properly addressed to the parties to order dismissal of the case.QUESTION: Okay.

We would not context the ability of them to file for the --QUESTION: You can say in a sentence -- as I read this, it says, class counsel hereby stipulates that the related case, including any and all claims, will be dismissed.

BEDERMAN: That's right, Justice Breyer.QUESTION: So I'm just curious what the defense would be.MR. BEDERMAN: The only defense that -- that I could imagine is the ambiguity in that provision, as you were reading, at 38a of the joint appendix, that the concern about whether including any and all claims, including without any limitation any claims defined herein. And what has not been made clear is that there were subsequent amendments to the stipulation, which made clear that certain classes of claims were excluded.here --QUESTION: Well, I guess that isn't before usQUESTION: It's not before us.QUESTION: -- is it?MR. BEDERMAN: Certainly not, Justice O'Connor.￼What's before this Court is what is the proper proceduralmechanismAll Writsto be used here.QUESTION: And several circuits have allowed the Act to be used in this fashion, do you think? MR. BEDERMAN: In this fashion? Yes, JusticeO'Connor.as a newfangled procedural device that was launched by the Second Circuit after the Yonkers and Agent Orange cases; that it has developed, as I think Mr. Alsobrook fairly241111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005That clearly this is what I would characterize1 characterizes, a momentum of its own in the court of2 appeals.3 QUESTION: In the Yonkers case, the United4 States Government urged the court to take that position,5 didn't it? So it wasn't something newfangled that the6 court dreamed up on its own when it was the Department of7 Justice urging it.8 MR. BEDERMAN: That is true, but my recollection9 of -- of the procedural background with the Yonkers case10 was that there was some concern about how Judge Sand11 drafted the consent decree in that case. He -- as was12 later acknowledged, Judge Sand had been perhaps misled by13 certain representations made by the Archdiocese of New14 York and therefore he did not include a provision that15 would allow for a subsequent injunction or -- or a16 retention of jurisdiction. That may have led the court in17 that circumstance to invoke All Writs Act.18 But there, again, the complete alternative was19 an injunction that could have issued in these New York20 land use proceedings that were pending in State court. So21 even in Yonkers, which presents, I think, analytically a22 very different context here, not a preclusion case, not a23 case that turns on the construction of an earlier Federal24 court judgment or settlement, there was the availability25 of injunctive relief. In that case, the Second Circuit251111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 bypassed that -- that reasoning and went straight towards2 an All Writs Act basis --3 QUESTION: But you said you would defend against4 injunctive relief on the ground that the settlement was5 narrower than --6 MR. BEDERMAN: We would defend essentially on7 the merits, is that an injunction should not issue because8 our construction of -- of the settlement is --9 QUESTION: Well, why didn't you seek that10 construction from the court that issued -- that -- that11 entered the settlement? Why go to another Federal court?12 Louisiana doesn't know anything about this case -- instead13 of saying, Alabama Federal District Judge, please clarify14 the scope of the settlement so that we can either go on15 with our case or know that we can't?16 MR. BEDERMAN: We believe that the proper course17 is -- in view of the precise enumeration of the -- of the18 case in State court, that the proper course was to amend19 the petition and seek a resolution.20 Mr. Henson and his counsel could have very well21 initiated an entirely new case and evaded the terms of --22 of the settlement in that fashion. They agreed and23 decided that the proper course, the more forthright course24 was to seek leave to amend the petition to make clear that25 certain claims were dropped by virtue of the earlier261111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 settlement, but there were remaining claims in play. And2 it was believed that this was the most forthright approach3 to -- to use here.4 I would credit, Justice Ginsburg, that it may5 have been equally appropriate to go back to the Federal6 court, seek a declaratory judgment or some kind of7 decision in that fashion. But I believe that this course8 was certainly honest and forthright on the part of counsel9 below.10 I -- I hardly think it may be necessary to11 indicate that the All Writs Act does not confer12 jurisdiction under 1441, as was already made clear in13 certainly the questioning and certainly in view of14 petitioners' discussion. Original jurisdiction has always15 been required and has been upheld in countless cases. And16 moreover, the All Writs Act textually demands that Federal17 courts issue writs, quote, "in aid of their respective18 jurisdiction."19 Petitioners' argument essentially would read out20 "respective" from that provision in the All Writs Act in21 section 1651. Clearly the All Writs Act does not22 independently grant original jurisdiction, and this has23 been consistently upheld by this Court for nearly 20024 years from the McIntire decision in 1813 to as recently as25 Clinton v. Goldsmith in 1999.271111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Moreover, issuance of writs under the All Writs2 Act is certainly conditioned by the statutory requirement3 that such be necessary or appropriate. And as this Court4 indicated in Pennsylvania Bureau of Corrections, this is5 essentially a threshold requirement for invocation of the6 All Writs Act. And in the Goldsmith case, as recently as7 3 or 4 years ago, this Court made clear that the All Writs8 Act can't be used as a form of cure-all to -- to fix what9 would otherwise be the availability of other statutory10 mechanisms which are not otherwise complied with.11 QUESTION: What would be wrong with the Eleventh12 Circuit saying in substance it's the same thing? What13 we're trying to do is to stop this litigation from going14 forward in Louisiana. So even though the defendants used15 the wrong device, we'll treat it as though it had been in16 application for an antisuit injunction?.17 MR. BEDERMAN: Well, if -- if, of course, the18 Eleventh Circuit had construed petitioners' filings in19 that way and -- and had indicated that injunction was the20 proper mode and essentially substituted, as they -- as21 they seem to invite in their closing lines of their22 decision, I think that would be appropriate. But there is23 certainly a difference in form and in content between a24 removal and a narrowly tailored injunction, and I think25 the Eleventh Circuit was correct.281111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 And other courts of appeals that have so held2 have indicated that there are profound federalism concerns3 that are implicated in allowing essentially a common law4 writ of removal to be used to evade what is Congress's5 role in dictating the mechanism for removal and -- and6 patrolling the boundary and the balance of authority7 between State courts and Federal courts in this country.8 There is, as -- as the Court indicated, no such9 thing as a -- as a common law writ of removal. There was10 no analogy in English common law at the time of the11 founding. The -- a writ of certiorari, as Justice Breyer12 indicated, would have been -- could have been potentially13 directed, I would agree, to -- to courts. But in no14 circumstance was there analogy in English common law for15 the court of one sovereign to remove cases from -- from16 another sovereign. And unless we delve into a kind of17 obscurantist legal history, I think that would be clear.18 But there was, in fact, no analogy for that. And in19 truth, there's no such thing as a writ of removal --20 QUESTION: Administrative agencies.21 MR. BEDERMAN: I presume that in English common22 law, to the extent that administrative agencies existed,23 the ones I'm aware of, of course, were quite inchoate.24 It's potential that you --25 QUESTION: Sewer commissioners, I think is --291111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. BEDERMAN: That's right. Or -- or sanitary2 commissions in London. One might imagine that.3 But again, at issue here is -- is removal, which4 this Court has always indicated is a creature of statute5 because of the profound federalism concerns.6 And essentially what -- what petitioners would7 have this Court do is allow, by use of the All Writs Act8 or analogous theories of ancillary enforcement9 jurisdiction, to achieve what is otherwise unavailable by10 statute. And as this Court clearly said in the11 Pennsylvania Bureau of Corrections case, although the All12 Writs Act empowers Federal courts to fashion extraordinary13 remedies when the need arises, it does not authorize them14 to issue ad hoc writs whenever compliance with statutory15 procedures appears inconvenient or less appropriate.16 If I can say just a word or two about ancillary17 enforcement jurisdiction, to the extent to which18 petitioners appear to be relying on it. This Court has19 said very clearly in both Kikkonen, where the Court20 indicated that ancillary enforcement jurisdiction may be21 used in view of what courts require to perform their22 functions, and in Peacock, where the Court made very clear23 that ancillary enforcement jurisdiction is a creature of24 necessity, there can be no showing of necessity here by25 virtue of the availability of alternate mechanisms,301111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 whether in the form of an injunction properly issued2 against the parties and consistent with the relitigation3 exception under the Anti-Injunction Act, or even,4 preferably, recourse to State courts to properly rule on5 the preclusive effect of earlier Federal court judgments6 and settlements, as this Court made clear.7 QUESTION: What about contempt? I suppose you8 could have been -- your client could have been held in9 contempt in that court, couldn't it? I mean, assuming10 you're wrong -- that he's right --11 MR. BEDERMAN: In the -- in the Federal court.12 And of course, obviously sanctions were imposed below by13 the Federal district court, and that's, of course, not --14 no longer at issue before this Court, but that court has15 that power.16 So certainly there are a variety of mechanisms17 to ensure compliance with -- with court orders. It is not18 respondent's submission to suggest that we take an19 important tool out of the toolbox of Federal courts in20 order to maintain the dignity and the enforcement of their21 judgments. But --22 QUESTION: A number of courts that have allowed23 the 1651 All Writs removal have said that they thought24 that that was less offensive. That was more faithful to25 the federalism concern, that -- that issuing an antisuit311111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 injunction was more offensive to the State than this2 removal device.3 MR. BEDERMAN: I would respectfully disagree4 with that characterization. The assumption seems to be5 that the injunction would somehow issue to the State6 court, and as of course we all know, that would never be7 the case. That truly would be offensive. The -- the8 injunction would issue to the9 instructions to -- to dismiss10 narrowly tailored instrument.11 QUESTION: Well, it12 remedy in a particular situation might be less offensive13 to federalism, but that's a concern that should be14 addressed 151617by Congress, isn't it --MR. BEDERMAN: Absolutely.QUESTION: -- in view of this statute?MR. BEDERMAN: Absolutely. It is -- if Congress address the availability of removal in thisparties, however, withor an even maybe even moremay be that a particular￼18 wishes to19 class action context -- and there is pending legislation20 today to that effect -- Congress is free to do so.21 QUESTION: And -- and if Congress wants to be22 more offensive, it presumably can.23 (Laughter.)24 MR. BEDERMAN: I wouldn't speak to the25 propensity of Congress in those circumstances, but they321111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425could also amend the Anti-Injunction Act to also change the balance of power between State courts and Federal courts. We take no issue with that.Your Honors, unless there are any further questions.QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Bederman.Mr. Alsobrook, you have 7 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY B. ALSOBROOK, JR.ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. ALSOBROOK: Excuse me. Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:I think Justice Breyer was correct when hepointed out that the stipulation that was entered into is really not ambiguous. The Eleventh --QUESTION: That's not -- I don't think that's before us, Mr. Alsobrook.MR. ALSOBROOK: All right.QUESTION: I mean, I don't think whether or not you might be entitled to an injunction, should you seek one, is -- is presented by the -- your question.MR. ALSOBROOK: Yes, sir.Well, Your Honor, I would say that at the time that we removed this also we relied on NAACP II, and there the Court said that if there are two alternatives that -- and they also pointed out a footnote 3 in the Kikkonen331111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 case which said that an injunction could be issued where2 there are two alternatives that -- that you can choose3 between one or the other, and that the -- the4 Anti-Injunction Act does not preclude the remedy under the5 All Writs Act.6 So we realize that the Court is not a7 legislative body and that it has been brought out here8 that Congress is the one that can -- can dictate the9 jurisdictional bounds of Federal courts. But by the same10 token, Your Honor, we have a great number of class action11 settlements that are pending in this country that have12 been already consummated in this country, and we face a13 situation where the settling party who has settled a14 national class action must have some kind of remedy to15 stop suits in State courts that attempt to thwart that16 class action settlement. And so we would ask the Court to17 consider that in its -- in its deliberations.18 If there any further questions?19 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Alsobrook.20 MR. ALSOBROOK: Thank you, Your Honor.21 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: The case is submitted.22 (Whereupon, at 10:43 a.m., the case in the23 above-entitled matter was submitted.)24 25341111 14th Street, N.W.
