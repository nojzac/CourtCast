Phoebe Putney Health System.Mr. Horwich?ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICHON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. HORWICH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:The State Action Doctrine provides a defenseto a Federal antitrust suit when a State has clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed an intent to displace competition with respect to the particular activity at issue in the suit.Now, in practical terms, what that comes down to is whether application of Federal competition law would somehow subvert a sovereign State policy choice that's clearly evident in State law.Now, that policy might be expressed in mandatory or compulsory terms, but, short of that, it would also be enough, if the -- the State had specifically permitted conduct that is inherently anticompetitive.But a grant of general power to act -­3￼17 entirely, in principle -- fund their services18 tax revenues. So they have another source of19 that would allow them to price in ways that a20 competitive actor would not necessarily price21 services.through fundingits1 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You don't think that the2 grant of powers in this case would permit the hospital3 authorities, the corporation, to set prices for their4 services that are below the competitive prices in order5 to serve the needy?6 MR. HORWICH: Well, Justice --7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't that inherent in8 the regulations?9 MR. HORWICH: I think it is, although for10 reasons that don't affect the analysis of the question11 about an anticompetitive acquisition. And let me12 explain why the analysis might be different with respect13 to prices.14 There is specific authorization in the15 statute for the hospital authorities, in conjunction16 with the counties, to partly fund -- or, I guess,￼22 So if we're talking about particular pricing23 decisions, say -- I guess it would be below cost pricing24 that is alleged to somehow be anticompetitive -- then25 there might very well be a State action defense to that43 wouldn't be 456 competition 78 which we --9 10able to do --JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have --MR. HORWICH: -- might very well displace in that regard.JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have any cases in we slice it that fine --MR. HORWICH: Well, I doJUSTICE SCALIA: -- thatfor some anticompetitive1 because it -- because the State -- the power to price2 services subsidized in a way that an ordinary actor11 State actor12 for others?1314 Justice Scalia. I think -- I think the best -- the best15 example comes from Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar. So,16 in that case, the -- the issue was a challenge to aMR. HORWICH: Yeah, absolutely,think ---- that you are a purposes and not￼17 practice of minimum fee schedules that were set by --18 not by the State, but -- but agreed upon by a bar19 organization.20 Now, the State in that case, of course,21 regulated the practice of law. It regulated admission22 into the practice of law. It regulated certain aspects23 of the conduct of the practice of law. And this Court24 held, in Bates v. Arizona State Bar, that those sort of25 regulations do constitute State action.522 requirement 2324 acquisition25 or two; it says other -- other facilities.1 But the Court did not accept the submission2 that the State action defense covered the setting of3 minimum prices that was at issue in that case because4 that was not something that there was State action over.5 And as a -- and, taking a step back, the6 justification for the State Action Doctrine is that the7 State is trying to pursue some policy that is part of8 its traditional sovereign prerogatives to regulate its9 own economy and that Federal law was not understood to10 intrude upon that.11 But, if the State is not actually trying to12 advance some other policy, with respect to the13 particular conduct at issue, then it can't be said that14 the State has done something that Federal law should15 stand aside for.16 The -- the --17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Horwich, you said18 in -- in your reply brief that, if the Hospital19 Authorities Law specifically authorized local hospital20 authorities to acquire any and all hospitals within21 their geographic area, then the clear articulation￼would be satisfied.But the Authorities Law does authorize the of other hospitals. And it doesn't say one61 So why doesn't the hospital laws law do2 exactly what you said would satisfy the -- the clear3 articulation requirement?4 MR. HORWICH: Well, I think the key5 difference there, Justice Ginsburg, between the6 hypothetical we offered in the -- the reply brief and7 the statute here is that the -- the additional words8 "any and all" make it clear that the State is9 contemplating that there could -- the county might opt10 for socializing its hospital services, putting all of11 them under the control of the hospital authority.12 And, by contrast, what we have here is an13 ordinary corporate power to acquire property. And, like14 all of the ordinary corporate powers that the authority15 possesses that are -- that resemble those that -- that16 an ordinary business corporation would have, the most17 natural understanding of them is that the State expects18 them to be exercised in conformity with the background19 principles that -- that bind everybody. So --20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just so I understand21 your answer to Justice Ginsburg, you're saying there22 would be a difference if the charter said the authority23 may require -- acquire any properties to fulfill its24 mission and if it said the authority may acquire25 properties to promote its mission?7￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. HORWICH: Well, I think it's probably in our -- the hypothetical offered in our reply brief, it's probably the "all" -- the "any and all" that -- that would, I think, be what communicates the State's --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think a general saying they may acquire properties doesn't implicitly say they may acquire all properties?That seems a pretty thin --MR. HORWICH: No, I don't think it does -- well -- but I think, in this area, it's -- it'simportant, for a couple reasons, that we actually have -- have some substantial assurance of what the State is trying to do here.And a power to grant proper -- excuse me -- a power to acquire properties, generally speaking, unadorned with any particular expression from the State about how -- how that power is to be used, is -- is something that can be used competitively or anticompetitively.And you can't infer from that that the State really has an objective of, as I say, such assocializing its hospital services because -- and -- and it's -- and that clarity of expression from the State is really important here, for several reasons.First of all, this is an odd rule, to begin8￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425with, in that it allows State law to displace Federal law. So we would want some clarity from --JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume -- I assume that the normal corporate charter contains such a provision, the authority to acquire property, right?MR. HORWICH: Yeah, it absolutely does.And--JUSTICE SCALIA: And we don't -- that -- that charter is issued by the State, right?MR. HORWICH: It is issued by the State.JUSTICE SCALIA: And we don't -- we don't think that that enables all corporations to ignore the Sherman Act, do we?MR. HORWICH: No, we don't. And we don't generally think that those corporate powers express an intent to displace any other background --if I could give some examples, maybe we could look at some --JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Horwich, could I just -- MR. HORWICH: Yes.JUSTICE KAGAN: -- before you give examples,just make sure I understand your basic position? Suppose the State had said, very clearly,that these hospital authorities had the power to engage in acquisitions of hospitals that, for a normal actor,9￼1 would violate the antitrust laws, but -- but basically2 said the -- the hospital authorities had the discretion3 to do that or not.4 And the State didn't know the hospital5 authority might do it, but it also might not do it.6 That would be subject to the immunity; is that correct?7 MR. HORWICH: I -- I think the defense would8 be available if -- if the beginning of your hypothetical9 was kind of 1011 authority -- 121314 completely discretionary. So the State is basically15 saying, we don't know, we're going to let the hospital16 authority figure it out.17 MR. HORWICH: Well, it's certainly -- the18 hospital authority can figure it -- figure out, but what19 it's figuring out is whether to actually invoke a20 displacement of competition that the State has expressly21 put on the table. And that's what is different in this22 case --23 JUSTICE KAGAN: What -- but what I'm trying24 togetatistheStatehasputitonthetableonlyasa25 completely discretionary action. The State has not10quoting the statute, yes.JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes. It's a clear grant ofMR. HORWICH: Yes.JUSTICE KAGAN: But the authority is￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425expressed a preference for it.The State has only said that the hospitalauthority can think about conditions on the ground in its particular locality and can decide whether such an anticompetitive acquisition is appropriate.MR. HORWICH: Yes, that's fine. We don't have any quarrel with -- with States setting up a clear set of tools, some of which, in your example, might inherently displace competition --JUSTICE KAGAN: So all of this language --MR. HORWICH: -- and having it exercised, actually, at a local level. That's fine.JUSTICE KAGAN: So all this language in your brief about necessarily and inherently and compelled, all of those things really are not part of your -- your governing test?MR. HORWICH: No. I -- I disagree with that. The reason they are part of our governing test is this: Is that a State can certainly give a -- a menu of specific options that sub-State entities can -- can select from. And it might be that some of those are, in fact, not anticompetitive.Let me give you an example from -- from this Court's cases. Southern Motor Carriers involved the submission of -- by motor carriers, of their rates to a11￼1 public service commission that was -- that would accept2 them as filed rates.3 Now, the States -- some of the States there4 said, well, you can file them individually, or you can5 file them jointly, and we don't necessarily have a6 preference, one way or the other, for it.7 But the fact that the States had said you8 can file them jointly, which is a horizontal agreement9 among competitors and sure looks anticompetitive, the10 fact that the State had said that and put that option on11 the table qualified as a clear articulation from the12 State that it intended the displacement of competition13 to occur if that specific option was chosen.14 The difference here is that, if you are15 willing to say, in a case like what we have here with a16 statute that -- that confers a -- a power that is17 entirely neutral as to how it would be -- how it could18 be exercised, you have the problem of not really knowing19 what the State would intend. And so you can't say that20 the State clearly intended that there be displacement21 of competition --22 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about the other?23 The next line that they give is they give to the24 hospital authority the power to acquire and operate25 projects and the power to form and operate one or more12￼1 networks of hospitals, physicians, and other healthcare2 providers.3 Now, as I read that, it certainly includes4 the rather specific power of acquiring a hospital. And5 having read that -- not -- not just something6 see in General Motors' charter.7 MR. HORWICH: Well --8 JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and those9 the language of the -- of the grant of power.you might-- that's10 Now, I want to know what you want11 because, in my mind, reading this, it's a statute that12 provides for regulation -- price regulation of13 hospitals. And you say -- and I have no doubt you14 thought of one way in which that could be -- I can think15 of 100 -- that you could have prices that are different16 from those set by a free market. So I have no doubt17 that this sets -- I start there.18 Now, what is it -- I go back to19 Justice Scalia's original question: What is it you want20 us to say? Even though this -- this statute is immune,21 does grant immunity from attack on a basis of cost and22 price regulation, it is not immune in respect to23 mergers, okay?24 MR. HORWICH: Well, I think --25 JUSTICE BREYER: I can, unfortunately, think13ustodo￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425of about 50 examples, where a merger might be anticompetitive, and yet, it would lead to lower prices. And the Department of Justice might attack it, but this statute -- and that's what's bothering me -- seems to want to further that kind of thing.MR. HORWICH: Well, I --JUSTICE BREYER: That -- that's where I am, and I -- I'm not at all decided.MR. HORWICH: Sure. Well, I guess I would -- I guess I would first point out that -- that price competition is not the be-all and end-all of anticompetitive consequences, right?JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I think I know that.MR. HORWICH: I mean, we have thisconcern -- obviously, we have a concern here that without -- and this is detailed, very clearly, in the complaint, I mean, I think starting with paragraph -- paragraph 8, that talks about some of the price -- some of the pricing constraints. But you get on to the later paragraphs of the complaint, you have all these descriptions of loss of quality competition here.So you have -- you have --JUSTICE BREYER: You are not understanding my question, I guess. You have to take as a given that, even though what you say is true, I would find that this14￼1 statute clearly prohibits the application of the2 antitrust laws to pricing decisions. That's the job of3 the authority.4 Now, if I start with that, then you will5 say, okay, I have to decide against you. Or you might6 say, even so, I win because mergers are different. Now,7 that -- that's what I'm trying to get you to say.8 MR. HORWICH: Yes, and I guess that is what9 I'm -- I guess that is what I'm trying to say, is that10 mergers are different because the challenged11 anticompetitive act here is not a pricing decision by12 the hospitals that --13 JUSTICE BREYER: I want to ask you: Why are14 they different?15 MR. HORWICH: They are different --16 JUSTICE BREYER: After all, we have, one,17 the specific language I read; and, two, I can think of18 examples where a merger would be anticompetitive under￼19 the DOJ and 202122 further the23 cost.24 25your FTC rules --MR. HORWICH: Yeah.JUSTICE BREYER: -- and yet, probably would purposes of the statute by lowering theMR. HORWICH: Well, that's --JUSTICE BREYER: Do you think that's the151 null set? I -- I don't think that's --2 MR. HORWICH: No, I -- well, I don't -- I3 don't know whether that is -- I don't know whether that4 is true or not, but I think -- I think we're relying on5 a more -- I think you can't simply start with the idea6 that, well -- well, you can't start with the premise7 that this act exists to pursue an objective and to8 pursue it at any cost, without regard to whether it9 displaces competition in the market for paid healthcare10 services, without regard to whether it displaces11 competition for quality among these hospitals.12 I mean, on that logic -- and I -- I think it13 might help to look at some of the other powers here. If14 we -- if you go to the back of the government's brief,15 on page 6A, the authority has the power to make and --16 and execute contracts. Well, I don't think that that17 implies a privilege to enter price-fixing contracts.18 That's part of the background principles of antitrust19 law.20 I also don't think it implies the power to21 enter contracts against public policy. A State,22 presumably, doesn't wish to abandon that background23 principle, simply because it wants the authority to24 pursue its mission.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you've already16￼1 told us that there can be State action for some purposes2 and not others.3 MR. HORWICH: Exactly.4 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the fact that you5 have examples where you might conclude, no, they didn't6 mean to do that, doesn't seem to categorically suggest7 that you prevail with respect to another one of the8 powers that are granted.9 MR. HORWICH: No, I agree with that, that it10 doesn't categorically, but it does -- it does seem to me11 that -- that if we're looking through this list of12 powers that -- that the hospital authority has, there is13 not anything meaningfully different about the power to14 acquire -- acquire property versus make contracts15 versus, as Justice Scalia said, any other powers that16 are -- that exist in a general corporation's business17 charter.18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- this may be19 completely wrong. You can tell me. I would -- would20 doubt that, in counties or municipalities of this size,21 you are going to have -- you know, five hospitals, and22 so that a -- the authority could acquire a hospital and23 yet still it not have any significant merger24 consequences on its face.25 In other words, when this law was passed,17￼MR. HORWICH: Well, no, because I think7 the -- the baseline when the statute was enacted was8 that the hospital authorities didn't even exist. So1 giving them the power to acquire hospitals, wasn't it2 the case3 hospital4 hospital5 one had?6that there would likely be only one otheror two, so that any acquisition of another would have the merger consequences that this9 they didn't own any hospitals.10 And the first acquisition of a hospital11 can't raise a competitive concern because it's not12 concentrating the market in any way. It's simply13 transferring ownership of the hospital from one actor to14 another.15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but to -- to follow16 the Chief Justice's question, suppose it were shown that17 there were many rural counties -- rural areas in18 Georgia, very much like this one. Would that change19 this case? I thought that was the purport of the -- the20 thrust of the question.21 MR. HORWICH: I think you'd have to imagine22 a very stylized hypothetical, to see that the State had23 clearly intended to displace competition. You would24 want to see, for example -- let me give you an25 example -­18￼1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I know Georgia has2 158 counties or something.3 MR. HORWICH: Right.4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So I think they probably5 have many rural areas with one or two hospitals. That's6 just a guess.78 that -- that9 for saying a10 competition.1112 recognize it is, if the hospital authorities were13 already in existence, but they -- and they all each14 owned a hospital, but they had never had the power to15 acquire a hospital, and you knew that they were all --16 that each of them had their neighboring competitor, and17 then the legislature comes in and says -- you know,18 we -- we would like you now to actually be able to19 acquire -- acquire additional hospitals.20 I mean, the power here is not the power to21 acquire additional hospitals. But, if the legislature22 had said, we have the power to acquire additional23 hospitals and we know you already have one and we know24 that the one you are going to acquire is going to be25 your neighbor and we know there is not lots of hospitals19MR. HORWICH: Well, right, but I suppose guesswork is not going to be a basis State has clearly intended to displaceThe situation in which I think you might￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425out there, then you might say that, yes, the -- the clear implication of that is that that's going --JUSTICE BREYER: What does the words mean, "to form and operate one or more major networks of hospitals"?MR. HORWICH: Well, I think the networks --JUSTICE BREYER: Which follow -- which follow the words "to acquire and operate projects, defined to include hospitals." So -- so what about those words? Why aren't they good enough?MR. HORWICH: Well, I guess I'm not sure where Your Honor is looking. They -- they aren't actually -- they don't follow themselves in the statute, but --JUSTICE BREYER: I'm looking at Section 30 -- well, where are we? 31-7-75(3).MR. HORWICH: Right. And so I think what you are referring to is number -- number 27 on the list.And -- and I think, in the healthcare industry, the idea of forming a network is not the idea of socializing all of the available resources under government control. A network is an integrated system where you can go to the hospital for your emergency care, and they can refer you to an outpatient clinic that they have somewhere else, and there is a physician20￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425who has an arrangement with both of those who can track your care, and you can go acquire your durable medical equipment from some -- from some store they operate.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Tying.MR. HORWICH: That's what a network is. That's not vertical integration.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: A network is tying products, to tie products.MR. HORWICH: Yes, that's exactly right. That's a tying situation.This is -- this is a merger within -- within one relevant market. And -- and that's what'sdifferent. So I don't think the 27 --JUSTICE BREYER: And this falls within thewords "to acquire and operate projects"?MR. HORWICH: It does. But so --JUSTICE BREYER: And --MR. HORWICH: It does, but there is nothing about acquiring a project that is inherently -- that's inherently anticompetitive. Acquisitions are not always anticompetitive.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I guess that just adds on to the issues that we have a price-fixing mechanism, we have a tying mechanism that is expressed, so what's left after that? Just this? Mergers and21￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425acquisitions?MR. HORWICH: Well, I -- well, no, Ithink -- I think horizontal --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: At -- at what point --MR. HORWICH: -- generally horizontal agreements, I think you -- so the contracting power doesn't -- doesn't allow the hospital authority to go -- I don't think the -- the hospital here could any more merge with Palmyra than it could go enter into a contract with Palmyra that says, hey, we are going to -- you know, fix the prices that we --JUSTICE BREYER: And can't -- in other words, the -- the two hospitals in the town, when they say, the price here -- you shall see that the price is not higher than 38 cents, whatever, and would you please get together and be certain that you have similar terms and you have similar agreements and similar prices there, we don't want either of you to be higher, that -- you would then proceed against them for that?MR. HORWICH: Absolutely, Your Honor. This -- this statute -- and take a step back --JUSTICE BREYER: And would you also do the same if -- if the electricity regulator in any State or telephone -- a local telephone regulator --MR. HORWICH: No, Your Honor. I think22￼1 that --2 JUSTICE BREYER: -- or gas pipeline3 regulator -- what they did is the same thing; they said,4 our prices are -- you're to file tariffs, and the5 tariffs are to be reached after you go meet in6 committee; and that -- that would also fall within the7 antitrust laws?8 MR. HORWICH: No, I think those would likely9 be very different.10 11 1213 this law is14 participate15 indigents.1617 regulation.18 public utility regulation, that all hospitals19 are supposed to be -- that the State intends counties to20 be able to elect to put all hospitals under their21 control and -- and manage them as such and manage them22 in the way that a -- that a public service commission23 would regulate all of the utilities --24 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the language is25 awfully similar to what you find in public utility23I want to be clear about --JUSTICE BREYER: How is that?MR. HORWICH: -- the point. The point of to grant counties the opportunity toin this market by providing care to￼This is not a law about public utility If you think that this is a law about1 statutes, to set reasonable rates, to be certain that2 nobody is higher than a reasonable rate.3 MR. HORWICH: Well, this -- the authority4 does not have the power to -- Justice Breyer, the5 authority does not have the power to establish rates at6 private hospitals. And that -- that would be a signal7 difference between the -- the authority's power in8 this -- in this case and the power of a public service9 regulator over a -- over a utility.10 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what does it mean to11 establish rates and charges for the services and use of12 the facilities of the authority?13 MR. HORWICH: The facilities of the14 authority, yes, but not other hospitals within the15 jurisdiction. It's only -- it's only the hospitals that16 the authority itself is -- is operating.17 And so -- so I guess we -- we also have18 here--Iwant--Iwanttobeclearthat,inallof19 this discussion, we are -- we are operating on the20 premise that it's actually the authority itself that is21 operating the hospital.22 Of course, that is not what this case is.23 The -- the hospital --24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you define25 "necessity," as you use it?

HORWICH: Correct.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And, in your answer, you conceded that whether -- if -- if there is discretion, it's not necessary to make it work because the -- the authority can say yes or no -- it's not --MR. HORWICH: Exactly.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what's your definition of "necessity"?MR. HORWICH: Our definition -- our definition -- well, I have to be honest with you, it's hard to define it because it's going to arise in a number of different contexts.But what this -- but the times where this Court has used it, it has -- it has used it to convey25￼1 the idea that the choice that the State is offering is2 no choice at all, if Federal law is going to come in;3 that -- that Federal law would just negate the choice.4 So to be concrete about this, in -- in5 Hallie, for example, the choice that the State provided6 at the end of kind of a complicated line of -- of7 statutory rules about how -- how cities do or don't have8 to provide their sewage treatments to -- to their9 neighbors, at the end of the day the city had a choice10 to say, fine, we will give you sewage treatment11 services, but you have to be annexed to us and -- you12 know, take the other things that come with annexation to13 the city.14 Now, if that choice is -- is -- if that15 choice is anticompetitive, it's going to be taken away16 by Federal law. And the choice that the State has tried17 to offer is no choice at all. It's going to be negated,18 and the only choice left for the -- the city in Hallie19 isgoingtobeto--toopt--20 JUSTICE ALITO: If the State --21 MR. HORWICH: To just relent and get the22 sewage treatment service --23 JUSTICE ALITO: If a State legislature24 articulates clearly and expresses affirmatively that it25 wants municipalities to share the State's antitrust26￼1415 affirmative16 saying that17 apply, that's not the basis in federalism for the -- for18 the State Action Doctrine.19 The basis in federalism is that the State20 has made some affirmative choice that it wants to21 accomplish something else, and that it's offered some22 principle on which the sub-State actors can -- can act23 to serve the State's policy interests.24 And so I think you might have to hesitate in25 a case like that to say, well, if the -- if the State is1 immunity, is that sufficient? Or is there a degree of2 specificity that's necessary as to the particular3 anticompetitive conduct that the State wants to cover?4 MR. HORWICH: Well, I think, in your5 hypothetical, we are imagining kind of a municipality6 enabling act that just has -- you know, a section in it7 that says, municipalities shall enjoy the State's8 exemption from the --9 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, Georgia does seem to have such10 a statute.11 MR. HORWICH: Yes. So -- so that -- that's12 not a clear articulation problem because it's plenty13 clear what the State's trying to do.There might be what I would call anexpression problem there because simplythe State doesn't want the antitrust laws to￼271 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425just passing out indulgences to -- to get out of Federal competition law, that may not be something that, substantively, Federal law will stand aside for.JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I don't want to take up your rebuttal time, but I don't see how that's consistent with your answer to Justice Kagan about a grant of discretionary authority.MR. HORWICH: Well, I -- I was assuming, in Justice Kagan's hypothetical, that we had some of the other things going on here that -- that manifested a particular objective that the State was trying to pursue.So sort of the State trying to pursue municipal governance doesn't seem to me to be enough of an affirmative State policy to say that works. So I think that would distinguish the two.And if I could reserve? Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Waxman.ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:In the specific area of local hospital services, the Georgia legislature has adopted a model of28￼1 local public choice, including the choice to reduce or2 eliminate competition.3 There is no issue here, Justice Scalia, with4 respect to your earlier question, of general corporate5 powers. The Hospital Authorities Law creates local6 public authorities to, quote, "exercise public and7 essential government functions to provide hospital care8 for residents, especially residents who cannot pay. It9 empowers authorities to acquire projects" -- plural --10 "specifically including each authority the ability to11 acquire hospitals" -- plural -- but with limitations.12 They have to -- it has to be within a very13 confined geographic and demographic jurisdiction. And14 for authority hospitals, it replaces any pure market15 model with statutory mandates, a mandate to provide16 services to all indigent in the community and to price17 all services on a not-for-profit basis and with a18 statutory limitation on rate of return.19 There are --20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I -- I don't see how21 any of that pertains to whether they can create a22 hospital monopoly. You can do all of that, even though23 you are not the only hospital in the area.24 MR. WAXMAN: The -- I guess my point here is25 that the -- that the legislature's -- the powers that29￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the -- the legislature has given hospital authorities are not, by any means, general corporate powers. They are broader than what a corporation may have in certain respects and much narrower in other respects.And they --JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but the only respect relevant here is -- is -- the only respect relevant is the ability to acquire other hospitals.MR. WAXMAN: That's right. And there is --JUSTICE SCALIA: Right? And that's -- and that's a general corporate power. Every corporation in Georgia has the power to acquire, including acquire other businesses.MR. WAXMAN: There -- there -- these -- these are -- the supervening wish, mandate, of the legislature -- and this is well-explained in Georgia Supreme Court cases, particularly DeJarnette, which was decided right after Georgia amended its constitution, enacted the Hospital Authorities Law -- was the desire to -- the goal to provide adequate hospital services, particularly for the indigent --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Georgia wasn't so sure because didn't it come in originally on the side of the FTC in this case?MR. WAXMAN: It did. And Georgia's30￼1 complaint and its theory in the district court, which it2 did not pursue in the court of appeals or here, not --3 was not that the authorities weren't exercising State4 power, but that the contention that the operation of the5 hospital by the -- the special purpose corporations that6 the hospital authority created was not adequately7 supervised.8 That is what the State was arguing in the9 district court. And when it lost that point, it10 withdrew from the case and has remained absent ever11 since.12 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Waxman, we do have a13 brief from quite a number of States, and the brief14 basically says, we do this all the time, we set up these15 local authorities, and then we give them powers because16 they have to act in the world, and we give them normal17 powers, like the ability to make contracts and the18 ability to buy property.19 And when we do that, we don't mean that they20 can do anything they want, notwithstanding the antitrust21 laws. And to construe these very normal powers that we22 would give to a State entity, in order to allow it to23 operate as a permission to violate the antitrust laws,24 is not at all consistent with our own intentions.25 MR. WAXMAN: I -- I have no problem with the31￼1 amicus brief filed by the States supporting the FTC in2 this case, which is positive, quite expressly and at the3 outset, on an understanding that what is involved here4 is simply a State authorization of creation of a local5 entity with general corporate powers and nothing more.6 That could not be farther from this case.7 These special purpose authorities do not simply have8 general corporate powers. They have a mandate. There9 is a Georgia constitutional amendment that coincided10 with the enactment of the Hospital Authorities Law that11 derogated the State's duty to provide indigent care12 to its -- hospital care to its citizens.13 JUSTICE KAGAN: But I'm --14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is it a fair15 characterization of your argument -- is it a fair16 characterization of your argument to say that the17 possibility that the hospital authority can use this18 general power in this way is tantamount to or equivalent19 to the legislature intending that it be used that way?20 Is that your argument?21 MR. WAXMAN: No. We take seriously the22 standard that this Court announced in self-consciously23 clarifying the level of explicitness that a legislature24 has to use in Town of Hallie.25 This Court said -- the Court asked whether,32￼1 quote, "suppression of competition was a foreseeable2 result of what the State legislature authorized," and it3 derived that formulation expressly from its earlier4 decision in City of Lafayette, which explained that a,5 quote, "adequate State mandate exists when it can6 reasonably be inferred," quote, "from the authority7 given a local entity to operate in a given area that the8 legislature contemplated the kind of action complained9 of."10 In other words, as I understand this Court's11 test, whether what was done by the hospital authority or12 any sub-State entity was foreseeable by a reasonable13 legislator, which in this case is that -- was it14 foreseeable that in -- in pursuing the State-imposed15 mandate to serve the indigent in a -- in a confined16 jurisdiction, especially in rural counties which abound17 in Georgia, a hospital authority might require market18 power or even a public service monopoly because that --19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you --20 MR. WAXMAN: -- is the natural way to acquit21 the statutory mandate.22 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There's -- there is a23 problem here, which is, I understand the public mandate24 to serve the indigent, but you are asking us to take25 this a step further. You're elevating that public33￼1 mandate to a public command,2 has to override the needs of3 price competition.4 MR. WAXMAN: No.5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And -- and that -- that6 step -- that further step that the State intended to7 immunize their -- the monopoly power, is the step we are8 trying to find in this grant. And that's what I don't9 see. I see the -- the compulsion to serve the needy.10 MR. WAXMAN: Uh-huh.11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I hear that much of12 Georgia is rural, but your adversary says, in most13 instances, there is only one hospital, so the14 municipality's taking it over is not going to bea15 merger issue. To the extent that they step in and take16 over one of two hospitals, there is no merger issue17 because it's only substituting one owner for another.18 This situation, they claim, is a rarity,19 where there are only two or three providers and a20 hospital's going to -- and a public -- a municipality is21 going to then get monopoly power by an acquisition.22 MR. WAXMAN: So, Justice Sotomayor, as to23 your first point, our position is not that the only24 mandate is to serve the indigent. The actual mandate in25 the constitution and the Hospital Authorities Law is to34that serving the indigent the majority, in terms ofI don't -- I don't --￼1 provide hospital services for all residents, with a2 particular note to the obligation to serve indigent3 clients.4 Second of all, we are not here to -- I mean,5 I don't know where the government is coming up with its6 speculation that, out of Georgia's -- I think it's 1547 counties, for a population of 10 million people, it is8 the rare instance in which there will be anything other9 than just one or -- you know, a multiplicity of10 hospitals. I mean, the Federal Trade Commission11 guidelines for market concentration is anything up to12 four, four or fewer participants.13 The notion that the legislature, in 1941,14 was providing the express authority to acquire multiple15 hospitals in a single municipality or county was focused16 only on huge metropolises, of which there was only one,17 or on counties that were so small that they couldn't18 otherwise even attempt to support more than one hospital19 is just fanciful; it's made up.20 And --21 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Waxman, could -- could I22 understand where you think this expressed approval is23 coming from? Because you said general corporate powers24 is not enough. So the general ability to buy property,25 you said, is insufficient.35￼1 Then you have this idea they have a mission.2 But the mission can be accomplished in all kinds of ways3 that are perfectly consistent with the antitrust laws,4 so that doesn't seem to get you all that far.5 So what else have you got to show that the6 State actually thought about this issue and approved7 this power for the hospital authorities?89 other thing10 before, the11 rate of return. Now, if that doesn't bespeak the12 foreseeable consequence of market power, I don't know13 what -- what does. That is the hallmark of a regulated14 public service monopoly or at least the regulation of a15 return by a participant with market power.16 The other thing that exists -- and the17 government pooh-poohs this as somehow not part of the18 Hospital Authorities Law -- is that the Georgia State19 legislature has -- this is -- this law was enacted in20 the backdrop of other laws in which Georgia has quite21 deliberately displaced, quote, "unfettered private22 market competition."23 The certificate of need law is the24 paradigmatic example of the imposition of regulation at25 the expense of free market competition and, in fact -­36MR. WAXMAN: Okay. I mean, for one -- one is in Section 7 -- 7-77, as -- as was noted authorities are subject to regulation of￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, a lot of States have2 that. You can't open a new hospital without getting a3 certificate of need. Are you saying that, in all of4 those, States the -- the result is that the antitrust5 laws can be ignored?6 MR. WAXMAN: No, no, no. Our argument is7 not that the certificate -- that the existence of a8 certificate of need law indicates an intent by the9 legislature to fully displace the antitrust laws with10 respect to anybody else.11 My point is, in the context of other Georgia12 systems that strictly limit entry into -- or expansion13 into these local markets, combined with very severe rate14 restrictions and obligations and mandates to serve --15 excuse me.16 JUSTICE BREYER: Your point -- I don't mean17 to interrupt, but the point that he's making in response18 to my earlier questions along these lines, I think, was19 the following: Where do they get their hospitals, these20 authorities? The -- the law sets up a hospital￼21 authority.22 hospitals?2324 legislature 25All right. Where did they get theirMR. WAXMAN: They can -- I mean, the permits them to be built, bought -- JUSTICE BREYER: Well, do you know what371 actually happened? Do you -- do you know, in fact,2 where these3 from?45 authorities 6hospital authorities got their hospitalsMR. WAXMAN:  You mean all of the hospitalsin Georgia?JUSTICE BREYER:  No, not all of them, but --a county, and suddenly, I'm the mayor, and I7 I now am in8 see this law, and it says we can set up a hospital9 authority. So Joe, I say, you are -- you are the boss,10 you are the hospital authority guy. And he says -- you11 are to run the hospital. And he says, what hospital?12 We don't have a hospital.13 (Laughter.)14 JUSTICE BREYER: So I want to know where did15 they get their hospitals?16 MR. WAXMAN: The -- the answer,17 Justice Breyer, I think -- I mean, there is nothing in18 the record to indicate where all the hospitals --19 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't need to know all of20 them. I just want some rough idea where do they come from.￼MR. WAXMAN:  Well, let's take -- let's take--JUSTICE BREYER:  You may not know.MR. WAXMAN:  No, no, no.  Let's take the2122 the example232425 example of this county, in terms of what was done and381 what is now being challenged. So when the hospital --2 there was a public hospital, beginning in 1911, in3 Dougherty County.4 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.5 MR. WAXMAN: When the State constitution was6 amended to impose on counties the State's obligation to7 provide adequate hospitalization care, it enacted the8 Hospital Authority Law for counties that chose to make9 use of that device, in order to acquit their public10 service mandate.11 And Dougherty County did, soon thereafter --12 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.13 MR. WAXMAN: -- establish a -- an authority,14 and the assets -- all of the assets and all of the15 operations of the existing hospital, were transferred.16 There then -- and there was a natural monopoly in that17 county.18 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. I've got it. I've19 got it. Then --￼20 21 22 2324 thinking of25 it like theMR. WAXMAN: Then --JUSTICE BREYER: Then he says this: I -- MR. WAXMAN: Yes. Then --JUSTICE BREYER: He says, I have beenit the wrong way. I have been thinking of California State Public Utilities391 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Commission. They regulate all the electricity producers. That isn't this.MR. WAXMAN: Right.JUSTICE BREYER: These were a group of people that ran some hospitals -- some municipalhospitals, and now, they can acquire, not just general -- I agree with you, it isn't just general. They have a lot of power there to acquire other hospitals from outside the system.But, when they do that, there's no reason to think that that gives them the power to acquire it, where it's anticompetitive.MR. WAXMAN: Well, I think that --JUSTICE BREYER: Now, the fact that you can regulate your own hospitals, which is one track and one group, doesn't say that you have to bring in anticompetitive people -- I mean, you have to bring in others, where they're anticompetitive. That -- that, I think, is his point.MR. WAXMAN: Yes.JUSTICE BREYER: Don't think of it as one thing; think of it as two separate systems.MR. WAXMAN: We're not arguing that the Hospital Authority Law gives the hospital authorities the right to regulate non-authority hospitals. We're40￼1 not arguing that. We're not arguing --2 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I know that. But3 once you don't -- once you don't -- he says, you see,4 they don't regulate prices at non-authority hospitals,5 they don't do this for non-authority, they don't do that6 for non-authority, even though they might have the power7 to bring them in; but, when they have the power to bring8 them in, why read this -- it's at least ambiguous -- why9 read this as saying you can bring them in, where it's10 anticompetitive to do so?11 MR. WAXMAN: I mean, this doesn't say, you12 can bring them in where it's anticompetitive to do so.13 That's their any and all hypothetical. And this Court14 has never required, for good reason, express authority.15 That was the whole point of City of Hallie and City of16 Lafayette -- Town of Hallie and City of Lafayette.17 The point here is, okay, so they created a18 hospital authority, it ran a public hospital, it was a19 natural monopoly. The county grew. A private hospital20 developed. The public hospital, which is serving more21 than ten times the number of indigent patients than the22 private hospital, which is very underused, the county23 hospital has been -- the hospital authority has been24 saying, for years and years and years, we need more25 capacity, we need more capacity.41￼15 to the rule 161718 not to find19 to the rule20of reason?MR. WAXMAN: You mean if it --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If it were -- if we were State immunity, would the merger be subject of reason?MR. WAXMAN: I am embarrassed to say I don't about Sherman Act laws --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I was embarrassed to ask1 There are -- in order to accomplish our2 mission, there are two ways to do it. We can only3 operate in this confine. We can build a new hospital,4 and here's what it would cost, and here's what we would5 get. And we would, by the way, have to satisfy the6 State authorities that we are entitled to a certificate7 of need in the context in which the private hospital is8 severely underutilized.9 Or we can talk with the private hospital10 about whether they would like to be acquired. And the11 record shows that they did that for many, many years,12 even before the Phoebe Putney entities were created.13 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Waxman, I'm showing14 my ignorance. Is this -- would this merger be subject￼21 know enough 2223 the question, but I was taught to ask the question. If24 it is -- I'm going to assume that we'll both be -- we'll25 both be corrected by our respective colleagues, soon421 enough.2 (Laughter.)3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But -- but if it --4 MR. WAXMAN: Probably me sooner than you.5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's likely.6 (Laughter.)7 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But -- but my question8 is really more fundamental, which is, yes, I understand9 that you have a great defense, potentially, to a rule of10 reason challenge that -- that there was necessity in its11 truest sense, in its economic sense, in this situation.12 So why should we undo our decades of13 writings that say that we should construe immunity14 narrowly and not broadly, when it comes to displacing15 our antitrust laws?16 MR. WAXMAN: Because the point of State17 action immunity, which is respect for the sovereign18 choices of sovereign States, is -- exists not only to19 provide a -- an ultimate defense in litigation on the20 merits, it's to protect States and sub-State entities21 from the cost of litigating.22 I mean, the question, ultimately, in this23 case -- and in all these cases -- is who gets to decide?24 Who gets to decide if this is reasonable or not?25 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, if that -­43￼1 MR. WAXMAN: Is it the Federal Trade2 Commission that comes in and files a lawsuit for this3 poor hospital authority?4 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Waxman, I mean, that's5 right, it is about choices, but -- but the question is6 whether the State has made a choice. And that's what7 all these cases are about --8910 whether the11 conduct.12 1314 corporate powers aren't enough, your general mission15 isn't enough.16 You said a certificate of need, but a17 certificate of need, it isn't even given out by this18 authority. It's something that has nothing to do with19 the powers of this authority.20 Then you said there -- there's some kind of21 a price regulation that happens as to the -- the22 hospitals that the authority owns, but not with respect23 to other hospitals.24 So I guess I'm still looking for the things25 that show that the State has made a choice that it wants44MR. WAXMAN: Right.JUSTICE KAGAN: -- is our trying to find State has made a choice as to this kind ofMR. WAXMAN: Right.JUSTICE KAGAN: So now, we have your￼1 these -- these hospital authorities to be able to make2 anticompetitive purchases. Where do I find that?3 MR. WAXMAN: I may not be able to convince4 you, but let me take another run. I think it's the5 combination because, as this Court has expressed6 repeatedly, it's -- one has to look at the specific7 power granted, which here is the power to acquire8 hospitals within a very circumscribed jurisdiction, in9 the context of the law as a whole.10 The context of the law as a whole here --11 and I hope this works for the Court, but if it12 doesn't -- you know, perhaps I am wrong; it certainly13 makes this a stronger case than Hallie -- here, we have14 a law that says counties have the obligation now, unlike15 the State, to provide adequate hospitalization services.16 They will exercise -- what they do is deemed17 to exercise public and essential government function18 within strictly limited areas. And they have the power19 to acquire hospitals in those areas, subject to very20 strict rate of return regulations and very, very strict21 conditions on how they operate those hospitals,22 including the power to lease to an operator for -- in23 order to serve the public mission.24 And they do that against the backdrop of a25 series of -- they have eminent domain power. They can45￼1 take another hospital, if it is essential to fulfill2 their mission.3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman --4 MR. WAXMAN: And they do this in a backdrop5 of a State that has -- notwithstanding the advocacy of6 the Federal Trade Commission, has repeatedly7 strengthened, rather than abrogated, a -- a certificate8 of need law910 essentially11 up the hospital authority. And you -- you're saying12 this is how we read it. We start with the antitrust13 exemption is for the State, not subdivisions, so the14 State has to give it to the subdivision, for the15 subdivision to have it.16 Could the Federal court have said,17 we -- we'd like to know what the Georgia legislature --18 what the Georgia authorities think this statute means?19 So, could a question have been certified -- I don't know20 if Georgia has a certification procedure, but to the21 Georgia Supreme Court, and said, tell us, does this22 statute, is it intended to transfer the State's immunity23 to the locality -- to the local unit?24 MR. WAXMAN: I don't -- I mean, I -- I25 assume that the Georgia State courts could do that; but,46that leads --JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, you are interpreting the Georgia statute that sets￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Justice Ginsburg, I think it's important to recognize that the FTC doesn't dispute that the -- that hospital authority -- county hospital authorities are, in fact, agents or arms of the State --JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question is does this -- does this legislature mean that the State is transferring its immunity to this local unit?MR. WAXMAN: And I believe the FTC --Mr. Horwich can correct me if I'm wrong -- but I believe the FTC's position is, generally, yes, but not with respect to the -- what is alleged to be a merger to monopoly.And the question in this case is whether or not the acts, under this law and applying theforeseeable result standard, whether the acts of the hospital authority in this case in approving and acquiring the second hospital are fairly attributable to the State.And if I could just --JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Waxman, if you don't want to be interrupted, you have to pause between sentences.(Laughter.)MR. WAXMAN: I was taking a cue from Your Honor the last argument.47￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand. That'sright.You've given a -- you know, an appealing example of a small county that has one -- one hospital, and this operation purchases that one -- one hospital. Seems nothing wrong with that; although, as Justice Sotomayor suggests, I doubt whether the FTC would be pursuing a situation in which there is a natural monopoly. It's a question of whether the monopoly would be owned by the State or not.But your argument, if we follow it, embraces a quite different situation, a very large county which has five hospitals that are competing vigorously in price, in specialties, they advertise on the radio, as some hospitals do.And what you're saying is that this operation can take over all of those hospitals and eliminate all of that competition. Isn't that so?MR. WAXMAN: Well, I -- for purposes of Federal antitrust law, yes.JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.MR. WAXMAN: But for purposes of State law, almost certainly no. And the point here is -- and that is the point here. The point is that Georgia, either through both private suits and actions authorized by its48￼1 attorney general, can take steps in order to restrain2 hospital authorities from doing what they -- and, in3 fact --4 JUSTICE SCALIA: We have no -- we have no5 idea whether they are willing to do that.6 MR. WAXMAN: Oh, yes, we do.7 JUSTICE SCALIA: And we have a Federal8 antitrust law.9 MR. WAXMAN: We -- we absolutely do,10 Justice Scalia. There is a solid line of cases in which11 the Georgia Supreme Court has -- has quite rigorously12 enforced the limitations of the Hospital Authority Law,13 in order to14 things that15 Tift County16 others cited in our brief.17 The last point --18 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why didn't it intend19 this? I don't understand. You -- you've told us that20 they did intend this, that they did intend to displace21 competition.22 MR. WAXMAN: Yes.23 JUSTICE SCALIA: And now, you say, but24 Georgia will say, oh, no, they didn't intend to displace25 competition.49prevent hospital authorities from doingit says the legislature didn't intend. The case is the best example, but there are￼1 MR. WAXMAN: No, no, no. My --2 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is it?3 MR. WAXMAN: My point is that, with respect4 to your hypothetical, whether the hospital authority of5 Fulton County -- and I believe there is more than one6 hospital authority in Fulton County, and they are7 authorized to merge, in any event -- but could they8 acquire, by purchase or eminent domain, all of the9 hospitals in metropolitan Atlanta to do so? And my10 point is that for purposes of Federal antitrust law the11 answer is you are out -- that's -- you are not the12 authority to inquire.13 The question is -- just as this Court -- you14 explained for the Court in Omni, there may be very many15 things that a local authority can do that would violate16 State law, and there are State law remedies. And my17 point only was that the Georgia Supreme Court has been18 very quick to enforce the limitations.19 But as a matter of Federal antitrust law,20 the only question is were they -- were they authorized21 to do things like this? And if I --22 JUSTICE BREYER: And they -- they say on23 that, that it's a sham. Well, just say 30 seconds on24 their argument, that the FTC looked into it, these25 people had never regulated anything, they'd never looked50￼1 at any price anywhere, they've never done a single2 thing, it's a sham; and therefore, that's the end of it.3 What about that?4 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. If I can just finish my5 answer to Justice -- I have one other point to make6 for -- to Justice Kagan, who has asked it twice.7 The -- my last point I want to make -- and8 then I will answer this -- is that this county -- this9 hospital authority, like many, facing a capacity10 constraint and a -- and a nondiscretionary mandate to11 serve the public needs for hospitalization, had two12 choices.13 It could have tried to convince the State to14 spend three times as much money to get half the number15 of beds, notwithstanding the existence of excess￼16 capacity; or it could buy the other hospital and get17 that capacity in a consensual transaction by the18 authority.19And here's my point, Justice Scalia, this all fours with this Court's decision in Omni. that this may have long been desired by20 case is on21 The notion22 this -- this special-purpose entity is totally23 irrelevant. This -- this acquisition was proposed to,24 considered by, and -- and approved by the hospital25 authority.511 And not only that, when the FTC came and2 complained about it, they reconvened another public3 meeting and discussed it again and came to the4 conclusion again that they wanted to acquire this5 hospital.6 And before they signed the lease, they7 issued a notice and comment period. There was three8 months for people to tell the authority whether this9 lease was or was not consistent with community10 interests. They had a public meeting, and they approved11 it. And that is the act of the State.12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can the State --13 does the State have a procedure where it can give14 real-time approval? In other words, this is going on,15 and the hospital authority says, boy, the FTC is sending16 us these letters. State, could you do something to show17 that you approve this transaction, whether it's a18 special law or there is some organization, I guess, in19 some other case, setup, that could give its approval?20 Is there --21 MR. WAXMAN: I mean, this is -- the Hospital22 Authorities Law says, counties, this is your23 responsibility, here are your powers. If anybody in the24 State or any competitor or the attorney general thinks25 that you are abusing those statutory powers, the courts52￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425are open and quite receptive to those concerns. But there's no --CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I know. But I guess my point is can the burden of going forward be switched the other way? And can this hospital authority say -- you know, to the State, we would like some blessing on this, so that we can go ahead with it?So the choices aren't really build your own hospital or acquire the other one, in the abstract, but ask the State -- you know, what do you want us to do? Do you want us to build a new hospital? Or is it okay if we acquire this one?MR. WAXMAN: I don't believe there is any such mechanism, and I believe that the -- the State -- the legislature didn't contemplate anything like that, because the mandate and the responsibility and the authorization was devolved to the counties.Now, Mr. Chief Justice, what the -- what the hospital authority could do and did do, although it's not in the record of this case, is evaluate the likelihood of getting a certificate of need to build the additional required facilities.Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Horwich, you have 4 minutes remaining.53￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. HORWICH: Thank you.I guess I -- I heard several members of the Court asking Mr. Waxman, specifically, Where do you find this? Where can you locate this intent to displace competition in the statute? And I would like to just run through, if I could, each of his answers and why I think they are insufficient.So the first one, of course, we've talked a lot about the existence of general corporate powers, but the most natural inference there is that the State expects those to be exercised in conformity with the background principles that anybody else who has general powers has.Now, the idea that the authority has a mandate, a purpose it's supposed to serve, of course, that's always true. States always have some purpose in mind when they set up some sub-State entity. The question isn't whether there is particular ends the State is trying to pursue.The question here is whether the State intended to pursue those ends through the particular means of displacing competition, here, displacing competition in the market for paid healthcare services.54￼1 And see Mr. Waxman also pointed to the rate of2 return provision in the statute. Now, as a sort of a3 threshold matter, there's -- if past is prologue, there4 is not any reason to think that that will be not be5 rigorously enforced with respect to the privately6 controlled operations here. But -- and that's sort of7 the second question presented, and we can set that aside8 for the moment, I guess.9 But it seems to me there are two far more10 natural explanations for the presence of the rate of11 return provision in the statute than the one Mr. Waxman12 would like you to -- to give to it.13 The first explanation is this is a statute14 about providing public care for indigents. Nobody15 should be making a profit off of that, and the State16 wants to say that. And that seems to be a very natural17 explanation that doesn't depend at all on the State18 intending to displace competition completely.19 The -- the rate -- the price regulation20 provision also can be naturally understood as a response21 to the recognition that there will be some de facto22 monopolies in the situation where there is only one23 hospital in the county.24 But it does not mean that the State wants25 there to be more monopolies, so that it can bring in the55￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425unfortunate medicine of rate regulation to respond to those. Presumably, the State intends, as is the accepted background principle of free market competition in this country, that there won't be monopolies, unless they -- unless they arise of necessity.interrupt --JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, can IMR. HORWICH: Yes.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- you, just a moment, to address a question raised by Justice Breyer, which is your alternative argument?MR. HORWICH: Yes.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You have lots of evidence that the authority does very little oversight of these hospitals when they move forward. But is that the issue before us? Is the question of immunity as to what happens in the operation of the hospital or in their merger and acquisition, their actual formation?And -- so that to the extent that we were to conclude that the State has delegated immunity on the basis of merger, why do we need to look any further at whether there has or has not been an appropriate degree of supervision of that decision?MR. HORWICH: Right. Well, the -- the --I -- I don't think the two are entirely -- are entirely56￼1 separable, as a matter of competition law, because the2 reason the competition law is concerned with mergers is3 not because of the transaction as such, but it's because4 of what it does going forward to the structure of the5 market and the competitive behavior of those in the6 market.7 And so the State Action Doctrine says that8 the State -- if the State's going to go create monopoly,9 it needs to take ownership of that monopoly. And I'm10 using ownership not in the literal sense, but at least11 ownership in the sense of actively supervising the12 monopoly, to be sure that it is pursuing the -- the13 objectives that the State has in mind for creating it.14 So that's -- that's why we are still concerned there.15 Mr. Waxman referred to the Certificate of16 Need Law. I think there is a very close analogy to be17 drawn to Goldfarb here. That is the -- the question of18 minimum fee schedules agreed to by lawyers. The State19 of -- the State of Virginia regulated entry into the20 market for the practice of law, just as the certificate21 of need regulates entry into the hospital market.22 But horizontal agreements among people23 already in the market, such as here and such as the24 minimum fee schedule in Goldfarb, are not exempt just25 because of it.57￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
