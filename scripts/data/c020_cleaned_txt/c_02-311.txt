Mr. Verrilli.ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR. ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:Under the clearly established law of Strickland v. Washington, a lawyer's decision about how to defend a client facing a death sentence must be supported either by a thorough investigation or by a reasonable professional judgment supporting limitation on investigation.In this case, the Maryland Court of Appeals andthe Fourth Circuit applied that rule in an objectively unreasonable manner. Kevin Wiggins' lawyers did not fulfill what this Court described in Williams against Taylor as their obligation under Strickland to investigate thoroughly their client's background, and no reasonable professional judgment in fact supports or could support their failure to do so.QUESTION: Do you think the Williams case is a white horse for you, that is, I mean, that it's exactly identical to this case?31111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. VERRILLI: I do not think it's exactly2 identical to this case, Your Honor, but we think it3 clearly informs this case both by explaining what an --4 what an objectively unreasonable application of Strickland5 amounts to and in emphasizing the critical importance of6 investigating a -- a -- your client's background as -- as7 a prerequisite to making informed, reasonable choices8 about how910 after the 1112 but -- 1314 purposes of deciding whether what Maryland did was an15 unreasonable application of then-existing Federal law.16 MR. VERRILLI: I disagree with that, Justice17 Scalia, for the following reason. Williams, like this18 case, was an AEDPA case and all Williams could do was19 decide whether Strickland had been unreasonably applied.20 Williams was -- because Williams was an AEDPA case, was a21 2254(d)(1) case, Williams could break no new ground by22 definition, and therefore, the -- the fact that Williams23 concluded what it did about Strickland's requirement,24 means that that is what Strickland requires. And that --25 and -- and so we don't think it -- we're going beyond41111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005best to defend your client.QUESTION: But -- but wasn't Williams decided Maryland Supreme Court's opinion here?MR. VERRILLI: Yes, it was Justice Scalia,QUESTION: So, therefore, it can't be used for￼1 AEDPA in the least.2 QUESTION: Yet, you go back to Strickland and3 you can't find the principle that you're now enunciating.4 MR. VERRILLI: Oh, no, no. I disagree with5 that, Mr. Chief Justice. We think it's right on page 6906 and 691 of -- of Strickland, and here's the principle that7 we think -- Strickland specifically says, as we read it,8 that a lawyer's judgment about how to defend a client has9 either got to be based on complete investigation or, if10 it's based on less than complete investigation, it's11 reasonable only to the extent that reasonable professional12 judgment supports the limitation on investigation. That's13 the rule.14 QUESTION: Last year in Bell -- Bell versus15 Cohen -- Cone, we stressed that it is a tremendously16 deferential regard that we have to the lawyer's action in17 a case like that.18 MR. VERRILLI: Yes, but there's a fundamental19 difference between this case and Bell v. Cone, Mr. Chief20 Justice, and it's this. Bell v. Cone was not a case about21 the failure to investigate. That was purely a case about22 counsel's decisions about what information to present to23 the sentencer after having done what was indisputably a24 thorough investigation.25 And the reason that's critical is because as --51111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 as we read Strickland, the whole point of the deference2 given to counsel's choices about what to present is3 premised on the adequacy of the investigation that4 precedes them. That is what the source of the deferential5 stance towards presentation is. It's the adequacy of6 investigation.7 QUESTION: Is that what this case8 Mr. Verrilli, about failure to investigate?9 MR. VERRILLI: This case is aboutis about, both, but it's10 principally about --11 QUESTION: It would seem to me if12 would have to establish pretty clearly that13 not know these many things that you say he did not know.14 And in fact, counsel was never asked the question, did you15 know this, did you know that, did you know -- we don't16 know what counsel --17 I -- I'm looking at the joint appendix on18 page 490. He knew a lot of these things. He's -- he's --19 he's asked did you know that Wiggins had been removed from20 his natural mother as a result of a finding of neglect and21 abuse when he was 6 years old? Yes, he says, I knew that.22 That was in the social service records. So you knew it.23 Yes.24 You also knew that there were reports of sexual25 abuse at one of the foster homes. Yes, he knew that.61111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005it were, you counsel did￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425You also knew he had his hands burned as a child as a result of his mother's abuse of him. Yes, he knew that.You also knew about homosexual overtures made towards him by his Job Corps supervisor. Yes.And you also knew he was -- he was borderline mentally retarded. Yes.Now, that -- that examination could have -- could have gone further, but you didn't know, did you, this, this, this, this, and this. There's no examination like that. We know that he knew many things about thisperson's the restScalia.know it?background, but we don't know that he didn't know of it.MR. VERRILLI: I disagree with that, JusticeQUESTION: Well, how do we know that he didn't￼MR. VERRILLI: Well, here's how. There -- there are two absolutely compelling reasons, but before I get to them, I think it's important to look at the very next thing that the lawyer says in that colloquy. And the very next thing the lawyer says is, well, yes, at least I knew what was reported in other people's reports. And that is what led the Maryland Court of Appeals to the conclusion it reached, which was that the social service records and71111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the pre-sentence records, other people's reports, contained that information, and we have shown by clear and convincing evidence that they do not.But there are two additional points that are critical here, and the first one is this. The trier of fact, the actual judge who heard that testimony --QUESTION: I -- I have to correct you. That -- he -- he didn't say that all of this that he knew he only knew because it was in other people's reports. The question was -- he had just said -- and you also knew that he was borderline mentally retarded. Yes.He -- then another question is begun. You knew interrupts the question and he says, at least I as it was reported in other people's reports, that was the fact that he was borderlineall -- heknew thatyes. The mentally retarded.￼the --MR. VERRILLI: Justice Scalia, that is not howQUESTION: That's how it reads.MR. VERRILLI: -- Maryland Court of Appeals read it. It is not how the Fourth Circuit read it.QUESTION: The court of appeals and the Fourth Circuit must have read it wrong because that's the way it reads.MR. VERRILLI: But -- but, Justice Scalia, what81111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 matters here for AEDPA purposes under (d)(2) is whether2 the court of appeals based its determination on an3 unreasonable factual finding, and there are two -- there4 are two critical indicia here that it did. The first5 one -- the first one is this. Well, there are three.6 First, the records don't contain the7 information.8 Second, the trier of fact, the judge who heard9 this testimony, concluded -- and this is at page 605 and10 606 of the joint appendix -- that Mr. Schlaich, the lawyer11 who gave that testimony, did not know what was in the12 social -- what was in the social history subsequently13 prepared.14 QUESTION: This was in the trial itself or in a15 State habeas proceeding?16 MR. VERRILLI: In the State habeas proceeding,17 Your Honor. His -- at the conclusion of his testimony and18 during closing argument by the -- by the government in19 that State habeas proceeding, the -- the trier of fact who20 heard the testimony, could assess demeanor, could assess21 credibility, heard all the other evidence, saw all the22 other evidence, concluded that he didn't know and found it23 was error.24 And then -- and the next point that we think25 conclusively demonstrates that -- that the lawyers did not91111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 know is this. Remember that -- that at the close of the2 sentencing proceeding, not the post-conviction proceeding,3 Mr. Chief Justice, but the actual sentencing proceeding,4 counsel for Wiggins made a proffer of what mitigating5 evidence they would have submitted to the sentencing jury6 had their motion to bifurcate been granted. That proffer7 doesn't mention any of the mitigating evidence that --8 that we have shown in the social history -- doesn't9 mention the terrible abuse of the first 6 years of his10 life. It doesn't mention the horrible burning incident.11 It doesn't mention the sexual abuse. It doesn't mention12 the homelessness. There's no conceivable reason why13 counsel would have withheld all of that information from14 its proffer at the conclusion of the sentencing phase of15 the proceeding if counsel knew that and could --16 QUESTION: So that counsel referred to other17 people's reports and other reports. Can we draw any18 inference from the record that there were some reports19 other than the -- I take it it's the social -- social20 services report?￼2122232425 any otherMR. VERRILLI: Well, I think there was -- QUESTION: And the pre-sentence and social -- MR. VERRILLI: Pre-sentence.QUESTION: -- and social services? Were there documents that --101111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 MR. VERRILLI: The -- there is a document which2 the State has lodged which indicates that there were3 transcripts of interviews with family members. Those4 aren't in the record, but I think the same exact analysis,5 the same exact inference has to be drawn. If those6 included the kind of terrible descriptions of -- of7 it would have shown up in the psychologist's report8 because, after all, what that document shows is the9 psychologist got those interviews and it would havehad abuse,shown10 up in the 1112 social -- 13proffer because that is the most --QUESTION: And -- and the psychologist's is the social services report.MR. VERRILLI: No. That's separate -- QUESTION: That's a separate report.MR. VERRILLI: That's a separate --QUESTION: That's exactly my -- look, there is a14 15 1617 document here called lodging and it says, Baltimore City18 Department of Social Services Department File. Now, in19 looking through it briefly, I cannot find in it all the20 references that you say are not in it.￼21 MR. VERRILLI: They are --22 QUESTION: I don't think they're there.23 MR. VERRILLI: They are not there.24 QUESTION: But this says, other people's25 reports, and I'm perhaps going to hear in about 20 minutes111111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 from now that there could be other reports to which he was2 referring which are not in this document and which might3 be those other -- those other interviews with other4 people, et cetera. In other words, I don't want you to5 sit down -- it's -- it's one thing if I'm supposed to look6 at this document and say did this lawyer investigate the7 background, and the answer I think would be no. But it's8 quite another thing if he knew all kinds of other things9 from other sources, namely about the burned hands, all the10 things you've listed. So I want to be sure.11 Now, you're referring me one other thing, the12 proffer. But in respect to the proffer, since I've read13 the briefs, I suspect I will hear the following. Of14 course, he didn't want to proffer this. His strategic15 decision was to make the jury think that this man might16 not have done it, and the more lunatic we make him sound,17 the more the jury is going to think the opposite.￼1819 me--2021 I've read 22232425 because IMR. VERRILLI: Justice Breyer, let me -- letQUESTION: Or I suspect I'll hear that because it.MR. VERRILLI: Let me address --QUESTION: So I would like you --MR. VERRILLI: Let me address that directly think this goes the essence of why the Maryland121111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 Court of Appeals judgment was an unreasonable application2 of -- of the Strickland rule, and it's this.3 The proffer occurred in the following context.4 Counsel for Wiggins made a motion to bifurcate the5 sentencing proceeding so that they could first retry the6 factual case of eligibility, and then if they lost, they7 could then put on the full-blown mitigation case.8 QUESTION: That would have involved the9 principal issue had they -- as a separate --10 MR. VERRILLI: Right. Bifurcation would have11 first involved the principalship, and then had12 principalship been established to the jury's satisfaction,13 they would have moved to the issue of mitigation. And14 the -- and the trial judge denied that motion. Now, he15 denied that motion -- this is critical -- on the first day16 of the sentencing hearing. So up to the first day of the17 sentencing hearing, Kevin Wiggins' lawyer's strategy was18 obviously to prepare both a principalship case and a19 mitigation case because they made a motion that was20 designed to allow them to do precisely that. So there is21 no conceivable justification for them to have failed to do22 everything a reasonable lawyer would have done to develop23 a mitigation case.24 And they -- and what the proffer shows -- I'm25 afraid the proffer cannot, Justice Breyer, be explained on131111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 the basis that Your Honor described for this reason. The2 point of the proffer -- the point of the proffer was to3 show the judge and to create a record on appeal of what4 they would have shown had the bifurcation been granted and5 they could have tried their mitigation case. This proffer6 was their mitigation case.7 QUESTION: What about the first part which was8 Justice Kennedy's part, I think so far all of our parts --9 questions, which is when you read just the part that10 Justice Scalia read to you -- and he says it's on the11 basis of other people's reports -- will the other side12 concede or how do we know it's -- what he's referring to13 is this document rather than some other set of documents?14 MR. VERRILLI: Well, I think what's critical in15 that regard is what the Maryland Court of Appeals found16 because what AEDPA requires deference to is factual17 findings made by a State court. And what the -- and the18 factual finding that the Maryland Court of Appeals19 found -- made is on page 121 of the appendix to the20 petition in the -- in the second paragraph there. It --21 it says, counsel was indeed aware of Wiggins' unfortunate22 background. They had available to them not only the23 pre-sentence investigation, but detailed social service24 records documenting sexual abuse and physical abuse.25 That is the sum and substance, the total, of141111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 what the Maryland Court of Appeals said in terms of the2 facts here. It's the sole factual finding. That factual3 finding --4 QUESTION: Did it say, and nothing else? Did it5 say, and nothing else?6 MR. VERRILLI: It said --7 QUESTION: You're -- you're making it as though8 it was a factual finding that this is all that he knew.9 Now, they knew that he knew that, but they didn't make a10 factual finding that he didn't know anything else.11 MR. VERRILLI: They -- the factual -- the only12 factual finding they made -- the only -- the only -- the13 only thing that supports and explicates the general14 statement at the outset of that paragraph that they were15 aware of his unfortunate childhood is the specific factual16 finding that the social service records documented sexual17 abuse and documented physical abuse. We've shown by clear18 and convincing evidence that that finding is wrong.19 And then under (d)(2) in AEDPA the question is20 whether the Maryland Court of Appeals' judgment was -- was21 based on an -- an unreasonable factual determination. And22 we've shown that the only thing that they found --23 QUESTION: Mr. Verrilli, I'd like to come back24 to the habeas -- the State habeas decision that you --25 that you cited us to, which is on the joint appendix151111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 page 604. Now, as I understand it, if you're making a2 claim of failure to investigate, the burden is on you to3 show that counsel did not know things that he would have4 learned on investigation. The burden is on you.5 As I read this court's decision, what the court6 is simply saying is, I don't ever remember a death penalty7 case where there was not a social history done. And so it8 was simply unthinkable not to have a social history.9 Then when you go across the page, so, therefore,10 based upon the evidence that I have seen, I'm concluding11 it was error for them not to investigate it because I12 don't have any information before me to believe that they13 did not have this information available to them.14 You see the context? And I understand what15 you're saying, but the context of this case is that I have16 no reason to believe that they did have all of this17 information. That's not -- that's not enough to satisfy18 your burden. That court would have had to find I believe￼19 that they20 no reason21 22did not have this information, not I just have to believe that they had it.MR. VERRILLI: But --QUESTION: The court should have had to find23 they did not have this information. It doesn't find that.24 It just says I have no reason to believe that they had it.25 MR. VERRILLI: Justice Scalia, I disagree. I do161111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425not think that is a reasonable reading of what the trial judge held. What the trial --says --QUESTION: You -- you tell me what it means. ItMR. VERRILLI: The trial --QUESTION: -- I have no reason to believe that they did have all of this information.MR. VERRILLI: The trial judge said that he was concluding that it was error not to investigate. If they knew the information, it wouldn't have been error not to investigate and --QUESTION: No. Earlier the -- the trial judge says, I just don't think -- I -- I don't know any capital --MR. VERRILLI: With all due respect, Justice Scalia --QUESTION: -- I don't know any capital case in which a social history wasn't done.MR. VERRILLI: With all due respect --QUESTION: I think he -- I think he reversed simply because you're always supposed to do a social history.MR. VERRILLI: With all due respect, Your Honor, the very sentence that you pointed to said, based on the evidence that I have seen, I'm concluding it was error for171111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425them not to investigate it. If they knew the information, he never would have reached that conclusion.QUESTION: No. He reached the conclusion because --MR. VERRILLI: And that's completely supported by the proffer.QUESTION: He reached the conclusion becausehe--QUESTION: No two voices at the same time. Justice Scalia is asking you a question.MR. VERRILLI: Excuse me.QUESTION: He reached the conclusion because he said, I have no reason to believe that they had the information. He never made the finding that they didn't have it.MR. VERRILLI: I think that's implicit, Justice Scalia, in his conclusion that it was error not to investigate, and I think it's completely confirmed by the proffer which didn't include any of this information and for which there would have been absolutely no explanation for its exclusion. Absolutely none whatsoever. So I think with respect to the -- to the factual finding that the Maryland Court of Appeals made, that the social services records documented abuse and provided the source of his knowledge, that's clearly erroneous.181111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Mr. Verrilli, you said absolutely no2 reason why it wouldn't come in if they had it. Why3 couldn't counsel for the defense think if we introduce4 this, it's going to be subject to cross examination? And5 if we look at that social history, we find out that the6 whole thing is -- the defendant himself was the source of7 the information about the horrible sexual abuse he had8 been exposed to as a child. The jury might find that a9 person who had been so abused would be full of hate and10 therefore very likely would have had the mental state to11 carry out this brutal murder that -- in other words, that12 this kind of information could be a two-edged sword. The13 jury could infer from it he's not fully responsible for14 his acts or, on the other hand, that this person was15 violent, full of hate, and indeed committed this brutal16 murder.17 MR. VERRILLI: Well, I think, Your Honor, I'm18 going to answer Your Honor's question directly, but I -- I19 need a minute to do it.20 QUESTION: Yes.21 MR. VERRILLI: The question under Strickland, it22 seems to us, is that once you've concluded that there was23 a failure to investigate adequately, the question is24 whether there is a reasonable probability that the outcome25 would have been different as a result of that failure.191111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 And in this case, it seems to me, that means that what2 we -- and Strickland also stresses that that is an3 objective test. That is not based on the idiosyncracies4 of the individual decision makers. It's an objective5 analysis.6 And so the question here is whether had this7 information been investigated, if it was in the hands of8 competent counsel, is there a reasonable probability that9 competent counsel would have used it and introduced it,10 and then is there a reasonable probability that it would11 have affected the sentencing jury's outcome.12 And the second half of that analysis, it seems13 to us, is answered a fortiori by Williams against Taylor.14 The first half of that analysis seems to us15 clearly to support relief here because, as I take Your16 Honor's question, it's a question of, well, there might be17 a justification for not submitting this evidence to the18 jury. Yes, there might. We think in a case like this19 one, it would be an unreasonable choice not to do so20 because this evidence has so little of what this Court has21 described in other cases like Burger and Darden as a sharp22 double edge, and it is so powerfully mitigating that we23 don't think it would have that effect.24 But we -- we respectfully suggest that's not the25 relevant question. Once you've established deficient201111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 performance with respect to investigation, then we shift2 to the prejudice inquiry, and it's an objective analysis.3 And so long as there is a reasonable probability that4 competent counsel would have used this information in5 combination with the case that they made, then -- and6 there's a reasonable probability that the outcome would7 have been affected, which I think Williams v. Taylor8 establishes for us, then we have shown what we need to9 show to be entitled to relief.10 QUESTION: Do you --11 QUESTION: What are the --12 QUESTION: What do you think the test is that13 Williams against Taylor lays down as to determining a -- a14 probability of a different outcome?15 MR. VERRILLI: Well, I think, if I may just draw16 from Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion with respect to17 that. If there's an obvious failure on the part of the18 State court to consider the totality of the record, that's19 an unreasonable application with respect to prejudice.20 And with -- in Williams, of course, as Your Honor's21 dissenting opinion pointed out, there was a much more22 severe case of aggravating information than here.23 Williams had a terrible, long record of violence. Wiggins24 has none. And the mitigating evidence here is even25 stronger than the mitigating evidence that existed in the211111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 Williams case.2 And so we think it follows directly from3 Williams that -- that if you look at whether there's a4 reasonable probability that the outcome would have been5 different here on the basis of submitting this evidence,6 that we think that's a very clear and easy case under the7 standards that Williams sets.8 QUESTION: Are -- are you making any argument9 that the ruling on the bifurcation motion might also have10 been different if there had been a proffer of this? Or11 did the judge rule on the bifurcation motion without12 knowing what the mitigation evidence might be?13 MR. VERRILLI: The -- factually, Justice14 Kennedy, it's the latter. The -- he ruled on the15 bifurcation motion at the outset of the -- of the trial.16 QUESTION: Is -- is that a common motion in17 Maryland capital cases, to try to bifurcate the sentencing18 proceeding?19 MR. VERRILLI: At the time it was, and the20 reason it was, Mr. Chief Justice, is because sometime21 shortly before this case was tried in Baltimore County,22 another Baltimore County judge had allowed such a motion.23 And we think that fact reinforces the utterly24 unreasonable character of the failure to investigate here.25 These lawyers had a -- had -- had to think there was a221111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 reasonable prospect they were going to be able to put on a2 mitigation case, but we know that all they had to put on3 that mitigation case was the psychologist's testing. And4 after all, that -- all that psychologist did was test.5 QUESTION: But they would -- they would be6 fighting over the principalship too, would they not?7 MR. VERRILLI: Yes, but that -- the point of8 bifurcation was to do principalship first, and if they9 prevailed on principalship, they wouldn't go to the second10 phase. And only if they didn't prevail on principalship11 would they go to the second phase where they wouldn't have12 any of the tactical cross currents they were worried about13 because principalship was already established and they14 could go whole hog and make the fullest mitigation case15 possible.16 And the fact that they were -- that they were17 endeavoring to follow that strategy until the first day of18 the sentencing hearing, October 11th, 1989, shows that19 they didn't -- that all they had as of October 11, 1989,20 was the psychologist's report -- shows that they did not21 investigate at the level that Strickland requires.22 QUESTION: Mr. --23 QUESTION: What about the psychological reports,24 Mr. Verrilli? Those were available to defense counsel?25 MR. VERRILLI: Yes, Justice O'Connor.231111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425counsel.QUESTION: And indeed, obtained by defenseMR. VERRILLI: Yes, Justice O'Connor.QUESTION: And what did they reveal in this area of mitigation?MR. VERRILLI: They were -- the -- the -- there are two things that are important about the psychologist's report: one, what it does contain; the other, what it doesn't contain.The psychologist was commissioned in this case to do testing of Mr. Wiggins, intelligence testing and then psychological profiling, MMPI-type testing. The evidence is undisputed about that. That's what the psychologist did.The thing that's significant about what wasdiscovered was the fact that Mr. Wiggins was of borderline intelligence, which seems to us quite relevant and entirely consistent -- it would have been entirely consistent, even absent bifurcation, to use that evidence, in addition to an effort to disprove principalship, because the borderline intelligence would easily and strongly have supported the conclusion that Mr. Wiggins was an accomplice and not a principal.But the thing it doesn't show is any of the history of abuse, and that's because the psychologist241111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 wasn't commissioned to do that. They didn't do what they2 needed to do here, which was to do the social history.3 The evidence is clear that it was routine practice in4 these public defenders' office to do the social history.5 They admitted that. The evidence is clear -- and the --6 and the public defenders admitted it -- that funds were7 available for that purpose. They just didn't do it. They8 just dropped the ball on this. They didn't do what all9 the lawyers in their office did routinely, and they didn't10 do what the State post-conviction trial judge said he had11 never seen not done, which is prepare this social history12 and --13 QUESTION: Mr. Verrilli, is -- is there any14 evidence, one way or the other, as to whether defense15 counsel simply sat down with the defendant and said, tell16 us about your background and what has happened to you in17 your life? Is there any evidence one way or the other18 about that?19 MR. VERRILLI: There is not. There is not, but20 it wouldn't be a surprise, Justice Souter, that even if an21 interview like that occurred, that the defendant would not22 have revealed it, that -- it's very difficult to get this23 kind of history of horrible personal abuse out of a24 defendant. It very often requires a professional to do25 it. That is why -- that's the very reason why the social251111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425workers are brought in to do the kinds of social histories as a -- as a routine matter. And it wasn't done here.If there are no further questions, I'd like to reserve my remaining time.QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Verrilli. Mr. Bair.ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY E. BAIRON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSMR. BAIR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleasethe Court:I'd like to first start with a correction in thefactual record in this case. Counsel for petitionerhas -- has referred the Court to JA605 and 606. And indeed, that was a comment made by the post-conviction court during the State post-conviction proceedings. However, that was an oral comment from the bench in April of 1994.The post-conviction court's written opinion did not issue until 1997. And in the post-conviction written opinion -- it was a 257-page written opinion. And that written opinion basically countermanded and superseded and disavowed the statements that are on page JA605 and 606. If you look to page 137a of the appendix to the petition for writ of certiorari, that is where you have the excerpts from --261111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: What page? What --MR. BAIR: 137a, Your Honor. That is where you have the excerpt from the State habeas, State post-conviction court's written opinion. And if you look at footnote 261 on that page --QUESTION: These are footnotes in the State court's opinion or footnotes in the -- in the appendix?MR. BAIR: This is in -- these are footnotes in the State post-conviction court's opinion. It was, as I said, a very lengthy opinion and had several hundred footnotes as well as 257 pages.By the time the post-conviction court rendered its final decision, its written decision, it had the transcripts from the post-conviction proceeding. And -- and as you may recall, the post-conviction proceeding lasted 5 months. Testimony was taken over 7 days in a 5-month post-conviction hearing.That footnote 261 is the transcript that Justice Scalia was referring to which is on JA490 and 491. So this is the testimony that the post-conviction court used to make its fact finding. And in its fact finding it said Schlaich had more information than appeared in the PSI report.I would go back to what was said earlier. There were several sources of the information for trial counsel.271111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 In fact, I would -- I would tally them up to be six2 different sources. You had, obviously, the DSS reports,3 the lodged material that Justice Breyer referred to,4 220 pages of social background, educational background,5 medical background, because petitioner was in foster care6 from when he was about 6 years old to when he --7 QUESTION: Let me just get one thing straight on8 the -- the long footnote that you quote. They end up9 saying, you knew all this and you did not get a social10 history. Do you think it was -- a competent counsel would11 have gotten a social history or not knowing what he said12 he knew?13 MR.BAIR: Ithinkhegota--he--hegota14 social history in a different way, Your Honor. He didn't15 hire a forensic social worker. Instead, he obtained16 lengthy DSS reports, hired a psychologist, hired a17 criminologist, talked to family members, talked to the18 client. He didn't do it in the way that -- that counsel19 now says it should have been done.20 QUESTION: Is -- is the way that counsel says it21 should have been done the way that lawyers typically do it22 in -- in Maryland?23 MR. BAIR: I think they do it in different ways,24 Your Honor. I think -- I think sometimes they use25 forensic social workers. Sometimes they use281111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425psychologists.QUESTION: But they're wrong to tell us thatthey normally use social workers. Is that right? MR. BAIR: I think --QUESTION: That was -- his representation was that this case is unique because every other member of the defense bar routinely gets the social history. Are you -- is that right or wrong?MR. BAIR: I think it's wrong. I think it's wrong, Your Honor. I think that lawyers in Maryland use psychiatrists, they use psychologists, they use social workers, they use combinations thereof.QUESTION: But he didn't use any of these. MR. BAIR: Pardon me?QUESTION: He didn't use any of those.MR. BAIR: He -- he used a psychologist and heused a criminologist. And he obtained very lengthy DSS records.QUESTION: If -- the DSS records that he obtained -- are they all in the lodging or there are some other ones?MR. BAIR: Yes. They're all -- they're all in the lodging.QUESTION: Okay. Now, if -- if -- it's5 months -- it took 5 months. They went into this in291111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 great care. You've given us the lodging. I've looked2 through the lodging, my law clerk more thoroughly. I3 can't find a word about the sexual abuse. I can't find a4 word about the frightful things that he -- one I did find5 where it said for -- when he was taken from his mother6 at age 6, it's true that the mother hadn't fed him for7 2 days. All right. That's there, but none of this other8 stuff is there.9 And -- and, indeed, if he looked at any of it --10 anywhere for this other stuff, where would he have looked?11 Why wasn't that in the record which took 5 months, if in12 fact he looked? Why was there no more reference to it13 than an ambiguous statement where he seems to refer to the14 lodging?15 MR. BAIR: Your Honor, a couple of -- a couple16 of points to be made.17 First of all, I -- I agree, and I think we state18 in our brief, there is no specific reference to sexual19 abuse in those -- in -- in the lodging.20 QUESTION: And that's actually -- to me that's21 the most serious thing there is, I mean, in terms of22 shaping an individual who could later turn out the way23 that some have turned out. And -- and there is -- it was24 horrible in this case, and -- and there's absolutely no25 reference whatsoever that I can find that suggests that301111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 this lawyer even knew about it.MR. BAIR: Well, there is, Your Honor. That -- back to JA490 and 491.23 that goes 456 that he knew of it.7 QUESTION:8 know since -- since9 5 months, when I read them -- people can characterize them10 differently, but it seemed to me ambiguous, and the11 written reports could have easily referred to what I call12 the lodging. But if they didn't refer to the lodging,13 what did they refer to?14 MR. BAIR: The written reports and -- and I15 think the reports of others could be either written16 reports or oral reports. I think --17 QUESTION: What he said was -- what did he say?18 He said, in other people's reports. Yes, they could have19 been. So I would like to know. There's been 5 months of20 trial, as you said. There have been endless proceedings.21 In your opinion, what did they refer to if, in fact, they22 did not refer to the lodging? Because if they did refer23 to the lodging, the lawyer in those two pages out of the24 5 months simply made a mistake, repeating what he knew25 later and thinking that he had learned it earlier from the311111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005QUESTION: MR. BAIR:He said he knew about it.But the lawyer explicitly testifiedAnd what was -- that's why I want to that statement, the two pages out of￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425lodging.MR. BAIR: Your Honor, again, two -- two points to be made. One is if there is any ambiguity or any lack of a record here, I think under Strickland that inures to the detriment of petitioner. He had the burden at this hearing to rebut the -- the strong presumption of competence, the strong presumption of reasonable conduct.But let me go back to what the reports were. You had reports from the client. And I think, although, as -- as was asked earlier by Justice Souter, there's nothing in the record to say whether he spoke to his client. I think we can infer that he spoke to his client. He represented him for close to a year. Counsel for petitioner at post-conviction never pursued those lines of questioning. So I think we can assume that this lawyer talked to his client.QUESTION: The -- the post-conviction proceeding extended over a period of 5 months. How many trial days were there?MR. BAIR: There were 7 days, Your Honor, where testimony was taken in those 5 months --QUESTION: So it had recessed and then resumed --MR. BAIR: Yes.QUESTION: -- several times.321111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. BAIR: Yes, several times. It was --QUESTION: Mr. Bair, you -- you seem to accept that -- that all that he knew was as it was reported in other people's reports. But I just don't read the text that way. He said, at least I knew that as it was reported in other people's reports. And the that in that transcript is that he was borderline mentally retarded.MR. BAIR: I agree.QUESTION: That is the only thing that he said he got from other people's reports.MR. BAIR: I agree. I think --QUESTION: We don't know where he got all of the other information that he said he had.MR. BAIR: No, but I think logically, going back to the reports of sexual abuse, there's only one person that could have come from because even the Selvog report, which is what post-conviction counsel prepared -- Selvog testified at the post-conviction hearing that his sole source for the information about Wiggins' sexual abuse was from Wiggins himself.Now, Wiggins obviously spoke to his attorney. He spoke to the psychologist who interviewed him. He spoke to the criminologist that trial counsel hired. Clearly, I think an inference can be drawn that Wiggins reported that sexual abuse either directly to his attorney331111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 or to the criminologist or to the psychologist.2 QUESTION: And in your view on page 137a of the3 transcript, all of those matters are comprehended in this4 question and this answer toward maybe -- 10 lines from the5 top. You also knew that there were reports of sexual6 abuse at one of his foster homes? Yes.7 MR. BAIR: Yes.8 QUESTION: So the term -- the word reports there9 means that he relied on things other than that are in the10 lodging.11 MR. BAIR: Yes, I think so, Your Honor.12 QUESTION: To your knowledge -- and this is13 quite important to me. I'm just trying to find out what14 the -- if they were not referring to the lodging which15 contains the reports, if they were not referring to that￼16 document,17 referring1819 reports of the other experts in the case.they must have been referring to or they were to Wiggins' own statements.MR. BAIR: Either Wiggins' own statements or the20 QUESTION: Other experts21 MR. BAIR: Right. There22 QUESTION: He would have23 MR. BAIR: From Wiggins.24 QUESTION: After the trial was over.25 MR. BAIR: No, no, Your Honor.341111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005in the case.was --gotten them from?1 QUESTION: Before, before.2 MR. BAIR: This was all going on --3 QUESTION: That's the criminologist and the --4 MR. BAIR: Yes, yes. And those reports were5 prepared before trial or between trial and sentencing.6 There was a 2-and-a-half month postponement between the7 time of this trial and the time of the sentencing.8 QUESTION: All right. So the words, other9 people's reports, could have meant Wiggins told me or an10 expert whom I hired who talked to Wiggins told me.11 MR. BAIR: Yes.12 QUESTION: Yes,13 MR. BAIR: Or I14 other --15 QUESTION: That16 retarded. It only goes to whether he was mentally17 retarded.18 MR. BAIR: Yes.19 QUESTION: I'm puzzled about another thing.20 MR. BAIR: The only other --21 QUESTION: Do those reports refer to sexual22 abuse?23 MR. BAIR: Pardon me, Your Honor?24 QUESTION: Do those reports refer to sexual25 abuse?351111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005okay.guess the only -- the only-- that he was mentally￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. BAIR: The only report that refers to sexual abuse -- now, the only written report that refers to sexual abuse is the Selvog report.QUESTION: The what?MR. BAIR: The -- the Selvog report was the one done by the social worker during post-conviction by -- by post-conviction counsel.The psychologist's report was an oral report. So we don't really know exactly what he knew because there -- that was never reduced to writing.QUESTION: Well, I'm still puzzled. Were there any written reports available to the lawyer that referred to sexual abuse that we know about?MR. BAIR: No.QUESTION: So then when he said you know that there were reports of sexual abuse at one of his foster homes, he was wrong.MR. BAIR: No. I think he -- he was referring to -- he could have been referring to reports of Wiggins himself.QUESTION: Oh, oh. I see what you're saying -- QUESTION: Oral reports.MR. BAIR: Oral reports.QUESTION: That -- that word reports does notmean written reports.361111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. BAIR: I don't think it has to refer to written reports, Your Honor.The only -- just to follow up with Justice Breyer, the only other report was the pre-sentence investigation. That was the other written report that was available to counsel.QUESTION: But that didn't have --MR. BAIR: No, no, no.QUESTION: I mean, what's worrying me obviouslyis we're -- we're turning an awful lot here on this word, other reports, which came in a fairly long hearing and which would normally be taken as referring to written reports, though it doesn't say that. And I'm -- that makes me concerned. I'm not sure where to go with it.MR. BAIR: Well, I think two points, Your Honor. One, counsel did testify and it was undisputed -- it was never in any way negated through cross examination or any other vehicle -- that he knew of sexual abuse. In fact, he specifically answered the question, the more specific sexual abuse question, I knew about the Job Corps overture. So those answers are unequivocal and they stand in the record unchallenged.QUESTION: Yes, but that's troubling because the Job Corps overture is -- is quite mild compared to the repeated days, months-on-end physical abuse suffered at371111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the hands of the stepfather. MR. BAIR: I agree.QUESTION: And it seems to me that this -- well, I'll ask you. Does this permit us to make the inference that if he had known this, he would have brought it out?MR. BAIR: I think --QUESTION: Because it's just very difficult to see why he would not have.MR. BAIR: Well, I think he made a -- a reasonable tactical decision.QUESTION: That goes to the tactical point.MR. BAIR: I think he made a reasonable tactical decision. He had a powerful case. Under Maryland law, the jury had to find unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt that Wiggins was the principal, that is, the actual killer in this case.They also had to find unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt that the murder and the robbery occurred at the same time, and there was evidence in this case. This was a very unusual situation in that it wasn't even clear whether the robbery occurred simultaneously with the murder. There was a -- there was a -- a huge dispute at trial and at sentencing over when Ms. Lacs was killed because her body was discovered on a Saturday. Wiggins was in possession of her car --381111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Mr. Bair, may I ask? Did counsel during the -- the sentencing hearing come up with a theory as to what happened other than that his client was the killer?MR. BAIR: Yes, absolutely. He challengedand -- and very strenuously both during opening and -- and closing -- pointed out the evidence in the case that showed there were five fingerprints in Ms. Lacs' apartment that were not tied to anyone. There was a hat, some sort of a baseball hat, that was in the apartment.QUESTION: No, I understand -- but did he -- did he suggest who they might have belonged to? Did he come up with a theory as to who --MR. BAIR: No. I don't -- I don't think there was any particular person who was another suspect.QUESTION: He didn't suggest that the man who lived downstairs might have been involved.MR. BAIR: No. And that -- that was never challenged as part of any ineffective assistance of counsel in these proceedings, Your Honor.QUESTION: Mr. Bair, what -- what do you respond to opposing counsel's argument that it doesn't matter because you didn't know until the eve of trial that you wouldn't have had a bifurcated proceeding, so you should have been doing this research in contemplation of a391111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 bifurcated proceeding?2 MR. BAIR: Well, Your Honor, first of all, of3 course, our position is they were doing it. They had,4 as -- as I said, lots of information. They were doing it.5 They were -- they were keeping that option open.6 But another answer, Your Honor, is the evidence7 would not have been put on. The more evidence that --8 that actually came out in -- in, you know, the9 proceedings, the details that we've now learned of through10 the Selvog report, they are so double-edged. They are so11 potentially harmful particularly in the context of this12 case. Between the Selvog report and the lodged materials,13 the DSS records, the -- the jury would have heard not just14 that Kevin Wiggins was -- had been in foster care and had15 a clean record, which is all they did hear. In addition,16 if those records had come in, they would have heard that17 he hated his biological mother, that he was in fights with18 other foster children, that he had once stolen some19 gasoline and tried to set fire to -- to a building, that20 he had a disturbed personality --21 QUESTION: That all goes to explain why they22 wouldn't have put it in, but why didn't they put any of23 this in the proffer at the -- to the judge at the --24 MR. BAIR: There -- there was no need to, Your25 Honor. There's no need under Maryland law to give a401111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425detailed proffer. They -- they did not want to tip off the other side as to any potential things that might be negative to their client.And again, to the degree that we don't know about the details, it -- it inures to the detriment of Wiggins. It was his burden to bring out all of this evidence and he didn't do it.QUESTION: Does -- does the strength of the mitigating evidence have anything to do with whether a bifurcated proceeding is allowed?MR. BAIR: No.QUESTION: Would they have been more likely to get the bifurcated proceeding if they had come up with a lot of information about his childhood and so forth?MR. BAIR: I don't believe so, Your Honor. Of course --QUESTION: What does it turn on then?MR. BAIR: I think it was -- it was the trial court's discretion. I think it was just a -- this was back in 1989. There wasn't a lot of definitive law on it at the time. Since then, the Maryland Court of Appeals has said absolutely not.QUESTION: Was there a transcript of that hearing? He just said, I want a bifurcated hearing and sat down, or did he say, I want a bifurcated hearing411111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 because there's going to be very substantial mitigating2 evidence and I want the jury to consider that separately?3 What did he -- do we have a transcript of what he said4 here?5 MR. BAIR: I think we do have a transcript, Your6 Honor, and my recollection is that there was a short7 discussion of it, not -- not a detailed discussion of it.8 QUESTION: No, but if he had been in a position9 to make a strong proffer, why wouldn't he have made it?10 His case for a bifurcated hearing would have been stronger11 if he had had a strong proffer. Wouldn't it have been?12 MR. BAIR: It would have been stronger, Your13 Honor, but I think in all likelihood if you look -- if you14 look at the Maryland sentencing law, it contemplates it,15 as I said, the court of appeals in Maryland has since held16 definitively. In fact, in the direct appeal in this case,17 in the Wiggins case itself on direct appeal, they have18 held that the Maryland sentencing procedure in capital19 cases requires that the jury go through certain steps, and20 those steps all have to be done at a unitary hearing.21 Obviously, there's a bifurcated guilt/innocence and22 sentencing.23 QUESTION: Well --24 QUESTION: Well, obviously, the -- the defense25 counsel didn't know until the motion was made and ruled421111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425upon for a bifurcated hearing whether the judge would grant it, and there's no reason presumably that defense counsel should not have investigated the mitigating circumstances pending that ruling.MR. BAIR: I agree.QUESTION: And yet, we don't have a clear understanding of what he knew. And in fact, did not defense counsel tell the jury for sentencing that they would be hearing evidence about the defendant's background --MR. BAIR: They -- they did --QUESTION: -- at sentencing? And then nothing was put on.MR. BAIR: No, not -- not really, Your Honor.QUESTION: I mean, what -- what is the jury to make of that? It's so odd.MR. BAIR: I don't -- I don't think so, Justice O'Connor. I think -- I think what counsel did is if you look at the essence of the -- the approach at sentencing, clearly it was we're contesting principalship. There was one comment about you're going to hear what a tough life he had.Now, that was done I think for a couple reasons. One is the counsel knew that petitioner could allocute and probably would allocute personally to -- to the -- the431111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 jury.2 They also knew that there was going to be a3 criminologist who was going to testify because the jury4 knew there was only two choices for this man, either life5 or death. That was -- and life without parole. But they6 knew it was either life or life without parole or death.7 And they were also putting on evidence by a criminologist8 that would show that Wiggins would adjust well to a life9 sentence. So I think they10 the pre-sentence report --111213141516 AS 17you, Mr. Bair. you, Your Honor.-- they also knew that -- thatQUESTION: ThankMR. BAIR: ThankQUESTION: Mr. Himmelfarb, we'll hear from you.ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARBON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS￼MR. HIMMELFARB: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 18 please the Court:19 The position of the United States is that the20 Sixth Amendment imposed no obligation to present evidence21 of petitioner's background at sentencing. It imposed no22 obligation to conduct a more extensive investigation of23 his background before sentencing. Those conclusions24 follow from a straightforward application of Strickland25 versus Washington which judges attorney performance by a441111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 single standard, whether it was reasonable under all the2 circumstances of the case.3 The decision to choose a principalship defense4 and to reject a mitigation defense falls comfortably5 within the wide range --6 QUESTION: What's the bifurcated -- I've never7 heard of a bifurcated sentencing hearing. How does that8 work?9 MR. HIMMELFARB: My understanding, Justice10 Breyer, is that the basis for the motion was that the11 principalship defense could be undermined by presenting12 the mitigating evidence, so they wanted to do it13 separately.14 QUESTION: Right. So what do you do? You15 present the principalship defense and then the jury votes16 death or life, and then if they vote death, they go on and17 present the next one, and if the next jury or the same18 jury, having heard the other one, votes life, then it's19 life? I mean, I don't see how it works.20 MR. HIMMELFARB: My understanding is that under21 the theory advanced by petitioner's counsel in support of22 the bifurcation motion, principalship alone would be23 determined at the first phase of the sentencing. If the24 jury found principalship, there would be a second phase at25 which counsel could --451111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Okay. Under those circumstances,2 they're saying that, obviously, in that motion he would3 have given everything he knew about the background since4 he thought it might work that way, and if he didn't,5 that's evidence, in fact, amazingly convincing evidence,6 that he didn't know. He didn't know about the sexual7 history.8 And the main argument they're making has nothing9 to do with the strategic choice. It has to do with his10 failure to investigate.11 So what's your -- what's your response?12 MR. HIMMELFARB: If you look at the actual13 proffer that was made in support of the bifurcation14 motion, which is at pages 44 and 45 of the joint appendix,15 what counsel said was, I can proffer to the court that in16 a non-bifurcated proceeding, the defense is in a position17 of coming forward with evidence regarding psychological18 history on Mr. Wiggins.19 QUESTION: This is 40 -- page 44 of the appendix20 to the petition?￼2122 the joint 232425MR. HIMMELFARB: No, Mr. Chief Justice. It's appendix.QUESTION: Oh, the joint appendix?MR. HIMMELFARB: Page 44 at the bottom.I'm in a position to come forward with evidence461111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 regarding psychological history on Mr. Wiggins, including2 aspects of his life history, including a diagnosis of a3 personality disorder, including diagnosis of some4 retardation. So --5 QUESTION: So he says nothing whatsoever about6 the most frightful sexual abuse, about having the mother7 who did all the things that this one particularly did, not8 feeding them, burning their hands on the stove, et cetera.9 I won't list it. But I just don't see anything in the10 thing you've just read that suggests that he knew a single11 thing about that.12 MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, it's true it was a13 general proffer rather than a highly particularized14 proffer.15 QUESTION: Yes. And so their point is,16 obviously, if he had known about it, he would have said17 something, and the fact that he didn't say something, when18 coupled with the ambiguities on the pages, you know, 40419 or 405 or 401-402 -- you get what we're talking about, the20 footnote -- coupled with that shows that the correct21 reading of that is he didn't know about it.22 MR. HIMMELFARB: I think there's an important23 point to keep in mind here. The constitutional right24 petitioner has raised in this case is not the duty to25 know, it's the duty to investigate. The claim is that the471111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 investigation was constitutionally inadequate.2 And the other important thing to keep in mind is3 that there is significant evidence in the record that a4 significant investigation was done, an investigation which5 we think is constitutionally adequate.6 QUESTION: Mr. Himmelfarb, in that connection,7 there's something I'd like you to set me straight on.8 There was a statement at some point that each of the9 defense counsel thought the other was going to bear the10 laboring awe in working up the mitigation case. Now, it11 seems to me that each one thought the other was doing it12 and the other wasn't doing it. That would be ineffective13 representation if each one thought the other was14 investigating and it turned out neither investigated.15 MR. HIMMELFARB: I agree that would be16 problematic, but I don't think the record bears that17 suggestion out, again, going to the joint appendix.18 QUESTION: Well, where -- where do I get that19 notion from that each one thought the other was20 principally responsible for working up the mitigation21 case?22 MR. HIMMELFARB: Petitioner makes that argument23 in his brief, and there are record cites to support it.24 But we don't think the record cites do, in fact, support25 the notion that each counsel thought the other was481111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 responsible for investigating the mitigation case.2 There were two lawyers, Schlaich and Nethercott.3 At page 485 of the joint appendix, Schlaich testified that4 after he left the Baltimore County Public Defenders Office5 and went to another office, from that point forward his6 co-counsel, Ms. Nethercott, did most of the mitigation7 preparation with his guidance.8 Then Ms. Nethercott testified at the9 post-conviction hearing as well, and her testimony was10 that she had no responsibility for retaining experts,11 that that was Schlaich's responsibility.12 So I think that's a far cry from testimony by13 either that only the other one had responsibility for14 preparing the mitigation case. Each one was testifying15 about his or her particular responsibilities.16 QUESTION: Yes, but where -- the page you refer17 to, he says, when asked what he did in -- in mitigation,18 he said, well, basically what we did in mitigation was19 attempt to retry the factual case and try to convince the20 jury on the principalship issue. That doesn't sound like21 the kind of mitigation we're talking about.22 MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, that's right, Justice23 Stevens. It remains the case, though, that a substantial24 amount of investigation was done. That testimony --25 QUESTION: But this part of the transcript491111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼doesn't support that proposition.MR. HIMMELFARB: Well --QUESTION: That's the part you called our --MR. HIMMELFARB: -- in fairness to Mr. Schlaich,6 I think he was interpreting the question to mean what was7 your defense at sentencing, not so much what was your8 mitigation --9 QUESTION: That's right. So this part does not10 support the -- the proposition that he did any mitigating11 research himself or with the other person. He's talking12 about the principalship issue.13 MR. HIMMELFARB: I was just responding to14 Justice Ginsburg's question about whether it was true that15 each one testified that the other was responsible for the16 investigation. My only point is that I don't think the17 record bears out that suggestion in petitioner's brief.18 QUESTION: But it also doesn't show that there19 was substantial investigation, which is what you went on20 to say, and I don't think it's supported.21 MR. HIMMELFARB: I do, Justice Kennedy. The22 investigation that was done in this case by trial counsel23 was not materially different from the investigation that24 was done by post-conviction counsel. It was trial25 counsel, after all, who obtained the social services501111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 certainly 234 attention 5￼1 records that documented a history of neglect. Trial2 counsel directed public defender investigators to go out3 and interview petitioner's family members, which they did.4 Trial counsel hired a psychologist to conduct clinical5 interviews of petitioner which were done.6 Really the only difference between what trial7 counsel did and what post-conviction counsel did was that8 post-conviction counsel hired a social worker, a so-called9 mitigation specialist, who supervised the investigation10 and pulled the information together in a report.11 But we're talking here about whether there is a12 constitutional deficiency in the investigation, and any13 difference in14 fact that the15 the other, we16 significance.17 I do want to say a little bit about the duty to18 present claim because most of the focus in the argument19 has been on the question of the duty to investigate.the two investigations, which is really the social worker was there in the one but not think can't have constitutional￼20 We think that the principal defense was21 reasonable both because a finding of no principalship22 would have been an absolute bar to imposition of the death23 penalty and because the principalship case that the State24 put on here was so weak.25 We also think it was reasonable not to present a511111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 mitigation defense either in addition to the principalship2 defense or instead of it. It was reasonable not to3 present it in addition to the principal defense because it4 had a -- a very serious possibility of undermining it. It5 was reasonable not to present it instead of the6 principalship defense because mitigating evidence is just7 that. It's evidence that would be weighed against8 aggravating circumstances. It might or might not lead to9 a sentence of death.10 A finding of no principalship is a categorical11 bar to imposition of the death penalty. If a single juror12 harbored a reasonable doubt about whether petitioner had13 carried out the killing himself, it would be obligated to14 return a verdict of life.15 QUESTION: But presumably the -- the16 determination of the facts about the murder was made in17 the trial when he was determined guilty or innocent, and18 they found him guilty. And so to try to redetermine that19 at sentencing and not to offer any evidence in mitigation,20 do you think we can say that's reasonable?21 MR. HIMMELFARB: Absolutely. There were two22 different issues, one issue at the guilt phase, one issue23 at the sentencing, as far as the -- as far as petitioner's24 role is concerned. He was charged with first degree25 murder. As the jury was instructed, a conviction of first521111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425degree murder does not necessarily encompass a finding of principalship, a finding that petitioner himself had carried out the killing. So it was perfectly understandable that petitioner's counsel would think that contesting principalship at sentencing would be a reasonable strategy.QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Himmelfarb.Mr. Verrilli, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. VERRILLI: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd like to clarify the -- the facts surroundingthe proffer because it's very important to understand how this unfolded.Counsel for Wiggins made a motion. That motion was argued on October 11th, 1989 and denied at that time, the first day of the sentencing hearing. But the proffer was not made at that time. What -- what counsel for my friend, the United States, described was what Mr. Schlaich he would proffer if he had to proffer. He made the actual proffer at the end of the sentencing proceeding, and it can be found at pages, I think, 349 to 51 of the -- 348 to 51 of the joint appendix. And there's a lengthy proffer there of what he would have shown had he been able to put on his mitigation case in the -- in the method he wanted531111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 to. So--2 QUESTION: He does that -- he does that to3 argue --4 MR. VERRILLI: He's making a record for --5 QUESTION: -- after the fact that that the6 judge --7 MR. VERRILLI: He's making a record for appeal,8 Justice Kennedy. Here's the -- here's what we would have9 suffered because we wouldn't have been -- we weren't able10 to put on all of this mitigating evidence, and here it is.11 And so the sum total of his mitigation case is12 right there on the pages. He's described what it is and13 it contains nothing about the horrible abuse that this boy14 suffered. Nothing.15 Now, with respect to the question of whose16 responsibility it was, I think it is correct to focus on17 the -- the colloquy on page 485 of the -- of the joint18 appendix, but the question asked Mr. Schlaich there, as19 Justice Stevens' question suggested, was, well, he first20 says, well, it was Ms. Nethercott's job to develop21 mitigation. And then the question put to him is what22 guidance did you give her, obviously, about how to develop23 the mitigation case. And he says, well, what we decided24 to do was retry the factual case. That's the -- that's25 what he says he gave as guidance with respect to541111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 developing the mitigation case. So it's -- it's2 completely clear that this was neglect. They just dropped3 the ball.4 Now, with respect to what they actually did at5 the sentencing proceeding, picking up on Justice6 O'Connor's questions, I think this is critical as well.78 that's an9 this caseRemember, Strickland says no hindsight, but argument that works against the government in because what these lawyers actually did was, in10 opening statement, invite the jury specifically to11 consider not only the facts of the crime but, quote, who12 this person is, said they would hear he had a difficult13 life. And then they didn't deliver on that promise.14 But not only that, Dr. Johnson, the -- the15 criminologist, got up and testified, well, yes, violent16 people do tend to adjust well in prison. Well, that's not17 focusing on principalship. That, once again, is inviting18 the jury beyond principalship into the mitigation inquiry19 and giving them some reason to -- to mitigate, but of20 course, omitting all of the extraordinarily powerful21 reasons to mitigate that the social history shows.22 And then third, there was as a matter of law in23 Maryland a pre-sentence report that had to go to the jury.24 And there was nothing that Wiggins' lawyers could do to25 stop that. And that pre-sentence report gave a highly551111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 misleading and negative portrayal of Wiggins' background.2 And the -- what -- effect of what these lawyers did was to3 leave that unrebutted, further damaging Wiggins'4 prospects, further ensuring that he was going to get a5 death sentence.6 Now, if I could conclude by just reminding this7 Court that very recently in the Miller-El case, this Court8 said even in the context of Federal habeas, the9 deferential review of Federal habeas, there's a difference10 between deference and abdication. And what my friends on11 the other side are asking for here is the latter. They12 are asking for abdication. They are asking this Court to13 uphold a judgment even though the only factual finding the14 Maryland Court of Appeals made was wrong by clear and15 convincing evidence, and even though that proffer16 demonstrates that Wiggins' lawyers did not do the work17 necessary and did not know the powerful mitigation case18 that could have been made to save this man's life.19 Thank you.20 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you,21 Mr. Verrilli.22 The case is submitted.23 (Whereupon, at 12:03 p.m., the case in the24 above-entitled matter was submitted.)25561111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼
