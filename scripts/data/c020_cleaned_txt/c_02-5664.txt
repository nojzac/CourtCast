The United States.Mr. Short.ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY A. SHORTON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. SHORT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleasethe Court:On Friday, this Court entered its order statingthat counsel should be prepared to discuss the jurisdiction of this Court and of the court of appeals, and cited the Cohen v. Beneficial case, and they --QUESTION: Mr. Short, did that subject jurisdiction come up when you were in the court of appeals?MR. SHORT: It did not come up in the court of appeals, Justice O'Connor.In the first --QUESTION: It is interlocutory?MR. SHORT: It's a decision from -- it's a finaldecision under the collateral order doctrine. QUESTION: Well, that's the issue. Is it? MR. SHORT: That's the issue, I believe, yes.31111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: No trial has taken place?2 MR. SHORT: No trial has taken place, not at3 all.4 I -- I believe that this Court, of course, has5 jurisdiction pursuant to section 1254 because it granted a6 writ of certiorari to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.7 The court of appeals had jurisdiction pursuant to section8 1291, providing for appeal of final decisions of the9 district courts. I believe this was a final decision10 pursuant to the Cohen collateral final order doctrine.11 Now, while this Court has not addressed the12 collateral order doctrine under these set of facts, the13 courts of appeals that have, have unanimously concluded14 that an order approving the involuntary medication of a15 pretrial detainee constitutes an appealable order under16 Cohen, and these cases are set forth in footnote 5, page￼17 10 of the 1819 doctrine,20 must conclusively determine the dispute question, it must21 resolve an important issue completely and separate from22 the merits of the underlying action, and it must beGovernment's brief.In order to fall within the collateral order the order must satisfy several requirements. It23 effectively unreviewable on appeal from the final24 judgment.25QUESTION: Well, that's the question. Would --41111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 if it -- if we did not think there were jurisdiction, then2 at the end of the day, if the defendant were tried, I3 suppose that issue could be raised then.4 MR. SHORT: Except by that time, Justice5 O'Connor, his rights will have already been infringed. He6 will not be able to become unmedicated.7 QUESTION: Well, but that's not the point. The8 point is whether the third requirement has been met, that9 it is effectively nonreviewable unless it's reviewed this10 way. It seems to me it is reviewable.11 QUESTION: We held that in Riggins.12 MR. SHORT: Riggins -- Riggins was looking at a13 post conviction case, however, and looking only to see if14 his trial rights had been violated.15 QUESTION: Perhaps it depends on whether we're16 talking about the right to avoid medication, as opposed to17 the right to avoid medication for purposes of trial, and18 the latter would give you maybe somewhat more difficulty19 under prong 3, whereas the former, the right can only be20 vindicated by treating this as a final order. Would you21 accept that, or would you say that it's final even if what22 you're talking about is the right to avoid medication for23 purposes of standing trial?24 MR. SHORT: I would say on all three it would.25 Certainly under -- under the First and the Fifth51111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 Amendments, whatever rights he would have would have been2 infringed irreparably once he's medicated.3 QUESTION: Well, are there -- are there no ways4 to challenge that, except in the context of the criminal5 prosecution? I mean, if -- if you had objections to being6 medicated, whether for purposes of, of making your client7 capable of standing trial or not, if you had objections to8 being medicated, why couldn't those objections be brought9 under section 1983 or in some civil action?10 MR. SHORT: My reflections on that, Justice11 Scalia, is, it would probably be too late. By the time we12 brought any type of other action, I believe the Government13 would have proceeded in the criminal case and gone ahead14 with the order and had him medicated.15 I also see filing such an action with another16 district court, for example, having it defer to the court17 in which the criminal action was pending, I think there's18 some -- I think there's some procedural problems with, by19 the time that was done, Dr. Sell may have already been20 medicated, and of course -- we will address these issues21 hopefully in our briefs that are due, that are due Friday.22 QUESTION: What concerns me is, you know, the23 Cohen doctrine is over half a century old.24 MR. SHORT: Yes, sir.25 QUESTION: It has no rooting in the text. The61111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 text of Congress' statute is quite absolute. We have made2 in that half a century only three exceptions under the,3 under the Cohen doctrine, and I'm truly concerned about,4 about the extent to which this new exception would, would5 be available to disrupt criminal trials considerably. For6 example, a defendant, instead of challenging the, the7 order initially can, can half-way through trial decide he8 does not want any medication, and then the trial has to be9 postponed so that, so that the order to continue the10 medication can be appealed. I just see real difficulties11 in running a criminal justice system when, when this kind12 of an order is immediately appealable, rather than13 reviewable at the end of the criminal case.14 MR. SHORT: Again, Justice Scalia, all I can say15 is, I think by the time that would be reviewed, filed, and16 considered, I'm afraid Dr. Sell will have been medicated,￼17 and again 1819 think the20 as I understand it, is that even if that's the case,21 perhaps he has to wait till the end of the criminal trial22 in order to appeal it because our policy against piecemeal23 appeals in criminal cases has been so strict.we've already, of course --QUESTION: Well, that's perfectly true, but I hypothesis offered by Justice Scalia, at least24 MR. SHORT: I do -- I do understand that, but --25 and again, I think this is unreviewable.71111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Do you -- do you equate it to bail, bail pending trial? If it's denied, and the trial goes on, you can't get it back again once the trial is over. Is -- is that your point, with respect to once -- once he's drugged he can't be --MR. SHORT: Once --QUESTION: -- restored?MR. SHORT: It's a simple statement, but oncehe's medicated he can't be unmedicated.QUESTION: I think you're confusing unreviewablewith irreversible. To be sure, it can't be reversed, but can it be reviewed? In the case of bail, it can't be reviewed, because once the trial is over, it's a moot question. It cannot be reviewed. It's not just that it can't be reversed, it cannot be reviewed.But you're here asserting that this issue cannot be reviewed. It seems to me that's just patently false. It can be reviewed. Your complaint is that it can't be reversed, but that has never been the, the Cohen criterion.MR. SHORT: My view, Justice Scalia, is it can't be effectively reviewed. Once he's medicated with these drugs, whatever changes take place, these drugs are meant to cause changes to take place. That's the purpose of giving him these drugs. In effect, the decision will81111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 have been made, his mind will have been altered, in2 whatever segment that is altered, and that cannot be3 undone.4 QUESTION: That is his -- if that is his5 objection, and if his objection is not that my criminal6 trial will be distorted, he should bring a separate civil7 action and perhaps the court would stay the criminal8 action until that one is, until that civil action is9 determined, but it's an entirely different procedure to10 come in in the criminal case and seek an interlocutory11 appeal from that order, and I just don't --12 QUESTION: May I ask a question about the13 back -- about the background order? Isn't it correct that14 in this case the Bureau of Prisons got an order15 authorizing them to medicate your, your client?16 MR. SHORT: Justice Stevens, that is correct.17 QUESTION: And then you got a stay of that18 order?19 MR. SHORT: Yeah. There was appeal -- there was20 an appeal of that order, and then we filed a motion with21 the magistrate judge to have a hearing as to whether or22 not, as to the propriety of whether or not he should be23 medicated, yes. That's -- that's the24 procedural standpoint --25 QUESTION: But to pursue Justice Stevens'91111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425question, that order was in the context of this criminal case.MR. SHORT: Yes, it was.QUESTION: Yes.QUESTION: The Bureau of Prisons order was inthe context of this criminal case? I -- I thought that they ordered him to be medicated before -- before the trial was -- was on the horizon. Is that --MR. SHORT: He was -- he was sent to the Springfield Medical Center after being found incompetent under section 4241, in order to be treated to see if he could be restored to competency.QUESTION: You're going to brief this issue, so perhaps we ought to, since your time is running out, hear something on the merits of your --MR. SHORT: Very well.QUESTION: -- case.MR. SHORT: Very well.The individual, of course, we are talking abouttoday is Charles Thomas Sell. He's a dentist. He is a pretrial detainee. He has not been convicted of any crime. In his present setting, he is neither dangerous to himself, nor is he dangerous to others. The Government wishes to medicate Dr. Sell.QUESTION: Is that a finding we have from the101111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 lower courts, that he is not dangerous to himself or2 others?3 MR. SHORT: Yes, it is, Justice O'Connor. The4 district court made that finding, and -- and --5 essentially reversing the magistrate court, and the6 appellate court affirmed the district court's finding that7 he was not dangerous.8 The Government wants to forcibly administer to9 Dr. Sell antipsychotic drugs solely on the chance that it10 can, that it can bring him to trial on insurance fraud11 charges, nonviolent crimes. Dr. Sell does not want to be12 forcibly medicated. In his own words, he said, I do not13 want my chemistry altered. My brain is working fine.14 Now, Dr. Sell is legally incompetent. He15 suffers from a rare mental disorder called delusional16 disorder, persecutory type. This is not schizophrenia.17 The main feature of this disorder is nonbizarre delusions.18 In other words, thoughts that are plausible, thoughts that19 can conceivably come true, probably won't. In Dr. Sell's20 case, he believes the FBI is out to discredit or harm him.21 Excuse me.22 QUESTION: As I take it, that's try -- that is23 tied into the competence to stand trial because he thinks24 that's why he is being prosecuted, is that it, that the25 FBI is behind this?111111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425true.delusion.MR. SHORT: Justice Souter, that's absolutely QUESTION: Yes.matter of trial.fact --QUESTION: Then he should be able to standMR. SHORT: The problem --QUESTION: If he's so normal.MR. SHORT: The problem, Justice Scalia, is,MR. SHORT: That's part of -- that'spart of theBut another feature of this disorderapart from the direct impact of the delusions, psychosocial functioning is not markedly, markedly impaired, nor is the behavior odd, which means that his disorder only affects him in a narrow, a very narrow band, but the rest -- most of his life he can perform as a normal person would, function in a normal manner, and as ais that￼because of his delusion he can't focus on the trial -- QUESTION: I see.MR. SHORT: -- on anything else other than theFBI.QUESTION: Well, what is your solution for this dilemma? We cannot try him for the crime that he's accused of, because his mind is not working properly. He121111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 is entitled to refuse, you say, drugs that would cause his2 mind to work properly. It's a vicious -- what -- what do3 we do with him? Do we continue to hold him with the4 inability to stand trial, not treat him, because he5 refuses treatment? I -- it's just a crazy situation.6 What can be done about it?7 MR. SHORT: Your Honor, our -- because we feel8 that he is a) medically competent -- no one has ever9 contended that Dr. Sell is not medically competent. Dr.10 Sell is perfectly able to make his own health care11 decisions, and make his own decisions about his mind and12 his body, 1314 say -- 1516 1718 incompetent.19 QUESTION: And is there a finding below that20 medication will -- there's a substantial probability he21 would be restored to competence if there were medication?22 MR. SHORT: The standard's changed somewhat, but23 the answer is essentially yes.24 QUESTION: And is there a finding that no less25 intrusive alternative is available to restore him to131111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005and he has made the decision --QUESTION: But he's legally incompetent, youMR. SHORT: He's legally incompetent -- QUESTION: -- to stand trial.MR. SHORT: Yes, but he's not mentally￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425competence?MR. SHORT: Yes, there was such a finding. QUESTION: And that the medication is medicallyappropriate?MR. SHORT: Yes, there was --QUESTION: Yes.MR. SHORT: There was --QUESTION: And even under those circumstances,you assert that there can be no medication?MR. SHORT: Yes. That is -- that is myposition.QUESTION: And what is your general principle oflaw that justifies your position?MR. SHORT: First of all, since he is medicallycompetent, he can make decisions about his own person andbody.QUESTION: I thought that you might have gone further in your case, and to say the Government just has no right to put needles into pretrial detainees?MR. SHORT: Well, on a -- at a basic level that is, that is what -- we have a -- we have a nondangerous --QUESTION: I mean, they can make the defendant wear a hat, put on clothes, give a voice exempt bar. This is somehow different. It seems to me at least thatought --141111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. SHORT: This is --QUESTION: You don't exactly argue that.MR. SHORT: This is very different, Your Honor.We are dealing with a person who has been merely accused of a crime. He is medically competent. He is nondangerous.was later yes.QUESTION: Well, you say he's nondangerous. He charged with attempted murder, wasn't he?MR. SHORT: He was charged with that offense,QUESTION: He doesn't sound nondangerous. (Laughter.)QUESTION: So what are we supposed to do, justdo this on the hypothetical basis that he isn't, although maybe he is?MR. SHORT: No, Justice Breyer, not at all. The nondangerousness --QUESTION: He didn't -- he did --MR. SHORT: The only -- the only times -- as I read the cases, pretrial detainees -- these are civilly committed people -- can be medically administered antipsychotic drugs is if they are in the prison setting and they are dangerous to themselves --QUESTION: So a person who's in a mental hospital, civilly committed, and he's dangerous, going to151111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 commit suicide or possibly kill someone, that the doctors2 in that civil setting are forbidden to administer3 psychotic 456drugs? That's not my understanding. Is that -- MR. SHORT: Maybe I -- maybe I --QUESTION: -- what you're saying?MR. SHORT: Maybe I misstated --QUESTION: All right, but -- so -- but my8 question on this case is the following. I take it you9 say, to follow the psychological association's standards,10 one, the court did consider whether any nondrug therapy11 could restore him to competence, and it answered the12 question, no.13 The court did consider whether there was a14 substantial likelihood of success in restoring the15 defendant to competence, and they answered, yes.16 The court did consider whether the effectiveness17 of the drugs clearly outweighed the risk from side18 effects, and it said yes.19 It also considered the effects of the Fifth and20 Sixth Amendment rights to fair trial, and decided they21 weren't enough to change the question, so it seems to me22 that once you concede all that, they're following the23 right standards.24 So is your claim that we should go and review25 because they, although they purported to follow the right161111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200057￼1 standards they didn't really do it, in other words, going2 to the facts of this case, or is your claim that those3 standards that your side's amicus says are the right ones,4 are not the right ones and, if so, what are?5 MR. SHORT: Our view is that, first of all we6 have fundamental rights at stake here, and the Government7 must show then, of course, a compelling interest in8 overriding those fundamental interests.QUESTION: But I would appreciate a directmy question.MR. SHORT: I'm sorry. Maybe I misunderstood -- QUESTION: It seems to me, either you have to910 answer to 111213 say that the psychological association standards are14 wrong, or you have to say they're right, and if you say15 they're right, then you have to ask us to say they weren't16 applied correctly here, but I want to know if you think17 they're the wrong ones, or if you think they're the right18 ones.19 MR. SHORT: I'm not sure I understand the20 requirements of --21 QUESTION: Well, if you read -- if you'd simply22 read the table of contents, as I'm certain you have --23 MR. SHORT: Oh, I have.24 QUESTION: -- of the APA, the psychological25 association's brief, filed on your side --￼171111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 MR. SHORT: Yes.2 QUESTION: -- they have four standards, so I'm3 asking you if you think those are the right standards.4 MR. SHORT: I think essentially those are the5 right standards.6 QUESTION: Okay. If you think those are there7 right standards, do you think they were applied here?8 MR. SHORT: Yes.9 QUESTION: Yes, all right. Then is what you're10 asking us to do, since you think they were applied, and11 you don't like the answer the court came to, is what12 you're asking us to do today is take those standards, look13 to see how the court applied them, and come to the14 conclusion that they applied them incorrectly, or are you15 asking us to do something else?16 MR. SHORT: Essentially --17 QUESTION: I'm just trying to clarify --18 MR. SHORT: Essentially that's it.19 QUESTION: That's it.20 QUESTION: And I -- I don't know why you concede21 that the Government has this right at all. What gives the22 Government the authority to medicate a pretrial detainee23 or someone pretrial -- supposing they're not even in, in24 custody. Can they essentially, out with a needle the day25 before the trial and say, we're going to get you ready for181111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 trial?2 MR. SHORT: Well, it's very possible then, of3 course, I'm not understanding Justice Breyer's contention,4 and it's my fault. I don't concede that they can do this5 at all.6 QUESTION: Well then, you think these standards7 are wrong. The standards -- can you come up in your8 mind --9MR. SHORT: I --QUESTION: I won't pursue this, but I'm just clarify what it is you want us to do. Now, call own mind the standards of the American1011 trying to12 into your13 Psychological Association. I read that amicus with some14 care, I'm very interested, and it seemed to me similar in15 principle to the Government's point of view, and I want to16 know, in -- though they may not think they're applied￼here, but what -- what -- tell me about it. MR. SHORT: I'm sorry, I can't recall their with such preciseness that I can answer thatQUESTION: Well, I thought, looking at your22 brief, that you were asserting that the petitioner has a23 right to be free from compelled medication by the24 Government, period, per se. That's the rule.25 MR. SHORT: That is my under -- that is my --191111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 2000517 correctly 1819 standards20 question.211 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Page 26 of your brief. So you don't -- you don't go along with any other standards. You're saying there is an absolute right to be free from compelled medication.MR. SHORT: That is our position.QUESTION: How about -- how about -- how about vaccinating little children with a needle against smallpox? I guess there's no right to do that by the Government?MR. SHORT: Yes, there is a right to do that. QUESTION: Oh.MR. SHORT: The intrusion there is very minimal,and I think the Government -- the governmental interest is obviously to protect it against the spread of whatever dis --QUESTION: And I take it that's pursuant to the statute, not because some prosecutor thinks it's a good idea.MR. SHORT: That's --QUESTION: Then you don't even agree with the dissenting judge in the court below who said there could be forcible medication for a violent crime?MR. SHORT: I do not -- that's correct, Mr. Chief Justice. I do not --QUESTION: Well, the -- --201111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Then I wish you'd go back to aquestion I asked earlier that I don't answer to. What do you propose that He's been accused of a serious crime. this case you're willing to assume it had been accused of a violent crime.MR. SHORT: That's correct.think I got anwe do with this man?For purposes ofto be the same if heQUESTION: He is -- his mental ability is such that he cannot be tried. The means are available to straighten his mind out so that he is competent to stand trial, but you say no, if he refuses that, we must respect his wishes. Then what do we do with him? Do we let him go?MR. SHORT: The direct answer to your question, Justice Scalia, is --QUESTION: Is we let him go.MR. SHORT: -- is that you do not -- he will not be let go.QUESTION: Why not?QUESTION: What happens to him? You can't keep him in prison indefinitely. I had very much the same question in mind. As I understand it, and correct me if I'm wrong, he could not be civilly committed, since he's been found nondangerous.MR. SHORT: That's correct.211111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: If he were found dangerous, he could be civilly committed. So here he is, nondangerous, but incompetent to stand trial. You -- you agree that civil commitment was -- isn't -- isn't available under those circumstances?MR. SHORT: No, I -- civil commitment is what's going to happen to this individual under 4241.QUESTION: How? How is he going to be committed if he's not dangerous?MR. SHORT: Because 4241 provides that a person who can't stand trial because they are legally incompetent are referred to the sections of 4246. The director at that facility, under section 4246, will then have to make a determination as to whether or not Dr. Sell is a substantial risk to persons or property of others if --QUESTION: And -- and you are telling us -- and you are telling us, are you not, that he is not a substantial risk? That -- that that may not be something we accept in view of the murder charge, but I mean, on your theory, you are saying he's not dangerous.MR. SHORT: Justice Souter, I'm saying there are two different standards at --QUESTION: No, I realize there are two different standards, but there's -- if I understand the representations you have been making to the Court about221111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 your client, under the standard for commitment, if he2 cannot be tried, he would not be subject to commitment.3 Am I wrong?4 MR. SHORT: Yes, Your Honor.5 QUESTION: He would -- so are you -- are you --6 MR. SHORT: He would. He would --7 QUESTION: He would be subject to commitment?8 MR. SHORT: He is subject to commitment under9 4246.10 QUESTION: He satisfies the criteria for11 commitment?12 MR. SHORT: Yes, he does. He does, and --13 QUESTION: And I thought that the whole reason14 why we're -- how you got to this stage is that a district15 court made a finding that this man is not a danger to16 himself or others, and now you want to say for purposes of17 the -- your being here on that question, could he be18 medicated, because he's not a danger to himself or others,19 that finding holds, but once he avoids the trial, then he20 can say, ah, but for purposes of civil commitment I am21 dangerous to myself or others?22 MR. SHORT: No, that -- that's not what will23 happen to Dr. Sell. He will then go from the 4241 to24 4246, at which time the director of that facility will25 have to make a determination whether he is a substantial231111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425risk to others, or property to others, if he is released. He then has to make that certification. It goes to the district court. They have to prove that by clear and convincing evidence, and if they so show, he does remain committed.QUESTION: Yes, but you keep saying, if they show. Are you conceding that, in fact, the evidence is there to show it and that he will be in fact subject to -- that he will, in fact, be lawfully committed?MR.SHORT: No,Iamnot--Iamnot--QUESTION: Then I don't see how you've answered Justice Scalia's question.MR. SHORT: No, I will tell you, from my experience in this case, I suspect that's precisely what's going to happen, because of what the Government's view is of this individual.QUESTION: No, but you --QUESTION: Well, I -- I hope that's what's going tohappen,butI--butIdon'tknowhowit--howit comes about with the law as you've described it to us. That's -- that's my problem.QUESTION: I have a different problem. Let me explain to you what -- I imagine that the slogan, mind- altering drugs, is not a very good slogan for present purposes, because there are a lot of seriously ill people241111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 whom these drugs do help a lot.2 MR. SHORT: That's correct.3 QUESTION: Now, if we're thinking of that class4 of people, how are they any different from the class of5 people with very, very high blood pressure whose lives are6 at risk, and could be perhaps medicated with blood7 pressure medicine. These people could be medicated with8 antidelusional medicine. Now, is there a difference9 between those two circumstances?10 That doesn't answer the question, because what11 I'm looking for are the right standards to use to separate12 those genuinely ill people from others who may be more13 borderline, or may be less obviously helped.14 Now, you don't -- I realize now you don't have15 much time, but I'm -- that's what I'm struggling with in16 this case.17 MR. SHORT: The standard, the standard, Your18 Honor, is whether or not -- and this is very basic,19 whether the person has the right to make the choice. Our20 position is that Dr. Sell has the right to make the choice21 over his medical decisions.22 He has had experience with antipsychotic drugs.23 He took Haldol in the 1980's. He had an attack of acute24 dystonia, which this Court has recognized as being a25 serious side effect in at least three cases, Harper,251111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 Riggins, and Mills. He also has a psychiatrist that has2 told him that antipsychotic drugs will not work on3 delusional disorders, and Dr. Sell, with all due respect4 to what he's charged with, is not a stupid person. He5 does not want to undergo the effects of antipsychotic6 medication. He is making that a free choice, and with all7 due respect, I think he has a right to make that choice.89 time, Mr. 10QUESTION: Do you wish to reserve your remaining Short?MR. SHORT: Thank you, Your Honor, I do. QUESTION: Very well.11 12 13 14 1516 may it please the Court:17 I'd like to address the question of jurisdiction18 first. Dr. Sell's claim should be analyzed as having two19 related but distinct components. One component of hisNow, Mr. Dreeben, we'll hear from you. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBENON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and￼20 claim is a Harper-style objection to forcible medication21 by the Government in order to render him competent to22 stand trial. The second component of his claim is a23 Riggins-style objection to the fairness of his trial if,24 in fact, he is medicated and restored to competence and25 tried.261111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 The Riggins-style claim is clearly not amenable2 to review under the collateral order doctrine. Dr. Sell3 has not even been tried. There is clearly no4 determination yet whether he can be given a fair trial,5 whether he will receive one, and he may raise an objection6 to the fairness of his trial at the conclusion of the7 criminal case and obtain reversal of his conviction at8 that time, but the Harper-style claim is amenable to9 review under the collateral order doctrine. It deals with10 a right that is effectively unreviewable if not reviewed11 now, just as this Court's cases addressing double jeopardy12 claims and qualified immunity claims are effectively13 unreviewable if not reviewed --14 QUESTION: Well, it's not just they're15 unreviewable, Mr. Dreeben, but it would -- I think we said16 in those cases there the claim was a right not to be17 tried.18 MR. DREEBEN: Correct, and --19 QUESTION: Not to be tried at all.20 MR. DREEBEN: -- that right would be lost if the21 trial occurs. Here, one of his claims is a right not to22 be medicated. That right will be lost if, in fact, he is23 medicated.24 QUESTION: Well, what if -- what if -- what if25 someone says, I claim a right to be tried without this271111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 evidence that I want suppressed but the court has ruled2 otherwise?3 MR. DREEBEN: Well, that's right and that's4 because the court has concluded that there is no right not5 to be tried in the relevant sense without particular6 evidence that will be suppressed. What that reflects is a7 right whose remedy would be a right not to have the8 evidence used against them, which could include reversal9 of a conviction, so that kind of a claim is reviewable at10 the end of the case.11 But taking Dr. Sell's claims at face value, he's12 saying it will violate my First Amendment rights and my13 substantive due process rights to be medicated, and those14 claims are, in a sense, independent of the main criminal15 action. Justice Scalia is correct that in a sense they16 could be viewed as claims that could be brought17 independently, but I think under the statutory scheme that18 exists they are better brought in the context of the19 criminal case, rather than through an independent APA20 action or some other form of action.21 QUESTION: Well, I -- I'd be less worried if, if22 all that was before us here is the up or down question23 whether you have an absolute right to refuse medication,24 and once that is disposed of, the issue goes away, but25 that's not what's before us here. That is not the only281111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 thing before us here.2 The -- there is also the question, assuming that3 you can be medicated, what are the criteria, and I assume4 that any prisoner can make the claim, I have a right not5 to be medicated unless these criteria are fulfilled, so in6 every criminal case you're going to have a pre -- with7 someone who has psychological difficulties, or who is8 found to be not triable because of his mental state, you9 have to have this preliminary appeal all the way up before10 the trial can even start. It -- it's not a one-time11 thing.12 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, I'm a little bit13 less concerned about the practical consequences, although14 I share the view that the delay of the criminal case and,15 more importantly, concretely here, the delay in starting16 the medication is a critical problem that results from17 collateral order review, but there are two things that I18 think reduce any of the costs associated with permitting19 collateral order review.20 First, if this Court does settle the fundamental21 question in favor of the Government and determines that,22 on an appropriate showing that this court defines,23 medication for the purpose of restoring competence is24 permissible, in the future, criminal defendants will not25 be able to assert that broad, unsettled, and important291111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 legal issue and obtain a stay of the medication order in2 order to litigate it.3 What they would have to show is that the actual4 application of those standards to the particular facts of5 the case is incorrect. That will most likely be reviewed6 under a more deferential standard. Courts of appeals can7 establish expedited calendars to dispose of frivolous8 claims, and can weed out those claims that don't --9 QUESTION: But it would certainly be a new10 exception to the collateral order doctrine, would it not?11 MR. DREEBEN: It would be a new exception as12 applied to the particular facts of this case, but the13 standards of the collateral order doctrine I think are14 met, and there is --15 QUESTION: Let me ask you, if we reach the16 question of what standards to apply, it doesn't fit17 comfortably in any setting with which we're familiar,18 strict scrutiny, rational basis test. Do you see this as19 somewhere in between some kind of heightened review, and20 if so, what case do you think is closest?21 MR. DREEBEN: Justice O'Connor, I do think that22 a heightened form of review is appropriate. I don't have23 any case that has precisely articulated the correct24 standard of review, but in all of this Court's substantive25 due process cases, what the Court has done is balanced the301111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 interests of the individual in his liberty, or in this2 case in the First Amendment concerns, against the3 Government's interest in achieving the objectives that it4 has.5 QUESTION: How -- how do you describe the6 authority of the Government to make this order at all?7 Suppose this defendant were under a voluntary commitment8 in a private institution. Could you send your guy out9 there with a needle the day before the trial?10 MR. DREEBEN: In order to render the defendant11 competent to stand trial, Your Honor, the Government would12 have to have some sort of a finding that would justify --13 QUESTION: Well, you have -- you have this --14 this -- this case, let's assume it's this person, and only15 with the hypothetical alteration that I've given. It's16 this person, he's in a private facility, voluntary17 commitment --18 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I don't think that that19 makes any difference at all, Justice Kennedy.20 QUESTION: All right, so what is the authority21 of the Government to go out and force him to be medicated22 so that he behaves the way the Government wants him to at23 trial?24 MR. DREEBEN: Well, the Government's authority25 here is the -- derives from the fact that Dr. Sell has311111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 been indicted on serious criminal charges, and he has2 been -- been found incompetent to stand trial on those3 charges. The Government will be completely unable to4 achieve what this Court has recognized to be the5 compelling interest in adjudicating serious criminal6 charges.7 QUESTION: Could you inoculate a material8 witness? You have to have a prosecution witness. He's9 the key witness, but he's incompetent. Could you force10 him to be inoculated the day before the trial?11 MR. DREEBEN: It's the same due process question12 as presented here, Justice Kennedy, with the possible13 difference that our interests may be greater with respect14 to a person who has been charged than with respect to a15 person who has not. Material witnesses are held all the16 time without bail.17 QUESTION: I fully understand that, and I want18 to know if they can be medicated and what your authority19 is for doing it.20 MR. DREEBEN: Well, the authority would be an21 application of any principle that this Court adopts in22 this case to permit us to medicate the defendant. As I23 indicated, there is a distinction between a witness and a24 defendant, but here we deal with someone who has already25 been placed under indictment, which is to an -- a certain321111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 extent a significant restriction on liberty as well as an2 indication of a paramount Government interest in3 adjudicating the charges.4 QUESTION: Well, at -- at the very least it5 seems to me that you should have statutory authority for6 doing this. Just the court thinks it's a good idea that7 the witnesses behave a certain way and order medication --8 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I think maybe it's important9 to back up and look at how this case came to be before the10 Court. Dr. Sell was found to be incompetent to stand11 trial, and pursuant to statute section 4241(d) of title12 18, he was committed to the Bureau of Prisons for13 treatment14 restored.1516 facility,17 Prisons, the Bureau of Prisons determined that18 antipsychotic medication and nothing else was the means by19 which the Government could restore him to competency.to determine whether his competency could be In the context of that confinement at a medical￼pursuant to regulations of the Bureau of20 QUESTION: But that, that was competency for21 trial. That's -- that's -- that's the -- that's not the22 standard in the regulations, as I understand them.23 MR. DREEBEN: No, the regulations do indeed24 address the potential of medication for the purpose of25 rendering competence to stand trial. That's one of the331111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 criteria that is given to the Bureau of Prisons when it2 accepts a patient for treatment under section 4241(d), and3 the bureau in fact made the finding that this was a4 medically appropriate treatment for a person who has the5 illness, the serious delusional disorder that Dr. Sell6 has, and that this treatment had a substantial probability7 of restoring him to competence. The --8 QUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, can you back up just for9 a minute, because there's a piece of this that I'm not10 clear on. I thought that before the issue of competence11 to stand trial came up, the Bureau of Prisons had12 determined this man to be dangerous to himself or others13 without medication, and that the Bureau of Prisons was14 going to medicate him under the danger standard.15 MR. DREEBEN: The administrative order, and it's16 the same administrative order that I referred to in17 answering Justice Kennedy's question, Justice Ginsburg,18 does rest on both restoration of competency and to a19 certain extent on concerns about danger.20 What happened after the Bureau of Prisons21 entered that order is not that it immediately implemented22 it and began to medicate Dr. Sell. Rather, it stayed the23 order, and Dr. Sell then sought judicial review in the24 very court that had ordered his commitment, which is why I25 think that it was appropriate for the district court to341111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 hear this in the criminal action rather than under some2 separate APA action. This is the district court that had3 ordered Dr. Sell confined.4 The magistrate judge determined that the5 Government had not made a showing of dangerousness, which6 would have permitted medication under Washington v.7 Harper, but that it had adequately shown that medication8 was necessary in order to restore Dr. Sell to be competent9 for trial.10 Dr. Sell then appealed that determination to the11 district court, which entered its final decision saying12 that the Bureau of Prisons could medicate, there was a13 substantial probability of restoring competence, the14 antipsychotic medication was medically appropriate15 treatment for the psychotic illness that Dr. Sell had, and16 that there was a reasonable likelihood of a fair trial,17 and any particularized fair trial concerns that Dr. Sell18 was raising, involving effects on his demeanor, or his19 effects to relate to counsel, should be determined after20 the medication has been administered and it's been21 determined whether, in fact, he was restored to22 competence.23 QUESTION: Can we get your answer to the24 question that Justice Scalia asked Mr. Short? That is,25 suppose it is determined that he can't be medicated for351111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the purpose of making him competent, what happens to him? MR. DREEBEN: Well, at that point, Mr. Short is correct that under 4241 he would then be referred over to the director of a medical facility where he would be heldfor confinement to determine, pursuant to section 4246, whether, if released, he would be dangerous to himself or others.QUESTION: Well, all right, suppose he's not. Then he goes free.MR. DREEBEN: And --QUESTION: And the question I would like to know is, suppose that you have a person who has very high blood pressure, a defendant. Is it permissible, or clearly permissible under the law, to force him to take blood pressure medication so that he can go to trial?MR. DREEBEN: It is not something that courts of appeals that I have seen have had to deal with, and this Court --QUESTION: All right, so we have exactly the same question.MR. DREEBEN: Correct.QUESTION: And so the question is not necessarily about psychiatry. It's about whether or not you can force a person to take medicine that makes him competent to stand trial.361111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. DREEBEN: I think it's a very particularized2 inquiry under the sub --3 QUESTION: I don't know why it would be -- it4 mayormaynotbe--5 MR. DREEBEN: Well --6 QUESTION: -- different with psychiatry, but7 then the question comes back to, assuming we have the8 right standards, which are, I think you and the APA agree,9 the psychological people, I don't see much of a difference10 there between you, the lower courts, and the -- as to the11 standards if you can medicate a comp -- if you can12 medicate such a person at all, and so what we know is that13 you can go to the person with high blood pressure or the14 person who is seriously mentally ill, and you can medicate15 him, because the Government has a good reason, where he is16 going to be tried for murder, assault, et cetera, all17 right.18 Here we have a property crime. Is this still a19 good reason? Suppose it were a traffic ticket? I mean, I20 take it this is a person whom, in the absence of a21 criminal proceeding, the Government could not compel to22 take medication. Am I right?23 Now, I've given you a number of things. I'm24 trying to elicit your views on things that are of concern25 to me.371111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, the question of what would happen if Dr. Sell were living safely in free society is obviously distinct from this case. There's no authority --QUESTION: No, it's not obviously distinct, because I am assuming a person who is not a danger to himself or others is, in fact, in that position.QUESTION: And it's not distinct because you say the Government has an interest in having him medicated for trial. I don't see the difference in somebody who is at liberty and in custody.MR. DREEBEN: I had taken Justice Breyer's question to involve somebody who's at liberty but not charged with a criminal offense.QUESTION: All right, now, if you want to make a difference, fine, do it. I start out with the proposition that a person who is wandering around a free person now suddenly is charged. Now he says, I have very high blood pressure and I won't take my medicine, or he says, I'm delusional and I won't take my medicine.If -- can the Government compel person 1 or person 2 to do it?MR. DREEBEN: Yes to both.QUESTION: Yes. Where it's murder and assault, if they're about to -- a traffic ticket? No, all right.381111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 Now--2 MR. DREEBEN: I -- I --3 QUESTION: If that's -- if that's your --4 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer --5 QUESTION: Yes.6 MR. DREEBEN: -- the question that you're asking7 is, how serious need the offense be in order to justify an8 intrusion on substantive due process interests, whether9 they be through psychiatric medication or through blood10 pressure --11 QUESTION: Oh, that's exactly right, that is my12 question, because I thought that's what was at issue in13 this case.14 MR. DREEBEN: And I entirely agree that it needs15 to be a sufficiently serious offense to outweigh --16 QUESTION: What is -- what is the basis for the17 Government ordering medication in the case of high blood18 pressure, where -- where I would think it doesn't19 necessarily interfere with your ability to make trial20 decisions?21 MR. DREEBEN: Well, to the extent that a person22 was making a claim that, I'm not medically competent to go23 to trial because I have high blood pressure, and if I go24 to trial, I may have a heart attack and die. This25 actually happens. People will come into court and say,391111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 you can't try me now because I'm too fragile, I have a2 serious health condition, and courts then have to balance.3 It's essentially the same balancing test that's at issue4 in this case. They have to balance --5 QUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, can I ask you a question6 that I've been trying to -- thinking about for quite a7 while? Is the amount of time he's already been in8 custody, as compared to the potential sentence he might9 receive, relevant to the analysis?10 MR. DREEBEN: It may be, Justice Stevens,11 relevant to the analysis to the extent that courts have12 held that the amount of time that a person can be held for13 treatment under 4241(d) cannot exceed the ultimate14 sentence that they would receive.15 QUESTION: And is that not true in this case?16 MR. DREEBEN: No, it's not true in this case for17 a number of reasons. First of all, even limiting18 consideration to the medicaid fraud and money laundering19 charges, the test is the maximum sentence that the20 defendant could receive as a matter of statutory law, and21 he could receive a sentence --￼2223 than what 2425 addressedQUESTION: It's the maximum sentence, rather the sentencing guidelines would provide?MR. DREEBEN: Well, this Court obviously hasn't the question, and it would be free to weigh401111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425in--QUESTION: But if you assumed it was the sentencing guidelines rather than the maximum statutory sentence, is it not true that his period of confinement has already approached that, that time?MR. DREEBEN: Yes, it probably is. Of course, he's also charged with attempted murder and conspiracy to murder charges.QUESTION: Yes, but that was not -- that was not part of the analysis, as I understood it, in the court of appeals decision.MR. DREEBEN: Well, to be --QUESTION: It relied entirely on the financialcrimes.MR. DREEBEN: You're right, Justice Stevens, but to the extent that the question is, how long can the Government hold him for treatment, he's clearly indicted for attempted murder and conspiracy to murder charges, and the length that the Government can hold --QUESTION: Well, is it critical to your position in this case that we take into account the indictmentfor -- for -- for attempted murder?MR. DREEBEN: No, because the Government's position here is that any felony case is serious enough -- QUESTION: Even if the time he's already been in411111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 custody exceeds the time he would get under the sentencing2 guidelines?3 MR. DREEBEN: Well, again, if-- if a court were4 to hold -- it's not critical to my position, because my5 position is, it's statutory maximum. If the Court were to6 hold that we're not going to look at the attempted murder7 and conspiracy murder charges, we are only going to look8 at the sentencing guidelines sentence, and we are going to9 hold that he cannot be held for treatment longer than his10 ultimate potential sentence, then the Court would have no11 choice but to remand for treatment of Dr. Sell under 424612 to determine whether he should be civilly committed.13 Those are questions that were never litigated in14 any court, and are certainly not raised in the petition15 for certiorari. What is raised in the petition for16 certiorari is whether treatment to render a defendant17 competent to stand trial on a nonviolent offense is a18 sufficient Government interest.19 QUESTION: May I ask this other question, just20 to be sure I have your understanding on it? Has he or has21 he not been getting civil -- getting treatment during the22 period of his detention?23 MR. DREEBEN: He has not been getting24 antipsychotic medication. He gets --25 QUESTION: In other words, not getting421111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 medicine -- I know he's not getting medical, medicine, but2 has he been getting any other kind of treatment for his3 ailment?4 MR. DREEBEN: Essentially, no, and the reason is5 that there is no other form of treatment, standing alone,6 that would have any likelihood of success with a person7 with delusional disorder, persecutory type. This is a8 serious thought disorder, interfering with Dr. Sell's9 ability to rationally understand what is going on in the10 world, and it's well-established in the medical literature11 that antipsychotic medication and nothing else is the only12 thing that may hold promise of treating the -- the ailment13 that he has. Now, the -- the --14 QUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, may I ask you to comment15 on this, on the question of medication? One of the16 arguments is that if you accept, for example, essentially17 your standard or the psychological association's standard,18 in applying it, you cannot apply it, as it were, in gross.19 You've got to apply it with reference to the specific20 medication which is proposed, and that was not done in21 this case. I think the argument is, it's important22 because the effects of the various possible antipsychotic23 medications may vary tremendously.24 Would you comment on that argument, that even if25 we accept the standards, they -- they were not adequately431111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 met here because the -- the order was not drug-specific?2 MR. DREEBEN: I -- Justice Souter, if a court3 were to attempt to make an order drug-specific for a4 patient it would be essentially ignoring the medical5 reality of what this treatment will entail.6 Now, Dr. Wolfson, the treating psychiatrist, or7 consulting psychiatrist at the hearing, testified that in8 his view there were two particular medications, quetiapine9 and olanzapine, which were likely to be the most suitable10 ones for Dr. Sell's case because of their very minimal11 side effect profile, that they would have a much better12 chance of not inducing sedation or other side effects that13 he might claim would interfere with the fairness of his14 trial.15 But he explained that he did not want to be16 locked into a particular medication because one of his17 hopes, as the psychiatrist on the case, is that Dr. Sell18 would participate in choosing, if he had been told, he's19 ordered to take medication, which medication he wanted to20 take.21 This is the kind of interactive process that22 doctors and patients have all the time, and for a court to23 superimpose some rigid rule up front that establishes this24 and only this medication can be administered is --25 QUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, isn't there something441111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 short of that, though? I mean, we -- we are told that2 there are the old kind of drugs that could be injected,3 and the new drugs, which originally had to be taken4 orally. Isn't -- that distinction between the category of5 drugs, not the particular drug within that category, or6 even a decision between something that's injectable and7 something that we'd have to force him to swallow, isn't --8 isn't that kind of determination something that the --9 shouldn't -- shouldn't there be some control over the10 Government's discretion?11 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I -- I think the Court12 should be very cautious about superimposing a judicial13 decision making process on a --14 QUESTION: But just asking the Government to15 identify that general class of drugs, not the court making16 the decision in the first instance.17 MR. DREEBEN: The -- the problem with that,18 Justice Ginsburg, is that the response that an individual19 patient has to a drug is individual-specific. Side20 effects can be described in general categories, but nobody21 knows what side effects will actually occur, or whether22 the drugs will be effective until they've been23 administered, and it is not uncommon for the treating24 psychiatrist to discover that a drug that may have a25 wildly, you know, significant side effect in one451111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 individual has none in another, and a drug that's2 anticipated to be entirely successful turns out not to be3 successful.4 One of the newer, new generation of drugs, the5 atypical drugs that have the more favorable side effect6 profiles in general may not turn out to be suitable for a7 particular patient.8 QUESTION: But of course, one answer to that is,9 this is sufficiently serious so that you ought to have to10 come back. In other words, in -- in -- in -- the -- the11 premise of your argument is that there's kind of an12 either-or choice that is made here, medicate or don't13 medicate, but if the -- if the substan -- if a substantive14 due process right is recognized, one question here is, how15 serious is it, and maybe it ought to be regarded as so16 serious that the Government would have to come back.17 MR. DREEBEN: That would -- might be true,18 Justice Souter, if the Government's alternatives were19 antipsychotic medication and psychosurgery, so that the20 difference was dramatic between the two forms of treatment21 that are being proposed, but even looking at the, at the22 classes of drugs that are at issue here, the atypical23 drugs and the older generation of typical antipsychotic24 drugs, there are very important and dramatic differences25 between them, but they belong to a family of medications461111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 that are used for treatment all the time, and the2 psychiatrist's understanding of the various range of3 effects that might be achieved is not likely to be4 enhanced by subjecting that to judicial review, nor are5 the potential side effects so dramatically different that6 it calls for an entirely different substantive due process7 analysis.8 QUESTION: May I ask you a different question9 about seriousness, and I think it was raised originally by10 a question from Justice Kennedy, and I'm not -- I'm not11 sure of the facts or of your answer.12 Should we treat this, assuming we are going to13 recognize it, as sufficiently serious that the Government14 should have no power in the absence of legislation, and if15 that is so, is there any legislation that authorizes this?16 MR. DREEBEN: There is legislation that17 authorizes and requires the Bureau of Prisons to treat an18 individual to attempt to restore him to competency once he19 has been determined incompetent. That's what section20 4241(d) says. Now, it does not --21 QUESTION: So it's treat for purposes of22 competency?23 MR. DREEBEN: Correct, and it does not24 specifically refer to antipsychotic medication, but in25 1984, when this legislation was enacted, it was well known471111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 that, for the kind of psychotic conditions that render a2 defendant incompetent to stand trial, it's antipsychotic3 medication or --QUESTION: But you say the Government can doif the defendant is, is not in custody, and just this same point, suppose a defendant not in45 this even6 to follow7 custody, at home, is undergoing a hunger strike and he's8 going to die before the trial. Can the Government come9 out and force feed him?10 MR. DREEBEN: You know, Justice Kennedy, I'll11 answer that question yes, but I recognize that it involves12 a very different set of considerations, because the13 intrusion through force feeding of somebody who wants to14 die might be considered to be a very different decision15 than treating an ill person's illness with medication that16 is the norm that's used to treat people with these kinds17 of disorders.18 QUESTION: But if -- but if your -- but if your19 interest is in making the defendant stand trial, it20 would -- it would seem to me that you could per -- suppose21 itwasfor--Idon't--I--wecouldplaywiththe22 hypothetical, and your time has about run out. I still23 just don't understand your basic authority to do this at24 all.25481111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼MR. DREEBEN: Well, as a matter of the1 organization of Government, this Court has recognized that2 the ability to resolve criminal charges through the3 mechanism of a trial is a compelling interest in4 maintaining social order and peace, and in order to try5 these criminal charges, the Government has no option but6 to attempt to restore competency.7 QUESTION: What's the most intrusive thing that8 it's clear the Government can do to get the defendant9 inside the courthouse door?10 MR. DREEBEN: Well, it -- it's quite clear that11 the Government may seize the person and hold them in12 pretrial detention, which is a --13 QUESTION: All right, physically seizing him,14 shackling him, I guess. Anything else?15 MR. DREEBEN: Not that this Court has16 considered, but this -- this kind of medication has to be17 judged against the backdrop of the nature of the intrusion18 and the efficacy of the treatment for those people who19 have this kind of disorder. Virtually everyone who is20 committed to the Bureau of Prisons' care for incompetency21 determinations has some form of psychotic disorder that22 can be treated.23 There are, of course, organic problems that24 cannot be treatable at all, and there are other kinds of25 mental illness that can create this, but the statistics491111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 that the Bureau of Prisons furnished to us in considering2 this case3 committed45 very little indication that any sort of judicial relief6 has been sought through appellate review, and I think7 that's because these drugs enable someone who has serious8 psychotic orders to be restored to a point of rationality9 where they can make decisions about what they want to doshows that 80 percent of the individuals who are take these drugs voluntarily.Of the remaining 20 percent who did not, there's10 with their life.11 So instead of remaining incompetent and perhaps12 being committed indefinitely to a Bureau of Prisons13 facility, where they may be warehoused without any14 treatment, or being released if they are not subject to15 civil commitment, so that they don't stand trial on16 criminal charges and suffer essentially no consequences,17 most individuals accept the fact, particularly after an18 initial round of treatment has rendered them competent so19 that thy can understand the benefits of this, that the20 medication is the appropriate, medically sanctioned way to21 deal with the disease that they have.22 And when the Government has no mechanism to23 achieve its essential interest in adjudicating criminal24 charges but for using these medically appropriate means,25 and it can show the, the items that have been laid out in501111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005￼1 our brief of medical appropriateness, no less-restrictive2 alternative, and that there's a reason to expect that a3 fair trial will not be precluded, the Government should4 appropriately have the authority to override the5 substantive due process interest that the defendant has6 asserted and medicate him.7 QUESTION: May I ask one last question before8 your light goes off? Under the statute that provides9 credit for prior custody, would this defendant's custody10 in the -- 111213count?MR. DREEBEN: Yes, it would, Justice Stevens. QUESTION: It would, okay.QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Dreeben.Mr. Short, you have 4 minutes remaining.14 15 16 1718 Your Honor. I am going to essentially combine one of the19 comments made by Mr. Dreeben with questions posed byREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY A. SHORT￼ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. SHORT: I only have 2 minutes I need to use,20 Justice Stevens.21 Mr. Dreeben says there is a -- we are talking,22 of course by a -- about an individual -- although I23 understand there's an overall concern about what the24 results of this case, case are, we are talking about25 Dr. Sell specifically, and the Government's interest --511111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the Government states that they have a compelling interest in prosecuting Dr. Sell.Now, I do not believe the statutory maximum is what -- is what guides here on the thought of how long has Dr. Sell been in custody. Dr. Sell has been in custody, except for a 5-month period of time when he was out on bond, since May of 1997. Under any way you calculate the guidelines, and I submit the guidelines is the only way you can calculate it, he has served much more time than he would have served had he been convicted and sentenced on this crime, and under these circumstances, I do not see any compelling interest whatsoever on the part of the Government in prosecuting this defendant, Dr. Sell.Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Short. The case is submitted.(Whereupon, at 11:01 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)￼521111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005
