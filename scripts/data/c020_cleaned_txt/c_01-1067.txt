GARRE                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. GARRE:  Thank you, Justice Stevens, and mayit please the Court:          In 1960, Congress declared the former FortApache military post to be held in trust for the White101112   Mountain Apache Tribe.  The specific --          QUESTION:  What condition was it in in 1960?Was it basically like it is today, or has it gotten worse?What was it like then?1314151617   older today.  It's about 40 years older today.  The18   condition the -- the legislative history doesn't discuss19   the condition of the fort in particular detail.￼MR. GARRE:  Well, it -- it's certainly much20             It's important to recognize that the military21   fort was built for temporary use -- today, some -- almost22   a century ago, and in 1960 had been built for temporary23   use, you know, more than 50, 60, or 70 years ago.  So it24   wouldn't at all have been surprising if there had been a25   state of decay in 1960.31111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1             And of course, when Congress passed the 1960 2   statute, there was no indication at all -- certainly not 3   on the face of the statute, or in the legislative history 4   that's contained in respondent's lodging -- that it had in 5   mind a historic preservation goal, or that it had in mind 6   that -- that it would require the Secretary of the 7   Interior to undertake the enormous financial 8   responsibility of having to restore a century-old fort. 9             QUESTION:  -- making use today of a portion of10   the structures there for the school and administrative11 needs?          MR. GARRE:  Absolutely, Justice O'Connor.The -- the vast majority of the buildings and historicdistrict area of Fort Apache are used today for school and12131415   administrative purposes.  The Bureau of --16             QUESTION:  Are those maintained in some fashion17   for that use by the Federal Government?￼18             MR. GARRE:  They are.  As we point out in note 119   of our reply brief, the Department of the Interior has20   spent more than $3 million over the past decade or21   15 years on repair and maintenance projects at the fort.22   It's also true that the tribe itself has engaged in23   historic restoration efforts at the fort with the support24   of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Department of the25   Interior, and with the assistance of private, State, and41111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005even -- in some cases -- Federal tax dollars.          QUESTION:  Well, the U.S. Government does holdthe property in trust for the tribe -- the White Mountain1234   Tribe.  Right?5 6 7 8 9          MR. GARRE:  That's true.  Just like the U.S.Government --          QUESTION:  And what basic responsibility doesthat entail, would you say, the fact that the Governmentis a trustee?               MR. GARRE:  Well, when Congress places land in     trust for Indians, it has two well-settled meanings that12   this Court has recognized.  First, it places a restraint13   on the alienation of property, and second, it immunizes14   the property from State taxation.  And if you look at15   pages 6 and 7 of the respondent's lodging, that indicates16   that in 1958, when there was discussion about what to do17   with Fort Apache, the tribe itself encouraged the18   Department to have Congress place the land in trust so19   that it was in a nontaxable status like the surrounding20   reservation lands.21             Now, we know from the first Mitchell decision22   decided by this Court that simply placing property in23   trust does not in itself create a substantive right to24   money damages.25 QUESTION: But there was an enormous difference 51111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 2000510 11￼ 1   in that case in that the Indians managed the land.  Under 2   the General Allotments Act, the idea was to make the 3   individual owner autonomous.  Here, I think it's not 4   disputed that this land has been operated by the U.S. 5   Government, and the U.S. Government has exclusive control. 6             MR. GARRE:  Justice Ginsburg, that -- that may 7   be true in the factual sense, but the 1960 act -- that is, 8   that the Federal Government is using the property, but the 9   1960 act -- quite unlike the General Allotment Act --10   specifically reserves to the Government the right to use11   the property for Government uses.  And in that respect, we12   think the trust relationship created by the statute in13   this case is much more limited than the one that was14   created by the statute in Mitchell I, and the existence of15   factual Federal control cannot in itself give rise to a16   damages action under the Tucker Act.17             QUESTION:  Can you just explain one small point18   to -- to me?  I know what "school purpose" means.  What is19   "administrative"?  Is that administrative in connection￼with the school, or some free-floating administration?          MR. GARRE:  Well, I -- I think generally, the20212223   very broad term.  In that respect, I think it's24   instructive that Congress used that term.  Nevertheless,25   I think that -- that "administrative purposes" has to be61111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005"administrative use" can refer to executive uses, and is a1   read with school purposes, and can be read to refer to2   both uses for storage and the like, and also for3   administrative purposes used by the Bureau of Indian4   Affairs to undertake activities at Fort Apache or -- or on5   the surrounding reservation.  So in that respect, it's6 7 8 9administrative for the purpose of the Department of theInterior, who operates activities there through the localagent of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.Now --               QUESTION:  Mr. Garre, is -- is any of the -- or11   let me ask you an open-ended question.  How much of the12   property which is the subject of this claim was within the13   Government's control throughout this period, and how much14   of it was not?15             MR. GARRE:  Oh, well, our position would be that16   the vast majority, if not all, was -- well, that's not17   true.  The -- the vast majority of the property has been18   within the Government's control, but it's important to19   recognize that the court of appeals' decision remands for20   building-by-building, in a sense, trial on the existence21   of Federal use and control.  And the tribe does have22   access to the Fort Apache property.  The tribe is there.23   The tribe even has a -- a cultural museum that it operates24   on the property.  So it's -- it's not as though this is a25   Federal enclave --71111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 2000510￼ 1             QUESTION:  Well, is the tribe making -- is the 2   tribe making a monetary claim with respect to property 3   which it has had in its control, as distinct from the 4   Government's, during this period? 5             MR. GARRE:  If you look at appendix A to the 6   tribe's complaint, which -- which has a detailed building- 7   by-building analysis of the ways in which the building 8   don't meet certain requirements, I think it's fair to say 9   the tribe's damages claim extends to all the buildings at10   Fort Apache and that, therefore, it may extend to11   buildings over which the Federal Government is not -- have12   any active use or -- or control.13             But we don't think that a damages action can be14   brought against the United States based on some fact-15   bound, manipulable notion of Federal control.￼QUESTION:  No.  I -- I realize that.  I realize1617   that.1819202122232425   moment about the analogy?  And we'll call it just that,81111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          MR. GARRE:  Under the Tucker Act -- and thisCourt emphasized it in the Mitchell decisions, and it'semphasized it in other decisions -- a substantive right todamages against the United States -- which, after all, isa right to damages against the public fisc -- has to begrounded in a source of substantive law.QUESTION:  Well, if -- can we talk just for a12345678   figure into your argument.  Again, it -- it struck me,9 10 11 12 13as -- reading the briefs -- that that was an argument --you don't really make that argument.          MR. GARRE:  Well --          QUESTION:  Is that because the trustee here isboth the beneficiary -- is -- is a co-beneficiary of thethe area of private trusts.          I -- I take it that usually a trustee, who hasthe obligation to repair buildings for the beneficiariesso they don't fall into disrepair, does so at thebeneficiaries' expense.MR. GARRE:  That -- that's true.QUESTION:  And that -- that didn't seem to14 trust?15             MR. GARRE:  That is true and it's much unlike16   the typical common law trust, but the -- the most17   fundamental reason, Justice Kennedy, is we don't think18   that a court should have to plumb through the common law19   to determine whether or not Congress established a right20   to damages against the United States in this case.21             And it's also true -- if you look at the common22   law, the first thing you -- you're met with -- with -- is23   with the general rule that you can't get breach of trust24   damages against the sovereign.  So you'd have to get --25   not only you'd have to get around the courts --91111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1             QUESTION:  Well, but that -- but, I mean, that's2   the whole purpose of the Tucker Act.  I mean, to -- to3   plead sovereign immunity begs the question.  That's4 5 6 7 8 9exactly the question before us.          MR. GARRE:  Well, and I agree, Justice Scalia,and we think that that question should be answered bylooking to the act of Congress on which the tribe relies,which is the 1960 act.          QUESTION:  Well, but it would have seemed to me,following Justice Scalia's question and my own, that ifthe law of trusts gave a clear indication one way or theother that there was a liability, then the Tucker Actanalysis might -- might be different accordingly.101112131415   think the Mitchell I case establishes that.  In16   Mitchell I, both the Court of Claims and the dissenters on17   this Court reasoned that because the General Allotment Act18   placed land, quote, in trust, that therefore one couldMR. GARRE:  With respect, I disagree.  And I￼19   look to the common law and therefore one could import into20   the Tucker Act all the liabilities that would follow21   against a private trustee, even liabilities that would22   result in damages actions.  A majority of this Court23 24 25rejected that analysis.          Now, in Mitchell II, the Court specificallyaffirmed the result in Mitchell I, and it emphasized that101111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051   Mitchell II was different because in that case, the Court2   had statutes and regulations that created specific3   management duties that could be fairly interpreted as4   mandating the payment of compensation for the breach of5   those duties.6             Now, the court of appeals recognized at page 18a7   of the petition appendix -- and the -- even the tribe8   recognizes on page 11 of its brief -- that the 1960 act9   doesn't set forth any specific management duties on the10   part of the Government.11             QUESTION:  Do you think the Government could12   have just destroyed the property or the structures on the13   land?141516171819202122   just compensation under the Fifth Amendment.  And those23   claims haven't been asserted in this case.  This case24   involves a breach of trust action, a claim for damages25   based on the alleged breach of trust which the tribe111111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          MR. GARRE:  Well, I -- Justice Stevens, I thinkthat the notion that the Government would destroy theproperty, if it did so in a way that was clearlyinconsistent with the terms of the act --￼          QUESTION:  Let me put it another way.  Do youthink they had a duty not to destroy the property?          MR. GARRE:  That -- that duty, if it exists,comes from ordinary tort principles and from principles of1   grounds in the 1960 act, and --2             QUESTION:  No, I understand.  But part of the3   question we have is to what extent did the Government4   assume duties beyond immunizing the property from State5   taxation and preventing its alienation.  Did they have any6   additional duties?  And I'm not clear on whether you've7   told me they had a duty not to destroy it or not.8             MR. GARRE:  Not under -- under the 1960 act, the9   statute in this case.  Now, if the Government had --          QUESTION:  But did they -- from any source, didthey have a duty not to destroy it?10111213   Justice Stevens.  If I could respond by -- by maybeMR. GARRE:  I -- I think -- I think it would,running through some hypotheticals --          QUESTION:  You'd help me if you responded yes or14151617181920   someone else, or if Congress destroyed the fort.  Then the21   tribe might have a claim for just compensation.  The tribe22   has referred to some just compensation cases in its brief,23   but it hasn't brought a just compensation claim in this24 case.25 The tribe also might seek to bring a damages 121111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼no, to be honest with you.(Laughter.)          MR. GARRE:  Yes, it would under the FifthAmendment to the Constitution if Congress sold the fort to 1   action under the Federal Torts Claimed Act -- Tort Claims 2   Act for some kind of destruction of property.  The tribe 3   hasn't brought that -- 4             QUESTION:  So you are -- to this extent, you're 5   differing from counsel's position before the Federal 6   Circuit, because I believe at that level, counsel was 7   asked if the United States could dynamite all the 8   buildings to the ground with no liability to the tribe, 9   and the answer was yes.10             MR. GARRE:  Well, it's -- it's not clear to me11   the context in which that question came up.12             But I also think that it's true that if the13   Secretary decided that it was necessary to level a14   building because it proves an attractive nuisance to15   school children, or because it was desirable to build a16   more -- newer and better educational facility at the fort,17   that the 1960 act would authorize the Secretary to do18 that.19             But -- but we do recognize that there are other20   principles in this area stemming from the Fifth Amendment,21   a source of substantive law, stemming possibly from the22   Federal Torts Claims Act, another source of substantive23   law, which aren't invoked in this case, which might be24   implicated based on the Government's management of the25 property.131111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1             QUESTION:  Well, how about Mitchell II? 2             MR. GARRE:  Well, in Mitchell II, Justice 3   O'Connor, the statutes and regulations there, which -- 4   which the Court described as a pervasive, statutory scheme 5   governing Indian timber management, provided specific 6   fiduciary management duties that could be fairly 7   interpreted as -- as mandating payment of compensation. 8   They -- they specifically govern the generation of profits 9   or proceeds for the Indian tribe, and in that case, the10   Court held that the violation of those duties, grounded in11   a statute or regulation, gave rise to a money damages12   action under the Tucker Act.  This case is --13             QUESTION:  Well, how would -- how would you14   describe the duties the United States has as trustee with15   relation to this property?  How would you describe the sum￼total of its duties?16171819   places land in trust:  not to alienate the land and -- and20   it immunizes it from State taxation.21             QUESTION:  In -- in effect, I think what you're22   saying is that there are no trust duties.  There's a23   peculiarity here.  The word trust in -- as you're using it24   in the argument, simply has those two implications:  don't25   give it away and place it in a -- in a condition or -- or,141111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          MR. GARRE:  I think the -- the principal dutiesare the ones that the Court has always recognized when it 1   by virtue of the word trust, it is in a condition to avoid 2   taxation. 3             MR. GARRE:  Well -- 4             QUESTION:  I think you're saying that there are 5   no fiduciary duties beyond that.  If there is any duty 6   beyond that, it's got to come from the Constitution, or 7   it's got to come from a specific provision of -- of a 8   statute creating a duty not necessarily as -- as that of a 9   trustee, but simply as a statutory duty.  Isn't that10   correct?11          MR. GARRE:  That's correct when the tribe comesinto court under the Tucker Act and asserts a claim formonetary damages against the United States Treasury.We're dealing against an area of sovereign immunity wherethe United States is immune from damages for breach oftrust unless Congress --12131415161718   and they -- they mesh perfectly.  One, you're making a19   sovereign immunity argument.  Two, you're saying there is￼QUESTION:  But I think you're saying two things,no trust responsibility whatsoever on the part of thetrustee except not to alienate.20212223   monetary damages.  Of course, in this area, the Court has24   recognized --MR. GARRE:  Not enforceable in an action for25 QUESTION: So you are conceding that there -- 151111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051   that there might be equitable remedies based on -- on a2   theory of fiduciary duty?3             MR. GARRE:  It's conceivable that there would be4   an equitable remedy based on a violation of statute, not5   on equitable duties.  This is -- this is a realm --6 7 8 9know --QUESTION:  So that if -- may -- may I just, youMR. GARRE:  Yes.  Sorry.               QUESTION:  -- pursue the example that Justice10   Stevens used?  If the Government said, 30 days from now,11   we are going to blow up all the buildings, there would be12   a -- an -- an equitable remedy based upon fiduciary duty?13             MR. GARRE:  I think in that situation, Justice14   Souter, the tribe might be able to bring an injunction --15   injunctive action perhaps under the APA claiming that that16   use of the property, the destruction of it, would exceed17   the scope of the Government's use right under the 196018   act.19202122232425161111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼          QUESTION:  Well, is that -- I -- I don'tunderstand what you're saying.          MR. GARRE:  That -- that would be under statute,not on some --          QUESTION:  So -- so you're saying that would notbe based on fiduciary responsibility?MR. GARRE:  Well --7 8 9the 1960 act gives this tribe --          QUESTION:  But the property interest takes into          QUESTION:  If -- if it exceeded the Government'suse right, what -- what other obligation -- what would bethe source of -- of a -- of an obligation if -- if it wasnot fiduciary duty?123456   interest as well.  I mean, we acknowledge that the 1968 --MR. GARRE:  I think it could be a propertyconsideration the trust relationship, doesn't it?          MR. GARRE:  Well, it doesn't necessarily have1011   to.  The Court has had many cases brought by Indian tribes12   claiming just compensation under the Fifth Amendment of --13   of property, which -- at least in some management -- some14   aspects would have a trust in it.  Overlapping all this15   area is the notion that the Government has political and16   moral responsibility to the Indian tribes, and the Court17   has recognized that throughout its decisions since --18             QUESTION:  Well, but -- just -- just to put19   Justice Souter's question back before you -- and my own:20   What trust duties does the United States have in addition21   to not alienating the property, and making sure that it's22   immune from State taxation?  I think your answer is it has23   no fiduciary obligations at all.  There may be some24   obligations under the Fifth Amendment to protect property,25   et cetera, but as a trustee, it has no fiduciary￼171111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051   obligations other than the ones that are mentioned.2             MR. GARRE:  The United States has general3   fiduciary obligations to the Indian tribes that this4   Court has recognized.  But the Court has never5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425recognized -- and I think it rejected the notion in theMitchell I case that --          QUESTION:  Well, but do those generalobligations with reference to this property import anyduty other than the duty not to alienate and to ensurethat it's immune from State taxation?          MR. GARRE:  Not a duty and certainly not a dutythat's enforceable in an action for monetary damages.          QUESTION:  Well, I would have thought theremight well be a duty for the trustee -- the U.S.Government acting as trustee here -- not to lay waste tothe property held in trust for the tribe --          MR. GARRE:  Well --          QUESTION:  -- not to affirmatively lay waste toit or -- or allow something to happen that just theordinary care would suggest should not happen.          MR. GARRE:  Justice O'Connor, that dutycertainly is not expressed in the terms of the 1960statute, and -- and, of course, there are otherstatutory --          QUESTION:  Well, except to the extent that the181111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1   statute does say, all right, this property, Fort Apache,2   is to be held by the U.S. Government in trust for the3   tribe.  And maybe that conveys some notion, in addition to4   not alienating it, not laying waste to it.  Now, whether5   what's done fits that I don't know.  Maybe ordinary wear6 7 8 9and tear isn't covered, but --          MR. GARRE:  I -- I don't think that thatposition would be consistent with the Court's ruling inMitchell I, where the Court rejected the notion that theuse of language, in trust, subjects the United States toall the liabilities of a private trustee.10111213   was true in Mitchell I.  It's specific property, hold it14   in trust, and the Government can use it for a school or15   administrative needs, but there -- there's something more16   than was in Mitchell I.QUESTION:  Well, there's a little more here than￼17             MR. GARRE:  With respect, I think that there --18   there's less, Justice O'Connor, that -- that Congress19   specifically carved out of the trust relationship the20   right of the Government to use the property for the21   Government's purposes.22             QUESTION:  Mr. Garre, there -- there is one23   significant difference, and that is the control element.24   Mitchell I stressed that the control was with the25   allottee.  Mitchell II has a whole paragraph that says191111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   what's key is who has control.  And as I read it, it was 2   that these specific instructions were an indication that 3   the U.S. had exclusive control, but that the real thing 4   was the control, who has control of this property. 5             MR. GARRE:  But -- but there's a key difference, 6   Justice Ginsburg, between this case and Mitchell II with 7   respect to the question of control.  In Mitchell II, the 8   Court emphasized throughout its decision and -- and 9   discussed the statutes and regulations in detail for more10   than four pages.  The control stemmed from specific11   statutory and regulatory duties that were created by12   Congress in that case, and the Court found that the13   violation of those specific duties, which could be14   fairly -- fairly interpreted as mandating compensation,15   gave rise to a damages claim against the United States.16             In this case, the tribe can't point to a single17   statute or regulation, and the only statute it relies in18   this case -- in this Court is the 1960 act that creates19 any --2021   it differently than I have just set it out.  As I take the22   Court to have said control is key, and these specific23   regulations show that there is indeed control, that the24   United States runs the show.  But the nature of this25   trust, there wouldn't be any instructions.  You wouldn't201111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼QUESTION:  Well, then you're -- you're reading 1   expect there to be detailed instructions.  The question is 2   who was in control. 3             MR. GARRE:  Well, there -- there is no specific 4   management duty in this case.  Instead of the situation in 5   Mitchell I or Mitchell II, Congress gave -- 6             QUESTION:  Can I interrupt with just one -- one 7   question?  The trust here refers not only to the land but 8   to the improvements.  Doesn't that make a difference?  In 9   a -- in a private situation wouldn't that normally create10   in the -- the trustee a duty to ensure against fire, and11   to take care of the improvements as opposed to just bare12   legal title to the property?13             MR. GARRE:  It -- it might, Justice Stevens, but14   I think the reference to that also is important in terms15   of Congress' express delegation to the Secretary the duty16   to use all of the trust property, the land and the17   buildings, to operate an Indian school there, which is18   the -- the use that -- that the property had been put19   since the 1920s.20             QUESTION:  So in your -- in your opinion, if21   this statute had added the words, and if the Government22   does take control, it shall use ordinary prudence and23   skill to preserve the property, then they'd have a claim.24             MR. GARRE:  It -- it certainly would be a￼25 much --211111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051             QUESTION:  Is that yes or no.2             MR. GARRE:  -- different case.3             QUESTION:  No.  Yes or no.4             MR. GARRE:  I -- I think -- if I can analyze5   that claim.  I -- I think they -- they might have a claim,6 7 8 9Justice Breyer.          QUESTION:  When you say might, I'm just21 22 23 24 25          MR. GARRE:  Congress creates a number of duties.And Congress has legislative -- of course, in the area ofhistoric preservation, and it creates duties that thecourts below found are procedural in nature.          QUESTION:  And so if they said, and by the way,221111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005imagining the same statute, everything that's gone on thismorning, and it says if they take control, they shall useordinary skill and prudence to preserve the property.10111213141516171819   been asking you whether that can be implied here?  And my20   impression was you said yes.  I mean, if it --MR. GARRE:  The --QUESTION:  The answer then is yes or no?MR. GARRE:  Well, I think it would be no,Justice Breyer, and if I could explain why.          QUESTION:  It would be no even then.  Then what￼have we been arguing about --          MR. GARRE:  Well --QUESTION:  -- because, I mean, everybody has 1   if in fact they take control, the trustee -- i.e., the 2   United States -- has a duty when they take control to use 3   ordinary skill and prudence to preserve the property. 4             MR. GARRE:  Then the statute -- they would -- 5   they would have a specific management duty.  And then the 6   question -- 7             QUESTION:  And so the answer is then they would 8   have -- they could -- then they'd win.  Right?  If it said 9   that.10             MR. GARRE:  I -- I think they might under that11   situation.12             QUESTION:  Okay, fine.13             MR. GARRE:  But there's a second question under14   the Court's cases that the Court would have to answer it,15   and that's case two, and that's whether or not that16   specific statutory duty can be fairly interpreted as17   mandating the payment of compensation.18             QUESTION:  And it adds, and indeed if they19   violate this, they have to pay a lot of money.20             MR. GARRE:  Of -- of course, in that situation.21             QUESTION:  Okay.  Then we're all right.22             MR. GARRE:  Of course, in that situation --23             QUESTION:  So our issue here -- what I'm getting24   at is our issue then is whether that word control implies25   those latter words --231111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1             MR. GARRE:  Well --2             QUESTION:  -- that were, in fact, left out.3   That's the question.  Is that right or not?4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. GARRE:  I don't think it's the questionbecause the word control doesn't appear anywhere in theface of the statute.          QUESTION:  I'm sorry.  I -- I was reading --it's subject to the right of the Secretary of Interior touse any part of the land in improvements.          MR. GARRE:  Right.          MR. GARRE:  Right.          QUESTION:  It didn't say he had to use it, did          MR. GARRE:  No, not at all.          QUESTION:  No.          QUESTION:  So in order to say he controlled it,you -- you would have to say he --          QUESTION:  I misspoke.  I'm sorry to have mixedpeople up.          MR. GARRE:  Right.          QUESTION:  I meant right to use.  Does it implythe words that are not there when they use it?          MR. GARRE:  Yes.  And -- and I think -- and if I241111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005101112131415   it?16          QUESTION:  So I -- we have to decide right touse -- does that imply those words that are left out.￼171819202122232425 1   could be more clear, I think that we think the Court's 2   cases and the Tucker Act -- and -- and we think can also 3   look to cases in the section 1983 context -- establishes a 4   two-step inquiry.  First, has Congress created a specific 5   duty on the Government's part, and second, can that duty 6   be fairly interpreted as mandating a payment of 7   compensation breached? 8             QUESTION:  How does it work in other areas of 9   real estate law, where suppose I turn my beach house over10   to a friend and he has a wild party and destroys it?  Do I11   have a claim against him if I had no knowledge he would do12   such a thing?13             MR. GARRE:  Conceivably you might have a tort14   claim, Justice Breyer, but that's not a claim that's --15             QUESTION:  So normally is it the case when you16   give or lease or give property to other people if they17   wreck the place, contrary to expectation, we imply into18   those promises or words that they had to take reasonable19 care?20             MR. GARRE:  Possibly as a breach of a contract21 or a tort --22             QUESTION:  All right.23             MR. GARRE:  -- violation.24             QUESTION:  If we normally do that in the law,25   why would we not do the same thing here where, indeed, in251111 14th Street, N.W.

It was just a question ofaddition to what you normally have, you have this wordtrust and special relationship?          MR.

GARRE:  Well, that's true, Justice Scalia.And --          QUESTION:  So the question he's asking you is --is destroying the land.          You say in your -- you quote in your briefAustin on trusts to the effect that there is a fundamentaldifference between a private trust and a public trust.What -- what kind of cases is -- is that -- is thatsection referring to?          MR.

GARRE:  Well --          QUESTION:  Because if that's all he wasreferring to, you know, that's been waived by -- by thestatute here.          MR. GARRE:  No.          QUESTION:  I thought there was something quitedifferent he was referring to, that the whole nature of a271111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          QUESTION:  Oh, is that all that -- that Scott ontrusts was referring to, just the doctrine of sovereign 1   public trust is different from a private trust.  If that's 2   not the case, then all of that is quite irrelevant it3 seems to me. 4             MR. GARRE:  I -- I think it's both, Justice 5   Scalia, that the public trust is different in that we 6   don't ordinarily assume that the Government acts in all 7   its capacities as a private trustee.  And that's certainly 8   true in the Indian law context.  This Court -- there are 9   more than 56 million acres of land that the Government10   holds in trust.  If the Court assumed just by Congress'11   use of the word in trust, the Government had assumed all12   the liabilities of -- of a common law trustee, then that13   would be an enormous potential liability that there's no14   indication whatsoever Congress ever agreed to assume.15             QUESTION:  Okay, Mr. Garre.  You're -- you're16   arguing that you can't infer from the use of the word17   trust that all of the obligations and all of the potential18   liabilities of a private trustee are carried by it.  But19   your argument seems to go, if I understand it, to the20   other extreme, that the use of the word trust seems to21   imply no obligation and no responsibility unless it is22   followed by a specific delineation of what those23   responsibilities are.24             And my question is -- Justice Breyer a minute25   ago was saying, well, what would be different if we added281111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   certain words.  And my question is what would we -- be 2   different if we subtracted certain words on your theory? 3   What if the statute had not included the words, in trust? 4   Wouldn't your argument be exactly the same? 5             MR. GARRE:  Under the Tucker Act -- and, of 6   course, the Tucker Act doesn't refer to claims for breach7 of trust. 8             QUESTION:  No, but would you answer my question? 9   Wouldn't you be -- aren't you making the same argument10   under a statute that says in trust that you would be11   making under a statute that did not include the words, in12   trust, at all?  Isn't that so?13             MR. GARRE:  Yes.  That -- that's true, Justice14   Souter.  But I -- I think --          QUESTION:  Then you -- what -- what are we to dowith the usual canon of construction that we assume thatCongress does not use useless words?1516171819202122   taxation.23             QUESTION:  Yes.  They -- they couldn't alienate24   under a statute that says the -- the land and et cetera25   will be held by the United States for the tribe.  Taxes291111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼          MR. GARRE:  Those words had great effect here.They had the same effect that the words have -- thisCourt has recognized -- with respect to the alienation ofland and with respect to immunization of land to State 1 2 3 4 5 6 7   It has those two settled consequences.  We know from 8   pages 6 and 7 -- 9             QUESTION:  But why would you not have those10   consequences without those words?  It's true if you have11   those words, the consequences follow.  But wouldn't the     consequences follow without the words?               MR. GARRE:  No.               QUESTION:  And if in fact that's all the     Government -- if that's all Congress was getting at, why     didn't Congress simply say that instead of using the     phrase, in trust, that normally carries enormouscouldn't be levied by lesser sovereigns against lands heldby the United States under those circumstances.12131415161718   implications?MR. GARRE:  Those -- those --          QUESTION:  It seems to me that the word, intrust, means nothing.MR. GARRE:  No.  With respect, I would disagree.￼19202122232425          MR. GARRE:  The -- that -- that line of argumentis the argument that we think that the court of appeal --the Court of Claims made in Mitchell I and that thedissenters made in Mitchell I, and we think that themajority of the Court rejected --          QUESTION:  And -- and Justice Ginsburg hassuggested that maybe the -- the significance of that line301111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051   of argument depends on whether there was or was not2   control.  But I think --MR. GARRE:  In the factual sense. 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   the implication of our argument.  They do have the10   accepted meanings.  The United States holds land in trust.11   It is immunized from State taxation.  If the tribe itself          QUESTION:  -- on your argument, I think whatyou're telling us is that Mitchell I -- and in any eventyour argument -- has the implication that those words addabsolutely nothing.MR. GARRE:  No, no, Justice Souter.  That's notheld it or private Indians held it, it wouldn't besubject -- it would be subject to State taxation.1213141516171819202122   the surrounding reservation lands.  And -- and again, I23 24 25think pages 6 and 7 of the tribe's lodging helps to makethat point.          If I could reserve the remainder of my time for311111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          QUESTION:  What if the Government of the UnitedStates held it?￼          MR. GARRE:  Well, it does in this case, andthat's the significance of holding it in trust.          QUESTION:  Yes, and it -- and it would do sounder the statute if the words, in trust, weren't used.          MR. GARRE:  That -- that -- it also has -- inthis case it has the effect of making the lands here like1   rebuttal.  Thank you. 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   control of these buildings, we would not be here.  It 9   would be a -- a bare trust.  Simply putting these10   buildings in trust does not create any fiduciary11   obligations.12             But the Secretary did take control.  It's not13   mandatory; it's voluntary.  And that's why this case is14   exactly like Mitchell II.  In Mitchell I, there's no nexus15   between the General Allotment Act and managing a forest.16   But when you look at the forest management statute,17   there's a direct nexus from the forest management statutes18   to control of the forest, and when you control the forest,19   to the exclusion of the tribe, then you are responsible as20   a fiduciary.21             QUESTION:  But the control -- the control here22   was not control given for the benefit of the tribe.  To23   the contrary, it was control given for the United States'24   own use.  It seems to me that's -- that's quite different.25   I agree that if -- if you -- you say the United States321111 14th Street, N.W.

BRAUCHLI:  The -- the benefit to thetribe -- Congress stripped the United States of all feesimple, absolute title and gave 100 percent beneficial1011   title to the tribe.  The United States has no retention of12   ownership whatsoever.  They have a use easement, and13   that's all they have.  A very limited right.  And the14   benefit is what Congress said, and Congress said, we're15   going to take this fort, which we established to kill16   Apaches and imprison them, and we're going to give it to17   the White Mountain Apache Tribe.  And they gave it, and it18   has value.  It has 35 buildings.  It has 7,500 acres.  Now19   it's only -- you know, we're down.  We're talking20   about 288 acres.21             QUESTION:  I thought the fort was to protect22   white settlers.

If the Government had, after this statute was12   enacted, said, you know, we really don't have any interest13   at all in these buildings, and just let them go to waste,14   but they didn't use them in any way, there would be no15   liability?16             MR.

If -- if the Government occupies the20   buildings and -- and by that preserves them in a small21   sense, they're falling apart, but at least it's better22   than a complete -- complete abandonment, they're liable,23   but if they completely abandon them, they're not.

BRAUCHLI:  Oh.          QUESTION:  I thought your initial argument wasthat after 1960, once the Government took control by,i.e. -- by that I thought you meant possessing thebuildings --          MR. BRAUCHLI:  Occupying.          QUESTION:  -- it had a duty, but that if it hadnot possessed the buildings or occupied the buildings, itwould have no duty.1011121314   I'm saying.  The -- the fact is that they occupied --15             QUESTION:  I -- I just don't understand that.16             MR. BRAUCHLI:  They occupied and physically17   controlled the buildings.  If -- for instance, we are not18   filing a claim for the four buildings.  There's only 419   buildings out of 35 being used for a school right now.20   The -- four.  And so we're not filing a claim for those,21   and they just -- they just sprang for 3 and a half million22   dollars to fix those up.  But the other buildings that23   they have used and occupied and destroyed and -- and24   some -- they've demolished four -- those are the buildings25   that we have a claim for.351111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MR. BRAUCHLI:  Yes, that is true.  That's what￼1             And we say we're not charging you for trespass.2   We're not charging you for reasonable wear and tear,3   but --45 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  Well, since 1960, did the U.S. usesome of the buildings other than it's now using?          MR. BRAUCHLI:  Yes, and the reason that theyhave fallen off from use is because the enrollment wentfrom 500 students down to about 80.          QUESTION:  Well, if there are 35 buildings onthe premises, how many did the Government use since 1960?101112   buildings.  They physically occupied them.MR. BRAUCHLI:  The Government used all of theQUESTION:  All of them.MR. BRAUCHLI:  Yes.QUESTION:  Physically occupied all 35?MR. BRAUCHLI:  Yes, they did, and they used them1314151617181920   exclusive control.  But as --21             QUESTION:  And now it physically occupies 4 of22 the 35.￼for storage and for schools.QUESTION:  Since 1960.MR. BRAUCHLI:  Yes.  And so it's been under the23             MR. BRAUCHLI:  Four for school and about six for24   its administrative use.25             QUESTION:  Mr. Brauchli, would you give me your361111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   view on the hypothetical that I asked your -- your 2   colleague on the other side?  Suppose I leave property to 3   the City of Falls Church.  The City of Falls Church takes 4   possession.  It's not occupied by anybody else.  And 5   it's -- it's in trust for the people of Falls Church.  The 6   City of Falls Church takes possession.  It doesn't do 7   anything with the land.  It just leaves it there.  Now, in 8   the law of trusts, that -- that would be wasteful, and the 9   trustee would have to use the land in order to generate10   income for the people of Falls Church, or at least do11   something for the people of Falls Church.12             Do you think the City of Falls Church would be13   in breach of trust?  Do you know of any lawsuits against1415161718192021   Falls Church and I do.  And the City of Falls Church22   doesn't do anything with it, just leaves it there.  It23   could have built a -- you know, an apartment building and24   gotten a lot of income for the city coffers.  It could25   have built a baseball diamond or whatever.  It just leaves371111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005cities or any public entities that -- that have acceptedland or other property in trust?￼          MR. BRAUCHLI:  If -- if the land is being -- asI understand the question, you -- you are leaving this toFalls Church and as a beneficiary --          QUESTION:  It's a lot.  It's a great big lot,and I say, you know, I'd like to leave it to the City of 1   the lot there. 2             MR. BRAUCHLI:  That is not our situation -- 3             QUESTION:  Is that a lawsuit? 4             MR. BRAUCHLI:  I don't know because -- 5             QUESTION:  Well, but that's crucial to your case6 here -- 7             MR. BRAUCHLI:  I don't -- 8             QUESTION:  -- it seems to me. 9             MR. BRAUCHLI:  Well, I don't think --10             QUESTION:  I think it goes to the point of11   whether a public trust is the same thing as a private12 trust.13             MR. BRAUCHLI:  Well, this is a private trust.14   I think this is a private trust, and it's not a public15   trust.  But it's --16             QUESTION:  Even if it were, I guess the real17   analogy would be it goes to the City of Falls Church to be18   held in trust for the public to be used as a school for as19   long as they want it, and thereafter to go to the20   archeological society for preservation.  And now they run21   it down as a school, and the question would be can the22   archeological society now sue them for the loss.  I don't23   know.  Maybe it can.24             QUESTION:  Well, this -- this doesn't say that25   it goes to the archeological society --381111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1             QUESTION:  It goes to the tribe.2             QUESTION:  -- or that it goes to the Indians3   afterwards.  It just says, in trust.4             MR. BRAUCHLI:  Justice Scalia, I think you're5   saying that -- you're talking about a situation where the6   beneficiary doesn't do anything with the property.  If7   the -- if the -- I think the analogy would be -- that8   you're making is if the White Mountain Apache Tribe did9   nothing to their property.  Then that's their choice.  Butif you as the trustee went in there and destroyed theproperty that you were going to give to the --10111213141516   aside.  I'm -- I'm just saying that the City of Falls17   Church doesn't do anything with it.  It does not do what a18   trustee would normally have to do, and that is produce19   income from it, or -- or use it in -- in some way that20   will benefit the -- the cestui que trust.  Okay?  It justQUESTION:  I'm not talking about destroying it.          MR. BRAUCHLI:  -- beneficiary of Falls Church,that's our situation.QUESTION:  Yes.  I'm putting destroying it￼21 22 23 24 25leaves it fallow.          MR. BRAUCHLI:  And they're a trustee.          QUESTION:  And -- and I don't know of anylawsuits in which in such a situation a citizen could say,you know, I'm -- I'm a citizen of Falls Church, and you391111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   are wasting my -- my trust estate. 2             QUESTION:  No.  I don't even know of one that 3   says I have my forest which I leave to the people of Falls 4   Church, and lo and behold, 20 years later, that forest is 5   a wreck.  They cut every tree.  And I don't know if the 6   citizens of Falls Church can sue there either, but I know 7   the Indians can. 8             MR. BRAUCHLI:  I don't -- I think there's a 9   different -- there's -- this Court unanimously last term10   in the Klamath case said that the fiduciary relationship,11   the trust relationship, between the United States and the12   tribes is the primary cornerstone of Indian law.  It was a13   unanimous opinion.  There's a special trust relationship14   between the Indian people and the United States Government15   and when the United States --16             QUESTION:  But does that -- does that extend to17   a requirement that the United States spend its monies18   rather than the tribe's monies to preserve the land?19   Suppose in this case that some basic erosion systems were20   needed because the land was eroding, endangering the --21   the topography, and some simple irrigation rivulets or --22   or drainage rivulets would -- would save the property.23   Would the United States have the obligation to perform24   those -- those repairs?25 MR. BRAUCHLI: Yes. Yes, they do. 401111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1             QUESTION:  At its expense?2             MR. BRAUCHLI:  Yes.3             QUESTION:  What -- what authority do you have4 for that?5             MR. BRAUCHLI:  Because they --6             QUESTION:  That's -- that's certainly not a -- a7   trustee doesn't have the duty to repair at his own expense8   in -- in a private trust.9             MR. BRAUCHLI:  Well, this is not a -- I -- the10   United States, if they are -- the beneficiary is the11   tribe, and I think when you have a trustee in control and12   occupying, they -- according to the treatises I read --13   read, there's an absolute obligation to protect and14   preserve the beneficiary.15             QUESTION:  Not at the trustee's own expense.16   That's the point.  The -- the trust itself has to provide17   the means, the -- the financial wherewithal to make those18   repairs.  This isn't a duty financially imposed on the19   trustee.20212223   authority.  You may disagree, but how -- how do you find24   it out of trust law?25             MR. BRAUCHLI:  Okay.  My authority is the411111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼          MR.

If your --5             QUESTION:  Waste -- waste is different.6             QUESTION:  If your answer to me --7             QUESTION:  Waste is different from doing8   something that costs money, and the money has to come from9   somewhere.  And -- and do you think the United Statescould sell off a piece of this to private hands in orderto obtain the money to renovate these buildings?10111213141516   trust.17             MR. BRAUCHLI:  Well, I think that the trust18   relationship between the United States and Indian tribes19   is sui generis.20             QUESTION:  Okay.21             MR. BRAUCHLI:  You cannot import the common law22   wholesale into a -- this type of situation.23             QUESTION:  Based on your answer you gave to me24   about the hypothetical about the erosion occurring, it --25   it would seem to me that if the United States has an421111 14th Street, N.W.

BRAUCHLI:  No, but they did appropriatemoney --ordinary trust law does not apply in the case of a publicQUESTION:  So you're -- you're urging then that￼1   affirmative duty in that case, the fact that it occupied2   or didn't occupy the buildings does not alter its duty to3   keep those buildings in repair.  Its occupancy and use has4 5 6 7 8 9nothing to do with the case --          MR. BRAUCHLI:  Well --          QUESTION:  -- because in my hypothetical theydidn't occupy or use the land.          MR. BRAUCHLI:  Well, the complaint is for -- fordamage to the infrastructure for failure to keep up the --the water and sewer system, the electrical system, as well1011   as the buildings that they used and controlled.  They had12   total, exclusive control.13             QUESTION:  But if they didn't -- in Justice14   Kennedy's question, if the United States didn't use it for15   administrative and school purposes, then the United16   States, under the terms of the trust, has no right to hold17   it because they have this exclusive right of occupancy18   only for those purposes.  And if they just let the -- then￼it would be -- wouldn't it belong to the tribe?          MR. BRAUCHLI:  It expires and they -- they said19202122   judges said, well, can you use it as a uranium dump?  And23   the Department of Justice said, no, because that would be24   a breach of the trust because we're only allowed to use it25   for school or administrative purposes.  Therefore, a431111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005that in the court of appeals below that the -- the circuit1234   construed against the easement.  The easements are not5   wide open.uranium dump would be outside the use allowed.          I think waste is a use outside what Congressallowed them, and it's a specific use and it should be 6             QUESTION:  Yes, but I'm not sure you confront 7   the question, and I'm not sure what the answer is.  If the 8   waste -- duty to protect waste requires spending some 9   money, whose money do you spend?  The trustee's or the10   trust's?  The beneficiary's money or the trustee's money?111213141516171819202122232425If you buy an insurance policy, does the trustee pay forout of his own pocket or out of trust assets?          MR. BRAUCHLI:  Well, I think in this case theUnited States was obligated to prevent the deterioration.All they have to do is repair -- they havebasketball-sized holes in the roof letting rain in whichprogressively deteriorates -- deteriorates the property.          QUESTION:  Could the United States have usedtrust assets to perform that duty?          MR. BRAUCHLI:  I think they should use their ownassets since they're using it rent-free, and they shouldprotect the property because they have --          QUESTION:  You're saying they should use it.Could they -- in your judgment, could the United Stateshave used trust assets to perform that duty?441111 14th Street, N.W.

BRAUCHLI:  Yes, the United States' assets.I'm -- are you -- I'm not --12345   You mean the buildings themselves?  I don't -- well, theyQUESTION:  That's not my question.MR. BRAUCHLI:  Oh, you mean the trust assets.               QUESTION:  Could they cut down some trees and     say, we're going to sell off some timber because we've got11   to raise some money to fix the roof?  Would that have been               QUESTION:  Yes.a -- a legitimate use of the property?          MR. BRAUCHLI:  Of the tribe's timber?1213141516171819202122   rather interesting.  I mean, suppose -- suppose that the23   trustee -- this were an ordinary trust, but the trustee24   was giving it to a third party to use, which he'd have the25   right to do under the trust.  And the third party didn't451111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          MR. BRAUCHLI:  I would say they cannot do thatwithout the tribe's permission.￼          QUESTION:  So it's literally got to come out ofa pocket of the National Government which has no relationto the tribe's assets is what you're saying.MR. BRAUCHLI:  That's what I'm saying.QUESTION:  Suppose you -- you rent -- it's1   repair the basketball-sized holes in the pavilion.  How do2   we decide if it's that third party's responsibility, or if3   trust assets should have been used?  I mean, here I'm4 5 6 7 8 9thinking that --          MR. BRAUCHLI:  Well --          QUESTION:  -- the trustee is both the trusteeand the third party himself because he's using it for hisown purposes.          MR. BRAUCHLI:  Well, under landlord and tenantlaw, the tenant would certainly be liable for the waste,and this Court said that in the Bostwick case.10111213141516   duty is to the United States as well as the tribe.  And17   the United States under the leasing regulations has an18   absolute duty to go in there and protect the -- to protect19   the value of the property -- and I put that in my brief --20   the value of the property from a tenant who's injuring21   that property.  So here they're saying we're like a          QUESTION:  Would the tenant have to repair theholes in the roof?          MR. BRAUCHLI:  The tenant would be responsible.Any lease of tribal property by a -- a tenant, the -- the￼tenant, but we can commit all the waste we want to.          QUESTION:  What precisely are you asking for?22232425   were asked a question.

What is the measure of the damages2 you're -- 3             MR. BRAUCHLI:  I think the measure of damages 4   would be against the measuring stick of a reasonable 5   trustee in like circumstances in total control of the 6   trust corpus of his beneficiary.  And I'm saying it's that 7   amount of damages necessary to bring it up to code, less 8   reasonable wear and tear. 9             QUESTION:  So it would be -- that -- that would10   be the -- 14 million-dollar figure to bring it up to code?11             MR. BRAUCHLI:  Well, that was been altered12   because the tribe has engaged in a little self-help, and13   we actually took over five -- five buildings, and we had a14   grant from the White House Save America's Treasures and15   the National Endowment of the Humanities and the State of16   Arizona, and the tribe put 2 million of their own dollars.17   So I think that figure is more like $8 million, and18 that's --19             QUESTION:  But you're still -- what you're20   talking about is what it would cost to bring this up to21   historic building preservation level?22             MR. BRAUCHLI:  Not necessarily.  Its just a --23   when you have -- not -- we're not talking about restoring24   it.  We're talking about rehabilitating the buildings and25   you can keep its historic character and make modifications471111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   to it.  We're not talking about restoring it and making it 2   into a theme park like the Government suggests.  We're 3   talking about bringing it up to code.  You can make some 4   modifications to it. 5             The -- the standards are -- the Secretary's 6   standard says if you're going to have properties listed on 7   the National Register of Historic Properties, you can make 8   modifications, but you have to keep the historic 9   character.  You can upgrade the electricity.  You can10   repair the roofs.  And actually the code is a lot more lax11   than the Uniform Building Code.  The --          QUESTION:  What -- what is this code?

BRAUCHLI:  They don't own them, and under 7   Mitchell II, this Court said that when the United States 8   is in control of a -- of a resource of a tribe, a -- a 9   fiduciary relationship is established in respect to that10   resource.111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  No, but isn't your argument thatthey -- I -- I'm not saying whether you win or lose on it,but isn't your argument that they are obliged to give usthe money to repair them because the deterioration tookplace when they were in control?          MR. BRAUCHLI:  Yes.          QUESTION:  Isn't that your point?          MR. BRAUCHLI:  That is my point which I did notapparently express very well, but that is the pointthat --          QUESTION:  You mean they -- they were stillusing those buildings when the -- when the basketball-sized holes in the roofs appeared?          MR. BRAUCHLI:  They were using the buildings asthe progressive -- it's not a Big Bang Theory about a511111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1 2 3 4   deterioration of the buildings.  And then when they felt 5   that -- they just started to board them up, and -- and we 6   said, okay, we'll take -- they said -- well, actually, 7   they wrote a letter, said they're yours.  And we said, 8   what do you mean they're -- they're ours?  With an 9   $8 million repair bill and you had total control, and you10   feel you have the right to destroy property that you don't11   own?12             And this deprives Congress of the benefit that13   Congress intended.  So here's the executive branch saying,14   we don't care what Congress gave you.  We'll make sure you15   don't get anything except a -- a pile of rubble.  And16   someone has got to pay for that, and the tribe should not17   pay for that.  And that's the point of the damage claim.18             We went to the Secretary and they said -- after19   a year of wasting my time at the solicitor's office, they20   said -- finally, the Special Assistant to the Secretary21   said, you're going to have to sue us because we're not22   going to give you the money, and we feel we have the right23   to destroy this property.  And that's -- whether it's24   demolition by neglect or, as the Department of Justice25   said in the circuit court below, since you don't have521111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005building falling down.          (Laughter.)MR. BRAUCHLI:  It's -- it's a progressive￼ 1   title to this property, contrary to the plain text of the 2   act, we have the right to dynamite it. 3             And somehow it's been held in some kind of 4   purgatory state where what Congress intended to give to 5   the tribe wasn't really intended to give to the tribe. 6   It's a -- it's a plaything for the BIA to play with and7 destroy. 8             And that's not the fiduciary relationship that 9   this Court has been noted for in -- in respect to a one-10   on-one relationship.  In Nevada versus United States, wesaid, when it's one on one, a fiduciary relationship andthere's a fiduciary obligation incumbent upon the UnitedStates when it deals with Indian people.11121314151617   I should know, but I really don't.  How long ago did theQUESTION:  Mr. Brauchli --QUESTION:  What about --QUESTION:  -- can I ask this factual question?￼Government's active use of the buildings cease?18192021   building-by-building.  And they have raised the statute of22   limitations.  They said, your claim is premature, in -- in23   the trial court.  Then, in the circuit court they said,24   it's -- no.  They said it's -- you're too late.  You25 didn't -- the statute of limitations will bar your claim. 531111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          MR. BRAUCHLI:  It is different depending on thebuilding, and that's why we say we have to go1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9So that's still lingering out there.          Then, in the -- then in the circuit court ofappeals they said, it's not in trust, and therefore we candynamite it.          Then, in their briefs here they say, we controleverything and your claim is premature.          So they have shifting defenses.          Different buildings, because they didn'tmaintain them, they started sloughing off one-by-onebecause they --1011121314151617   10 years ago?  Five years ago?          QUESTION:  Do you have a theory on when theiractive use of the buildings ceased?          MR. BRAUCHLI:  It's -- it goes -- it really doeshave to go by building-by-building because I would saythat --￼QUESTION:  Give me any building.  Was it          MR. BRAUCHLI:  -- in the last 5, 6.  The last 6years have been progressive, where they started boardingthem up and just stopped --1819202122232425   a deteriorating use.  We don't ask them to restore          QUESTION:  And your theory is that the -- thewaste occurred before or after they ceased using some --or some of each?MR. BRAUCHLI:  It's -- it's some of each.  It's541111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   pre-1960 condition.  We're saying take the 1960 condition, 2   and the waste you committed from 1960 when it's under your 3   control.  We don't want them to -- they don't have to 4   restore it back to its -- as they say -- Old West shape. 5   We're just asking it -- for the condition that when we got 6   it from Congress, Congress said, here's the gift.  Here is 7   the Fort Apache, but we're going to give the Secretary 8   just a limited use, and when that need expires, then the 9   Secretary has no right because but for that act, the10   Secretary can't even set foot on that property.  It's11   trespass.12             QUESTION:  Well, is it -- let -- may I also get13   clear on something that I -- I thought I was clear on but14   I'm not.  Is it your theory that they are responsible for15   the waste or damage or deterioration that took place up to16   the point at which they ceased actively to use it, or up17   to the point at which they relinquished control over it to18   you?  Because I take it those -- for some buildings --19   will be different -- different dates.20             MR. BRAUCHLI:  Yes.  There's -- they maintain21   that they relinquished some buildings and therefore it's22   barred by the statute of limitations.23             QUESTION:  No.  But what is your theory?  Is it24   that their responsibility is measured by the date at which25   they ceased to use, or the date at which they relinquished551111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   control to you? 2             MR. BRAUCHLI:  It was the date when they 3   relinquished control and we accepted it because we refused 4   to accept them without the money to repair them. 5             QUESTION:  Okay. 6             MR. BRAUCHLI:  And they're -- 7             QUESTION:  So you're saying during part of the 8   period in which the -- the property was just boarded up, 9   their responsibility was still in effect.10             MR. BRAUCHLI:  Yes, because they still kept them11   on their facility inventory maintenance list, but they12   didn't get -- they get the maintenance money and they use13   it for other things other than the --14             QUESTION:  Suppose in -- suppose in 1960 the15   Government said, here are the buildings.  We don't want16   them.  And you said, well, you know, it's -- it's going to17   cost us a lot of money to keep up these buildings.  You're18   going to have to pay for that.  We can't do that.  Could￼19202122232425the Government then say, well, we have a stand-off, we'lldestroy them?          MR. BRAUCHLI:  Are you talking about afterMarch 18th, or before --          QUESTION:  This is after the 1960 act wasenacted and they had become the trustee.          MR. BRAUCHLI:  If they never physically occupied561111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051   those buildings or they stopped using them, it's not their2   liability.  If they walked away from the property in -- on3   March 18th, 1960, they said, Hey, Congress just gave this4   to you.  We've been using them but we're going to walk5   away today.  No responsibility.  None.  Because when they6   were the owner, they can do whatever they want.  When the7 8 9tribe becomes the owner and they -- they take control ofthe trust corpus, then there's an obligation, the mostfundamental, rudimentary, crude fiduciary duty as to --          QUESTION:  Can -- can the Government terminatethis trust anytime it wants?1011121314151617   reservation.  Only Congress can.MR. BRAUCHLI:  Pardon?          QUESTION:  Can the Government terminate thistrust anytime it wants by executive order?          MR. BRAUCHLI:  No, it cannot because theexecutive branch does not have the power to terminate this￼          QUESTION:  That's -- that's what I thought.  Thetrust remains in effect at all times.181920212223   their liability ends.  You know, we have taken over the24   cook's cabin.  We've taken over four buildings.  Their25   liability is going to end there because we took them over.571111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          MR. BRAUCHLI:  But it's -- it'd be only a baretrust, Your -- Your Honor, because if -- once they -- oncethey relinquish the control and the need is not there, 1   We had to use some self-help. 2             QUESTION:  What -- what of the Government's 3   argument that this was really an illusory trust?  That is, 4   the statute, the 1960 statute, gave the Government the 5   right to use this for -- for school and administrative 6   purposes as long as they wanted to.  So at -- looking at 7   it from 1960, that could be forever.  They might have 8   wanted to use it as a school forever, and then the tribe 9   would have nothing.10             MR. BRAUCHLI:  Well, the -- to answer that11   question, Your Honor, the measure of damages always could12   be measured against a reasonable trustee.  If they kept13   using for 100 years, then of course, there's going to be14   normal -- you know, even normal wear and tear, but there's15   still -- that's something for the trial court to sort out16   as to the measure of damages.  I mean, what is17   reasonable -- what is reasonable to repair, what is18   reasonable not to under the circumstances.  That's --￼19202122232425that's a question for the trier of fact as to the measureof damages.          But, you know, the reality of the situation isthat the need has expired except for about 10 buildings.          In this -- I mentioned the Bostwick case becausein the Bostwick case, the United States had open, freeuse -- unrestricted use of a private home, and they --581111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051   they committed waste.  And there was -- and this Court --2   Court -- they were sued.  The United States was sued and3   the Court said that there's an implied covenant against4   waste even those the lease is silent as to that duty.  And5 6 7 8 9I think the analogy is here in the trust situation.When -- when -- it doesn't matter if the statute doesn'tsay you have to repair buildings when you're using them.It would be unnatural for a statute to say so.That's all I have, Your Honor.QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Brauchli.Mr. Garre, you have 1 minute left.10111213141516171819   the appendix to the petition.  It's using the property for20   its own Government purposes, and in that respect, this21   case is completely unlike Mitchell II, where the statutes22   and regulations specifically required the Government to23   manage the property as an economic resource for the24 Indians.25 There are no trust assets to pay for any 591111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. GARRE:  Thank you, Justice Stevens.  May itplease the Court:￼          The Government is not using the property, and isnot required to use the property for the benefit of thetribe as the court of appeals acknowledged at page 14a of1   historic restoration efforts because Congress directed2   that the property would be used for Government purposes,3   not for any -- any kind of economic purposes that would4   generate assets.  Congress has a separate regime for5   historic preservation.  It grants millions of dollars each6   year for historic preservation projects, and as7   Mr. Brauchli alluded, Congress has granted funds for8   historic reservation at Fort Apache.  The tribe has 910111213141516171819202122232425engaged in its own historic preservation efforts therewith millions of dollars of private, State, and Federalfunding, and the Department of the Interior has putmillions of dollars of its own maintenance and repairefforts into the fort.          Thank you very much.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Mr. Garre.          (Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)￼601111 14th Street, N.W.
