Felipe Edgardo Tovar. General Miller, we'll hear from you. ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS J. MILLERON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. MILLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:The modern guilty plea colloquy, by focusing onand clearly articulating the consequences of pleading guilty, paralleling the Patterson case, clearly constitute the -- the intelligent and knowing waiver of counsel in this particular context. In the modern guilty plea context, among other things, the defendant is told the elements of the crime, the range of the sentence, the factual bases developed between the judge and the defendant to assure that his guilt, and in addition,the --QUESTION: Well, if someone is going to plead guilty, I guess the question may boil down to whether he has a right to be told the he could be represented by an attorney in making the decision to plead and that it might be useful to him to have an attorney's advice in making that decision.3, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. MILLER: Yes, Your Honor. You know, we --2 QUESTION: It's a guilty plea. It wasn't a3 going to trial and he was told certainly of all the things4 that could be involved in a trial and how an attorney5 would be helpful but was not told, I guess, expressly that6 if you plead guilty, you can be represented by counsel and7 the attorney might give you useful advice.8 MR. MILLER: Separating the -- the two issues,9 first, the question of whether he was explicitly told in10 this proceeding that he had a right to counsel at this11 proceeding. He was not told in that many words. But, you12 know, there's -- there's a presumption of regularity here13 based on the Johnson case.14 QUESTION: My goodness, he wasn't told. You're15 conceding that he wasn't told he had a right at the plea16 stage. I thought what they said to him right off the bat17 was, Mr. Tovar, you're without counsel. I see you waived18 application for a court-appointed attorney. You want to19 represent yourself at today's hearing. So what I thought20 the State was saying is that that's sufficient.21 MR. MILLER: Yes.22 QUESTION: And I didn't even think that was an23 issue in this case. I didn't see it in the petition. I24 didn't see it in the response to the petition. Maybe it25 would be an issue for the lower court. So I'm not sure4, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 what to do with that. I can see it's ambiguous, but if2 you want to concede it, that's fine with me.3 MR. MILLER: What -- what I'm saying, Your4 Honor, is -- is this, that in -- in the total context, he5 clearly knew that he had a right to counsel and,6 that really is the -- the words that submit that7 QUESTION: I mean, nobody is really --8 is that an issue in front of us?indeed, --at least,9 MR. MILLER: You know, I--Idon't--10 think -- I don't think it should be, Your Honor.11 QUESTION: I thought it was very much the issue12 before the Iowa Supreme Court because that court said what13 was missing here was information about the utility of a14 lawyer at the plea stage before you enter the plea with15 you at that hearing. And here, all of the statements made16 relate to what you're giving up by pleading guilty and not17 going to trial.18 Now, I thought, as Justice Breyer did, from that19 opening colloquy there was information to the defendant20 that he could consult with a lawyer before entering the21 plea. And I wondered particularly about the form that he22 signed. Tovar signed a form waiving counsel before the23 plea hearing, but that form is nowhere in the record or24 the lodging. Does it exist?25 MR. MILLER: Your -- Your Honor, I -- I don't5, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005I don't￼1 think he actually signed a form. What -- what did happen2 is that he was informed at the -- informed at the arrest3 through the Miranda warnings that he had a right to4 counsel. And then he went for a initial appearance, and5 this is -- this is the part that -- that I think we focus6 on.7 At the initial appearance, the judge marked the8 form saying application for court-appointed counsel, and9 then wrote waived. In other words, he had given the10 opportunity at this initial appearance for counsel. Going11 forward, there -- there was no reason to -- to interrupt12 the initial appearance and having to have counsel at -- at13 initial appearance. It was going forward.14 And then the words that Justice Breyer referred15 to, when he went to -- went to the plea hearing, the judge16 said, you know, I see that you've -- you've waived17 counsel, and then he says I assume that you want to18 proceed to represent yourself.19 So we think that -- that that really satisfies20 the requirement --21 QUESTION: But do we have the transcript of the22 -- of that initial hearing where he waived counsel?23 MR. MILLER: The initial hearing -- the24 checklist is in -- is in the documents that -- that were25 given -- given to this Court.6, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: Well, that wasn't the basis. I -- I didn't understand that to be the basis of our decision here. The -- the Supreme Court of Iowa did, indeed, focus on whether he was advised at -- about how useful counsel could be --MR. MILLER: Yes, Your Honor, that --QUESTION: -- in -- in connection with the guilty plea --MR. MILLER: Yes, Your Honor. That's --QUESTION: -- not that he wasn't advised that he had a right to counsel. The problem here is he was told he had a right to counsel, but it wasn't said, boy, you know, you'd really be stupid to turn it down. That -- that wasn't done. Right?MR. MILLER: That -- that's exactly right. That's what the Iowa Supreme Court held. You know, it wasn't -- it wasn't raised at the district court level. It wasn't raised in the opposition to the cert petition.QUESTION: So what is your -- what everybody I think is trying to do is ask you what is your argument on the point that we thought was why we granted the case, or at least I thought why.MR. MILLER: Yes.QUESTION: What -- what is the reason that the Iowa court is wrong --7, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. MILLER: Yes.2 QUESTION: -- on -- on the point just as Justice3 Scalia put it?4 MR. MILLER: Yes, Your Honor. I think -- I5 think the -- the point is this, that in the plea setting6 it is very analogous to the Patterson setting and not7 analogous to the Faretta setting at -- at going to trial8 without counsel. And -- and the reason for that is, Your9 Honor, that going through the plea and hearing the10 elements and going through the factual basis and knowing11 the punishments, that's something a person can comprehend12 and can make a decision on, just like the Court held in13 Patterson that the decision to answer a question under14 interrogation or not under interrogation is something15 someone could do.16 But in -- in the trial setting, it is just so17 difficult for a person to represent himself in terms of18 the rule of evidence, in terms of strategy, witnesses,19 choosing the jury. Those are the kinds of things that it20 is just so difficult. What we do is two things. We21 inform the defendant of all those difficulties and by22 informing him as -- with a -- with an authority figure23 like a judge, we're -- we're pushing him towards counsel.24 QUESTION: Well, but -- but in -- in the context25 of entering a plea, it certainly would be useful for the8, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 defendant to know that if he had an attorney, the attorney2 might take a look at -- at the sobriety tests. He might3 talk with the prosecutor about a plea to the lesser4 charge, reckless driving. He might talk to the judge5 about a reduced sentence. It didn't happen here because6 he got the minimum.7 But just as -- as a general matter, your brief8 seems to suggest that there's -- there's not really much9 role for the attorney at -- in entering a guilty plea. I10 -- I suggest that there -- there's a very important role11 for him.12 MR. MILLER: Well, Your Honor, I think -- I13 think there are a number of useful -- useful functions,14 the ones you described, also collateral consequences.15 QUESTION: And collateral consequences, yes.16 MR. MILLER: But -- but generally in exercising17 these rights and describing these rights, you give the18 general -- the general right, not -- not the specific19 services. The -- the Ruiz case indicates that. And in20 the Patterson setting, the -- you know, the things that a21 lawyer could do about strategy on the questions or make22 sure that you weren't tripped up on the questions, that23 was not required by Patterson. It's the -- it's the main24 consequences. It's the direct consequences that Patterson25 requires and that this requires.9, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 And, Your Honor, if we go into all the useful2 things that an attorney can do -- and -- and certainly3 there are many -- then it's -- it's almost an endless4 list. It's a fairly long list. And then we're cluttering5 up the -- the colloquy. It's already a -- a rather long6 colloquy.7 QUESTION: This -- this comes after, I take it,8 General Miller, the discussion between the judge and the9 defendant as to whether or not the elements of the offense10 are present?11 MR. MILLER: It would -- it would have -- I12 guess it would have to come after that. I mean, I think13 -- I think the factual basis is really the key here.141516 -- that's 1718 represents to the court that the factual basis for the19 plea is there, that he committed the offense charged, why20 is there any great interest in trying to persuade him not21 to do that?22 MR. MILLER: You know, I -- I don't think there23 is a great interest, Your Honor, and I don't -- I don't24 think -- I don't think the -- the system is served here25 particularly what -- what the Iowa Supreme Court required10, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005QUESTION: Yes.MR. MILLER: The -- because that's -- that's the our -- that's our real assurance that guilty -- QUESTION: Well, and if -- if the defendant￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that, you know, a -- and a lawyer can give you an independent assessment of -- of whether it's wise to plead guilty. Obviously, that's something that -- that we know about lawyers.And also really subsumed in that, to some extent, is the -- the question of defenses, but it's not a -- it's not a particularly helpful litany that they developed.QUESTION: I --QUESTION: Well, the Iowa court made rather a long laundry list of requirements. I suppose you wouldn't have to go along with all of those things, but I am interested to know whether you think there is a baseline requirement that the court advise the defendant in making a plea that he has a right to counsel and the attorney could be helpful in making that decision.MR. MILLER: Well, I -- I think that -- that he has to know that he has -- has the right -- right to counsel. But --QUESTION: You don't think he has to know that counsel would be helpful.MR. MILLER: The -- he knows that counsel is -- would be helpful.QUESTION: He doesn't have to be told that counsel would be helpful.11, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

An individual knows that -- that -- it certainly follows much like in Patterson -- knows that the counsel would advise him whether to ask -- answer the questions or not. But that's something someone --QUESTION: But you do agree that he's -- you do agree that the advice should include explicit advice that he has a right to counsel at the plea hearing.MR. MILLER: He should -- he should know at the plea hearing that he had a right to counsel.QUESTION: But he doesn't have to be told by the judge that he has a right to counsel at the -- he was not -- this -- in this case he was not told by the judge he had a right to counsel at that hearing.MR. MILLER: The -- the judge said, you know, I -- I see you -- you made application, which would have been for this hearing, for -- you -- you did not make application --QUESTION: Well, why -- why is it clear that it would be for this hearing because the judge followed up, after saying that, did you want to represent yourself at￼today's hearing, which would seem to judge did not know whether or not he not to have counsel at that hearing?MR. MILLER: Well, I think12, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005me to imply that the had already decidedthat question was1 really did you change your mind. I mean --2 QUESTION: Well, of course --3 MR. MILLER: -- you made -- you made a decision4 at the initial hearing going forward towards this hearing5 that you wouldn't have counsel. Have you changed your6 mind?7 QUESTION: Maybe -- maybe you -- you should say8 that he should be advised of his right to counsel, but if9 he isn't, it is a harmless mistake if it is clear from the10 record that he knew it.11 MR. MILLER: That -- that certainly would --12 QUESTION: Even -- even if there is a -- a -- an13 absolute right to have the judge tell you you're entitled14 to counsel, if it's clear on the record15 were told, there's -- there's no foul.at least that you￼161718 though. 192021 You know,22 our favor2324 presumptions, maybe it is. You presume everything was25 regular. Why sure, then it is. But if you just look at13, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MR. MILLER: Yes, Your Honor. QUESTION: But it's not clearon this record,QUESTION: But that you knew.MR. MILLER: Yes. You know, I -- I think it is. this -- every -- every presumption is -- is in in this kind of collateral setting.QUESTION: Well, if you draw -- draw1 what was said to him at the hearing itself, it's not clear2 that he knew that he had -- he had waived application for3 a court-appointed attorney. He didn't necessarily say he4 wanted to 56 -- in the7 appearance and then drawing that towards the -- forward8 into the -- the plea -- plea hearing, that -- and -- and9 certainly indulging the -- the presumptions here, that --represent himself.MR. MILLER: Well, I -- I think, Your Honor, in context of the discussion at the initial10 that that -- that he did know. And indeed, to this date11 he's not asserted that he didn't know.12 QUESTION: Well, but the -- all I'm saying is13 the record doesn't establish it, and we've been -- in some14 situations been rather meticulous about what ought to be15 on the record because then you solve all the problems of16 collateral attack if the record does disclose17 than relying on presumptions and inferences.18 point.19 MR. MILLER: Yes. Yes, Your Honor.20 QUESTION: Where did this case come21 justice court? It was a misdemeanor, wasn't it, an OWI,22 operating without a --23 MR. MILLER: It -- it was, Your Honor. It would24 be associate district court. It would be a situation25 where there -- there would be a -- would be a judge and --14, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼it rather That's theout of? A1 who, you know, went through a -- you know, a long colloquy2 with the -- with -- went through a colloquy concerning3 representation.4 QUESTION: But that was basically the rule --5 what would be in the Federal system, a rule 11 colloquy,6 and it's all canned. I mean, the -- as the transcript7 shows, he -- he went through the -- almost precisely the8 same litany on both times. So --9 MR. MILLER: Yes, Your Honor. It -- it10 parallels rule 11. It's -- our rule 8 is -- is very11 similar to -- to rule 11. And at the -- at the plea12 hearing, of course, he was asked three times whether he13 wanted to plea or whether he wanted to -- to go forward14 and -- and contest the case and that's -- in that setting.15 QUESTION: He does have a right to counsel at16 the plea hearing. He does have a right if he asserts it17 to consult with counsel before the hearing takes place,18 but I -- I think your argument is he doesn't even have to19 be told that bare information, never mind the -- the20 continuing spiel about how much a lawyer would be worth to21 him, but just the simple statement before you enter this22 plea, you're entitled to consult a lawyer. And if you23 want a lawyer to be with you at the hearing, you're24 entitled to that too.25 MR. MILLER: What -- what we're saying, Your15, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Honor, is that -- that that was covered by the -- the2 words that Justice Breyer mentioned at -- at the outset,3 that you know, I -- I see you waived application for4 counsel at -- at the prior -- it would have been at the5 prior proceedings, which would have been for this6 proceeding, and do you -- you know, do you continue to7 want to represent yourself.8 QUESTION: But I think there's something9 important afterwards. It's or did you want to take some10 time to hire an attorney to represent you, which --111213 represent 1415 the -- 1617 his plea hearing. That was said at his sentencing hearing18 when he pled to another crime that he had committed in the19 interim.20 But at -- the lines of what went on at the plea21 hearing is I see, Mr. Tovar, you waived application for a22 court-appointed attorney. Did you want to represent23 yourself at today's hearing? Period. That was it.24 MR. MILLER: That -- that was at -- at that25 proceeding, and -- and we argue that that -- those are the16, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005QUESTION: That was at the sentencing. QUESTION: -- certainly one inference is that to you at this kind of proceeding.MR. MILLER: Yes, yes, Your Honor. The --￼QUESTION: That -- that was not said at -- at1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425-- those are the key words that really -- really wrap up this issue, that he was told before he had a right to counsel at this hearing. There's a referral back. It was reaffirmed that he wanted to represent himself at -- at the hearing.As I say, that -- that -- you know, it was not raised by the -- by the defendant at the trial court level or in the -- or in the resistance to the cert petition. And to this day, they -- they've not asserted that he didn't know that he had the right to counsel at the -- at the plea -- at the plea hearing.QUESTION: The States seem to take various positions on this. Do you know if any of them have taken it as a matter of their own constitution rather than the Federal Constitution?MR. MILLER: The State has -- has not on this -- on this particular issue.QUESTION: Iowa hasn't, but have other States? MR. MILLER: Not -- not that I know of, YourHonor.QUESTION: This -- this being? This being the issue on which we granted cert or the issue of whether you have to advise him of his right to counsel?MR. MILLER: I -- I was assuming on -- on the matter that was before the Court as -- as a matter of the17, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

QUESTION: Very well, General Miller. Mr. Stewart, we'll hear from you.ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWARTON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERMR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:The plea colloquy conducted at respondent's 1996 prosecution adequately informed respondent of the dangers and disadvantages of proceeding without counsel. Respondent's waiver of counsel and the guilty plea itself were therefore knowing and intelligent. The judgment of the Iowa Supreme Court should be reversed.I think it may be helpful to look first at the precise language that the Iowa Supreme Court employed in announcing the warnings that it thought were constitutionally required, and if the Court looks at page 18 of the appendix to the certiorari petition, that's the paragraph of the Iowa Supreme Court's opinion that's entitled Summary and Disposition. And it --QUESTION: Page 18 of what?MR. STEWART: Of the appendix to the certiorari18, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 petition.2 And if you -- if you look in -- in the middle of3 the page, the Iowa Supreme Court in summarizing its4 holding said, rather, the trial judge need only advise the5 defendant generally that there are defenses to criminal6 charges that may not be known by lay persons and that the7 danger in waiving of the assistance of counsel in deciding8 whether to plead guilty is the risk that a viable defense9 will be overlooked. The defendant should be admonished10 that by waiving his right to an attorney, he will lose the11 opportunity to obtain an -- an opinion on whether under12 the facts and applicable law it is wise to plead guilty.13 In addition, the court must ensure the defendant14 understands the nature of the charges against him and the15 range of allowable punishments.16 But the third paragraph is -- is more -- the17 third sentence is more or less irrelevant because there's18 no dispute here that the defendant was informed of the19 nature and -- of the charge and the applicable20 punishments, and that would be done in any standard plea21 colloquy. So it's really just the previous two sentences22 that are at issue, and I think there are some noteworthy23 points about these.24 The first is that the warnings mandated by the25 Iowa Supreme Court don't contain any declarative sentence19, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 to the effect that you have a right to represented by2 counsel at this plea proceeding. The Iowa Supreme Court I3 think took it as given that respondent had been made4 adequately aware that he had a right to counsel and that5 what was missing was adequate information about the6 services that counsel could perform in connection with the7 plea decision.8 The second thing is that there's no reference in9 these warnings to case-specific issues such as possible10 suppression of evidence or the potential for plea11 bargaining. The -- the warnings are designed to be12 warnings that could be given in every single case. And in13 our view, the warnings are either vacuous or misleading,14 depending on how they're interpreted.15 If they are accurately interpreted as16 generalizations about the criminal justice process, they17 really say nothing more than that as a class lawyers know18 more about the law than people who are not lawyers, and19 it's at least possible that consulting with a lawyer would20 improve your chances in this criminal prosecution. And I21 think any defendant who is aware that he has the right to22 counsel would be aware of those facts, would be aware of23 at least the possibility that a lawyer could help him and24 the certainty that a lawyer would know more about the25 charges than he would.20, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 On the other hand, if the defendant2 misunderstands these warnings as directed to him3 personally as availed suggestion that there is actually a4 meritorious defense in his own case, then the defendant5 may be given an artificial disincentive to plead guilty6 and in the case of a non-indigent defendant may be led to7 spend his own funds consulting with a lawyer when in fact8 no valid defense exists.9 QUESTION: Would a Miranda warning be sufficient10 to advise the -- the defendant that you have a right to11 counsel? Period. It's pretty obvious to me that if you12 have a right to counsel at interrogation, you certainly13 have a right to one at the plea bargain. Would that be14 sufficient?15 MR. STEWART: I think it would be16 constitutionally sufficient, but it's certainly better17 practice to make sure that the defendant understands that18 the right extends beyond the questioning itself. And I19 think that was done in the initial appearance. The20 defendant -- there's -- there's a form. The defendant is21 represented as having waived his right to application for22 appointed counsel. I suppose that still leaves open the23 possibility that he could have retained counsel if he had24 chosen to. But I think that certainly apprised the25 defendant of the right -- of -- of the fact that his right21, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 to counsel extended beyond the initial questioning itself2 and would continue for the duration of the proceedings.3 And we'd also point out that because this is a4 collateral challenge, the defendant bears the burden of5 establishing that no knowing and intelligent waiver6 occurred. And to the extent that there's a gap in the7 record on this point, I think the defendant is properly8 chargeable with that.9 I'd also like to return to the point that10 Justice Kennedy made earlier about the possibility that in11 some cases an attorney might be able to obtain suppression12 of incriminating evidence or might be able to negotiate13 with the prosecution about possible plea bargains. I14 think first it's noteworthy that the standard rule 1115 colloquy mentions several constitutional rights that an16 individual gives up by pleading guilty, but it doesn't17 mention the possibility of suppressing evidence and it18 doesn't mention the possibility of plea bargaining. So it19 would be odd to think that you could have a20 constitutionally valid waiver even though the defendant21 was not informed of those substantive possibilities but22 would, nevertheless, have to be informed of the assistance23 that a lawyer might provide in connection with those --24 QUESTION: Mr. Stewart, do you know what the25 general practice is in Federal courts? Are there22, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 instructions given to prosecutors to make sure, for2 example, that the defendant at a guilty plea is told that3 maybe the -- that he has a right to a lawyer and he might4 be helpful?5 MR. STEWART: Well, as to the -- it does --6 Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 in its current form7 says that if the defendant appears at the plea hearing8 without counsel, he is to be informed that he has a right9 to counsel at trial and at every other stage of the10 proceedings. So there's clearly a requirement that the11 defendant be made aware that he has a right to counsel at12 the plea hearing.13 Neither the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure14 nor the bench book for U.S. district judges requires that15 the defendant be given additional information about the16 services that an attorney might provide or the likelihood17 that an attorney could be helpful by --18 QUESTION: Do you know the practice in -- in19 other States generally?20 MR. STEWART: My sense is that there is probably21 a great deal of variation not only from State to State,22 but among different courts within different States I23 think, and I think that's probably the -- the likelihood24 in the Federal system as well.25 QUESTION: Well, I -- I suppose my comment was23, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 in response to the argument that, well, it really doesn't2 make any difference, which is the -- the intimation I -- I3 saw in -- in the brief. And I suppose it doesn't make any4 difference because we assume that anybody knows this5 stuff?6 MR. STEWART: I don't think we would assume that7 any -- necessarily any layperson would be aware of the8 potential for suppressing evidence or the possibility of9 negotiating a plea arrangement. I think any defendant10 knows more generally that lawyers have legal expertise11 that lay people lack.12 But I think if -- if we try to -- to think about13 how warnings about suppression and plea bargaining might14 work, I think we realize why the Iowa Supreme Court shied15 away from something like that because, on the one hand, if16 this Court instructed, as a matter of constitutional law,17 that whenever an uncounseled person pleads guilty, he has18 to be informed that in some cases it may be possible to19 suppress incriminating evidence and in some cases it may20 be possible to negotiate with the prosecution for a21 reduced charge, a lot of defendants are going to be given22 false hope because the possibility that those modes of23 procedure might succeed would vary enormously.24 QUESTION: Why -- why wouldn't the same argument25 apply to all of the rights that you're going to lose if24, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 you plead guilty? Why -- why wouldn't rule 11 be really2 largely unnecessary under your view?3 MR. STEWART: Well, I -- I think those rules4 really do focus on things that will actually happen in any5 criminal trial if the defendant decides not to plead6 guilty. That is, the defendant is informed if you plead7 guilty, you are waiving the right either to testify or not8 testify on your own behalf. You're giving up the right to9 counsel. You're giving up the right to cross-examine10 witnesses. The defendant really is being told about11 things that are likely to occur in virtually any criminal12 trial, and I think that's -- that's the idea of a13 standardized plea colloquy.14 On -- on the other hand, if you're talking about15 suppression of evidence or talking about plea bargaining,16 if you give that advice in every case, it's often going to17 be misleading. A trial judge is going to find himself in18 the position of saying you might be able to bargain with19 the prosecution over a reduced charge even though he knows20 that the policy of the prosecutor is not to engage in plea21 bargaining with respect to a category of cases that22 includes that one.23 QUESTION: Mr. Stewart, as I understand your24 argument, you're -- you're arguing not only are these25 warnings not constitutionally mandated, you're also saying25, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 they're probably unwise in a number of situations. Are2 you arguing that they're so unwise that we should tell, as3 a matter of Federal law, a State judge could not give4 these warnings?5 MR. STEWART: No, I don't think there would be6 any Federal law barrier to States requiring warnings such7 as these. And I -- I think the -- the vacuous warnings,8 the warnings we regard as vacuous, that were mandated by9 the Iowa Supreme Court are less likely to be harmful than10 more specific warnings about --11 But the other point I wanted to make is if the12 Court decided that it wouldn't be a good idea to warn13 about suppression of evidence or plea bargaining in every14 case but maybe it would be advisable to do that in some15 cases, that would really be thrusting trial judges in an16 untenable position because the point of having a17 standardized plea colloquy is to give judges a -- a safe18 harbor, to give them some assurance that if they provide19 standardized advice in every case, that's going to be20 enough. And if a trial judge had to decide is the21 likelihood of a successful plea negotiation sufficiently22 great in this particular case that the defendant should be23 advised about it or do I see a viable basis for asking for24 suppression of evidence, it would really make the trial25 judge's life much more difficult. And if the Court were26, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425to hold, as a matter of constitutional law, that the trial judge is required to do that and can be reversed for failure to, it would really cause disruption.QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Stewart. Ms. Wilson, we'll hear from you.ORAL ARGUMENT OF THERESA R. WILSON ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMS. WILSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:Before a court may accept a guilty plea from an uncounseled defendant, the Constitution requires that the defendant be advised of the following: of his right to have counsel present prior to and during entry of the guilty plea, including appointed counsel if necessary; that by waiving counsel, he will lose an independent opinion of his case and on the wisdom of pleading guilty; and that by waiving counsel, he risks overlooking potential defenses that he as a layperson may not recognize. These are the minimal standards required for a waiver of plea counsel.QUESTION: Where is it --QUESTION: That -- that isn't what the Supreme Court of Iowa required in this case, is it? I mean, the -- their warning, as read by Mr. Stewart, was not nearly that specific.27, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MS. WILSON: Correct. The Iowa Supreme Court2 applied the rules of Patterson and Faretta, determining3 that a uncounseled defendant who chooses to plead guilty4 must be given a meaningful discussion regarding the5 usefulness of counsel at the plea proceeding and the6 dangers of proceeding pro se. The court determined that7 the best way to fulfill that obligation is to advise the8 defendant of the risks of overlooking potential defenses9 and of the loss of an independent opinion regarding his10 case.11 QUESTION: My -- I guess the difficulty that I12 have with that is no -- no question about the -- the13 soundness of those general statements, but they are so14 general that they -- they raise the question whether there15 are really very many defendants that don't know that to16 begin with and whether there is a real utility in17 requiring those warnings and hence paying the price in the18 mistaken cases when they're not given. Do -- do19 defendants really need this?20 MS. WILSON: Yes. We simply cannot infer from21 the fact that a defendant is told that he has counsel or22 has a right to counsel that he necessarily understands the23 sort of assistance counsel could provide. The American24 Bar Association has discussed this particular problem in25 their criminal justice standards, specifically part 5,28, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 8.1. The American Bar Association recognizes that to many2 defendants the word counsel may not necessarily have any3 clear meaning.4 QUESTION: Did they say how they knew that?5 MS. WILSON: No, Your Honor.6 QUESTION: Did they say -- did they -- I mean,7 I'm -- I am impressed by the fact that rule 11(b), which8 is a product of the rulemaking process and presumably, I'm9 sure, it reflects the experience of trial lawyers, which10 is not my experience, and -- and they try to get in things11 like the ABA. Yet, they do not require that you tell the12 lawyer how useful -- you tell the -- the individual how13 useful the lawyer will be. They do require that you tell14 the defendant how -- that he has a right to a lawyer at15 every stage of the proceeding. So I took from the fact16 that the ABA and everybody else lobby nonstop for this17 kind of thing that they felt it was very desirable but not18 so important that you had to actually include it in the19 colloquy. Otherwise, it would be there in rule 11(b).20 So now, what -- what does the ABA say? Do they21 say it's a constitutional requirement? Do they try to22 change even the rule? No. I don't think they do.23 MS. WILSON: No.24 QUESTION: But you're -- you're saying that the25 Constitution requires the thing that the lawyers29, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 themselves through their groups have felt is desirable but2 not important enough to put in the rules. Wouldn't we go3 to the rules first?4 MS. WILSON: Not necessarily. Under -- under5 Patterson, under Faretta, even as -- back as far as6 Johnson v. Zerbst, this Court has required that any waiver7 of a constitutional right be a voluntary, knowing, and8 intelligent abandonment or relinquishment of a known right9 or privilege.10 QUESTION: But, Ms. Wilson, you know, as to how11 much that requires, when we invented the Miranda warning,12 we -- we simply required that -- that the defendant be13 told you have a right to counsel. We didn't -- we didn't14 say that he be told, and by the way, the first thing15 counsel will tell you is to shut up, which would be very16 good advice.17 (Laughter.)18 QUESTION: We didn't require that. We just said19 you have a right to counsel. And -- and you want us to --20 to elaborate upon the Miranda warning as well?21 MS. WILSON: The -- those particular warnings22 were used both in the Miranda case and in the Patterson23 case, Sixth Amendment right to counsel at post-indictment24 questioning. In both of those cases, a defendant still25 has other alternatives even if he does make statements to30, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 the police. He can attempt to recant his statement. He2 may have other available defenses. If a defendant appears3 before a court to enter a guilty plea uncounseled, that4 admission is going to be conclusive proof of guilt,5 leading to a final conviction that isn't revocable.6 QUESTION: Why -- even on this very record, when7 he came for the sentencing, the judge did say, as Judge8 Kennedy -- Justice Kennedy pointed out, that are you sure9 you don't want more time to consider having counsel. And10 one of the questions I was going to ask you is given that11 the judge was so solicitous at the sentencing hearing,12 could the defendant at that point have said, judge, I've13 thought about what I did at the plea hearing and I'd14 really like to withdraw my plea? I think you're right. I15 need more time to consult a lawyer.16 MS. WILSON: He -- the defendant would have been17 able to file a motion in arrest of judgment. I do not18 recall off the top of my head if that deadline had passed19 by the time of his sentencing. I believe it needs to be20 filed within 5 days of sentencing. So he may not have￼21 been able 2223 after the24 Iowa?25to do that procedurally.QUESTION: But the judgment is entered only sentence, I would assume. Is that correct inMS. WILSON: Correct.31, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 QUESTION: So it -- it just seemed to me that a2 judge, being so solicitous about this crime that didn't3 carry any jail time, would -- would certainly say the one4 that does carry jail -- jail time, yes, you think you want5 to talk to a lawyer? It's okay. We'll hold it in6 abeyance and you talk to your lawyer.7 MS. WILSON: Correct. The -- the discussion8 that the court had with Mr. Tovar was very abbreviated at9 the arraignment. At the time the court gave its10 discussion, I see you're appearing here today without11 counsel, do you wish to proceed pro se, the district court12 had no idea whether Mr. Tovar was going to enter a plea of13 guilty or not guilty. And unfortunately, a defendant in14 that situation may come into a court believing that he15 does not have a right to counsel simply because he's going16 to plead guilty. Nothing that district court would have17 told him up to that point would have dissuaded him from18 such a belief.￼1920 case that21 appointed22 been made23 24 25QUESTION: Is -- is there any allegation in this the defendant didn't know he had a right to counsel for the plea? That allegation has not before, has it?MS. WILSON: No, and I do want to address that. QUESTION: Are you making it now?MS. WILSON: I am indicating that the record32, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 simply doesn't show whether the defendant had any2 knowledge of the right to plea counsel, and3 unfortunately --4 QUESTION: No, but that's not an issue in this5 case, is it?6 MS. WILSON: It is and -- and the -- the State7 did say that this issue was not addressed in the Iowa8 Supreme Court. And it may be an error on my part I did9 not raise it as a denial of counsel case. But in fact, in10 the brief filed before the Iowa Supreme Court and the Iowa11 Court of Appeals, I did raise the fact that Mr. Tovar was12 not informed that he had a right to plea counsel, that the13 only discussion of the right to counsel at that plea14 hearing was in the context of the right to counsel at15 trial he was waiving.16 QUESTION: But in any case, you -- you didn't17 cross petition and you didn't raise this in the brief in18 opposition I take it.19 MS. WILSON: Correct.20 QUESTION: We're -- all of this -- it goes back21 to a prior conviction not his most recent one I take it,22 and all the facts we're talking about were at -- those23 associated with the prior conviction, not this more recent24 one.2533, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼MS. WILSON: Correct.1 The -- the reason that the issue of whether he2 was informed of plea counsel is important is because that3 is the first requirement for a valid waiver of counsel.4 The first requirement is an intentional relinquishment of5 a known right. This means that a defendant must be made6 aware that he has a constitutional right. According to7 Miranda v. Arizona, the only way to ensure that is to tell8 the defendant that he has the right.9 QUESTION: All right. So if we agree with you10 about that, the thing to do is send it back.11 MS. WILSON: Yes.12 QUESTION: Is that right?13 MS. WILSON: Yes.14 QUESTION: And they can decide it.15 MS. WILSON: Correct, Your Honor.16 QUESTION: I mean, we can't decide it. I mean,17 we could decide it but I guess it's not really fairly18 raised, is it?19 MS. WILSON: Correct. That -- that is an option20 for the Court, Your Honor. Correct.￼21 2223 you know,24 the lower25QUESTION: Send it back.QUESTION: Do we usually do that, send -- say, search the record for other possible failures of court --MS. WILSON: No, Your Honor.34, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: -- that haven't been raised and then send the thing back?MS. WILSON: No, Your Honor.QUESTION: Why should we do it here?MS. WILSON: Again, it -- it was raised below.Unfortunately, the Iowa Supreme Court did not directly address it. And it is part of the waiver analysis.QUESTION: Well, but you didn't cross -- as Justice Souter --MS. WILSON: No.QUESTION: -- you didn't cross-petition.MS. WILSON: No.QUESTION: You didn't put it in your brief inopposition.MS. WILSON: No.QUESTION: Well, I guess if we just -- what we'd normally do here is we say -- suppose we didn't agree with your -- on your basic argument. We say, well, you lose on that one. Now we send it back from appropriate proceedings, whatever is appropriate. I don't know. At that point, I guess you'd go back to the Iowa court and you'd say you didn't address this other issue which I had in my brief.MS. WILSON: Correct.QUESTION: Is there a reason we can't do that?35, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425I don't know.MS. WILSON: No, Your Honor. There -- there'sno -- I don't see any reason why this Court couldn't do that.QUESTION: The -- the Court usually remands for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.MS. WILSON: Correct.QUESTION: And -- and if the Court just addresses what's before them, whether the sentences that Mr. Stewart read to us whether the -- if the Court decides it, that's not what the Constitution requires, then it vacates or reverses and remands and Iowa could take it from there.MS. WILSON: Correct, Your Honor, but the -- the point at which the Iowa Supreme Court did decide is -- is still a valid point, that regarding whether there needs to be a brief discussion regarding the usefulness of counsel and the dangers of proceeding pro se.QUESTION: So how do you deal with the question that was posed that it raises a false hope, and if you tell a defendant a lawyer might know defenses that you don't know, but wouldn't the defendant then ask the judge, Judge, would you please tell me what those defenses might be?MS. WILSON: And then the appropriate response36, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 from the court would be, I can't advise you. I'm not your2 attorney. If you believe anything I've said here raises3 some doubts, speak with an attorney. Otherwise, we could4 proceed with the guilty plea if you wish.5 QUESTION: But the attorney is going to cost me6 $200 an hour. Give me a break. Let me know whether it's7 going to be worth it or not. And the judge will say,8 sorry, I can't say anything about that.9 MS. WILSON: That's exactly correct, Your Honor.10 QUESTION: You ought to know that attorneys are11 useful. That's -- that -- do you think that's a12 considerable help? You ought to know that attorneys are13 useful?14 MS. WILSON: It at least indicates that the15 defendant has been given some warning regarding how an16 attorney may assist him. And again, the -- the ABA says17 that the fact that you just merely tell a defendant that18 he has a right to counsel, it doesn't necessarily help.19 QUESTION: Was it in this case that the judge20 told the defendant he was not entitled to free counsel21 because he was dependent on his parent where he was going22 to Ames or something like that?23 MS. WILSON: That was at the sentencing hearing.24 Mr. Tovar did make an application for court-appointed25 counsel that was denied because he was dependent upon his37, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 parents as a college student.2 This case essentially falls into a -- a gap3 between Patterson and Faretta. Both of those cases4 require some discussion regarding the usefulness of5 counsel and the dangers of proceeding pro se. The Iowa6 Supreme Court attempted to fill that gap by requiring7 these particular admonishments. But these admonishments8 reflect the core responsibility of defense counsel at a9 plea proceeding and also are responsibilities this Court10 has recognized in previous cases.11 QUESTION: Do you know any other jurisdiction12 that has required such a -- a litany of warnings before a13 plea could be accepted?14 MS. WILSON: Specific litany? No. I do believe15 Pennsylvania rules do provide a -- a six-point litany, I16 believe.17 But I would direct the Court's attention to the18 brief filed by the National Legal Aid and Defender -- yes19 -- National Legal Aid and Defender Association in this20 case that outlines the various requirements in both the21 circuits and the States. The majority -- about half of22 the jurisdictions in this Nation have not discussed this23 particular issue, waiver of counsel at a plea proceeding.24 Of those that have, the majority have either required or25 preferred a Faretta type colloquy for waiver of counsel at38, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425a plea proceeding. All the Federal circuits that have discussed this issue have applied that standard. 18 States --QUESTION: You say applied that standard. You mean imposed it as a constitutional requirement?MS. WILSON: Have either required or preferred a discussion of the dangers of proceeding pro se at a plea proceeding.QUESTION: When you say preferred, what do you mean by that?MS. WILSON: It -- the failure to use those particular standards may create a rebuttable presumption, but the other factors in the case may show that a defendant did validly understand or did understand the right to counsel.QUESTION: And did the -- you're talking about now Federal courts of appeals?MS. WILSON: Federal circuits.QUESTION: And -- and they held this as a matter of Federal constitutional law?MS. WILSON: I -- I believe so. I believe the Ninth Circuit did.QUESTION: Any other circuits?MS. WILSON: I can't remember off the top of my head. Again, I would -- I would direct the Court's39, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 attention to that brief.2 Only 10 States that have considered this issue3 do not require a Faretta type colloquy. Some of those do4 use the -- the plea colloquy.5 But I guess it -- it's -- this issue, though it6 hasn't been directly addressed in the brief, but obviously7 it's a concern of the States whether this may have8 retroactive effect or whether it's prospective effect as9 far as its effect on recidivist statutes. Mr. Tovar would10 argue that these standards, if adopted, could be applied11 prospectively because they do create a new rule. Although12 they are certainly inspired by Patterson and by Faretta,13 these particular admonishments are not required by those14 cases, and again, those cases do not address the15 particular context of a plea proceeding.16 It --17 QUESTION: In your brief, Ms. Wilson -- let me18 make sure I've got the right one. Yes. In your table of19 authorities, you have a number of cases from this Court20 and then you have a number of State cases which seem to be21 mostly Iowa cases.22 MS. WILSON: Correct.23 QUESTION: And then you don't cite any Federal24 -- Federal cases such as the ones I presume you were25 referring to. Was there some reason, if -- if they40, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425support you, why you didn't put them in your brief?MS. WILSON: It was a cooperative effort betweenmy office and the National Legal Aid and Defender Association.QUESTION: And which one dropped the ball? (Laughter.)MS. WILSON: I -- I can't honestly answer that,Your Honor.But even assuming other jurisdictions do not usethese particular standards, the burden upon the State will be alleviated for a number of reasons.First, if for example, Iowa wanted to use a guilty plea from another jurisdiction for enhancement, a defendant would have the burden of proof on a collateral attack. If these standards were not used, that may create a presumption that the waiver was invalid. However, the State could certainly attempt to prove the validity of the waiver through other means.In addition, if the other jurisdiction does not use these standards -- some of the claims are simply going to be time-barred. For example, in Iowa after direct appeal, there is a 3-year window of opportunity for a defendant to apply for post-conviction relief. So Mr. Tovar, who did not apply for a direct appeal of his guilty plea and did not for a post-conviction relief, would be41, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 time-barred from challenging it now.2 The --3 QUESTION: Now, what if under -- under Iowa law4 you have a case like the present one? When this case --5 the -- Tovar pleaded -- rather, he -- he pleaded not6 guilty. He went to trial, didn't he? And supposing that7 the prior conviction is 4 years old, can he not challenge8 that under Iowa law when he appeals as -- as an enhancing9 factor?10 MS. WILSON: Do you -- can you rephrase the11 question. I'm not quite sure.12 QUESTION: Yes. What -- what I'm concerned13 with, take the -- the present case. The defendant pleads14 not guilty, goes to trial, the jury finds him guilty. And15 one of the bases for sentencing is that 4 years ago he16 pleaded guilty to a similar crime but didn't get these17 waivers. Under Iowa law, could he challenge that 4-year-18 old conviction as an aggravating -- or whatever you want19 to call it on appeal from his present conviction?20 MS. WILSON: I -- I would assume so, Your Honor.21 There's also a procedure in -- in Iowa law, Iowa Rule of22 Criminal Procedure 2.19(9) that would actually permit a23 defendant to challenge the use of that prior conviction24 prior to the sentencing enhancement. Now, the State may25 have an argument if he did not do that. Then the argument42, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 would be waived.2 QUESTION: Is there any limit on how many years3 back you go for enhancing prior convictions?4 MS. WILSON: It depends on the particular5 statute, Justice Ginsburg. In -- in Iowa for the OWI,6 it's 12 years. For domestic abuse, it's 6 years. For7 harassment, it is 10 years. There's habitual offender8 sentencing enhancement that does not contain any deadline9 for use of prior convictions.10 QUESTION: What was the sentence imposed in this11 case for the -- for the third offense?12 MS. WILSON: Third offense. It's -- the -- the13 particular sentence in this case was 180 days, all but 3014 suspended, and a $2,500 fine. The maximum permitted by15 statute would be 5 years in prison.16 Also, I do want to address a point that I17 believe Justice Kennedy raised earlier regarding how18 counsel may have been useful here given that he -- given19 that Mr. Tovar received the mandatory minimum for a20 conviction in his 1996 guilty plea.21 It is true Mr. Tovar did receive the mandatory22 minimum for his conviction for OWI first. Unfortunately,23 under the statute in effect at the time, Mr. Tovar also24 would have been eligible for a deferred judgment. This is25 something apparently the prosecutor did not offer to Mr.43, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Tovar and it's something the district court did not advise2 him regarding. It is something that had counsel been3 present, it would have benefitted Mr. Tovar who would have4 been a prime candidate for a deferred judgment.5 Also, I want to address the contention that a --6 the factual basis discussion inherent in a guilty plea7 helps to ensure that a defendant is pleading guilty to the8 correct crime. Unfortunately, that's not always the case9 and I can provide an analogy.10 Defendant is charged with forgery for writing11 checks on another person's account. The district court12 holds a factual basis colloquy with the defendant, asks13 the defendant did you make out these checks, and before14 doing this, advises the defendant that it cannot accept15 his guilty plea unless it has a factual basis to support16 the conviction. The court asks the defendant, did you17 make out these checks? Defendant says, yes.18 Minutes of testimony don't indicate whether he19 signed his name or the other person's name. The defendant20 himself does not say at the guilty plea whether he signs21 his name or the other person's name. Under Iowa law, in22 order to be guilty of forgery, a person must do an act23 purporting to be the act of another. If defendant signs24 his own name to that check, it's not forgery.25 QUESTION: Well, that would be the judge's fault44, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

WILSON: Correct.QUESTION: I mean, all you're saying is the make a mistake.MS. WILSON: Correct.QUESTION: But I mean, even if we grant what youwant in this case, judges will still be able to make mistakes.MS. WILSON: Correct, but unfortunately --QUESTION: If he doesn't make a mistake, he would know all the elements of the crime. Right?MS. WILSON: Um-hum.And unfortunately, in -- in the situation of anuncounseled defendant, as in that case, the defendant wouldn't know that he's not legally guilty, that there was no factual --QUESTION: But in this case -- this case I don't think you can raise any such --MS. WILSON: No.QUESTION: -- thing because it was a -- a blood alcohol test that did him in, and he didn't dispute the results of that test.MS. WILSON: Correct. There may have -- in an OWI case, your mostly likely defenses are going to be45, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 suppression, implied consent. Mr. Tovar didn't make any2 of those challenges in this case. He may have had them.3 QUESTION: Well, I'll ask you the same question4 I -- I asked of General Miller. If in fact the defendant5 here, Mr. Tovar, says, yes, I was guilty of driving under6 the influence and I know that the test said that and I7 don't disagree with it, what public policy is there to try8 to get him to change his mind because you might have9 suppressed some of that evidence?10 MS. WILSON: We're not attempting to make11 defendants change their mind. What Mr. Tovar and the Iowa12 Supreme Court is hoping to do is to ensure that a13 defendant knows exactly what they're getting into when14 they plead guilty, that they know that they have the15 availability of counsel and the basic services counsel can16 provide, and therefore they will be pleading guilty17 uncounseled with their eyes open.18 The -- the plea colloquy suggested -- or the19 waiver colloquy suggested by the Iowa Supreme Court is not20 unduly burdensome.21 QUESTION: Can I ask? Like the Chief, I'm --22 I'm not sure that as a matter of public policy I -- I even23 -- even like what -- what you're suggesting even if it24 were made very, very simple. That is to say, we've gone25 through the elements of the crime and you acknowledge that46, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 you've committed all of them. What you ought to know,2 however, is that if you got an attorney, he might find3 some gimmick that would allow you not to be convicted of4 this crime even though you have committed it. You should5 know that because it's your right, you know, to know that6 you can get off even where you're guilty. Now, is this7 something8 910 these are11 why isn't12 to encourage people to -- to confess. We want to13 encourage people, when they're guilty, to pay what used to14 be called their just debt to society. Why do we want to15 encourage them to -- to hire a lawyer so that they'll get16 off on a -- on an irrelevancy?17 MS. WILSON: It is doubtful that these -- these18 -- well, I'll rephrase that.19 The colloquy suggested by the Iowa Supreme Court20 is certainly not going to prevent anyone from pleading21 guilty. The State speaks of the defendant who wants to22 expeditiously accept responsibility. That person is more23 than likely going to plead guilty regardless of the length24 of the colloquy given by the court. However, what -- the25 only person that may possibly be deterred by this sort of47, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005that we really want to encourage?(Laughter.)QUESTION: So long as you've told the individual the elements, are you sure you did it, why -- that all that the State should require? We want￼1 a colloquy is the defendant who's already experiencing2 doubts as to -- to his decision of whether to plead3 guilty.4 QUESTION: Do you think it would be valuable in5 California to have somebody there to say, by the way, this6 is the second time you've stolen a chicken and if you7 plead guilty and do it again, you may go to jail the rest8 of your life? Or if you're in, say, Alaska, this seems to9 be an assault case but it's connected, in fact, with the10 charge of sexual assault. So if you plead guilty, the11 rest of your life you're going to have to be registered as12 a sex offender. Or to say, for example, if you're13 immigrant, you know, it may not seem to be important to14 you because it just happened to be hitting your child or15 something, you know, a slap or something like that, but16 you're going to be deported likely if you plead guilty.17 Would it be useful to have a lawyer there to tell them18 that?19 MS. WILSON: Absolutely, Your Honor, because the20 district court isn't necessarily required to tell the21 defendant such things and we're seeing in cases like22 Lockyear v. Andrade, Ewing v. California where petty23 offenses, because they are tied in with recidivist24 statutes, are creating life sentences. And it would make25 sense to have an attorney. If we're going to have this48, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

This assists not only the initial court in making the waiver decision as an initial decision, but it also assists any future court that may have to make a determination of the validity of the waiver.QUESTION: Well, if the Iowa Supreme Court thinks so, it could put it in the Iowa rules.MS. WILSON: Yes.QUESTION: And that -- that's how it would be. MS. WILSON: Correct. They could do that. QUESTION: In this case, the Iowa Supreme Courtis projecting what it would be law for the Nation. MS. WILSON: Correct. It was making aninterpretation of -- of Patterson and Faretta to the plea context. That's correct.49, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

MILLER: I would just pick up on -- on Justice Ginsburg's question or comment there that in terms of usefulness of counsel, there's a -- you know, we've explored a lot of difficulties and cross currents here today.
