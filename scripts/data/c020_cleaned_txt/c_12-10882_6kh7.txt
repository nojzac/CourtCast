Florida.      Mr. Waxman.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMANON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      In Atkins v. Virginia, this Court held thatthe Constitution bars executing persons with mentalretardation; that is, persons with significantlysubaverage intellectual function concurrent withdeficits in adaptive behavior with an onset before theage of 18.      Because of the standard error of measurementthat's inherent in IQ tests, it is universally acceptedthat persons with obtained scores of 71 to 75 can andoften do have mental retardation when those three prongsare met.  The statistical error of measurement or SEM isthat ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Waxman, a line has to be drawn somewhere.      And we did say in Atkins that we would leaveit up to the States to determine the standards for this3￼￼1 issue. So what's the rule we announce today? We tell2 them 70 is not okay, but 75 would be? I'm not quite3 sure. How would you announce the rule?4 MR. WAXMAN: Let me first take ­­ take some5 issue, with all due respect, with your characterization6 of Atkins. What this Court said in Atkins is not that7 we leave it to the States to establish the standards for8 the clinical condition of mental retardation.9 What you said, quoting Ford, is, "We leave10 it to the States to ­­ we leave to the States the task11 of developing appropriate ways to enforce the12 constitutional restriction that we announce."13 The rule that we advocate is ­­ and the only14 real question presented in this case is just this: If a15 State conditions the opportunity to demonstrate mental16 retardation on obtained IQ test scores, it cannot ignore17 the measurement error that is inherent in those scores18 that is a feature, statistical feature of the test19 instrument itself.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: But ­­ but we didn't ­­ we21 didn't base our decision in Atkins upon a study of what22 the American Psychiatric Association and other medical23 associations considered to be mental retardation. We24 based it on what ­­ what was the general rule that25 States had adopted. And a large number of States had4￼1 adopted 70 as the criterion. I mean, the criterion is2 what do the American people think is the level of mental3 retardation that should make it impossible to impose the4 death penalty.5 We didn't look for the answer to that6 question to the APA or any of the other medical7 associations. We looked to what the States did.8 Now, what has changed in what the States do?9 Anything?10 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Scalia, I have ­­ I11 would like to respond with four points, and I hope12 desperately I'll remember them.13 First of all, what this Court said was, this14 Court ­­ number one, it made clear, as it has reiterated15 in Miller v. Alabama and Graham v. Florida, that while a16 consensus or a perceived consensus among the States is17 important, the ultimate test is this Court's conclusion18 about what the Eighth Amendment does or doesn't allow.19 In making that determination at page 318 of20 this Court's opinion in Atkins, this Court, after21 reciting in Footnote 3 the virtually identical clinical22 definitions of mental retardation, and in Footnote 5,23 pointing out that 70 to 75 is the established cutoff for24 mental retardation, this Court said the following:25 Quote, "Clinical definitions of mental retardation5￼1 require" ­­ and it recited the three tests. "Because of2 their impairments, mentally retarded persons by3 definition" ­­ that is by the clinical definition ­­4 "have diminished capacities to understand" ­­ and it5 recited all the other disabilities that made the6 imposition of the death penalty for persons with that ­­7 excuse me ­­ with that clinical condition8 unconstitutional.9 Now, as to what the States did, the Court10 did refer to, I believe, 18 State statutes. Not a11 single one of those State statutes and not a single12 decision of the highest court of any State or any court13 in any State applied 70 or two standard deviations from14 the mean without reference to the SEM.15 The only statute that addressed it in 2002,16 when this Court decided Atkins, was Arizona, which17 expressly provided that the SEM must be taken into18 account in evaluating the ­­ an obtained IQ test score.19 JUSTICE SCALIA: The SEM being ­­ being what20 and ­­ and established by whom?21 MR. WAXMAN: The standard error of22 measurement, which is established by the creators of the23 test. It is not something that clinicians dream up.24 It's not something that is decided by the AAIDD or the25 American Psychiatric Association. It is inherent in the6￼1 test. And all clinicians are told ­­ both professional2 associations make clear, because it is simply a3 statistical fact, it must be taken into account such4 that an obtained IQ test score is actually the result of5 an obtained IQ test score, is a test band that accounts6 for the standard.7 JUSTICE SCALIA: For what purpose do they8 establish these scores? Is it for the purpose of9 determining who is so incapable of ­­ of controlling his10 actions that he shouldn't be subject to the death11 penalty? Is that ­­ is that what they're looking for12 when they establish 70 to 75? What are they looking13 for?14 MR. WAXMAN: Well, what they're ­­ they are15 looking for ­­ I mean, intelligence tests supply a ­­ I16 mean, they weren't created for the definition of ­­17 clinical definition of mental retardation. They were18 created as a ­­ in order to determine a proxy for true19 intellectual function. And therefore ­­20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.21 MR. WAXMAN: ­­ a true IQ test score ­­ I22 mean, the general clinical ­­23 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not talking about IQ24 tests in general. I'm talking about why do they pick ­­25 they used to pick 70. Now they pick between 70 and 757￼1 as the upper limit. What are ­­ upper limit for what?2 I assume it is for people who would profit from medical3 treatment. Isn't that it?4 MR. WAXMAN: There are many reasons why a5 person's IQ, that is, a person's intelligent ­­6 intellectual functioning, may be important for a whole7 variety of reasons, medical, psychological,8 developmental, and as a component of the clinical9 condition of mental retardation, the Eighth Amendment.10 Now, what intellectual ­­11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, could we just12 clarify one thing, that what you refer to as the SEM,13 that is not limited to IQ of 70, 75. That's across the14 board.15 MR. WAXMAN: I mean, the ­­ the concept, the16 statistical concept of a standard error of measurement17 has ­­ applies to all forms of testing.18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it has nothing to do19 with the death penalty and mental retardation ­­20 MR. WAXMAN: No. I mean, I'm sure that, you21 know, when Archimedes announced his principle based on22 experimental ­­ his experimental observations, he also23 recognized the ­­ essentially the standard error of24 measurement.25 JUSTICE ALITO:8May I come back to a￼1 question? May I come back to something similar to what2 Justice Sotomayor started out with. In your view, does3 the Constitution establish a State to establish any hard4 cutoff? Let's say 76. Can it do that?5 MR. WAXMAN: I think it can because that6 falls ­­ because the standard definition of prong one,7 that is, intellectual functioning, is two or more8 standard deviations below the mean.9 JUSTICE ALITO: All right. If it can do10 that ­­ oh, I'm sorry.11 MR. WAXMAN: I'm sorry. Let me just ­­ let12 me just explain. And because ­­ if ­­ if a State is13 using an obtained IQ test score as a proxy for true14 intellectual function, it has to take into account the15 standard error of measurement. And therefore, States16 like Mississippi and Oklahoma that, in fact, establish a17 cutoff of 75, in our view, is constitutional as this18 Court announced the class of individuals in19 Atkins because ­­20 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that's just21 saying ­­ I'm sorry. When you say the standard error of22 measuring, you're talking about a degree of confidence,23 right?24 MR. WAXMAN: Correct.25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And your submission91 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425is that you need to have a 95 percent degree ofconfidence.  That's what ­­ that's what the 5 gives youor do I have the numbers wrong?MR. WAXMAN: Well ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought the standard ­­MR. WAXMAN: The ­­ on a test that is normed at 100 ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.MR. WAXMAN: ­­ 70 is two standard deviations below the mean. If there is a ­­ the standard error of measurement ­­ and it's not ­­ this is not my submission. This is the universal ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know. I'm just trying to figure out what it means.MR. WAXMAN: That's exactly ­­ what it means is that someone, for example, with an I ­­ an obtained IQ test score of 71, as Mr. Hall received, has a 95 percent probability ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.MR. WAXMAN: ­­ that his score will be between 76 ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So why is 95 percent? Where does that come from?MR. WAXMAN: That ­­ that is ­­10￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: ­­ under Atkins? Why ­­ why are you picking 95 percent? Why isn't it 90 percent?MR. WAXMAN: I'm not doing any picking.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why did the other ­­ why did the ­­ the organizations pick 95 percent.MR. WAXMAN: It's been 95 ­­ it's been two standard error of ­­ two SEMs, which is 95 percent, for decades and decades, and this Court recognized that consensus, that universal consensus, in footnote 5 in its opinion in ­­JUSTICE ALITO: Which party has the burden of persuasion on the issue of IQ and what is the standard?MR. WAXMAN: So it varies from State to State.JUSTICE ALITO: I mean, what ­­ what does the Eighth Amendment require? Does the Eighth Amendment permit a State to assign to the defendant the burden of persuasion on ­­ on IQ, IQ above 75? Can they assign that burden of ­­ above 70? Can they assign that to the defendant, and if they can what is the standard of proof that the defendant has to meet?MR. WAXMAN: So I ­­ the short answer is, I believe, what I will come to is yes, so that you see11￼￼1 where I'm going. But we believe that it is entirely2 constitutional for the State to assign the burden of3 proving mental retardation on the defendant. And4 insofar as the clinical definition recognized by this5 Court in Atkins is a three­part conjunctive test, I6 think it's fair to say that a logical consequence of7 that is that as to every component the burden may8 constitutionally be placed on the defendant.9 Now, the burden with respect to prong one is10 the burden of proving significantly subaverage11 intellectual functioning, of which a true IQ score12 probabilistic piece of evidence. I don't think ­­13 JUSTICE ALITO: Why can't the State ­­14 told me that the State can establish a hard cutoff. And15 you told me that a State can assign the burden to the16 defendant.17 Now, in the case of someone who scores 75,18 is it not the case that there's roughly ­­ there's no19 more than a 2.5 percent chance that that person's real20 IQ is 70. So how does that square with any burden of21 proof that might be ­­ any standard of proof that might22 be assigned on that ­­ on that point? That's what I23 don't understand about your argument.24 MR. WAXMAN: I think ­­ let me see if I can25 explain this. First of all, we're talking ­­ I mean,12is ayou￼1 this is a man who has a 71.2 JUSTICE ALITO:   No, I understand.Okay.3 MR. WAXMAN:4 JUSTICE ALITO:5 general issue. Just hypothetically ­­6 MR. WAXMAN: As ­­ as to the general issue,7 let me ­­ let me ­­ let me state it this way: The whole8 idea behind measurement error is that you can't make a9 valid judgment that somebody doesn't have a true score10 of 70 or below if the obtained score is within the11 measurement error. And even more fundamental than that,12 the ­­ your question suggests and the State's suggestion13 suggests that diagnosing mental retardation, which is14 the constitutional inquiry, is just a probabilistic15 inquiry into a person's, quote, "true" IQ score. But16 true IQ scores themselves are a statistical concept.17 It's the score that you would get on a hypothetical test18 that had no measurement error. But true ­­ and this is19 my point ­­ true IQ is not the same as intellectual20 function and IQ tests themselves, however perfect they21 may be, don't perfectly capture a person's intellectual22 function, which is why ­­23 JUSTICE ALITO: I understand that argument.24 But that doesn't seem to me consistent with your point25 that a State can establish a hard cutoff. 76, that's13But I'm talking about the￼1 the end. You get a 76 on an IQ test, that's the end of2 the inquiry. The person does not ­­ does not ­­ does3 not qualify under Atkins.4 MR. WAXMAN: So I ­­ what I'm ­­ this ­­5 this would not be a standard I would endorse, but I6 believe that in light of the consensus test that all7 professional organizations apply that was recognized in8 Atkins, a score that is above the standard error of9 measurement of two standard deviations above the mean10 would be okay. But the point ­­ the converse point it11 seems to me is not true, which is we know for a fact12 that many, many people who obtain test scores of 71 to13 75, in fact, have mental retardation.14 And if I just may point out that in this15 case, there were six experts who fully examined Mr.16 Hall or supervised a full examination of Mr. Hall. They17 were cognizant of the IQ test scores that he had18 received. And each one of them opined without19 hesitation that he had mental retardation, functional20 mental retardation, significant ­­21 JUSTICE GINSBURG:22 MR. WAXMAN:23 JUSTICE GINSBURG:24 make a finding that he did not show adaptive behavior,25 and the district court said that that was so because all14      Retrospectively.Excuse me?The district court did￼1 of those experts that you've referred to were speaking2 retrospectively. There was no evidence of what the3 defendant's current condition was. That was ­­ I think4 it's in the Joint Appendix ­­5 MR. WAXMAN: That is correct, Justice6 Ginsburg. Now, the State trial court ruled that it7 would not accept evidence as to prongs two and three,8 but it did allow Mr. Hall's lawyers to make a proffer9 pursuant to the State's ­­ the State's agreement that10 there could be a proffer in some expeditious manner.11 And that's at Joint Appendix 158.12 We ­­ one of the two grounds that we13 appealed to the Florida Supreme Court on, in addition to14 the hard cutoff at 70, was the fact that in fact an15 expeditious proffer did not in fact permit us to put on16 all of our evidence about prongs two and three. And the17 Florida Supreme Court, and this is page 125 of the Joint18 Appendix, said: We don't need to consider that question19 because we uphold the rule in Cherry.20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what ­­ there was21 nothing that limited you to the retrospective proof.22 The ­­ the trial judge asked a simple question, how did23 the defendant adapt in prison, and quotes one expert as24 saying: "Well, I didn't test for that. I don't know25 why I didn't do it." And that same expert said that he15￼1 had, in fact, done it in other cases.2 MR. WAXMAN: You're correct. Part of the3 expeditious proffer ­­ the expeditious proffer was4 limited to the testimony of two of ­­ I believe actually5 only one of the experts who examined him and did the6 adaptive testing function, and that expert did say that7 he didn't test in prison.8 Now, as ­­ there is, again, a universal9 professional consensus that adaptive functioning is10 tested by adaptive functioning in the real world, not11 adaptive functioning that occurs on ­­ after 35 years on12 death row.13 And, in fact, we also know to a clinical14 certainty that because mental retardation is a condition15 that is both developmental and not transient, that is,16 there has to be an onset ­­ demonstrated onset during17 the developmental period, but one doesn't emerge from18 the condition of mental retardation, unlike, for19 example, mental illness.20 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you talk about the21 condition of mental disability that's involved here, I22 want to go back to something you've said in response to23 Justice Scalia. The question was along the line of what24 does it mean to have a disorder under the DSM.25 Obviously, one thing it means is that the scholars can16￼1 talk about it; that they can all focus on the same2 subject.3 Does it have any meaning other than that,4 that it ­­ it is an objective index, an objective5 characterization that certain people have a certain6 mental condition? Is ­­ is that what it means?7 MR. WAXMAN: That's exactly what it means,8 Justice Kennedy. What it means is, it is a ­­ as this9 Court recognized, it is a clinical condition, unlike,10 for example, insanity or competence. That the11 clinical ­­12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is ­­ is there ­­ is there13 any evidence that society in general gives substantial14 deference to the psychiatric profession in this respect?15 Are there any studies on that or is there anything we16 can look to to see that that's true on not true?17 MR. WAXMAN: I ­­ I'm actually not aware of18 anything that suggests that one ­­ that society doesn't19 look to professional evaluations to do this. And, in20 fact, if one looks only at Florida's system, Florida21 uses mental retardation as a determinant for things22 other than the death penalty. It uses the existence of23 the condition for educational remediation, vocational24 rehabilitation and everything. And in those instances,25 as we point out in our brief, the ­­ the Florida ­­17￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Florida does apply the standard error of measurement.And indeed ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: We have later in the week an argument about economic theories. And it's a little different because in that case, the Court ­­ it's theCourt's own jurisprudence and we have not said, ashave in Atkins, that it's up to the State.  But dothink we defer to psychiatric ­­ psychologists andpsychiatrists any more than we ­­ or any less thanto economists?we youwe doMR. WAXMAN: Oh, I think it has to be much, much, more because, as this Court pointed out, this is a clinical condition. It's a condition that can only be appropriately diagnosed by professionals.JUSTICE KAGAN: Mister ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: They change ­­ they changed their mind, counsel.

You could22 say, gosh, we're putting somebody to death, we should ­­23 we should have a 100 percent confidence level. Or you24 could say, as I take it Justice Alito ­­ Justice Alito's25 point was, well, look, the burden of proof is on the19below the mean intellectualsociety.Mr. Waxman, can I take youChief Justice asked?￼1 defendant here anyway, so a 95 percent confidence level2 seems awfully high. We should, you know, ration it down3 to 80 percent.4 So why for this purpose do we have to go5 with the test maker's determination that 5 is6 you a 95 percent confidence level?7 MR. WAXMAN: So the fact that two8 you a 95 percent confidence level is just the9 statistical fact. I take your question to be, well, why10 does ­­ you know, why do clinicians and professional11 associations use that?12 JUSTICE KAGAN:13 really my question.14 MR. WAXMAN:15 JUSTICE KAGAN:16 use it for a wide variety of purposes. The question is:17 Why does their determination that it's useful for a wide18 variety of purposes to have a 95 percent confidence19 level, why is the State stuck with that for this20 purpose?21 MR. WAXMAN: Because the whole ­­ and this22 goes to the reason that they use it. The reason that23 they use it is because of the inherent imprecision in24 testing in general, but in particular testing for the25 presence of something like relative intellectual20Well ­­ and that's notOh, I see.   I understand why they mightwhat givesSEMs gives￼1 functioning.2 There are so many ­­ it is so common for3 people who, for a variety of reasons, obtain a 71 or 72,4 in fact, to have mental retardation and because evidence5 of ­­ an evaluation of intellectual function involves6 clinically much more than a test score. I mean, look7 what happened in this case. All of the IQ tests that8 were administered, all of the Wechsler tests, were9 accompanied, because they fell within the standard error10 of measurement, they were accompanied by the11 administration of further intelligence testing for12 confirmatory purposes.13 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that what you want?14 That is, I go back to Justice Sotomayor's question.15 Start monkeying around with 95 percent. It's all over16 the law. I mean, 95 percent is a classical measure by17 scientists of when they have confidence that the fact18 that the regression analysis seems to establish is in19 fact a fact.20 MR. WAXMAN: Yes.21 JUSTICE BREYER: That is in tort law. That22 is in whether jury trials are ­­ are discriminating23 because they don't have black people on the jury. It's24 all over the law. So I assume that we ­­ you're not25 asking us to muck around with that number because I211 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425don't know what the consequences would be.  And ifyou're not, here's how we reduce it.  You give the sametest six times and now we've reduced it from 5 percent,if he's above 70 all the time, to maybe one ­­ oneone­hundredth of one percent.  Is that what you want tohave happen?      MR. WAXMAN:latter point ­­      JUSTICE BREYER:what I said?      MR. WAXMAN:the things you've said.      JUSTICE BREYER:      MR.

So am I right before the last thing, abouthow 95 percent ­­22￼1 MR. WAXMAN: You are right that 95 percent2 is just a feature ­­ is, generally speaking, a feature3 that is widely adopted as a confidence level, and it is4 particularly important here because the constitutional5 guarantee announced in Atkins is against the execution6 of persons with mental retardation. And ­­7 JUSTICE ALITO: On Justice Breyer's last8 point, before your ­­ your time expires, because I do9 think this is important. Is there not another way of10 proving reliability? Suppose ­­ what about multiple11 tests? Suppose someone is given 25 Wechsler tests and12 24 times the person scores 76 and one time the person13 scores 72. What would you deal with ­­ how would you14 deal with that in a State that has a hard cutoff?15 MR. WAXMAN: So, this is the last point that16 I wanted to get to, and I think if you ­­ that the best17 thing I can ­­ before my time runs out, I just want to18 point you to page 10, Footnote 3 of our reply brief,19 which cites the Oxford Handbook of, I don't know,20 Clinical Diagnosis or something, and we've given you the21 pages. And on those pages, it explains why when you22 have a situation of somebody who takes more than one23 test, the appropriate determinant is very much not the24 average. It is what's called the composite score. And25 the composite score is different, and, in fact, for23￼1 people below the mean, below the average, because you2 have to take into account the fact that regression3 towards the mean and also, the fact that a person who4 takes two, three, or four tests, multiple tests, changes5 the bell curve of standard deviation.6 So the example that's given in the Oxford7 Handbook is very similar to this case. There were four8 tests. They averaged at 72. The composite score, and9 there's ­­ there's a ­­ there's a statistical10 explanation for how it's arrived at. The composite11 score is 69, and the standard error of measurement is12 actually larger using a composite score.13 So that's why, as to Justice Breyer's last14 point, simply averaging obtained scores does not, in15 fact, give you a better handle. Because there are so16 few people who score significantly below the mean on17 multiple tests, what clinicians use is a statistical18 analysis that takes into account the different ­­ the19 different calculation of what a standard deviation below20 the mean is.21 JUSTICE ALITO: That's not consistent with22 my understanding of it, but I don't claim that I have a23 deep understanding of it. But what ­­ what would be24 your answer to my hypothetical? Where there are25 multiple scores that are above the hard cutoff but one24￼1 that's below ­­ and I will ask the State the opposite2 question ­­ what would you do there?3 MR. WAXMAN: Well, we know what Florida4 does, which ­­5 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what does the Eighth6 Amendment require, in your view?7 MR. WAXMAN: Well, in our view, the Eighth8 Amendment requires that if a State chooses to use IQ9 test scores as a proxy for intellectual functioning10 rather than a full inquiry into intellectual11 functioning, it cannot refuse to employ the standard12 error of measurement that is inherent in the test.13 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And if it were 76, you14 would not need to go on to adaptive behavior; is that15 your view?16 MR. WAXMAN: Our ­­ our view is that a State17 consistent with Atkins could say that if you have no18 obtained score on a valid, properly administered,19 up­to­date test that is 70 ­­ that is below 76, you20 may ­­ you may constitutionally be precluded. I think21 many clinicians would go ahead and do adaptive22 functioning and other intellectual functioning. But our23 view is that States like Mississippi and Oklahoma that24 set 76 as the cutoff do, in fact, comply with Atkins.25 May I save the balance of my time.251 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLEN WINSORON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. WINSOR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      This Court should affirm the decision of theFlorida Supreme Court because it represents a reasonablelegislative judgment and one that is fully consistentwith Atkins and the Eighth Amendment.  I would like tostart by responding to your question, Justice Alito,about what ­­ what do you do with multiple scores.  Andin fact in this case we're not talking about someone whohad one or two IQ scores.      When you look at the Wechsler test, which iswhat the Petitioner contends is the gold standard, hehad test scores of 71, 72, 73, 74 and 80.  And as weunderstand, what the Petitioner would have this Court dois to take some of those lower scores and simplysubtract 5 points from them.  That is not consistentwith ­­ with the materials that he cited in the footnotein his brief.  If you look at the example there, they ­­they do apply some statistical principles to a range ofscores, but they do not simply take the lowest score andsubtract 5 points from it.      And the logic of that, I would submit, is26￼25 JUSTICE KAGAN:So what ­­￼1 fairly obvious. You couldn't have a situation where,2 take in this case, you have an ­­ a low IQ on the3 Wechsler of 71 and a high IQ on the Wechsler of 80, and4 say at the same time that there is a 95 percent chance5 his score is between 75 and 85 and also a 95 percent6 chance that his score is between 66 and 76.7 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you want us to decide8 this case and establish the principle, the ­­ the very9 significant principle that where you have a ­­ a10 criminal defendant condemned to death for ­­ for murder11 whose scores are 71, 72, 73, 74, and 80, that's okay?12 That's all you're trying to persuade us of?13 I mean, I'm not very happy having to go14 through this in all future cases where you have somebody15 who has 69, 73, 74, 75, and 81. I mean, don't you have16 some more general principle, other than the particular17 scores in this case are good enough.18 MR. WINSOR: Well, we certainly think the19 particular scores in this case are good enough. But we20 do; we have a broader principle, which is that when you21 are dealing with things like mental diagnosis or things22 in the medical field generally, that there is good23 reason for this Court to do as it has historically,24 which is to defer to reasonable legislative judgments.27￼1 JUSTICE KENNEDY:2 you this. Suppose that the American Psychiatric3 Association and ­­ and all other professional4 associations do use the SEM. Suppose that. It seems to5 me what the State is saying here in declining to use6 that, is that it declines to follow the standards that7 are set by the people that designed and administer and8 interpret the tests.9 MR. WINSOR: Well, I have two responses to10 that. One, if the constitutional rule ­­ which we11 submit it's not ­­ but if there were a constitutional12 rule that the Eighth Amendment required Florida to adopt13 all kinds of ­­ of clinical criteria that the APA or the14 AAIDD ­­15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This is not clinical;16 this is statistical criteria with the tests you're17 relying on.18 MR. WINSOR: Well, there's two parts ­­19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You keep saying20 clinical, but the SEM is not a clinical judgment. It's21 a standard error of measurement. That's the test22 maker's.23 MR. WINSOR: Well, that's right, but Justice24 Kennedy's question as I understood it was how can25 Florida deviate from what the DSM and what the AAIDD28Well, let ­­ let me askJUSTICE GINSBURG:MR. WINSOR:JUSTICE GINSBURG:      Can I stop you there?Yes, certainly.￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425suggest are best practices. And my ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No. This has nothing todo with best practices.  It has to do with what the testgivers say is the right way to look at their tests.MR. WINSOR: Well, the ­­ the test measures published the error measurement; but it's the DSM and the AAIDD that are suggesting how many deviations that you should ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no. They're not challenging the two standard deviations; they're saying if you are going to preclude functioning abilities and the other two factors of your test based on a score of a test that says it has an SEM of 5, then you have to use the SEM. It's very different. They're not saying you have to take that number and declare that person mentally/intellectually challenged. You just have to apply the other factors.MR. WINSOR: Well, it's a three­prong test, so in any instance you would have to demonstrate the existence of all three prongs. But with respect to the ­­ the 95 percent interval, that ­­                               I thought that you don'thave to go to, under your view, you don't have to go to29￼1 the second and third standards if you ­­ on the first,2 it's 70 or below. I thought that adaptive behavior3 doesn't come into the picture, and onset4 into the picture, if the IQ is above 70.5 MR. WINSOR: That's correct,6 There ­­ it's a three­part test, and the7 community doesn't dispute that and the Petitioner8 doesn't dispute that, that to achieve a diagnosis of9 mental retardation you would have to demonstrate that10 you meet each of the three criteria.11 JUSTICE BREYER: So what is wrong ­­ this ­­12 there may be agreement among you on this. What the ­­13 what Atkins says is there are three parts, as you say.14 One part is significantly sub­average intellectual15 functioning. That's the first part. And so what you16 say is, if it's above a 70 on an IQ test, or a couple of17 them, that's the end of it. We don't go further. All18 right. What they say is, I want to tell the jury19 something, or the judge if the judge is deciding it:20 "Judge, I have an expert here. Thank you."21 Expert: "I want to tell you, Your Honor,22 that that number 70 is subject to error."23 It could be ­­ and indeed the State can do24 the same thing. If it's 68, the number 68 is subject to25 error. So if somebody measures 68 you could bring in30doesn't comeYour Honor.medical￼1 the witness, and you would say 5 percent of the time,2 it's within 5 points either way.3 I think that's all they want to do. Now,4 there could be other ways of going about it, and maybe5 you would give the same test six times with different6 questions, and that may not eliminate but it might7 reduce the possibility of error, or there may be some8 other way to do it. You call in a psychiatrist and he9 says okay; or an expert: 72, he's still. We have other10 ways. We have other ways, not just tests.11 Now, I think you would do the same thing if12 you wanted to, on the down side, I guess. And that13 might lead people not to ­­ to being executed. You see?14 And that's their position, though, I think. And they15 get to do it on the upside. All right, what's wrong16 with that? It doesn't sound so terrible.17 And anyway, the Eighth Amendment ­­ this is18 a way of enforcing the Eighth Amendment. This doesn't19 need to be, I don't think, an independent Eighth20 Amendment violation.21 But go ahead; that's the kind of question I22 would love to have some ­­23 MR. WINSOR: Sure. Well, what is wrong with24 that is that substantially, if you raise the limit to 7525 as Mr. Waxman suggested you could, that doubles ­­31￼1 JUSTICE BREYER:2 to 75. What it does is it says just what I said, and I3 don't want to repeat it. When it's there at 70, they4 call their expert, who informs the decisionmaker just5 what I said. Now, that would take a little time, maybe6 15 minutes, maybe a little longer. But that's what they7 want to do, I think. And ­­ and why not? I mean, what8 is so terrible about doing it?9 MR. WINSOR: What is so terrible about doing10 it is you would end up increasing the proportion of11 people, the number of people who would be eligible for a12 mental retardation finding.13 JUSTICE BREYER:14 are mentally retarded.15 16 1718 is no19 here.20 matter of what does it take to prove by clear and21 convincing evidence, which is a standard of proof that22 they have as a matter of Florida law. And it's a23 standard of proof they do not challenge in this case.24 And all Florida recognizes is that the best measure of25 your true IQ is your obtained IQ test score. And so for32MR. WINSOR:JUSTICE BREYER:MR.

It's a￼1 someone who ­­2 JUSTICE KAGAN: But, General, the ultimate3 determination here is whether somebody is mentally4 retarded; and the IQ test is just a part of that. It's5 a part of one prong of that ultimate determination. And6 what your cutoff does is it essentially says the inquiry7 has to stop there. And the question is how is that at8 all consistent with anything we ever say when it comes9 to the death penalty? Because we have this whole line10 of cases that says when it comes to meting out the death11 penalty, we actually do individualized consideration,12 and we allow people to make their best case about why13 they're not eligible for the death penalty. And14 essentially what your cutoff does is it stops that in15 its tracks, as to a person who may or may not even have16 a true IQ of over 70, and let alone it stops people in17 their tracks who may not be mentally ­­ who may be18 mentally retarded.19 MR. WINSOR: Well, first, with respect to20 the mitigation, this is ­­ this Atkins hearing in21 Florida is completely separate from the mitigation22 phase, and so he does still have individualized23 decisionmaking with respect to whether to ­­ to have a24 death sentence, and he's still had an opportunity to25 present all evidence ­­33￼1 JUSTICE KAGAN: But he doesn't have it with2 respect to this critical question, right? We've said3 you cannot execute somebody who is mentally retarded;4 and he says now you are preventing me from showing you5 that you're mentally retarded, because you have an IQ6 test, a part of one prong of the three­prong test, you7 have an IQ test that says that I'm not mentally8 retarded, but you know, that IQ test may be wrong. It's9 not ­­ given that you are not using a margin of error.10 MR. WINSOR: Well, with respect to the IQ11 test just being one part of the intellectual functioning12 prong, that is a very recent development and one of the13 ­­ one of the problems we have with the idea of14 constitutionalizing medical criteria is that it is15 changing. If you look at the DSM­IV which was in ­­ in16 existence at the time of Atkins ­­ the DSDM­V replaced17 it last year ­­ they said that intellectual functioning,18 the prong was defined by IQ as measured on test scores.19 JUSTICE SCALIA:20 MR. WINSOR:21 JUSTICE SCALIA:22 factors to be considered, do we? Would ­­ would the23 State have been able to refute his assertion of mental24 retardation by pointing to the fact that he is the one25 who seized the young woman, who pushed her into a car,34    General Winsor, we ­­Yes.­­ we don't allow all1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425who drove the car with his accomplice following inanother car, and who killed her, and ­­ and killedanother ­­ and killed a policeman, too, later, I guess.MR. WINSOR: Yes, sir.JUSTICE SCALIA: Could the State bring that in and say somebody who is mentally retarded enough ­­ so mentally retarded as not to be responsible and not to be subject to the death penalty certainly could not have pulled all of this off. This is not a person who is that mentally retarded, significantly mental ­­ mentally retarded.Could the State show that ­­MR. WINSOR: Well, the State certainly ­­ JUSTICE SCLIA: ­­ in refutation of ­­ ofhis mental retardation evidence?MR. WINSOR: Only adaptive functioning is aportion of the test.  So there's a three­prong test.The intellectual functioning, which historically hasbeen all about IQ until very recently.  And thenadaptive functioning talks about how people react in theordinary world to ­­ to difficult situations, and someof what you talked about may or may not be relevant tothat.      But further responding to the earlierquestion, it's not that Florida is not allowing evidence35￼￼1 that you meet prong one. It's that Florida is making a2 finding that you cannot satisfy prong one and so that's3 why you don't know the ­­4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it seems to me that,5 to follow from Justice Kagan's question, and I think6 this is a very important question, that we've been7 talking about here about the ­­ the inaccuracy, to some8 extent, of IQ scores, and your rule prevents us from9 getting a better understanding of whether that IQ score10 is ­­ is accurate or not because you ­­ we cannot even11 reach the adaptive functioning prong. You prevent it at12 the outset. And incidentally, you don't prevent it if13 it's under 65 ­­ under 70, do you?14 MR. WINSOR: Well, it's a three­prong test.15 So you'd have to satisfy all three. But with respect to16 your question about whether adaptive functioning17 evidence can affect the reading of the IQ, we submit18 that's not ­­ that's not the case. That's why they're19 discrete inquiries. And so if you have multiple test20 scores or if you have one test score ­­21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in very close cases,22 doesn't it illuminate whether or not the IQ test is23 exactly as reported or if it is subject to some decrease24 or increase depending on what the evidence of adaptive25 functioning shows.36      JUSTICE KENNEDY:read Atkins again.MR.

WINSOR: Oh, yes, sir. That's been a a part ­­ that's been a part for ­­ for decades. What is changing is the way the medical community looks at how to measure IQ or what to do with IQ. And so themodern ­­JUSTICE KAGAN: But, General, at the very least, you give somebody an IQ test, he scores a 71.

They're just arguing that we should stay where9 it's always been, which is using the SEM.10 MR. WINSOR: Well, I think what they're11 arguing is that you should ­­ you should do this, you12 should apply the SEM in the same way that clinicians do13 because that's the way the clinicians do it. And if you14 go down that road, then it is very difficult to15 understand in a principled way where ­­ where that would16 stop.17 JUSTICE ALITO: Is it the case that those18 who use IQ tests always require a 95 percent confidence19 level and always must require a 95 percent confidence20 level? Let's suppose a school on the other end of the21 IQ scale wants to identify gifted children and they say22 a child is gifted if the child has an IQ of 130 or23 above. So they say if you have an obtained score of24 130, you're in. You're in the gifted child program,25 even though there is the same percentage that would39￼1 be ­­ would be the case with respect to someone with an2 IQ of 70, that really the person is below 130. Would3 there be something wrong with their doing that?4 MR. WINSOR:5 JUSTICE ALITO:6 that do that?7 MR. WINSOR:8 the decisionmaker who is relying on the IQ for whatever9 the purpose he or she is. There is an SEM that's10 published that's a part of the ­­ of the test, but the11 decisionmaker who's relying on an IQ test score, to take12 your example about someone in a school, they can set13 that as high or low as they want to, because they might14 want to be overinclusive, they might want to be15 particularly restrictive.16 And that's one of the areas where, what17 we're dealing with here in the Atkins context is18 fundamentally different because we have an adversarial19 process, at least with respect to contested cases. We20 have a burden of proof, a clear and convincing evidence21 burden of proof that's not shared in the clinical22 setting.23 And so there are a lot of reasons why it's24 very different to make a diagnosis in a clinical25 setting, particularly now where the emphasis in the40No, Your Honor.   Do they ­­ are there placesOh, certainly.

WINSOR: Well, the State certainly hassubstantial leeway.  I think the answer to that is yes,although it would be ­­ it would be more difficult todefend because I think what you'd want to do is go backand look at the consensus that ­­ that was a part ofAtkins, the consensus that supported the decision inAtkins.      But I think before making a decision on 60as a threshold or some other number, you'd want to lookat the whole picture ­­JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I guess I don't understand it.

And what happened in this case was there wasa ­­ a motion in limine by the State recognizing thatthe ­­ that the IQ scores that were at issue here wereall above 70.  And so it was sort of an ordinaryevidentiary motion, you know, if you had a differentcase where you had to prove causation of damages ifthere was no evidence ­­43                         Yes, sir.                              Thencase.

Has theattorney general of Florida suggested to the legislatureany ­­ any measures, any provisions, any statutes, toexpedite the consideration of these cases.MR. WINSOR: Your Honor, there was a statute enacted last session, last spring, that is ­­ it's called the Timely Justice Act, that addresses a number of issues that you raise, and it's presently being challenged in front of the Florida Supreme Court.      But I would like to talk about the 95 ­­JUSTICE KAGAN:MR. WINSOR:JUSTICE KAGAN:MR. WINSOR:   General, can I just ask ­­Certainly.   ­­ why you have this policy?I'm sorry?47￼1 JUSTICE KAGAN: Why you have the policy. I2 mean, is it administrative convenience? Just tell me3 why you have the policy.4 MR. WINSOR: Well, the people of Florida5 have decided that the death penalty is an appropriate6 punishment for the most horrific crimes, like the crime7 at issue.8 JUSTICE KAGAN: No, no, no. Why you have9 the 70 threshold.10 MR. WINSOR: Well, that ­­ that's what I was11 getting at. And that ­­ and so Florida has an interest12 in ensuring that the people who evade execution because13 of mental retardation are people who are, in fact,14 mentally retarded. And if we apply the rule that the15 Petitioner has suggested, it would double the number of16 people who are eligible for the ­­ for the punish ­­ or17 for the ­­ for the exemption. And that's inconsistent18 with Florida's purposes of ­­ of the death penalty.19 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that's just to say20 that it would double the number of people eligible, but21 some of them may be mentally retarded. I mean,22 presumably we want accurate decisionmaking with respect23 to this question, don't we?24 MR. WINSOR: Well, there ­­ there ­­ we do25 certainly. And they are not mentally retarded if they48￼1 don't have an IQ of 70 or below. And that's a ­­ that's2 a position that Petitioner doesn't ­­ doesn't challenge.3 JUSTICE KAGAN: Who are not mentally4 retarded if they don't have an IQ score of 70 or below?5 I mean, you ­­ you don't believe that yourself, right?6 This is a tool to decide whether somebody is mentally7 retarded, and it's a tool that functions in one prong of8 a three­prong test.9 MR. WINSOR: It is the first prong. The IQ10 threshold is the first prong. So ­­ no matter what your11 adaptive deficits are, you must demonstrate ­­ and,12 again, here in this adversary setting, you must13 demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that you14 have an IQ of 70 or below.15 And what we believe is that if you say,16 Well, there is a 95 percent chance that my IQ is17 somewhere between, say, 68 and 78, that you have not18 satisfied that first prong.19 And I would like to talk about the 9520 percent confidence interval, because it is not the case21 that you have, say, with a 72 a 95 percent chance that22 your IQ is 70 or below. In fact, it's a very small23 chance.24 What the ­­ what the confidence interval25 measures is that you have a 95 percent chance that your49￼1 true IQ is within five points of the measured thing, the2 measured IQ, but it's not that you would have an equal3 chance of having a 66, a 67, a 68. It falls under the4 bell curve.5 And so if you take the test over and over6 again, you are going to score near the ­­ near the peak7 of that bell curve most of the time, which is where your8 true IQ would be. And at the outer ends of that 959 percent threshold are very, very small likelihoods that10 you ­­ that that's your true IQ.11 And ­­ and then with each additional test12 you take, the odds ­­ that ­­ that's above 70, the odds13 would go down.14 And so it's simply not the case that you can15 say, Well, he has a 72 so he has satisfied or even might16 have satisfied the first prong because, as a statistical17 matter, every ­­ well, as a factual matter, every18 Wechsler test he has taken that was admitted into19 evidence was over 70. He had a 71, a 72, 73, 74, and an20 80.21 And so if you want to apply statistics to22 it, you would have to look and say, well, what are23 the ­­ what are the odds that with that group of24 testing, that his true IQ is under 70?25 Now, is it possible? Certainly it is50￼1 possible that it's over 100. You know, you can exceed2 beyond the 95 percent confidence interval.3 And nobody disputes that ­­ that the true IQ4 is something that is incapable of being measured or5 incapable of ­­ and ­­ but ­­ but the IQ test is what6 the community has, and it's the most objective of the7 three prongs, which is why we believe it's particularly8 important to focus on because it's the most objective9 test that we have.10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How many States retain11 that practice with a rigid 70 cutoff?12 MR. WINSOR: Your Honor, by our count there13 are eight States that have both a hard cutoff and a ­­14 and a 70 or two standard deviations, which approximates15 to the same thing, that has been expressly recognized by16 the States. There are a number of other States that17 have statutes similar to Florida's, but that have not18 been interpreted one way or the other that ­­ that we19 may or may not ­­20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Of those eight, how many21 actually have a fixed cutoff and how many have a SEM?

WAXMAN: In State v. Cherry, which isthe ­­ the Florida Supreme Court decision thatestablished this rule that if you ­­ if your lowestscore or your only score is 71, you are out, and thatapplies whether you take one test or multiple tests ­­here I'm quoting from the Supreme Court's decision inCherry, that, quote, "It is a universally acceptedgiven, that is that the SEM is a universally acceptedgiven, and as such should logically be considered indetermining whether a defendant has mental retardation."What the Court said was: We have to read the plain meaning of the Florida statute and the Florida statute says two standard deviations.      The notion that the Florida legislature orthe ­­ may I finish my sentence ­­ the Floridalegislature or the people of Florida have made aconsidered decision not to account for the SEM isbaseless and is belied by the ­­ the legislative reportthat accompanies the statute which said 70 to 75.Thank you.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
