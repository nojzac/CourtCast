TAGGART               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MR. TAGGART:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          There are three reasons Congress did not validly10111213   Leave Act's family leave provision.  First, the FMLA is14   everyday economic legislation, a national labor standard,15   not antidiscrimination legislation, second, Congress was16   not responding to a discernible pattern of17   unconstitutional behavior, and third, even if such a18   pattern were discernible, the 12-week family leave mandate19   enforced by abrogating State immunity is not a20   proportional and congruent response.21             The Family Medical Leave Act is no different22   than the minimum wage and other national labor standards.23   It is, in its operation and effect, it is simply Commerce24   Clause legislation.25             QUESTION:  Well, but now in the statute, the31111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005abrogate State immunity when it adopted the Family Medical￼ 1   findings, or the beginning, they refer to the Equal -- the 2   Equal Protection Clause.  They say it's consistent with 3   the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,4 don't they? 5             MR. TAGGART:  Yes, they do, but they do not -- 6   Congress did not invoke Section 5 of the Fourteenth 7   Amendment, as it did in the ADA and the ADEA statutes.  It 8   told us exactly why, in the House and Senate reports, it 9   was mentioning the Fourteenth Amendment in the text of the10   statute.11          QUESTION:  Well, as applied to privateemployers, I suppose Congress had to rely on CommerceClause powers, but as applied to States, there is specificreference in the statute, of course, to section 5 -- toequal protection.121314151617181920212223   report?  I mean, the very text of the statute doesn't say,24   in order to assure equal protection of the laws in the￼          MR. TAGGART:  Yes, there is specific referenceto equal protection --QUESTION:  Yes, right.          MR. TAGGART:  -- but Congress told us why theymentioned equal protection in the House and the Senatereport, where Congress stated that if --QUESTION:  Why do you need the House and Senate25 States. That's not what it says. It says that what we're 41111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051   doing, what we're requiring, the leave that we're2   requiring, we are requiring in a manner that, consistent3   with the Equal Protection Clause, minimizes the4   protection, the potential for employment discrimination.5             I read that as saying what we're doing here is6   being done with an eye to being sure that it's in7   conformance with the Equal Protection Clause.  That's8 91011121314151617181920212223quite different from saying that we're doing it in orderto enforce the Equal Protection Clause, which is beingviolated by the States.          MR. TAGGART:  We agree with that position,Justice Scalia.          QUESTION:  But Mr. Taggart, we --          QUESTION:  But the statement in the text goes tothe manner, goes to the manner, not to the purpose at all.          QUESTION:  The first rule of statutoryconstruction is to read on, and if you read on with me --(Laughter.)          QUESTION:  --  you will find it said, to promotethe role of equal employment opportunity for women and menpursuant to such clause, to promote the goal of equalopportunity for women and men.￼               Throughout your opening brief, you never24   referred to that statute.  You told us there was only the25   (4), the one that Justice Scalia referred to, and it51111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051   wasn't until your reply brief that you even acknowledged2   that Congress has said, we're doing this to promote the3   goal of equal opportunity for men and women.  Why didn't4   you mention (5) in your opening brief?5             MR. TAGGART:  Well, why we didn't mention (5),6   I -- I apologize if we did not -- if we did not mention7   it, but the -- the Senate report and the House report8   describe exactly why Congress was talking about equal9   protection.          QUESTION:  Well, one would look to the statutebefore one looks to the House or the Senate report.1011121314   everyday Commerce Clause legislation.  Congress was deeply15   concerned that the Family Medical Leave Act itself would16   be challenged on equal protection grounds, and that's why17   it said it was promoting the goal of equal employment18   opportunity.  Everything else about the statute, the way19   it operates, the economic benefit that it provides, the20   fact that it doesn't prohibit discrimination at all, show21   that this is nothing different from the minimum wage, and22   that -- that is what -- that is what this -- this was23   adopted in the tradition of.24             QUESTION:  Mr. Taggart, I -- I thought the25   reason you didn't refer to the reference to equal61111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          MR. TAGGART:  Yes, that is correct, but theoperation of the statute clearly shows that it is just￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9opportunity for men and women is that that is not areference to the Equal Protection Clause.          QUESTION:  Pursuant to such clause --          QUESTION:  People -- people -- people --individuals could fail to provide equal -- equalopportunity for men and women without violating the EqualProtection Clause.          MR. TAGGART:  That's true, but the --          QUESTION:  The -- the statute says, pursuant tothe Equal Protection Clause.10111213141516171819202122   discriminate against people of that gender.  So what I23   take that to mean is that, without this, State employers24   as well as others tend to say to the woman, You go take25   care of your sick mother, and because employers know that,71111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          MR. TAGGART:  Well, it does say that, but in ourview, it is more important to look at the operation andthe text of the amendment, and how -- how the -- or of theact, and how the act works.          QUESTION:  Why?  If you're looking at the text,then just a few lines above, in the text, where it talksabout findings, it says that, due to the nature of theroles of men and women, primary responsibility for familycare-taking often falls on women, and then it saysemployment standards that apply to just one gender haveserious potential for encouraging employers to￼ 1   they won't hire women.  That's what it says in (5) and 2   (6), and I would have thought that sounded like equal 3   protection of the laws, as if this statute is designed to 4   help remove one of the major reasons why employers 5   discriminate against women.  That's what (5) and (6) says, 6   and then the -- 10 lines down it says, pursuant to the 7   Fourteenth Amendment. 8             MR. TAGGART:  Well, Justice Breyer, the 9   statement here, in our view, indicates why Congress10   adopted a gender-neutral statute.  If it adopted a gender-11   specific statute, the statute itself would have been12   subject to challenge under the Equal Protection Clause.13             Our -- our concern here is that any everyday14   economic legislation that may have a disparate benefit to15   one suspect classification or another will all of a sudden16   be -- have the power to abrogate Eleventh Amendment17   immunity, and then State immunity will be subject to18   abrogation at -- at any expense where Congress deems that19   Commerce Clause legislation is appropriate.  Congress20   should not be allowed to do indirectly what it's21   prohibited from doing directly.22             QUESTION:  Mr. Taggart, would you comment on23   this argument, which I think is really an elaboration on24   the findings in the purpose statement that Justice Breyer25   was referring to.81111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1             I think you can distill those statements down to 2   something like this.  We know for a fact historically 3   that, whenever burdens of family responsibility are 4   allocated, they are allocated to the woman, not to the 5   man.  If we do not have an employment standard that 6   expressly says you have got to treat them exactly alike, 7   the women will always get the short end, and that will be 8   reflected in hiring decisions, among others. 9             Secondly, in order to make this determination a10   practical one, we can't simply leave it that whatever you11   do for men you should do for women, or vice versa.  We've12   got to put some kind of a threshold there that will mean13   something, and so we've come up with a particular period,14   a particular number of weeks.  That's the only way to make15   this work.  I think that is the argument that is based, in16   effect, on these two sections.  That doesn't sound to me17   like simply an end run, a phony Commerce Clause argument.18   Would you comment on that argument?19             MR. TAGGART:  Well, even if that were true, even20   if that effect occurred from the statute, the failure, the21   utter failure of the statute to satisfy this Court's City22   of Boerne test shows that it is purely economic23   legislation.  There were absolutely no findings by24   Congress regarding State conduct, or whether State conduct25   was unconstitutional, and it's difficult to discern from91111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   the record before this Court or -- 2             QUESTION:  Well, given the fact that we have 3   accepted in prior cases the pervasiveness of the 4   phenomenon that seems to be quite clearly reflected in the 5   findings and purpose, is that necessary here to say, well, 6   yeah, it -- we've already said, the Supreme Court has 7   already accepted its pervasiveness, but we've got to go a 8   step further and say, well, yeah, that pervasiveness even 9   goes to States.  Isn't there a point at which the point10   has been made?11             MR. TAGGART:  Well, first of all, if that were12   true, then any law that Congress passes that has any13   arguable fact on discrimination based on gender would be14   sufficient for satisfying an abrogation of State immunity.15 In 1993 --16             QUESTION:  Well, we can't -- what about the17   Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer decision, where the Court18   unanimously found Title VII was a valid abrogation of the19   Eleventh Amendment immunity, and there was no inquiry into20   the history of gender discrimination, it was just21   accepted?  Do you think that that case would stand up22   under your analysis?23             MR. TAGGART:  Yes, it would.  There -- or we24   would take the position that it would.  There is --25             QUESTION:  Because this is rather similar.101111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1             MR. TAGGART:  Well, there is no requirement, and 2   we are not urging the Court to adopt a requirement that 3   Congress make findings.  Congress simply helps the Court 4   when it makes findings about what it is -- whether there 5   is unconstitutional State behavior that would justify a 6   12-week family leave benefit that's abrogated by State 7   sovereign immunity.  But Title VII is closely hewed to 8   this Court's section 1 jurisprudence, and there's every 9   reason to believe that Title VII would stand up to the10   City of Boerne test.  So the difference with this statute11   is that there is absolutely --12             QUESTION:  Mr. Taggart, I thought that part of13   your argument was, if the discrimination doesn't exist14   anymore in the State, even if it did at one time, then the15   provision would have to sunset, and as far as Title VII is16   concerned, many States, the vast majority of States have17   their own Title VII laws, so at this point in time I18   guess, under your reasoning, Fitzpatrick and Bitzer would19 have to go.20             MR. TAGGART:  Well, we are not arguing that21   position and, in fact, in our view Title VII is so closely22   hewed to this Court's section (1) jurisprudence that it --23   it -- there's every reason to believe that it would24   satisfy this Court's test.25             In -- in -- in this case, though, the question111111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   is, in 1993 was there a pattern and practice of State 2   behavior that would justify a 12-week mandatory family 3   leave benefit for all State employees that's -- that's 4   enforced through abrogating State immunity, and the5 standard -- 6             QUESTION:  What was the -- in the title of Title 7   VII what was the pattern and practice that justified that 8   result, because when the original Title VII was passed 9   this Court had never declared any law that differentiated10   on the basis of gender unconstitutional, and when it was11   extended to public employees -- was it in '72? -- this12   Court had just begun to address the issue.13             MR. TAGGART:  Yes, that --14             QUESTION:  And yet the Court said Congress could15   do that in '72 with no special record of any kind.  The16   record, to the extent it existed, was made for race, not17   sex.18             MR. TAGGART:  Well, we're not challenging Title19   VII in this case.  We're challenging that in 1993, when20   the --21￼               QUESTION:  But she's asking you to distinguish22   Title VII from this.  We know you're not challenging it.23 24 25          MR. TAGGART:  Well, in our view --          QUESTION:  What about the fact that Title VIIgoes to discrimination on the basis of sex in general, and121111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   there was no doubt that States have engaged in that and 2   were engaging in it at the time.  You could have said it 3   was -- it was general knowledge.  But the statute we're 4   construing here doesn't go to sex discrimination in 5   general, it goes to a very particular type of sex 6   discrimination, and that is in the granting of leave, and 7   on that, at least I can't say as a matter of general 8   knowledge that the States were in violation of provisions 9   of leave.  I've no idea what the state -- what the state10   was.  Certainly you -- you need evidence to show that they11   were violating that particular aspect of -- of -- of equal12   protection.13             MR. TAGGART:  Well, in order to show a pattern14   and practice in 1993 it's this Court's section (1)15   jurisprudence on violations of the Equal Protection Clause16   that governs, and Washington v. Davis, incorporated into17   the gender cases through State Administrators v. Feeney,18   is a test which requires purposeful and invidious19   discrimination.  There's no showing that there was a20   pattern and practice of State managers in 1993 of using a21   gender stereotype when they granted leave.22             QUESTION:  Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, because if23   you accept, I take it, you accept the proposition that24   Congress has sufficiently shown, as far as anyone need do,25   that State employers discriminated in their hiring against131111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1   women, the gener -- you accept that, is that right?2   That's your -- your -- your -- your, for -- because if3   that's not so, I guess goodbye to Title VII, a whole bunch4   of things, but is -- do you accept that?5             MR. TAGGART:  Well, Title VII, and the circuits6   have said this already, is that Title VII is so closely7   hewed to this Court's section (1) --8             QUESTION:  No, I'm not asking you to distinguish9   Title VII.  I'm asking you if, for purposes of this case,10111213141516171819202122232425you accept the proposition that it is adequately shownthat State employers, like a lot of other employers, diddiscriminate against women in hiring people, in general.          MR. TAGGART:  If --          QUESTION:  I'd like a yes answer or a no answer,if I could.          MR. TAGGART:  Well, a qualified yes if you'retalking about 1972, when --          QUESTION:  Okay, so at the time of this statute?          MR. TAGGART:  Not at the time of this statute.          QUESTION:  Oh, okay.  You do not accept theproposition that it is adequately shown that Stateemployers discriminated against women when they passedthis law?          MR. TAGGART:  No, and even if there was a --          QUESTION:  Okay.  No, then, I don't see the141111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1   distinction with Title VII.  It's goodbye if I accept that2   argument, I think.  It's just that it was earlier?          MR. TAGGART:  No, it's that title -- it'sunclear whether Title VII even prohibits things that thisCourt's section (1) jurisprudence wouldn't also prohibit.34567   said in Washington v. Davis.  It allows a give-and-take in8   the courtroom of the evidence to -- to flesh out theTitle VII basically codifies what this Court 9   totality of facts that surround an employment activity,10   and at the end of the day in the Title VII lawsuit an11   inference can be made of whether purposeful discrimination12   actually occurred.  It allows a defense not based upon13   heightened scrutiny or strict scrutiny.  It allows just a14   simple defense by the employer.15             Unlike the Family Medical Leave Act, which just16   takes away any defense at all for States to defend the17   policies that they have, that it doesn't even elevate18   State policies to a heightened scrutiny standard, but in19   1993 State policies were gender neutral, and under this20   Court's section (1) jurisprudence those policies should be21   subject to a rational basis review.  But instead, the FMLA22   just makes all of those policies unlawful.  Any policy23   that doesn't have 12 weeks of leave is simply unlawful.24   It doesn't give the State the ability to come in and prove25   that that policy was -- was applied --151111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼6 7 8 9weeks, the damages are capped, it's simple to operate --          MR. TAGGART:  But --          QUESTION:  I would think that that is much moreproportional and congruent than the other statute that I          QUESTION:  Suppose you have two statutes, one isa congressional statute that says, all States must haveemployment and pay policies that do not differentiate on1234   the basis of gender, and the second is the FMLA.  It seems5   to me that the FMLA is much more limited.  It's just 1210   described.          MR. TAGGART:  Well, the -- this statute, inour -- our position is is not proportionally concurrent,because first, there's no pattern of State behavior that11121314   would justify a 12-week leave benefit.  But to completely15   make unlawful any act, any State policy that's less than16   12 weeks would require a substantial showing that States17   were engaged in discrimination in the employment, in￼18   employment practices.19             QUESTION:  Why?  Why?  Because if you imagined,20   and you won't concede this, but I think, take it as a21   hypothetical, then, if you imagined that State employers22   had been shown to discriminate against women in hiring,23   wouldn't Congress have quite a lot of leeway in choosing24   the remedy for that discrimination, and wouldn't this25   statute be part of the remedy?161111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051             MR. TAGGART:  Absolutely.  If your2   hypothetical --3             QUESTION:  So in other words, if it's4   absolutely, then the answer as far as you see it in this5   case is whether there has been an adequate showing that at6   the time of this statute State employers discriminated7   against women in hiring, and if the answer to that8   question in your view is, there was an adequate showing,9   this is an appropriate remedy, but if the answer in your10   view is, it wasn't an adequate showing, then, of course,11   you would win.  That's how you're basically seeing the12   case.13          MR. TAGGART:  Well, I don't want to agree withyou 100 percent, but -- but the --1415161718192021222324   there had been a violation shown.  Isn't that what your25   brief said?171111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005(Laughter.)￼          QUESTION:  I would think your-- your brief --your brief agreed with him zero percent.MR. TAGGART:  Well --(Laughter.)QUESTION:  Your -- your --MR. TAGGART:  We didn't --QUESTION:  Under your brief, the answer is quiteclearly no, you don't think it's proportionate even if 1             MR. TAGGART:  Well, the hypothetical was, if 2   there was enough of a showing, and I think that's the 3   question.  We argue there was no showing, which would 4   justify no remedy, but even if there was a showing, the 5   remedy has to be proportional, and this 12-week leave 6   benefit just goes far out of proportion of any discernible 7   pattern of conduct by States which would justify it. 8             QUESTION:  Mr. Taggart, there have been scores 9   of Title VII cases where there's a nice, neutral standard,10   and then there's a decision maker, and the decision maker11   is exercising discretion under these general standards.12   And time after the time, the decision maker is duplicating13   himself, whether race, sex, and the people who don't look14   like the decision maker say, gee, we suspect15   discrimination.16             There have been countless Title VII suits that17   have prevailed on that, that the standards are nice and18   neutral, but the discretion whether to hire is made by19   someone who is coming up with results that exclude these20 people.21             Now, do you think that State employers, that the22   people who do hiring and promotions for States are so23   nonbiased, so unprejudiced that that doesn't affect the24   decision makers on the State level, as opposed to the25   municipal level, and in private employment?181111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1             MR. TAGGART:  Our position is that the 2   presumption has to be that States act in a constitutional 3   manner, and I'm not going to stand here before the Court 4   and say that States are perfect, but there's certainly no 5   pattern which would justify a 12-week mandatory family 6   leave benefit enforced through the abrogation of State 7   immunity.  This -- the FMLA is simply not based upon 8   any -- any pattern of State conduct. 9             The Congress knew in 1993 that 30 States had10   laws just like the Family Medical Leave Act.  Congress11   wasn't thinking about whether States were violating law12   and whether States needed to be corrected.  Congress was     trying to supplement what States were already doing with     the leave benefit.13141516   by the States.  Several States had human rights laws long17   before there was any Federal law.  At least as to thoseQUESTION:  In Title VII, too, the lead was taken￼1819202122232425States Title VII should not have been valid legislation,should it?          MR. TAGGART:  Well --          QUESTION:  Because there was no sign that theywere not at least as good as the Federal Government.          MR. TAGGART:  Well, Title VII is, in our view, a-- a -- clearly, a law that's clearly antidiscriminatory.It doesn't -- it isn't -- wasn't adopted for Commerce191111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   Clause purposes, and in our view in this -- the Family 2   Medical Leave Act is just a round peg being forced into a 3   square hole.  It's not -- wasn't adopted with the 4   operation -- with the idea of acting like 5   antidiscrimination legislation.  It, in fact, would 6   completely allow for discrimination.  It would -- and that 7   wouldn't be prohibited by the law at all. 8             QUESTION:  Okay, if they had passed this statute 9   without the 12 weeks in it, and the statute had simply10   said, on family leave decisions, the decisions have got to11   be the same, the standard for making them has got to be12   the same, whether the employer, employee is a man or a13   woman, would that be constitutional?14             MR. TAGGART:  Well, that --15             QUESTION:  Under section (5)?16             MR. TAGGART:  Well, certainly that would sound17   more like an antidiscrimination law that would require18   leave, if it's granted --19             QUESTION:  Okay.20             MR. TAGGART:  -- to be granted on a gender21   neutral basis --22             QUESTION:  Now, the difference between that case23   and this -- I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to interrupt you.24             MR. TAGGART:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.25             QUESTION:  I was trying to get in another201111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   question before Justice Scalia did. 2             (Laughter.) 3             QUESTION:  The difference between the case I 4   just put to you and the case that we've got here is 12 5   weeks, and I suggested that one reason for the 12 weeks is 6   a decision on the part of Congress that if we don't put 7   some period of time, some threshold period of time, our 8   nondiscrimination standard isn't going to be worth9 anything.10             For example, just outside this case, the States11   could say, okay, we're going to give a 1-week maternity12   leave, men or women.  Obviously, that isn't going to13   accomplish anything.  So Congress says, we've got to have14   some kind of a threshold in order to make this requirement15   of neutrality really work.  Why is that not a reasonable16   way to get to the point which I think we both agree would17   be a perfectly lawful exercise of power under section (5)?18             MR. TAGGART:  Well, first on the latter part, a19   prohibition or a requirement for gender-neutral leave20   would -- for -- if leave is allowed, it must be allowed on21   a gender-neutral basis, I would still argue that that22   would be, that would require some predicate of a pattern23   of unconstitutional behavior, but --24             QUESTION:  Okay.  We'll take that as a given.25   You don't concede that.211111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼          MR. TAGGART:  Okay, but on the 12 weeks point,this Court would have to assume, without any indicationfrom Congress, that that's why it used 12 weeks, because1234   that is not why it used 12 weeks.  12 weeks --5             QUESTION:  How many States are covered by the6   act?7 8 9          MR. TAGGART:  Well, at the time the act wasadopted --QUESTION:  Yes.MR. TAGGART:  -- 30 States had family leave1011   laws.121314151617181920212223   propounded.  It's clear that the 6 weeks was designed for24   the 50 States, never mind the hundreds of thousands of25   private employers.  Does that seem plausible?221111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          QUESTION:  How many are covered by the act?  Tohow many States does the act --MR. TAGGART:  Every State is covered by the act.          QUESTION:  50 of them.  How many privateemployers are covered by the act?￼MR. TAGGART:  Every private employer.MR. TAGGART:  Yes.  Yes, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Yeah, like how many do you think thatis, hundreds of thousands?          QUESTION:  And the 6 weeks was adopted with the50 States in mind, is the argument that's being 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   applied to private industry?  Isn't that a fair argument? 9             MR. TAGGART:  No, because it's not so simple as10   to draw the conclusions about the society in general11   directly to States and impute States with unconstitutional12   behavior without presuming first that States act in a13   constitutional way.14             QUESTION:  No, I recognize that you're not15   conceding the -- the -- the point that a predicate for16   applying it to the States, even a -- a -- a non-6-weeks17   antidiscrimination has been shown, but if we assume that18   point is past, then is the argument, is the19   appropriateness of the means somehow categorically20   different for States from the appropriate --21   appropriateness of the means with respect to private22   employment?MR. TAGGART:  No, and it -- first it's --          QUESTION:  Doesn't it seem plausible, however,that the period of time was designed in view of thepervasive history of discrimination in and out ofGovernment, and that it is just as applicable when it isapplied to the Government, just as reasonable orunreasonable, however you come out, as it is when it's￼23 24 25          MR. TAGGART:  Well, it's our view that the twoquestions can't be split, that -- that the State conductis so critical that -- that it -- the answer cannot be231111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051   derived from saying that if -- if there's this conduct in2   general, then 12 weeks fits both State and non-State3   actors.  The -- the 12-week benefit was not designed at4   all by Congress to target unconstitutional conduct.  It5 6 7 8 9was designed to give children 12 weeks of childdevelopment time with their parents when they're born.          QUESTION:  Insofar as the statute applied toprivate employers, could it possibly have been directed atunconstitutional conduct?          QUESTION:  I presume --MR. TAGGART:  It may be possible, but -- but101112131415161718   constitutional question.  Isn't the question whether it's19   directed at discriminatory conduct?  Isn't that the basic20   question?any --          QUESTION:  But the real question is whether it'sdirected at discriminatory.QUESTION:  At discriminatory conduct.￼21 22 23 24 25          MR. TAGGART:  Well --          QUESTION:  Or do you concede it is directed atdiscriminatory conduct.          MR. TAGGART:  No, we do not concede that it'sdirected at discriminatory conduct.241111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          QUESTION:  If it's private discrimination, it'snot constitutional; if it's State discrimination, it is a12345678   please.910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Taggart.          Ms. Pillard.          ORAL ARGUMENT OF CORNELIA T. L. PILLARD                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MS. PILLARD:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court:          The Family Medical Leave Act is an appropriateresponse to enduring problems of State sex discriminationbias against women in hiring and promotion becauseemployers assume that women are more likely than men toleave their jobs to go take care of their family members,and bias against men in the dispensing of family leave.          Congress gathered ample recent evidence of thesemutually reinforcing problems, and Congress also built ona known foundation of State laws and decisions fosteringdifferent roles for men and women in work and family.Those different roles and beliefs about them persist.251111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          QUESTION:  But if it were directed atdiscrimination, discriminatory conduct, that would embraceboth the States and the private employers, wouldn't it?          MR. TAGGART:  Well, that -- we do not concedethat point, because Congress did not have any predicate onwhich to base the direction of this onto the States, andI'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal,￼ 1             Offering a threshold amount of leave to men and 2   women alike is responsive to the problems.  The act has 3   successfully encouraged more men to take the leave, and in 4   narrowing the gap between men's and women's leave rates, 5   the act erodes the very basis of employers' bias against 6   women.  If you will, it makes men and women equally 7   unattractive. 8             (Laughter.) 9             MS. PILLARD:  The act also responds to10   discrimination against men in the dispensing of leave.  A11   bare prohibition against discrimination doesn't do that12   and, in fact, the bare prohibition against discrimination13   in the dispensing of leave had been in place.  That's14   Title VII, and that, for the generation during which Title15   VII applied to the States, that had not succeeded in16   eradicating sex-based dispensing of leave, and in the real17 world --               QUESTION:  Sex-based dispensing of leave by the               MS. PILLARD:  By the States.￼1819   States?202122232425          QUESTION:  Well, what statistics are there thatsupport that statement?          MS. PILLARD:  Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like tohighlight four aspects of the evidence of sex-baseddiscrimination in leave specifically about the States.261111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051             First, Congress learned of the pattern of State2   granting leave through the Bureau of Labor Statistics'3   figures.  In 1987, 50 percent of women in State and local4   government, as compared to 30 percent of men in State and5   local government, were offered parenting leave.  Yale also6 7 8 9did a 50-State survey to which --          QUESTION:  Excuse me, what --          QUESTION:  You know, I presume to get parentingleave you have to be a parent, and it doesn't seem to methat that -- that is a terribly instructive statisticunless it -- it's shown that equal numbers were parents,or equal numbers applied.          MS. PILLARD:  The statute --10111213141516171819202122   is not rates of people taking.  This is rates of people23 24 25who had it available.          QUESTION:  Who had the opportunity to take it?          MS. PILLARD:  Should they choose, yes, and the271111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          QUESTION:  Could you tell me what, before we goon with the discussion, what you mean by, were offeredparenting leave?￼          MS. PILLARD:  Parenting leave was available tothem in their State --or not?QUESTION:  Was available, whether they took itMS. PILLARD:  Whether they took it or not.  This 1 2 3 4 5 6   evidence.  Yale did a 50-State survey to which 36 States 7   responded, and 19 of those States themselves said they 8   offered parenting leave to women and not to men under 9   their policies.10             QUESTION:  Well, that's 19, 19 out of 50 States.11             QUESTION:  Excuse me, when you say parenting --12             QUESTION:  Let her respond to my question.13             (Laughter.)14             MS. PILLARD:  That's 19 out of the 36 responded15   that themselves admitted that they -- they had these16   policies.  The president of the labor union that17   represents State employees said, the vast majority of our18   contracts really cover maternity leave.  They're not --19             QUESTION:  Exactly, and that explains the20   discrepancy.  I'm trying to figure out -- what you're21   saying is that some States provided for maternity leave,22   but did not provide any leave for the father, but that's23   quite a different thing.24             I mean, does one have to think that parenting25   leave, which is the ability to go home and take care of a281111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005Bureau of Labor Statistics is very clear on that.          QUESTION:  How -- how could that be?  TheStates' laws were written in such a way that --          MS. PILLARD:  The States' laws and the States'policies, and this is confirmed by other pieces of￼1   child, is the same as allowing a woman who's just gone2   through childbirth some leave to recuperate from the3   childbirth?  I don't think that proves anything at all.4 5 6 7 8 9It just proves that some States had a policy of maternityleave, and presumably if, you know, if one of their maleemployees gave birth they'd give him maternity leave, too.(Laughter.)          MS. PILLARD:  Justice Scalia, let me clarify,each of these studies and all the figures that I'm citing10   are not talking about pregnancy disability leave.  We're11   talking about maternity leave over and above pregnancy12   disability leave, so we're talking about whether it's13   unconstitutional for a State to assume that women and not14   men can appropriately go home and take --15             QUESTION:  I thought we were talking about the16   medical leave act here.  We're not talking about17   parenting, are we?18             MS. PILLARD:  We're talking about both.  Part of19   the medical leave provision allows parents to take care of20   their seriously ill children as well as their spouses or21   parents, and Congress saw these as part and parcel of the22   same phenomenon.23             QUESTION:  Did any State have parenting leave24   laws which say, we just want you to have time to take care25   of your family, which applied only to men -- only to women291111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1 2 3 4   leave.  I consider that a different category entirely. 5   Were there any States that had parenting leave, time to 6   take care of your family, that applied only to women and7 not to men? 8             MS. PILLARD:  Justice Scalia, each of these 9   States, when they called it maternity leave, the important10   distinction is that it encompassed but was not restricted11   to a period of pregnancy disability.12             We're talking about, for example, in our lodging13   appendix at page 31, the Rhode Island agreement that14   applied from 1992 to 1995.  In provision 13.7, maternity15   leave is available for up to a year, without regard to16   pregnancy disability.  Another example at page 47, 48 of17   our lodging, maternity leaves not to exceed 6 months, but18   may be extended, and paternity leaves are available for 319   months, so someone -- a woman can take a maternity leave20   up to a year without a showing of maternity disability,21   and a man can take 3 months.  And on page 40 of the22   lodging, again the Pennsylvania agreement says that women23   can take a period of 6 months, and it may be extended for24   6 months, no provision for a man who is so inclined and25   who wishes to do so, to go take care of his infant child,301111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005and not to men?          MS. PILLARD:  Yes, all --QUESTION:  I know plenty of States had maternity￼ 1   and I think these stereotypes are very alive and well 2   today, and the act was -- 3             QUESTION:  Kind of the successor of the man 4   going down with his babe in arms to ask for an excuse from 5   jury duty and they said, would tell him no, you don't get 6   any excuse, but you give excuses to women.  Yes, because 7   women take care of children.  I take care of children. 8   That's the same thing. 9             MS. PILLARD:  It's precisely these assumptions10   that have caused State employers and other employers to11   discriminate against women in hiring, promotion, and12   retention, and against men in the dispensing of leave, and13   these are really two sides of the same coin.  And the act14   is working.  In the 5 years that were studied from 1995 to24 25          QUESTION:  And why couldn't Congress have solvedthat problem adequately by simply prescribing that noState shall discriminate in -- in the -- in the giving of2000, there was a jump from approximately 14 percent to 211516171819202122   problem.23￼percent of the percentage of male --          QUESTION:  Would the act be any less valid if wewere to conclude it weren't working?          MS. PILLARD:  No, but I think the point is thatthere's an ongoing problem, and that Congress was correctin discerning that this was really at the core of the311111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1 2 3 4 5 6 7   women.  Why -- why wouldn't that have been a proportionate 8   response to -- to the defect that they had found?  Why -- 9   why did the Federal Government, in order to solve the10   problem, have to impose upon the States 12 weeks, just11   pulled out of the air, 12 weeks, this is the solution to12   this constitutional problem?13             MS. PILLARD:  Justice Scalia, that prohibition14   was already in place from 1972, and the problem also is15   that a bare prohibition against discrimination cannot16   respond to discrimination against men in the dispensing of17   leave, because in the real world a facially neutral policy18   without a threshold leave entitlement really equates to a19   discretionary practice of dispensing leave tainted by20   stereotypes about who should need it.21             QUESTION:  I don't understand what you said.22             MS. PILLARD:  Even if employers do not23   affirmatively provide for any leave, they equally have a24   no-leave policy for men and women that is formally equal.25   In the real world, some workers ask for leave and some do321111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005-- of family leave?          MS. PILLARD:  Justice Scalia, Congressalready --          QUESTION:  No maternity leave, kind of no Statecan have maternity leave as a separate category, and allfamily care leave must be offered equally to men and￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6   discretion?  You -- the supervisor cannot discriminate on 7   the basis of sex.  I think what you're saying is that 8   without this 12-week period, many men just wouldn't take 9   the leave.  That's probably right, but then many men10   wouldn't necessarily take the 12-week leave either, if11   it's available.12             MS. PILLARD:  Many men would be deterred, if13   they didn't have an affirmative right to take the leave,14   by the assumption that their employers would not grant15   them leave if they requested it, by the assumption that16   they would be retaliated against in the employment process17   if they took it, because it is still much more18   unacceptable for men to take family leave than for women.19             QUESTION:  Let me ask this question about the20   operation of this law in light of our recent cases on the21   Eleventh Amendment.  Is it your understanding that becauseget family leave, but by leaving it up to supervisordiscretion we open the door --QUESTION:  But there's --MS. PILLARD:  -- to discrimination.QUESTION:  But where -- is it supervisor￼22 23 24 25of the exercise of the Commerce Clause power, that theStates are bound by this law --          MS. PILLARD:  That's right.          QUESTION:  -- to grant the leave?331111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1             MS. PILLARD:  That's right, Justice Kennedy. 2             QUESTION:  So all we're talking -- and -- and do 3   you think that State attorney generals like -- probably 4   Mr. Taggart would be the better one to ask that 5   question -- would tell their Governors and their officials 6   you are bound, by law, to grant the family -- to follow 7   the Family Medical Leave Act? 8             MS. PILLARD:  So the question is, why damages? 9   Once Congress has found a problem, a serious problem of10   unconstitutional discrimination, that we assert exists11   here, the standard remedy to enforce rights in the12   employment context is make whole monetary relief, the13   centerpiece of which is lost wages.  Title VII uses141516171819202122232425damages, the Equal Pay Act uses damages, and here, in theFamily Medical Leave Act, these are limited damages.Congress took great care to ensure that they wouldn'toverburden the States --          QUESTION:  I understand that, but it seems to meif there's a big problem you can have an Ex Parte Youngsuit or, if the Government just is -- the United States isconcerned about this, the Government of the United Statescan intervene, and why isn't that wholly adequate --          MS. PILLARD:  Congress determined --          QUESTION:  -- to enforce this law?          MS. PILLARD:  Congress considered very carefully341111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   that damages were needed, and limited the damages. 2   They're just enough to spur enforcement and not burden 3   employers, including the States.  You need money damages 4   to make sure cases get the attention of higher-ups in 5   State government as well as in private industry. 6             States at the highest levels may be fully 7   responsive, but the application of stereotypes is 8   typically at the lower level of the supervisor with 9   hiring, promotion, and assignment discretion, the line10   supervisor in the State university, in the State hospital,11   in the State troopers, in the State human services12   agencies, like where Mr. Hibbs worked, and without the13   clear commitment by Congress that a threshold of family14   leave is going to be made available not on an ad hoc15   basis, not according to supervisor decisions about who16   really needs the leave, but because Federal law requires17   it as a remedy for past discrimination.  Only then will18   that message really reach the line supervisors who are19   making these decisions.20             So I would emphasize that the act is working,21   the damages are limited, and the problems at which it aims22   are clearly unconstitutional, and petitioners are just23   wrong that there was no evidence in the legislative24   record.  Congress clearly identified the problems, the25   problems of the States as on a par with problems of other351111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   sectors. 2             Congress was well aware of the body of recent 3   judicial decisions, finding State sex discrimination in 4   employment.  We've included some illustrative examples in 5   our brief at footnote 23.  The United States has included 6   some examples of the most recent cases in their brief at 7   note 15 and, as I was discussing before, Congress learned 8   of the patterns of States granting leave to women but not 9   to men, and Congress saw the family medical issue as part10   and parcel of the parenting leave issue.  These were all11   responsibilities, family care responsibilities12   traditionally performed by wives.  And so Congress aimed13   in subsections (a), (b), and (c) at a common problem of14   employers' assumptions of women taking leave burdening15   their employment prospects, and employers' assumptions16   that men did not need the leave, hindering their ability17   to take it, which in turn exacerbates the discrimination18   problem against -- against women.19             So denial of employment opportunity to women and20   of family leave to men are two sides of the same coin.21   Congress clearly identified the problems, had facts22   showing that they continued.  Nearly every State, until a23   generation ago, overtly placed discriminatory restrictions24   on womens' workforce participation.  That history --25 QUESTION: A generation ago. How many years is 361111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   a generation? 2             MS. PILLARD:  Well, when Congress was acting in 3   1993, it was only 20 years since Title VII had been 4   extended to the States, and less than that since this 5   Court had adopted heightened scrutiny of sex-based 6   classifications based on the recognition that public 7   agencies have a -- have a tendency to rely on overbroad 8   sex-based generalizations, overbroad sex-based 9   classifications, so it was -- it was only since the 1970's10   that we started to recognize that discrimination that we11   had previously seen as benign, as often intended to help12   women, was really hindering their advancement, and to --13   and to seek to try to dismantle that system.14             QUESTION:  And the changes in the unemployment15   and Workers' Compensation laws, those persisted.  Wasn't16   the Wengler decision in 1980?17             MS. PILLARD:  That's right.  We have18   decisions --19             QUESTION:  And States all have that kind of one-20   way law, where the woman did not -- if the woman wage21   earner died, then her husband got nothing because she was22   not considered really an equal worker.23             MS. PILLARD:  Really her wages were24   supplemental.25             QUESTION:  And that went on till 1980.371111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1             MS. PILLARD:  That's exactly right, and we have2   the beginning of a process of dismantling this3   discrimination.4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Pillard.          Mr. Dinh.               ORAL ARGUMENT OF VIET D. DINH         ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT UNITED STATES          MR. DINH:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and mayit please the Court:          The Family and Medical Leave Act is just onepart of a broader statutory scheme to eliminate sex-basedemployment discrimination in the hiring, retention,promotion, and granting of leave benefits for both men andwomen, and that's the key point to emphasize here.Congress was acting not simply to remedy discrimination inleave-granting policies, but more fundamentally Congresssought to remedy and prevent sex-based employmentdiscrimination based on impermissible presumptions aboutthe role of women in the home and the role of men in the1011121314151617181920   office.21QUESTION:  I --￼          QUESTION:  In our cases, is there any differencebetween Congress' prohibiting something under its section5 power and creating a substantive entitlement under that22232425   power?381111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051             MR. DINH:  I have not seen a distinction in the2   cases, in the section 5 cases of this Court.  They are few3456   distinction is not readily made.  One can characterize the7   entitlement here as simply a prohibition on discrimination8   for men and women who take leave.  It is simply an -- 9101112131415161718192021222324          QUESTION:  No, it isn't, it's 12 weeks.          QUESTION:  -- entitlement to come back to a job.          QUESTION:  Well, it's a 12-week period.          QUESTION:  It says you get 12 weeks, and if --if we approve this, we are establishing the propositionthat in order to eliminate, to enforce any of theprovisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, but in particularequal protection, the Government may establish whateversubstantive requirements might further equal protection,and I just don't know where the Government plucks 12 weeksfrom and says that it -- we have to stop discrimination,and therefore everybody's entitled to 12 weeks of leave,and it's an extraordinary leap.          MR. DINH:  Your Honor, I disagree that there isno limiting principle here, and the limiting principle isprecisely provided by this Court's jurisprudence inand far between, as you can --          QUESTION:  Uh-huh, right.MR. DINH:  -- as you can appreciate, but the￼25 congruence and proportionality. That's precisely the 391111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   limiting principle as to what is the constitutional 2   violation that Congress seeks to redress, and whether or 3   not the remedy is congruent and proportional. 4             The constitutional violation here that Congress 5   seeks to redress or to prevent is employment-based 6   discrimination based upon presumptions about leave-taking 7   habits of men and women. 8             QUESTION:  And was that the big fight in the 9   statute?  Is that what was really going on when this 12-10   week -- I mean, I -- I was around at the time, and I11   remember the big -- the big discussion was whether there12   ought to be a Federal law that requires all employers, not13   States in particular, but all employers to give all14   workers 12 weeks of family leave if they wanted it.  That15   was what all the discussion was.  I didn't hear any16   discussion at the time of sex discrimination, and you17   present it to us as though this was the motivating factor18   of the legislation.  I find that hard to believe.19             MR. DINH:  Your Honor, I was not there at the20   time, and I --21             (Laughter.)22             MR. DINH:  But I will take your word for it, but23   more importantly, I think we should take Congress' word on24   its face.  Congress says at 29 U.S.C. 2601(b)(5) that the25   purpose of the, one of the purpose of the statute is,401111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   quote, to promote the goal of equal employment opportunity 2   for women and men pursuant to the Equal Protection Clause, 3   and the further evidence -- 4             QUESTION:  Justice Scalia is right, is he not, 5   that it -- the bill that he's talking about was the '87 6   bill, and that didn't say anything about the Equal 7   Protection Clause, and that's the startling difference 8   between the bill that actually passed in 1993. 9             MR. DINH:  That's precisely right, Justice10   O'Connor -- I mean, Justice Ginsburg.  Justice Scalia was11   talking about S. 249, the 1987 bill.  The first time that12   the section (5), the promotion goal that entered into the13   statute was in the next iteration, H.R. 925 in the House,14   in 1987, and concurrent with the insertion of the15   promotion of equal opportunity, Congress also included the16   provision for family leave for care of parent illnesses,17   as opposed to simple -- simply children illnesses.  And so18   there is some concurrency with respect to Congress'19   reliance on, for the first time, section (5) authority and20   the grant of family leave, and that's consistent with the21   legislative record that was before Congress.22             Congress was facing a situation where it was23   finding more two-worker families entering in the workforce24   and increased demand for family care in the workforce, and25   it said that, based upon the evidence, as Justice Souter411111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1   had summarized, that when push came to shove, women would2   be expected to take leave to take care of the family, and3   Congress was finding that push was, indeed, coming to4   shove, and was adopting a remedy that was directly5   proportional and congruent to the period of constitutional6   violation.  It adopted a gender-neutral entitlement to7 8 911             MR. DINH:  Your Honor, I'd -- that would be a12   more difficult case.  I do not think that --13             QUESTION:  6 weeks?  Would 6 weeks be14   proportional?15161718   of --19leave so as to eliminate the underlying presumption thatthis Court has said is impermissible.               QUESTION:  Would 24 weeks have been10   proportional?          MR. DINH:  It would -- the -- the -- I do notthink that this Court's jurisprudence on proportionalityhas fine -- is so finely tuned, and this Court's lack￼          QUESTION:  Of course, that jurisprudence cameafter the statute was enacted anyway.202122232425   weeks.  Of course, if it is more an increase, then it          MR. DINH:  And I do not think that this Court'sevaluation of congressional enactments under section (5),the unique remedial powers of Congress under section (5),would turn on whether it's 10 weeks or 12 weeks or 13421111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051234   length.  That's the point I was getting to.  I can't5   imagine that it would turn on the length.would be less proportional, if it is less, then it wouldbe more proportional.QUESTION:  I agree that it shouldn't turn on the 6             QUESTION:  Perhaps Justice Scalia should ask 7   this question, but I was just wondering -- 8             (Laughter.) 9             QUESTION:  -- if you have to get to the --10             QUESTION:  Pass it to me.  I'll --11             (Laughter.)12             QUESTION:  You have to get to the 1993 version13   of the statute to introduce the equal protection notion,14   and it's interesting to me that precisely the same remedy15   was provided after the equal protection became an16   ingredient of the problem as was provided before the equal17   protection rationale was introduced.18             MR. DINH:  You mean, that same remedy, you mean19   number of weeks?￼QUESTION:  The same 12-week period.  Wasn't that2021 true? 2223   first time that the family leave was introduced and the24   first time the section (5) authority was invoked was in25   H.R. 925, and there were differing leave times for431111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MR. DINH:  Not exactly, Your Honor.  H -- the 1   different provisions. 2             I believe there was one that for section (d), 3   for the personal disability, it was 24 weeks.  Some was at 4   6 weeks.  It turns out that when Congress passed this 5   statute, a prior version of which was 1990, 1991, and this 6   version in 1993, it pretty much reached the equilibrium of 7   12 weeks.  This is the normal give-and-take of the 8   legislative process, and nowhere in this Court's 9   jurisprudence --10             QUESTION:  And this was the statute that was11   repeatedly vetoed, as I remember it, the bill, by12   President Bush, and the basis for the veto had nothing to13   do with discrimination, that it really was based on the14   length of the provision.15             MR. DINH:  No, Your Honor, you are right, the --16   I have reviewed the veto statements.  They concern the17   imposition that these types of policies would have on18   small businesses and the economy of the United States,19   rather than on the discrimination provisions at issue.20   But it's clear that Congress, in passing the statute, was21   relying on the discrimination, discriminatory effects that22   these types of leave policies would have on women.  And I23   think the crux of this case, if I may, turns exactly,24   Justice O'Connor, on your comparison with the evidence25   that was before Congress when it enacted Title VII, when441111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   it extended that, when it included that into the gender. 2             As you may recall, this Court in, I believe in 3   Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, recounted the legislative 4   history of how gender entered into Title VII, and it was 5   entered there as the legislative equivalent of the poison 6   pill in order to attempt to kill Title VII, and so not 7   much evidence was put into the record regarding gender 8   discrimination, and yet, as you noted in 1976, in 9   Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, this Court assumed that that was10   adequate in order to invoke section (5) authority, or11   justify section (5) authority.12             QUESTION:  Do -- do you want us to say that13   before the Family Medical Leave Act was enacted there was14   a discernible pattern of intentional and purposeful15   discrimination by the States in violation of the Equal16   Protection Clause with reference to the granting of leave?17             MR. DINH:  There was evidence, with respect to18   the granting of leave, of such discrimination in the19   record before Congress, yes, Your Honor, but in addition20   to that, there was a discernible pattern of employment21   discrimination that this Court had taken judicial notice22   of and Congress had before it and, in particular, Congress23   has evidence of employment discrimination based on leave-24   taking presumptions that this Court has found to be25 illegal.451111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  I guess you're thinking under thisCourt's cases, which we accept as a given, Congress wouldhave more leeway to create a remedy for the generaldiscrimination than it might have if the discrimination,that if the leave discrimination were at issue?          MR. DINH:  It goes into both the --          QUESTION:  You think there's enough for both,but the remedial power is greater, is that right?          MR. DINH:  There's no question that under the --under Kimel the Court has said that difficult, intractableproblems often require more powerful remedies, and thatwould certainly be the, how the Court would evaluate --1011121314151617   enlightened policies.  That's what the record shows, and          QUESTION:  It's hard for me to see there's adiscernible pattern of intentional and purposefuldiscrimination when in the legislative history of this actthe States were cited as being in the forefront of￼you're up here arguing just the opposite.          MR. DINH:  Your Honor, some States were in the18192021222324   Honor.  I would refer Your Honor to the United States25   brief at pages 36 to 40, and also the brief for the461111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005vanguard, some States were laggards in the granting ofleave policies.QUESTION:  But the latter was not mentioned.MR. DINH:  Yes, there -- yes, it was, Your 1   petitioner at pages 29 through 30, which recounts some of 2   this -- some of this evidence. 3             The key here -- but nevertheless, the statement 4   in the record that you noted was about States' leave 5   policies, whether or not they had leave policies at all. 6   We know 30 States had -- had leave policy.  The position 7   of the United States rests upon not whether States had 8   leave policy, but the character of such leave policies. 9             QUESTION:  Mr. Dinh, would it violate this10   statute for a State to provide the 12-week family leave to11   men and women both, but also to continue a policy of 6-12   week maternity leave?  Would that violate the statute?13141516171819202122232425          MR. DINH:  In addition to a 12-week, Your Honor?          QUESTION:  In addition to the 12 weeks.          MR. DINH:  6 weeks, if I can characterize the 6weeks not as maternity leave, but as pregnancy disabilityleave --          QUESTION:  Call it pregnancy disability leave.          MR. DINH:  Well, this is actually a matter ofquite -- quite good -- quite --          QUESTION:  What's in a name?          MR. DINH:  No, no, it is a matter of substance,not form alone, because pregnancy disability, medicallyand in insurance terms --          QUESTION:  No necessity to prove disability,471111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314   would -- that may very well violate Title VII.  It would15   not violate this particular statute.just, if you have a child, you're entitled to 6 weeks off.          MR. DINH:  If you are --          QUESTION:  You don't have to prove that youcan't walk, or anything else, just, if you have a child,you have 6 weeks off.          MR. DINH:  If --          QUESTION:  Would that violate this act?          MR. DINH:  If the grant of the additional 6mean --weeks is on a sex-based basis --          QUESTION:  Well, it is.  It's maternity.  I(Laughter.)MR. DINH:  If that is the case, then that￼QUESTION:  Would it violate the Equal Protection1617   Clause?1819   Equal Protection Clause if it is above and beyond the20   pregnancy disability leave that this Court has recognized21   can be accommodated, unconstitutionally though --22             QUESTION:  That would solve the problem, unless23   your answer is categorically yes, it would violate it,24   because then the discrepancy, the 30 percent versus 8025   percent that we're talking about would continue.481111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MR. DINH:  Yes, it may very well violate the 1             MR. DINH:  Well, the -- the key here, Justice 2   Scalia, is that after the period that is recognized as 3   pregnancy disability, and therefore constitutional under 4   Geduldig, beyond that, parental leave, infant care leave 5   is simply parental leave, and there's no difference 6   whether the mother or the father takes care of the child. 7             Indeed, the law would not countenance such a 8   difference, because that would be relying on the very 9   presumptions that the law condemns.  And so the key here10   is that if there is an additional grant of leave to either11   sex beyond the period of pregnancy disability, that would12   constitute a violation of Title VII.  It would notconstitute a violation of the FMLA.          The reason for that is very simple.  The FMLA13141516   scheme.  It supplements and does not supplant Title VII.17   It paints a little bit more broad -- more broadly than18   Title VII in the sense that it grants affirmative leave19   rights, but in one further, in one important respect it20   paints very much more narrowly, as your -- as your21   question to my colleague, Mr. Taggart, had indicated,22   Justice Kennedy.  That is because it is very narrowly23   tailored to the particular problem that Congress was24   facing, which is the problem of employment discrimination25   based on leave-taking propensities.  And so in that sense491111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005was enacted as part of the overall antidiscrimination￼ 1   it is perfectly congruent to the constitutional problem 2   that Congress was addressing. 3             Congress could not very well have addressed the 4   problem of gender-based differentials and the presumptions 5   in law and in practice that arise from those differentials 6   by granting additional leave rights only to women, or 7   granting leave rights only to men that would perpetuate 8   the discrimination and the presumptions, rather than 9   eliminate it root and branch.10             The key to the money damages is the same key as11   it is in our general antidiscrimination statutes.  That12   should not be a surprising -- Title VII has the same type13   of damage remedies, and the reason for that is that14   discrimination, whether it be for race or for gender, is15   pervasive and pernicious and historically recognized by16   this Court, and so Congress has made a judgment that it17   needs as many hands on deck as possible in order to18   enforce the effort to eradicate discrimination, and money19   damages is part of the normal remedy in order to ensure20   that plaintiffs are made whole and State actors are21   deterred from acting unconstitutionally or, in this case,22   in violation of the section (5) legislation that is at the23   -- the -- at issue here.24             The fact that -- if I may return to the point25   that the fact that it should not be surprising that this501111 14th Street, N.W.

Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005distinguish that paternity leave and leave for childbirthand when a child is adopted is not the question that waspresented to this Court today.￼          The question presented to this Court is familyleave, and there's certainly no record of family leavedifferentials, as has been argued with respect toparenting leave, and second, it is not possible under anyjurisprudence of this Court to simply presume that State 1   to simply presume that State managers are using some -- 2   some outdated stereotype in making their decisions. 3             The third point I want to make is, it's our 4   position that one who reads the text and the history of 5   the Family and Medical Leave Act would hardly recognize 6   the statute that has been described here today.  This was 7   simply every-day economic legislation, and upholding the 8   FMLA would simply tear section (5) from any remedial 9   moorings by allowing a general legislative power of10   Congress to grant economic benefits so long as there is11   some incidental benefit to some suspect class.12             QUESTION:  You mean holding, upholding money13   damages under the FMLA, because I take it you concede, or14   don't you, that Nevada is bound to follow this law?15             MR. TAGGART:  Since -- I do concede that, and16   since 1993 Nevada has had a -- a State policy of giving17   our workers Federal family medical leave.  We also have18   our own State medical leave laws, so States have joined,19   and have actually led the Federal Government in providing20   family leave for their employees, and to simply say, and21   ignore that -- that pattern and say instead that States22   are engaged in a pattern of discrimination, or were23   engaged in 1993 in a pattern of discrimination, in our24   view does not stand up to any of this Court's section (1)25   jurisprudence.521111 14th Street, N.W.
