HURD                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. HURD:  Justice Stevens, and may it pleasethe Court:               Our Virginia cross-burning statute protects a     very important freedom, freedom from fear, and it does so12   without compromising freedom of speech.  Our statute does13   not ban all cross-burning, only cross-burning used to14   threaten bodily harm.  And unlike the ordinance in R.A.V.,15   our statute does not play favorites.  It bans16   cross-burning as a tool of intimidation by anyone, against17   anyone, and for any reason.  Surely, for all the reasons18   why we can ban threats of bodily harm, 100 times over we19   can ban this exceedingly virulent weapon of fear.20             QUESTION:  Mr. Hurd, I -- there's one part of21   the statute that may be troublesome, and that is the prima22   facie evidence provision.  I suppose you could have a23   cross-burning, for instance, in a play, in a theater,24   something like that, which in theory shouldn't violate the25   statute, but here's the prima facie evidence provision.31111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 2000510 11￼12345678   rule of evidence.  It says that a burning cross may be9   presumed to mean what we all know it ordinarily does mean,Would you like to comment about that, and in the process,would you tell me if you think it's severable, or what'sthe story on that --          MR. HURD:  Justice O'Connor, I would like tocomment about that. There are three major points I wouldlike to make.First is the inference is simply a common sense10   a threat of bodily harm.  And so it says no more than whata prosecutor could argue if the inference were not there.          QUESTION:  And the jury is instructed11121314151617   judge?18accordingly by the judge?          MR. HURD:  The jury is not required to accept.It's --￼QUESTION:  No.  Is the jury so instructed by the          MR. HURD:  Where the inference is given, yes,Your Honor, it -- it is so instructed, and was soinstructed in -- in the Black case, though not in theElliott case.19202122232425   the appendix.  The instruction is a burning cross --41111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          QUESTION:  Do we have the instruction that wasgiven in the Black case?MR. HURD:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  It appears in1             QUESTION:  What page?  Are you talking about the2   joint appendix?3             MR. HURD:  Yes, Your Honor.4             QUESTION:  And where would that be?5             MR. HURD:  Instruction number 9 in the joint6   appendix.  I apologize for the delay.7 8 9          QUESTION:  Well, maybe you -- maybe you shouldtell us later, and proceed.          MR. HURD:  On page 146.  The burning of a crossby itself is sufficient evidence from which you may inferthe required intent.101112131415   purely permissive inference.  The prosecution retains the16   burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that there was17   an intent to intimidate.          QUESTION:  It didn't say that they -- it justsaid the positive, that they could make such an inference.MR. HURD:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  It is a￼18             QUESTION:  In this -- in the particular cases19   before us, what evidence, other than the burning itself,20   was there to show intimidation?21             MR. HURD:  What we had in the case of -- of22   Barry Black was he heard that -- he's from Pennsylvania,23   and he heard that down in Carroll County, blacks and24   whites were holding hands on the sidewalk.  And so they25   came down.  He came down, and they had this event.  They51111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   chose a spot near an open stretch of highway where they 2   erected a 30-foot cross.  That's as high as these columns. 3   And they burned it at night with a loudspeaker and talk 4   about taking a .30/.30 and randomly shooting blacks. 5             QUESTION:  Now, was that -- did that intimidate 6   everyone who drove by in their passenger vehicle or -- 7   let's put it this way -- racial minorities who drove by in 8   their passenger vehicle?  All of those were intimidated? 9             MR. HURD:  Whether or not there was actual10   intimidation of minorities who drove by was not clearly11   established by the record.  There was evidence in the1213141516171819202122232425record that a black family did drive by, pause, saw it,and took off at a higher than normal rate of speed.          QUESTION:  Yes, but surely they were in no fearof immediate violence, and our -- our Brandenburg line ofcases says there must be an element of immediacy --          MR. HURD:  Justice Kennedy --          QUESTION:  -- before you can punish speech byreason of its content.          MR. HURD:  Brandenburg was an incitement case,not -- not a threat case, although there was across-burning in Brandenburg --          QUESTION:  Well, then if I -- if I have apicture of a burning cross, and I -- and I give it tosomebody, that's --61111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1             MR. HURD:  No, Your Honor.  There has to be a -- 2   a burning cross.  In Brandenburg -- 3             QUESTION:  Isn't that because there's an 4   immediacy element to the threat? 5             MR. HURD:  Well, we believe, Your Honor, that -- 6   that if you read into the -- the threat jurisprudence an 7   immediacy element, then -- two points I would make. 8   Number one is that you would -- you would 9   constitutionalize threats when someone said, I'm going to10   kill you, but it won't be for a little while.  Surely that11   can't be the case.  A threat, say, against the President12   would be constitutional so long as the -- the time when13   the threat was going to be delivered was delayed.14             QUESTION:  Well, that -- that may be -- that may15   be a different -- so -- so in your view if a burning cross16   is just put on a hill outside of the city, everybody in17   the city can be deemed intimidated?18             MR. HURD:  Not necessarily, Your Honor.  The --19   the burning cross carries not merely a message of20   intimidation, but -- a -- a threat of bodily harm, but a21   threat of bodily harm soon to arrive.  Now, the --￼22 23 24 25          QUESTION:  Why doesn't Virginia just have astatute making it a crime to threaten bodily harm that'ssoon to arrive --          MR. HURD:  Well, we --71111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005123456789   may.  Again --QUESTION:  -- burning cross or not?          MR. HURD:  We could have such a statute, YourHonor, but the -- the availability of other options doesnot mean the option we have chosen is unconstitutional.          QUESTION:  Do other States have criminalstatutes that have the broad-based intimidationprohibition that I've just described?MR. HURD:  Your Honor, some -- some very wellQUESTION:  I have not found one.101112131415   down side to having a broad statute, and it is this.  That16   whenever you prohibit a proscribable category of speech,17   there will be a -- a zone of protected speech that looks a18   lot like the proscribed category and in which people must19   be somewhat careful or they may be arrested mistakenly, as20   happened with Mr. Watts in the Watts case.21             QUESTION:  I thought the key here is that this22   is not just speech.  It is not just speech.  It's action          MR. HURD:  Respectfully, that -- that eventwould not -- would not be the test we believe establishedby this Court in R.A.V.Moreover, Your Honor, there's a -- there's a￼23 24 25that -- that is intended to convey a message.          MR. HURD:  It is --          QUESTION:  Surely -- surely your State could81111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   make it unlawful to brandish -- brandish an automatic 2   weapon with the intent of -- of intimidating somebody, 3   couldn't it? 4             MR. HURD:  Justice Scalia, we -- we have 5   statutes that prohibit brandishing of firearms.  In fact, 6   a -- a burning cross is very much like a brandishing of a 7   firearm. 8             QUESTION:  That's your point. 9             MR. HURD:  It is virtually -- it is virtually10   a -- a present offer of force.  That makes it an11   especially virulent form of -- of intimidation.12             Let me, if I may, come back to Justice13   O'Connor's point about the inference.  Justice O'Connor,14   you asked whether the inference could be struck down,15   severed.  We believe the answer to that question is -- is16   absolutely.  If this Court were to decide it was17   problematic, under Virginia law, as we cite in our briefs,18   it is -- it is severable.  We have a general severability19   statute in Virginia so that if the Court were not to agree20   with us that this inference is constitutional, it should21   not declare the entire statute invalid, but should sever22   the inference and remand these cases for further action.23             QUESTION:  Well, just to make it clear, anytime24   in Virginia a burning cross is put near a highway, that is25   an -- a criminal offense.91111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1             MR. HURD:  Your Honor, it is a criminal offense2   to burn a cross with intent to intimidate.  Now, what --3             QUESTION:  Even on your own property.4             QUESTION:  No, not on your own --5             MR. HURD:  On your own property if it is a -- a6   public place.  A public place is defined in our statute --7 8 9actually on a jury instruction -- as being not publicownership, but public view.          QUESTION:  And intimidate means to cause fear ofviolence at some unspecified time in the future --10111213141516   the threat.  Justice Kennedy, there -- there are --17             QUESTION:  May I ask -- may I ask you a question18   on -- about instruction 9 to which you called our19   attention?  It says, the court instructs the jury that the20   burning of a cross by itself is sufficient evidence from21   which you may infer the required intent.  Does that mean22   it is sufficient beyond a reasonable doubt by which you23 can do it?24             MR. HURD:  Certainly the jury could, by this25   instruction, by the burning cross infer -- infer guilt.101111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MR. HURD:  To -- to --QUESTION:  -- from some unspecified people.MR. HURD:  To instill fear of -- of bodily harm.The specificity of the people is not hard to figure out.It's whoever burns the cross is the one who is delivering￼123456   past a motion to strike.  Of course, sustaining a --7             QUESTION:  Let's say there's no -- the defendant8   puts in no evidence, just rests on the -- on -- on just11          QUESTION:  So that in -- in a case in whichthere was a cross burned out in the middle of a desertsomewhere, and that's all that's proved, that would beenough to sustain the conviction.MR. HURD:  That would be enough to -- to get you 9   remains mute.  He could be convicted on it in that case,10   I think.               MR. HURD:  If the instruction were given, he12   could be convicted.  Of course, in this case, we have more13   than a burning cross.  And his -- his argument, YourHonor --               QUESTION:  I understand that.  But then my next     question is -- I'm asking about whether there's content14151617   discrimination.  Supposing he burned a -- a circle, he￼1819202122232425could not be convicted on the same evidence.          MR. HURD:  He could not.  A burning circle,unlike a burning cross, carries no particular message.          And, Justice Stevens, I would -- I would pointout that where this Court has previously struck downevidentiary inferences, it has done so under the DueProcess Clause.          QUESTION:  In the case of a desert, he's out in111111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   the desert, and he's burning the cross for symbolic 2   purposes and nobody else is around.  I guess wouldn't the 3   judge have to set aside the conviction on -- on First 4   Amendment grounds. 5             MR. HURD:  Justice Breyer, absolutely. 6   There's -- there's -- the General Assembly chose this word 7   very carefully when it said a prima facie case.  The State 8   supreme court was very careful when they said, based on 9   that language, it would survive a motion to strike, but10   there's no attempt in the statute to preclude the kind of11   independent post-conviction review as required in First12   Amendment cases.13             So absolutely in that case, if -- if -- first of14   all, if the police made an arrest, which is doubtful, and15   if it was prosecuted, which is doubtful, and if the jury16   found guilt, which is doubtful, then the court could in17   that case and should in that case vacate the conviction.18             QUESTION:  Well, that -- that's fine if you use19   the term prima facie case, which is what the statute says.20   But the instruction here said the burning of a cross by21   itself is sufficient evidence from which you may infer the22   required intent.  And you think that's an accurate -- an￼23 24 25accurate conveyance to the jury of what is meant by primafacie case.          MR. HURD:  The -- the -- that obviously was not121111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200056 7 8 9          QUESTION:  But -- but then it goes on to say theburning of a cross is sufficient evidence from which youmay infer the -- the required intent.          MR. HURD:  May, but -- but need not necessarily.the only instruction given, Justice Scalia.          QUESTION:  I understand.          MR. HURD:  There was also instructions giventhat -- that required the prosecution to prove its case12345   beyond a -- a reasonable doubt.  And --          QUESTION:  Need -- no, not necessarily.  Butthat seems to me to be much more than what you nowdescribe as the consequence of a prima facie case.Just -- just one that gets you past a -- a motion to1011121314   dismiss.15MR. HURD:  Well, the -- the jury --￼          QUESTION:  It says it's sufficient evidence tofind it if -- if that's all you --16171819202122232425   instruction.  Were that to happen, then that might violate131111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          MR. HURD:  And Justice Scalia, if there were aproblem with that instruction, it would be in our viewa -- a due process problem, not a First Amendment problem.          QUESTION:  Well, I thought there would be aFirst Amendment problem in the unusual hypotheticalinstance of the desert, where they gave this instructionand the very thirsty jury convicted the person under this 1   the First Amendment since there was no evidence in the 2   case that this was going to intimidate a person, and the 3   only basis for a conviction would have been the 4   instruction of the State.  And under those circumstances, 5   I guess the State instruction permitting conviction would 6   violate the First Amendment. 7             QUESTION:  In other words, every due process 8   violation in a First Amendment case is a First Amendment9 violation.10             QUESTION:  Not necessarily.11             QUESTION:  But that's quite a far --12             (Laughter.)13             MR. HURD:  Justice Scalia, Justice Breyer, in14   any event that very unusual case would present an15   as-applied challenge.16             QUESTION:  May I ask you --17             QUESTION:  I agree it's unusual.18             QUESTION:  -- about a more -- a more -- case of19   immediate concern?  You have said that the cross --20   burning cross is a symbol like no other.  And so this is a21   self-contained category.  What about other things that are22   associated with the Klan?  For example, the white robes23   and the mask?  Are they also symbols that the State can24   ban, or is there something about the burning cross that25   makes it unique?141111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1             MR. HURD:  Justice Ginsburg, there -- there are2   several things about the burning cross that make it3   unique.4             First, it is the symbol that the Klan has used5   to -- to threaten bodily harm.  The connection, if you6 7 8 9will, in our history is -- is between the burning crossand ensuing violence, not so much between people wearingwhite sheets and ensuing violence.          QUESTION:  Isn't there a Federal statute thatmakes it -- makes it an offense to go on the highwaywearing a -- wearing a sheet?1011121314   with a particular intent -- I believe there is.  And we15   have a statute in -- in Virginia.QUESTION:  In disguise.MR. HURD:  And going in disguise on the highway￼16             One of the things -- let me -- let me make this17   point about the burning cross --18             QUESTION:  I -- I --19             MR. HURD:  -- and why it's -- why it's unique.20             QUESTION:  You're saying it's not unique then if21   you could also make going on the highway in disguise a22 crime.23             MR. HURD:  Well, I think going on the highway in24   disguise is -- is a different kind of -- of concern.25   It's -- it's the same kind of concern that might, in a151111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051234   delivering threats, it really is unique.  It says -- it5   says, we're close at hand.  We don't just talk.

The message is opposition to the thing that theBurn anything else.  Burn the flag.  Burn a10   symbol unburned represents.  Burning a cross is not11   opposition to Christianity.  The message is a threat of12   bodily harm, and it -- it is unique.  And it's not simply13   a message of bigotry.  It's a message that -- that whoeverhas it in their hands, a message of bodily harm is coming.That is the primary message --1415161718192021   This is not obnoxious speech.  This is a -- a threat of22   bodily harm.23             Justice Souter made the point in the concurrence24   in -- in Hill v. Colorado the Government may punish25   certain types of expressive conduct even though that161111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼          QUESTION:  It sounds to me like you're defendingthe statute on the ground that the message that thisparticular act conveys is particularly obnoxious.          MR. HURD:  Obnoxious.  Justice Stevens, we havea lot of obnoxious speech, and it's all perfectly fine.1   conduct is associated with a particular point of view.2   Those who burn draft cards typically oppose the draft.3   Those who engage in sidewalk counseling typically oppose4   abortion.  But we can oppose restrictions on those5   activities.          Similarly, we can ban cross burning as a tool ofintimidation even though many people who practicecross-burning may also carry with that cross-burning some6789   message of bigotry.  But the primary message -- the10   fundamental message is a threat of bodily harm.11             And this is not something that we just made up.12   Cross-burning has that message because for decades the13   Klan wanted it to have that message because they wanted14   that tool of intimidation.  And so it rings a little15   hollow when the Klan comes to court and complains that our16   law treats that message -- treats that burning cross as17   having exactly the message that they for decades have18   wanted it to have.19             And so, we do believe that our statute is -- is20   quite constitutional.  They may have a political rally21   with a burning cross, but what they cannot do is use a22   Klan ceremony as a way to smuggle through real threats of23   bodily harm with a specific intent to intimidate.  That is24   what happened in the Barry Black case, as the jury found.25   The sufficiency of the evidence in that case has -- has171111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9not been contested.          For these reasons, we would ask the Court toreverse the decision below and, Justice Stevens, I'd liketo reserve the balance of my time.          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Hurd.          Mr. Dreeben.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN              ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,        AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER          MR. DREEBEN:  Thank you, Justice Stevens, andmay it please the Court:1011121314   threatening form of such conduct.  History has revealed15   that cross-burning has been used as a tool to intimidate16   and put people in fear of bodily violence in a way that no17   other symbol has been used.18             QUESTION:  Does it fall under the fighting words19   notion, or is it a separate category of constitutionally20   proscribable speech do you suppose?21             MR. DREEBEN:  Justice O'Connor, our analysis of22   the intimidation element is that it's akin to a threat to23   put somebody in bodily harm.  And as such --24             QUESTION:  Is it -- is it a defense under the25   statute for someone to prove that they didn't intend to181111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          Virginia has singled out cross-burning with theintent to intimidate because it is a particularly￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425threaten anyone, but just purely to express a viewpoint?          MR. DREEBEN:  Apart from the presumption orprima facie case provision that Your Honor calledattention to earlier, the prohibitory language of thestatute does not reach cross-burning when it is donesolely for the point of expressing a particular view.          QUESTION:  And how -- how do you look at thestatute in light of the prima facie evidence provision?          MR. DREEBEN:  Justice O'Connor, it raisesseparate issues that are distinct from whether across-burning statute can single out that particularactivity and prohibit it on the basis of itsthreatening --          QUESTION:  But that's part of this statute thatwe have to look at, isn't it?          MR. DREEBEN:  It is, but the Virginia SupremeCourt approached the issue by first asking whether thecross-burning provision, insofar as it targetedcross-burning --          QUESTION:  Yes.          MR. DREEBEN:  -- ran afoul of this Court'sdecision in R.A.V., and it only then turned to the primafacie case provision --          QUESTION:  Yes.          MR. DREEBEN:  -- and concluded that it rendered191111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   here. 9             MR. DREEBEN:  That was the instruction given in10   one of the two cases.  In the Elliott case, there was nothe statute overbroad.          The United States has not taken a position onthe validity of the prima facie case provision, which doesraise distinct issues because it could allow a jury incertain instances to infer solely from the act ofcross-burning, without any other evidence at all --QUESTION:  And that was the instruction giveninstruction --          QUESTION:  Yes.111213141516   case.17             But a cross-burning statute like this functions18   not like a fighting words statute which seeks to avert19   breaches of the peace by the use of particularly obnoxious20   language that would induce anybody to strike back with a21   violent reaction.  It functions instead on the theory that22   a signal to violence, or a warning that violence will come23   is not protected within the First Amendment.  It is a24   prohibited form of conduct, and when done as here by an25   act of putting a flaming cross in a place with the intent201111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          MR. DREEBEN:  -- whatsoever on the prima faciecase provision, and so Elliott's case is somewhatsimilar -- differently situated from -- from the Black￼1   to actually put somebody in fear of bodily harm, it's not2   a form of protected conduct that directly implicates the3   First Amendment.  It's --          QUESTION:  Is it -- is it unlawful in Virginiato put somebody in fear of bodily harm in some otherfashion, not to burn a cross, but to say I'm going to4567   lynch you?  Is that -- is that unlawful in Virginia?8             MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Scalia, my understanding9   of Virginia law is that it has a -- a written threats10   statute which would cover any threat of any kind in11   writing, but it does not have a general intimidation or12   threat statute that would reach other means of oral13   expression.QUESTION:  It's sort of peculiar, isn't it?141516171819   establish a prohibition that is limited to that.  Rather20   than sweeping in other classes of speech that may raise21   questions when you come close to the line of whether it is22   or isn't intimidating and therefore might chill free23   expression, Virginia has chosen to focus on what conduct24   occurred within its borders that caused particular harms.25 And what --211111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          MR. DREEBEN:  Well, what Virginia has done istake something which has historically been used as aparticularly dangerous means of intimidation because ithas so often been followed up by actual violence and￼          QUESTION:  Was -- was there a common law ofintimidation, a tort -- a tort that went beyond assault?          MR. DREEBEN:  There is a common law of -- ofputting somebody in fear of bodily harm through the tort12345   law.  And there were similarly antecedent criminal6 7 8 9provisions that are --          QUESTION:  Is there -- is there an immediacycomponent to that as there is with assaults?          MR. DREEBEN:  No, there is not, Justice Kennedy,10   and it's crucial to underscore why that is.  The harms11   that can be brought about by threat statutes are not only12   putting somebody in fear of bodily harm and thereby13   disrupting their movements, but providing a signal that14   the violence may actually occur.  It may not occur15   tomorrow, the next day, or next week, but it's like a16   sword of Damocles hanging over the person whose head --17   who has been threatened.  And in that sense it creates a18   pervasive fear that can be ongoing for a considerable19   amount of time.20             QUESTION:  Mr. Dreeben, aren't you understating21   the -- the effects of -- of the burning cross?  This￼22 23 24 25statute was passed in what year?          MR. DREEBEN:  1952 originally.          QUESTION:  Now, it's my understanding that wehad almost 100 years of lynching and activity in the South221111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051   by the Knights of Camellia and -- and the Ku Klux Klan,2   and this was a reign of terror and the cross was a symbol3   of that reign of terror.  Was -- isn't that significantly456789   the effect of the cross, the burning cross.  I --greater than intimidation or a threat?          MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I think they're coextensive,Justice Thomas, because it is --          QUESTION:  Well, my fear is, Mr. Dreeben, thatyou're actually understating the symbolism on -- of and10   I indicated, I think, in the Ohio case that the cross was11   not a religious symbol and that it has -- it was intended12   to have a virulent effect.  And I -- I think that what13   you're attempting to do is to fit this into our14   jurisprudence rather than stating more clearly what the15   cross was intended to accomplish and, indeed, that it is16   unlike any symbol in our society.17             MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I don't mean to understate18   it, and I entirely agree with Your Honor's description of19   how the cross has been used as an instrument of20   intimidation against minorities in this country.  That has21   justified 14 States in treating it as a distinctive --22             QUESTION:  Well, it's -- it's actually more than23   minorities.  There's certain groups.24             And I -- I just -- my fear is that the -- there25   was no other purpose to the cross.  There was no231111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1   communication of a particular message.  It was intended to2 3 4 5 6 7 8 913   hatred.  And in singling out speech based on the content,14   the State was expressing disagreement with particular15   messages.16             In the Virginia statute, and in the other17   statutes that the States have, the focus is not on any18   particular message.  It is on the effect of intimidation,cause fear --          MR. DREEBEN:  It --          QUESTION:  -- and to terrorize a population.          MR. DREEBEN:  It absolutely was, and for thatreason can be legitimately proscribed without fear thatthe focusing on a cross -- burning of a cross with theintent to intimidate would chill protected expression.               This is a very different case than the R.A.V.10   case that was before the Court.  There the Court was11   confronted with a statute that prohibited the use of12   language based on particular messages of group-based￼19202122232425and the intent to create a climate of fear and, as JusticeThomas has said, a climate of terror.          QUESTION:  So your argument would be the sameeven if we assumed that the capacity of the cross toconvey this message was limited to certain groups, blacks,Catholics, or whatnot.          MR. DREEBEN:  I would, Justice Souter, and I241111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   think it's for the reason that Your Honor pointed out in 2   his concurrence in Hill versus Colorado.  Merely because a 3   particular activity might have become the signature of a 4   certain ideological group does not prevent the State from 5   addressing and regulating what is proscribable about that6 activity. 7             QUESTION:  But it seems to me from this 8   argument, if the message is as powerful as Justice Thomas 9   suggests it is -- and I'm sure he's -- he's right about10   that -- why is it necessary to go beyond the message11   itself?  Why -- why wouldn't it still be proscribable even1213141516171819202122232425if the person burning it didn't realize all of thishistory, just did it innocently, but it nevertheless hadthat effect?          MR. DREEBEN:  Well, that would --          QUESTION:  Why do you need the intent?          MR. DREEBEN:  I think that would raise a muchmore difficult question because notwithstanding the factthat there is a very powerful linkage in our society suchthat the State is justified in singling out the cross, itmay be that under certain contexts, a particularindividual is attempting to express a message rather thanattempting to intimidate.          And it -- it is important to note that merelyexpressing a message of race-based hatred is not something251111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1   that the State can proscribe --2             QUESTION:  Surely -- surely one can burn a cross3   in the sanctity of one's bedroom.  Right?4 5 6 7 8 9(Laughter.)          MR. DREEBEN:  There -- there are -- there arehypothetical cases that one can imagine, the desert, thebedroom --          QUESTION:  No, but my assumption is that thegeographic scope of the statute is just like this statute.It doesn't apply to your own property, but on anyone1011   else's property, or in public view.  If the message is as12   powerful as -- as we're assuming as it is, why isn't that13   a sufficient basis for just banning it?14             MR. DREEBEN:  It might well be, Justice Stevens,15   but I think that a law that is more tailored, as this one16   is, and reaches those acts of cross-burning where it is17   the very intent of the actor to put a person or group of18   people in fear of bodily harm makes it quite clear that19   a -- that statute aims at the proscribable feature of that20   conduct and not at the protected feature, namely21   race-based hatred.22             QUESTION:  But if you can infer the -- the23   intent to intimidate just from the act, even when this is24   done on one's own property, as it was in one of these25   cases, doesn't that go beyond the line, if -- if you --￼261111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 2000512345678   conviction could be rendered for unprotected conduct.  And9   it's for that reason that most States don't have any sortcross-burning on your own property?          MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Stevens, may I answer?          Justice Ginsburg, the inference provision isproblematic because it does raise the potential that awholly protected act of cross-burning, which this Courtmight find within the scope of the First Amendment, couldserve as the exclusive source of evidence from which a10   of analogous provision.  The Federal Government doesn't,111213141516171819202122232425and it raises distinct problems from the targeting focusof the law that's at issue here.          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Dreeben.          Mr. Smolla, we'll -- we'll hear from you.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF RODNEY A. SMOLLA               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS          MR. SMOLLA:  Justice Stevens, and may it pleasethe Court:          At the heart of our argument is that when theState targets a particular symbol or a particular symbolicritual, it engages in content and viewpoint discriminationof the type forbidden by the First Amendment.          QUESTION:  What -- what about the symbol ofbrandishing an automatic weapon in -- in somebody's face?          MR. SMOLLA:  Justice Scalia, I think --271111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1 2 3 4 5   gun.  The physical properties of the gun as a weapon add 6   potency to the threat, and so if the State makes a threat 7   committed with a firearm an especially heinous type of 8   threat, it is acting within the confines of what is 9   permissible under R.A.V. because it is creating a subclass10   of threat and defining that subclass of threat for the11   same reasons that allow it to define the outer perimeter12   of threat law, things going to the danger posed by that13 threat.QUESTION:  You're next.          MR. SMOLLA:  I think that a core element of ourargument is that there is a fundamental First Amendmentdifference between brandishing a cross, and brandishing a          But the properties of the cross are not physicalproperties, and the burning element of a burning cross arenot what communicate the threat.141516171819   cross, in effect, acquired the history that it has?  If we20   were in the year 1820, and you had a choice between￼          QUESTION:  But is -- isn't the -- isn't yourargument an argument that would have been sound before the21   somebody brandishing the loaded gun, and somebody22   brandishing a cross and nobody knew how the cross had been23   used because it had not been used, your argument, it seems24   to me, would be -- would be a winning one.25             How does your argument account for that fact281111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   that the cross has acquired a potency which I would 2   suppose is at least as equal to that of the gun? 3             MR. SMOLLA:  Justice Souter, I think that our 4   argument is that in fact it works the reverse way, that 5   what the cross and the burning cross have acquired as a 6   kind of secondary meaning, somewhat akin to the way that 7   trademarks acquire secondary meaning in intellectual 8   property law, are a multiplicity of messages.  Undoubtedly 9   a burning cross identified as -- as effectively the10   trademark of the Ku Klux Klan carries horrible11   connotations of terrorism of the kind --12             QUESTION:  But it -- it carries something else,13   doesn't it?  Isn't it not merely a -- a trademark that has14   acquired a meaning?  Isn't it also a kind of Pavlovian15   signal so that when that signal is given, the natural16   human response is not recognition of a message, but fear?17             MR. SMOLLA:  No, Your Honor.  Respectfully18   I think that that overstates what is being communicated.19   Any symbol in its pristine state that has gathered20   reverence in our society -- the American flag, the Star of21   David, the cross, the symbols of government -- is a22   powerful, emotional symbol in -- in its revered state.23             QUESTION:  But they don't make -- they don't24   make you scared, and if you start -- for your own safety.25   And if you start with the proposition that State can, in291111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼12345678   intimidated.  If I see a burning cross, my stomach may9   churn.  I may feel a sense of loathing, disgust, a vaguefact, prevent threats that scare people reasonably -- fortheir own safety, this is in a separate category fromsimply a -- a symbol that has acquired a potent meaning.QUESTION:  I dare say --          MR. SMOLLA:  Your Honor, the word scared isimportant in answering your question because it's -- it'swhat we mean by being scared, or what we mean by being10 sense of --11             QUESTION:  Yes.12             MR. SMOLLA:  -- of being intimidated because I13   associate it --14             QUESTION:  How about a cross -- how about a15 cross --16             MR. SMOLLA:  But that's not fear of bodily harm.17             QUESTION:  How about a cross on your lawn?18             QUESTION:  Yes.  I dare say that you would19   rather see a man with a -- with a rifle on your front20   lawn -- If you were a black man at night, you'd rather see21   a man with a rifle than see a burning cross on your front22   lawn.232425301111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼          MR. SMOLLA:  Your Honor, I concede that.However -- however --QUESTION:  The whole purpose of that is -- is to1 terrorize.          MR. SMOLLA:  -- as -- as powerful as that pointis -- and I totally accept it, and totally accept thehistory that Justice Thomas has -- has recounted, and that2345   the United States recounts in its brief as accurate.  As6   powerful as all of those points are, there's not a single7   interest that society seeks to protect in protecting that8   victim that cannot be vindicated perfectly as well, 9   exactly as well with no fall-off at all, by10   content-neutral alternatives, not merely general11   run-of-the-mill threat laws, or incitement laws, or12   intimidation laws which may have an antiseptic and sterile13   quality about them.  You can go even beyond that --               QUESTION:  But why isn't this just a regulation     of a particularly virulent form of intimidation?  And why     can't the State regulate such things?14151617181920   we've explored this morning.  What if I think it is?  Why￼21 22 23 24 25can't the State regulate it?          MR. SMOLLA:  Because, Justice O'Connor, it isalso an especially virulent form of expression on ideasrelating to race, religion, politics --          QUESTION:  You were -- you were saying that the311111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          MR. SMOLLA:  Your Honor, it is not aparticularly virulent form of intimidation.QUESTION:  Well, it is for the very reasons 1   State can go -- doesn't have to have a sterile law on 2   intimidation.  It can go further, but not as far as this.3 What -- 4             MR. SMOLLA:  Justice -- 5             QUESTION:  What is this midpoint? 6             MR. SMOLLA:  Justice Kennedy, it is the 7   Wisconsin versus Mitchell bias enhancement-style model 8   where the interest of the State goes beyond just 9   preventing physical crime.  It goes to preventing racism,10   acts of violence, threats, intimidation that are done out11   of bias and animus.  That captures the fullness of all the12   conceivable State interests that there could possibly13   be --          QUESTION:  Well, that was in conjunction with anactual physical assault.14151617181920   the penalty.  If you threaten out of racial animus, you21   get double the penalty, triple the penalty.  And that22   would work in any cross-burning case --23             QUESTION:  Suppose -- suppose if you threaten by24   use of a cross -- burning cross, would that be a specific25   statutory category that allows the penalty be -- to be321111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼          MR. SMOLLA:  But -- but, Your Honor, in anyinstance in which the State were operating upon someconduct that it is constitutionally permissible toproscribe, such as a threat, the State could then enhance1   enhanced?234MR. SMOLLA:  Yes, Your Honor, and even more --          QUESTION:  Well, how can you have a statutorycategory which enhances the penalty that you can't alsouse to -- to describe the underlying offense? 5 6 7 8 9   prove intent does not implicate the First Amendment.  And10   although the line is thin, it is gigantic in terms of our11   First Amendment values.  It is the difference --12             QUESTION:  Well, let me ask you this.  Supposing13   you have a statute that prohibits intimidation by burning14   circles, any -- any design of any kind, and the maximum15   penalty is a year in jail, but if you burn a cross, it's16   2 years in jail.  Would that be permissible?          MR. SMOLLA:  The -- the answer to that question,Justice Kennedy, lies in Wisconsin versus Mitchell wherethis Court held that the mere evidentiary use of speech to￼171819202122232425          MR. SMOLLA:  It would not be permissible, YourHonor, and the reason it --          QUESTION:  And -- and it's --          MR. SMOLLA:  -- would not be permissible is thecross has acquired this meaning as an ideological symbol.          QUESTION:  Because it's content-baseddiscrimination within the category of activity that can beentirely proscribed.          MR. SMOLLA:  That is precisely our argument.331111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1             QUESTION:  Now, is there any support for that 2   proposition other than the majority opinion in R.A.V.? 3             MR. SMOLLA:  Your Honor, R.A.V. is the only case 4   that dealt squarely with this puzzle of what happens when 5   you're dealing with a category of speech that you have the 6   right to proscribe, and then you draw gratuitous content- 7   or viewpoint-based distinctions within it. 8             However, Justice Stevens, I would say that it 9   isn't alone in this Court's powerful condemnation of10   viewpoint discrimination, and a key element to this11   Court's First Amendment history is that we don't want to12   cut matters too finely.13             QUESTION:  What was involved in R.A.V.?  Was14   it -- was it activity?  What kind of activity was15   involved.16             MR. SMOLLA:  Well, the -- the fact pattern in17   R.A.V. was identical to one of the fact patterns here.  It18   was going on to the yard of an African-American family --19             QUESTION:  Yes --20             MR. SMOLLA:  -- and burning a cross in the21   middle of the night, Your Honor.22             QUESTION:  Yes, but what was made a crime was23   the burning it with a particular motivation, wasn't it?24             MR. SMOLLA:  The -- the --25             QUESTION:  It wasn't the mere act.341111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1             MR. SMOLLA:  And -- and at the core of our 2   argument, Justice Scalia, is the claim that the concept of 3   viewpoint discrimination is, and ought to be broad enough 4   to encompass not only viewpoint discrimination articulated 5   linguistically, the way that it was done in the statute in 6   R.A.V., but also viewpoint discrimination through the 7   singling out of a symbol because symbols acquire meaning 8   in precisely the same way that words acquire meaning. 9             QUESTION:  But words -- words are even more.10   I mean, your argument applies a fortiori to words.  Right?111213141516171819202122232425          MR. SMOLLA:  It does, Justice Breyer.          QUESTION:  I guess you could have statutes, ifthe need were great, that forbid you from using certainwords with a certain intent like, for example,impersonating somebody or -- or counterfeiting, or -- Imean, if -- I've never heard of a case which said youcouldn't have a statute that in -- if the circumstanceswere right, forbid a person to use certain words.          MR. SMOLLA:  Justice Breyer, the -- the FirstAmendment speaks to this, and -- and it's --          QUESTION:  You can't have that?  To have astatute that says --          MR. SMOLLA:  In fact --          QUESTION:  -- you cannot say I am the Presidentwith the intent to confuse people that I'm the President,351111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9I mean, that would be unconstitutional.          MR. SMOLLA:  The -- the normal -- the normallegislative process, Justice Breyer, is not to name thewords, not to put in the statute if you utter these --          QUESTION:  I know that's not normal.  I -- I --that's why --          MR. SMOLLA:  -- but to describe -- but todescribe the conduct that you are attempting to get at,and then various combinations of words may fit into it.               But let's take the example of naming a set of11   words.  Even that is enormously problematic for First101213141516171819202122232425Amendment purposes.          QUESTION:  It is a crime to impersonate theGreat Seal of the United States --          MR. SMOLLA:  The --          QUESTION:  -- for purposes of obtaining money.It violates the First Amendment.          MR. SMOLLA:  But -- but the -- but the -- itcould, Your Honor, in -- in an appropriate circumstance.Take --          QUESTION:  In other words, all it -- all it --all you're saying is that heightened scrutiny applies.￼and --  MR. SMOLLA:  We are certainly saying that,  QUESTION:  That's all you're saying.  You can't361111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1 2 3 4 5 6 7   heightened scrutiny, it's okay to proscribe it.  That's 8   basically the -- 9             MR. SMOLLA:  That is a -- that is a fair10   characterization of the question.  And -- and accepting111213141516171819202122232425strict scrutiny as the -- the test here, but strictscrutiny we would argue bumped up a bit in its intensityif this is viewpoint discrimination because --          QUESTION:  Well, why shouldn't we apply --          MR. SMOLLA:  -- this Court's been hostile toviewpoint --          QUESTION:  -- the O'Brien test?  Why -- why sometougher test than that here?          MR. SMOLLA:  Your Honor, whether you applyO'Brien or strict scrutiny, it's our submission we winbecause when you get to the point at which you look atalternatives, there are content-neutral alternatives thatwork perfectly as well.          But to answer directly your question, JusticeO'Connor, this Court has never allowed the use of the371111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005possibly say more than that once you acknowledge that --that symbols can be proscribed.MR. SMOLLA:  We -- we say that --          QUESTION:  And so the question before us iswhether burning a cross is such a terrorizing symbol inAmerican -- in American culture that even on the basis of￼ 1   O'Brien test or any of the cousins of O'Brien, such as the 2   secondary effects doctrine or time, place, or manner 3   jurisprudence, when the harm that the government seeks to 4   prevent is a harm that flows from the communicative impact 5   of the expression. 6             And there is no getting around the fact that the 7   harm the government seeks to prevent here indubitably 8   flows only from the formation of this symbol.  If I -- 9             QUESTION:  So I would think then that if the10   test suggests that you cannot have a statute which says11   you cannot use the words, I'll kill you, with an intent to12   kill somebody or threaten him, then there's something13   wrong with the test, not that there's something wrong with14   the statute.  That's --15             MR. SMOLLA:  Your Honor, take the -- take the16   words -- take the words, if you do that again, I swear17   I'll kill you.  Those words in a given context might be￼breakfast banter, might be a joke.181920212223   true objective threat.  And the -- a core element of this24   Court's commitment to freedom of speech has been to25 separate abstract advocacy from palpable harm. 381111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005QUESTION:  Correct, they might.MR. SMOLLA:  It might be something a teacher --QUESTION:  So what we put in the --MR. SMOLLA:  -- says to a student, or might be a 1             QUESTION:  -- fails to do that. 2             QUESTION:  If it's intended to be -- 3             QUESTION:  -- the requirement of intent. 4             QUESTION:  -- a threat, you can get it.  Right? 5             MR. SMOLLA:  Pardon me, Your Honor? 6             QUESTION:  You're saying if it's intended to be 7   a threat, it can proscribed. 8             MR. SMOLLA:  If it meets the Watts true threats 9   test, it -- it is permissible.  This law -- this law,10   however, is a fusion of true threat law, and a gratuitous11   addition to the true threat law, cross-burning.  The lawwould have been --          QUESTION:  Mr. -- Mr. Smolla --121314151617   States brief several laws.  They don't mention18   cross-burnings.  Are all those adequate under your test?19   Would they be constitutional?20             MR. SMOLLA:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  The Federal21   model, for example.  There are a variety of Federal civil22   rights laws that punish conduct that the United States23   uses routinely to punish acts of cross-burning are24   perfectly permissible.25             And the difference, which is enormous for First391111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MR. SMOLLA:  -- perfectly sufficient --          QUESTION:  -- on the question of perfectlysufficient laws, we have in the appendix to the United￼ 1   Amendment purposes, is that both at the front end of that 2   legislation and at the back end, there is breathing space 3   for the First Amendment.  It's important to remember that 4   our First Amendment jurisprudence is not just about 5   deliberate censorship and realized censorship.  It is also 6   about possibility, about chilling effect, and about 7   breathing -- about breathing space. 8             In effect, in Virginia -- 9             QUESTION:  But this statute --10             MR. SMOLLA:  -- you burn a cross at your peril.11             QUESTION:  -- this statute incorporates the12   intent to intimidate feature.13             MR. SMOLLA:  That is true, Justice O'Connor, but14   even if it does, the learning of R.A.V., we'd submit, is15   that that alone does not rest in the statute.16             QUESTION:  Well, this --17             MR. SMOLLA:  A law can't be half constitutional.18             QUESTION:  -- this seems to fall within the19   first exception mentioned in R.A.V.  This does address20   conduct and with a certain intent.  I mean, to apply21   R.A.V. is to extend R.A.V.22             MR. SMOLLA:  Your Honor, it's our submission23   that in fact the two cases are identical, and the reason24   they don't seem identical perhaps is that it is harder --25   it is harder -- to locate the viewpoint and content401111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   discrimination in our minds when we think of the burning 2   cross than when we think of the language of R.A.V., which 3   talked about anger or resentment on the basis of race, 4   color, creed.  And that may well be because of the kind of 5   Pavlovian connection that you have identified where we 6   feel this loathing, and we feel this -- this generalized 7   fear when we see the sight of the burning cross. 8             But our point is that ought never be sufficient 9   because even if at a given moment in time, you could take10   some symbol and freeze it and you could say at this second11   this symbol always seems associated with violence --12   imagine you had a terrorist group that was on a serial13   killing spree and every time they committed an act of14   violence, they left a little calling card, and that symbol15   became a terribly frightening --16             QUESTION:  Well, I guess what -- you have a very17   interesting point.  And as I've been thinking about it, it18   seems to me that the -- a difficulty, possible difficulty19   with it is that the First Amendment doesn't protect words.20   It protects use of words for certain purposes.  And it21   doesn't protect, for example, a -- a symbol.  It protects22   a thing that counts as a symbol when used for symbolic23   purposes.24             MR. SMOLLA:  That's correct.25 QUESTION: So just as it doesn't protect the 411111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9words, I will kill you, but protects them when used in aplay, but not when used as a threat --          MR. SMOLLA:  That is correct.          QUESTION:  -- so it doesn't protect the burningof the cross when used as a threat --          MR. SMOLLA:  That is correct.          QUESTION:  -- and not as a symbol.          MR. SMOLLA:  That is -- that --          QUESTION:  And now we have a statute that says     you can use it as a symbol, but you can't use it as a11   threat.  And therefore, the First Amendment doesn't apply.101213141516171819202122232425          MR. SMOLLA:  And -- and --          QUESTION:  Now, if that's the right analysis,then what's your response?          MR. SMOLLA:  Your Honor, that -- that everythingyou said up until the very end --          (Laughter.)          MR. SMOLLA:  -- we would not accept.          (Laughter.)          MR. SMOLLA:  I have a -- I have a hunch I haveto at least say that much.          (Laughter.)          MR. SMOLLA:  And -- and, Justice Breyer, itcomes to this, that you cannot make the judgment that thislaw in its actual impact only penalizes those acts of421111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1   cross-burning that result in threat.  It certainly chills,2   Justice Breyer, a wide range of expression, as it did in3   this case, that cannot plausibly be understood as a threat4   of bodily harm in any realistic sense.5             Every time the Ku Klux Klan conducts one of its6   rallies, at the height of its rally, it burns a large7   cross, and it plays a hymn such as the Old Rugged Cross,8   or Onward Christian Soldiers or Amazing Grace, and this is9   a ritual that it engages in.  Now, it is inconceivable --10   there is absolutely nothing in this record that says that11   every time the Klan does that, that is, in fact, a true12 threat. 13          QUESTION:  No, it isn't, so long as the Klandoesn't do it in -- in sight of a public highway, or onsomebody else's property, there's not a chance that thisstatute would apply to them.141516171819   highway?20￼               MR. SMOLLA:  Your Honor, but the --               QUESTION:  They have to do in sight of a public               MR. SMOLLA:  The -- the -- all the statute21   requires is that it be visible to others.  And of course,22   the First Amendment value here in our view is that speech,23   particularly disturbing and offensive speech that runs24   contrary to our -- our mainstream values that the majority25   of us embrace, is ineffective unless it is put out to the431111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051   world where others can see it.2             And as Justice Brandeis said in Whitney versus3   California in his concurring opinion, you don't make the4   world safer by driving the speech of hate groups such as5   the Ku Klux Klan underground.  In many societies in thisworld, you can ban racial supremacist groups.          QUESTION:  I want you just to address -- but6789   interests here perhaps.  But -- but if -- if it's rightit's hard for you because you have clients with different10   that you can ban speech, i.e., the use of words for11   purposes of threatening people with bodily harm, which I12   think we can, then what about this prima facie13   prohibition?14             The way I was thinking about it, to get you to15   respond, is if you did have a statute that was16   constitutional that said it is a crime to use the words, I17   will kill you, with the intent to threaten someone with18   death.  That statute might go on to say, and the jury may19   infer from the use of the words themselves on a particular20   occasion that the threat existed.  And I think --￼MR. SMOLLA:  And I accept that, Your Honor.21222324   different.  It says the jury may infer from the -- the25   burning cross on a particular occasion, just like the use441111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005          QUESTION:  -- if all that's true, then I guessthat the -- the prima facie presumption here is no 1   of the words, I kill you, on a particular occasion -- 2             MR. SMOLLA:  There's a world of difference, Your 3   Honor, and the difference is that the words, I will kill 4   you, are words of threat that have no additional 5   emanations.  They have no additional secondary meaning in 6   this society either as the symbol of a group, or as the 7   symbol of an idea such as bigotry.  They partake of the 8   same rationale, the same defining parameters that allow 9   you to attack threats in the first instance.10             Whereas the burning cross -- the burning cross,11   whether it's the 19th century burning cross before the12   Klan began, or today, introduces a symbol -- first of all,13   just a cross before we get to the burning part, a symbol14   that you must concede is one of the most powerful15   religious symbols in -- in human history.  It is the -- it16   is the symbol of Christianity, the symbol of the17   crucifixion of Christ.  When the cross is burned, in much￼1819202122232425the same way as when the flag is burned, undoubtedly theburner is playing on that underlying positive repositoryof meaning to make the intense negative point, often apoint that strikes as horrible and as evil and disgusting,but that's --          QUESTION:  Mr. Smolla --          MR. SMOLLA:  -- what the person is trying to do.          QUESTION:  -- there's a huge difference between451111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051   a flag and a burning cross, and it's been pointed out in2   the briefs.  The flag is a symbol of our government, and3   one of the things about free speech is we can criticize4   the President, the Supreme Court, anybody, and feel5   totally free about doing that.  It's the symbol of6   government.7 8 9          But the cross is not attacking the government.It's attacking people, threatening their lives and limbs.And so I don't -- I think you have to separate the symbolthat is the burning cross from other symbols that arecritical of government, but that don't -- that aren't athreat to personal safety.1011121314   accept that -- that dichotomy.  In fact, when the Klan15   engages in cross-burning, as it did in Brandenburg versus16   Ohio, and as it did here, it is -- it is a melange ofMR. SMOLLA:  Justice Ginsburg, I only partially￼17   messages.  Yes, to some degree, it is a horizontal message18   of hate speech, the Klan members attacking Jews and19   Catholics and African-Americans and all of the various20   people that have been the -- the point of its hatred over21 the years.22             But it's also engaged in dissent and in a23   political message.  If you remember in Brandenburg versus24   Ohio, Brandenburg says if the Congress doesn't change25   things, some revenges will have to be taken.  In this461111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   case, President Clinton was talked about by the Klan 2   members.  Hillary Clinton was talked about by the Klan 3   members.  Racial preferences and the idea that the -- 4   where they're using taxes to support minority groups. 5   There is a jumble of political anger, of -- 6             QUESTION:  Mr. Smolla, I would -- I would like 7   to take exception to your suggestion in response to 8   Justice Breyer that the words, I will kill you, always 9   have a threatening meaning.10             MR. SMOLLA:  They may not, Justice Stevens.11             QUESTION:  I think they're often used in casual12   conversation without any such threatening meaning at all.13             MR. SMOLLA:  Justice Stevens, I accept that.14   But I -- I'm merely making the argument that you can fit a15   phrase such as the words, I will kill you, within the16   exceptions to R.A.V. in a way that you cannot fit17   cross-burning within the exceptions to R.A.V. or18   flag-burning within the exceptions to R.A.V. because19   cross- and flag-burning and any symbol, the burning of the20   Star of David, the swastika -- Virginia has a law21   virtually identical to the cross-burning law that singles22   out the swastika.  The -- you could -- you can go through￼23 24 25the universe of symbols --          QUESTION:  Your argument is not the same with --I mean, it's an -- your argument, I take it, is that if471111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9you actually have a statute that criminalizes the use ofparticular words, or -- or the burning of a -- of asymbol, even if you qualify that by saying you -- it'scriminal to use them for certain purposes, you'vemonopolized those words because people who are using themfrom different purposes will be afraid to use them.          MR. SMOLLA:  And chilled --          QUESTION:  And then they can't express what theywant even though that expression is not to hurt someone.          MR. SMOLLA:  And not merely monopolize,Justice Breyer, but --10111213141516171819   threaten.20             MR. SMOLLA:  Justice Kennedy, there's no free21   ride if the government employs content-neutral22   alternatives, which really --23             QUESTION:  Well, why isn't -- why can't we say24   there's no three -- free ride when the government imposes25 scienter?481111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005QUESTION:  That's right, yes.          MR. SMOLLA:  But chilled the use of thatcombination of words or chilled the use of that symbol --QUESTION:  Yes.  All right.  I see your point.MR. SMOLLA:  So that in effect it becomes --QUESTION:  That -- that seems to give them a￼free ride when they really want to intimidate and -- and1             MR. SMOLLA:  Your Honor, because the First2   Amendment requires that we flip the question.  It is not3   why can't the government single out this particular form4   of expression.  It is why do you need to.  And if you have5678   alternative.  I'm sure there are other ways of getting at9   the person who brandishes an automatic weapon, but surelyno need to --          QUESTION:  Wait, wait, wait.  I think -- I don'tthink our cases say you have to use the least restrictive10   you can make brandishing an automatic weapon a crime --11             MR. SMOLLA:  Your Honor --12             QUESTION:  -- even though there are other ways13   you could get at it.14             MR. SMOLLA:  Justice Scalia, you do not need to15   use the least restrictive alternative when you are not16   regulating a fundamental right, or engaged in a suspect17   classification.18             QUESTION:  A symbol -- I mean, that's a symbol19   too.  Brandishing a weapon is a symbol just as burning a20   cross is a symbol.21             MR. SMOLLA:  Except, Your Honor, under -- under22   the Brandenburg test -- excuse me -- under the O'Brien23   test, the government has functional elements of -- of --24   that relate to the weapon that allow it to cite things25   utterly unrelated to the content of expression that491111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1   empower it to say you may not -- you may not brandish a 2   weapon. 3             QUESTION:  I don't know what you're talking 4   about.               MR. SMOLLA:  That -- that it's -- it's like the 6   difference, Justice Scalia, between burning a draft card 7   and burning a cross or burning a flag, that -- that the 8   reason O'Brien -- the draft card case -- allowed the 9   government to punish burning the draft card was that the10   draft card had a functional purpose -- the administration11   of the Selective Service System -- that had nothing to do12   with what was being expressed when one burned the draft13 card.14             The gun is like that.  When the government says15   you may not threaten someone by brandishing a gun, there16   is a functional element to the gun.  It's a weapon that5￼171819202122232425the government can cite as its basis.          But a symbol only has symbolic meaning.          QUESTION:  Okay, but --          QUESTION:  It's an unloaded gun.  This is anunloaded gun that's being brandished.(Laughter.)          QUESTION:  So once it's unloaded, it's nothingbut a symbol.          MR. SMOLLA:  It is -- it is --501111 14th Street, N.W.

If I -- if I take two wooden sticks -- 8             QUESTION:  100 years -- 100 years of history. 9             (Laughter.)10             MR. SMOLLA:  Exactly, Justice Kennedy, that's11   the difference.  And that 100 years of history is on the12   side of freedom of speech, that it is 100 years of history13   that a particular group has -- has capitalized on this14   particular ritual to make not only points that are15   threatening, but to advance their agenda.16             QUESTION:  All right.  We'll -- we'll accept --17   I mean, I think we accept that, but we -- our problem is18   that the 100 years have also added something else, and19   that is the kind of specific Pavlovian quality that I20   spoke of.  And if that is giving us difficulty in deciding21   whether we should classify this in the O'Brien direction,22   or the flag direction, what's the -- what's the -- in23   effect, the tie-breaker?24             MR. SMOLLA:  Your Honor, I think the tie-breaker25   is what I've kept coming back to a number of times, which511111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005QUESTION:  It is nothing but a symbol.          MR. SMOLLA:  It is -- it's still -- it's still aweapon, Your Honor, and -- and it is giganticallydifferent from a cross.          If -- if I -- take a torch.  What would be thedifference between brandishing a torch and brandishing a￼ 1   is really would there be any fall-off through 2   content-neutral alternatives, and if there would not be 3   any fall-off through content-neutral alternatives, then 4   err on the side of freedom of speech. 5             Imagine that you have two rallies going on 6   side-by-side.  The -- the Klan is going to make -- engage 7   in a rally, and then a group that wants to counter the 8   Klan's message, a Christian group, has a counter-rally in 9   a public forum in Richmond.  And imagine that at the10   height of those two rallies, the Klan ignites its cross.11   Under this statute, the Klan can be prosecuted, the other12   group cannot.  It's --               QUESTION:  Mr. Smolla, I thought that --               (Laughter.)               MR. SMOLLA:  Then -- then round them up, Your(Laughter.)131415161718   Honor.19          QUESTION:  What if the other group all arebrandishing guns as Justice Scalia said?￼          QUESTION:  I thought Mr. Hurd told us that inthe Brandenburg case, where it was just burned at a rallyas part of the ceremony, that's not what this statute is20212223   getting at.  It's only when it's used as a signal of24   intimidation, and that what sparked this particular25   cross-burning at this rally -- this was no ordinary rally.521111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005 1   This was in response to something that the Klan opposed. 2             MR. SMOLLA:  And -- and I think, Justice 3   Ginsburg, again to think about this in content-neutral 4   terms, the First Amendment would not forbid the government 5   charging the Klan in the case that we have with an 6   ordinary, run-of-the-mill threat law, or a hate crime law, 7   such as a bias enhancement statute, and then introducing 8   the fact that the cross was burned as evidence of the 9   threat, and as part of the emotional atmospheric of the10   case to try to convince a jury of the heinousness and the11   seriousness of the threat.12             That was approved by this Court in Wisconsin13   versus Mitchell, and it may seem not worth the candle.  It14   may seem that it's just a way to get to the same result15   through some other formality, but our position is that16   that is enormous for First Amendment purposes.  It is the17   central divide of modern First Amendment law in which the18   Court insists that you use content-neutral alternatives19   when you can accomplish the governmental ends equally well20   through them.21             Thank you, Your Honor.22             QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Smolla.23             Mr. Hurd, you have 2 minutes in which to discuss24   all these hypotheticals.25             (Laughter.)531111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼ 1 2 3 4 5   intimidate which is in our statute.  If there's no intent 6   to intimidate, there's no violation here. 7             Opposing counsel's problem is how does the Klan 8   go out in public and burn a cross and have it viewed not 9   as its common, ordinary meaning backed up by 100 years of10   history.  Well, one thing they could do is not talk about11   shooting blacks with a .30/.30.  That might suggest12   there's no intent to intimidate.13             Opposing counsel suggests that there should be a14   broader law.  Well, Congress could pass a broader law, one15   that didn't focus on threats against the President, one16   that focused on threats against any Federal employee, but17   this Court has said a broader law is not needed because18   threats against the President are especially problematic.19             So is cross-burning.  It is not just hate20   speech.  It doesn't just say I don't like you because you21   are black.  In the hands of the Klan, the message is the22   law cannot help you if you're black or Catholic or Jewish23   or foreign-born, or we just don't like you, and if you try24   to live your life as a free American, we are going to kill25   you.  That is the message of cross-burning backed up by541111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. HURD     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. HURD:  Very briefly.Justice Souter, the tie-breaker is the intent to￼ 1   100 years of history.  That's why it is especially 2   virulent.  And that's why under R.A.V., this Court can 3   allow us to proscribe it without having to pass any other 4   law, or pretend it is the same as something quite 5   different than what it is. 6             We have not interfered with freedom of speech. 7   We have not tried to suppress any idea.  All we have tried 8   to do is to protect freedom from fear for all of our 9   citizens by guarding against this especially virulent form10   of intimidation.11             We ask that the decision below be reversed and12   the statute upheld.
