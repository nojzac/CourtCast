Saint Clair          Mr. Nagle.              ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID E. NAGLE                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. NAGLE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleasethe Court:          The Federal Arbitration Act is a declaration ofFederal policy favoring arbitration, arbitrationagreements, and its coverage extends to the very limits ofCongress' Commerce Clause power.  There's an exception tothe act, the scope of which is in dispute today.  Therespondent asserts that all contracts of employment areexcluded from the coverage of the act.  That simply cannotbe correct.          The act does not say that it excludes allcontracts of employment.  Section 1 excludes only certainkinds of employment contracts, the contracts of employmentof seamen, railroad employees, any other class of workersengaged in foreign or interstate commerce.          Beginning nearly 50 years ago, 11 courts ofappeals have read that text in a uniform, consistent312345    Adams.67 8 9101112131415161718192021222324251    manner, finding it to create a narrow exclusion applicable2    only to those workers who are actually engaged in the3    movement of people or goods across State lines, and we4    contend that that's the only interpretation consistent5    with the text of the statute.67    argument?89QUESTION:  Is the word class important to yourMR. NAGLE:  Your Honor --          QUESTION:  Or would your argument be just thesame without --10111213141516    employees.17              QUESTION:  Well, it would seem to me to help18    your argument somewhat, because we -- the statute asks us19    to think in terms of classes of workers, rather than20    individual workers engaged --21              MR. NAGLE:  Oh, certainly, Your Honor.  It22    identifies a group or a category of employees in the same23    manner that seamen and railroad employees are grouped.24    Seamen, of course, was a recognized term.  As the opinion25    of the Court -- as Justice O'Connor's opinion for the4          MR. NAGLE:  I do not believe that itsignificantly alters it.  I think the class is a termwhich is used in the Railway Labor Act, for instance,which was under consideration and passed the followingyear to refer to categories of craft or class of1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9Court in McDermott International recognized, seamen was aterm having specific meaning.  Railroad employees was aterm defined under the Transportation Act of 1920 and alsoin the Railway Labor Act, so --          QUESTION:  Mr. Nagle, I guess at the time thatthis act was adopted in -- what, 1925?          MR. NAGLE:  Yes, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  We had not taken as broad a view ofthe Commerce Clause power as is true today, is that10    correct?11              MR. NAGLE:  I would acknowledge that, Your12    Honor.1314    in mind that its jurisdiction was as broad as we would15    have subsequently indicated, and apparently it intended at16    least that the act not include or cover contracts of17    employment over which their authority to regulate was very18    clear, right?19              MR. NAGLE:  That is correct, Your Honor.  They20    were specifying seamen and railroad employees.21              QUESTION:  And the indications were that at22    least then Secretary of Commerce Hoover thought employees23    shouldn't be covered at all, and he presented language to24    the Congress which approved it, and yet you want us to say25    that Congress did intend to include for arbitration5QUESTION:  And so Congress probably didn't have 1    contracts of employment over which the jurisdiction was 2    most questionable, and yet exclude it for those where the 3    jurisdiction of Congress was clearest at the time, which 4    seems a little odd to me. 5              MR. NAGLE:  Well, there are several points in 6    response, Your Honor.  First, the letter from Secretary 7    Hoover was a letter submitted to the committee in 1923, 8    written on the day that it was entered, and there was no 9    further explanation.10              I would also submit that we need to look to the11    language of the coverage provision, section 2 of the act,12    and contrast that with the language contained in section 113 of the act.14              I acknowledge that Commerce Clause authority15    over seamen and railroad employees would have been clear,16    but I would also point -- bring to the Court's attention,17    of course, the fact that there were statutory mechanisms18    in place, and also the single item that we know most19    clearly is that the seamen as a group, through their20    representative, Mr. Bruce, have specifically asked that21    they be carved out.  While it may be somewhat difficult to22    determine exactly what Congress' motive was, they were23    responding to a request from a constituency group to be24    carved out.25              QUESTION:  Well, the other most troublesome6 1    point for me, anyway, is this Court's decision in Allied- 2    Bruce, which dealt with section 2, and said that we're 3    going to interpret it now as reaching the full scope of 4    Congress' Commerce Clause power.  Why would we not do the 5    same for this section 1? 6              MR. NAGLE:  Well, in Allied-Bruce, which is one 7    of the cases upon which we would principally rely, that 8    was an interpretation of section 2, the coverage, and 9    certainly was making it clear that the Court recognized10    that Congress was acting to the full with respect to its11    Commerce Clause power.12              Section 1 is an exclusion.  It is to be narrowly13    construed.  I would submit that there is a general policy14    that whenever we have a statute which clearly enunciates a15    public policy of broad scope that any exclusion to that16    should be narrowly construed.17              QUESTION:  Why is that?  I mean, it seems to me18    an exception is just as important as the rule.  Why should19    we unrealistically construe it just because it's an20    exception?21 22 23 24 25MR. NAGLE:  I certainly would not suggestthat --          QUESTION:  Would you tell that to the members ofCongress?  When you vote for this exception, bear in mindthat we're not going to take it to have its most71 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9reasonable meaning.  We're going to construe it narrowly.Why?  Why would we do that?          MR. NAGLE:  I apologize, Your Honor.  I was notsuggesting that we take an unreasonable meaning.  In fact,I'm suggesting that we take the most reasonableconstruction that Congress --          QUESTION:  Well then, fine, so your case reallyturns, it seems to me, on the point that the language usedby the Congress that enacted this statute in section 1 wasat that time narrower than the language used in section 2.          MR. NAGLE:  Absolutely, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Now, what support do you have for10111213    that?14                MR. NAGLE:  I would point the Court first to --15    for contemporaneous construction of the language I would16    point the Court to Illinois Central Railroad v. Behrens, a17    1914 case, where the Congress clearly recognized -- the18    Court clearly recognized that the Congress had very broad19    authority under the FELA statute over instate commerce,20    recognized that even trains, for instance, moving in21    intrastate commerce were nevertheless in the channels of22    commerce, and so when the FELA in 1914 limited its23    coverage to an employee who was injured while employed in24    commerce, this Court found that that was a narrower25    construction --812345678    term.910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Employed in is not the same asengaged in, but I'd like to go back, first, to theinvolving term.          MR. NAGLE:  Yes.          QUESTION:  You're using words and say that --saying that in the second section, involved is a verybroad term, and in the first section engaged is a narrow          MR. NAGLE:  Yes, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  But some of the briefs in this casetell us that involved in is not affecting commerce, thatindeed this is the only piece of Federal legislation thatuses the words, involved in.  Is that so?          MR. NAGLE:  To my knowledge it is, and that'swhat the Court indicated in the Allied-Bruce decision.          QUESTION:  So -- but you're asking us to saythat Congress meant in 1925 something different in usingthese two words.          MR. NAGLE:  In involving commerce says, as thisCourt found in Allied-Bruce, that it's the functionalequivalent of affecting commerce, which is --          QUESTION:  Well, let's be precise about thewords.  Are we talk about, involved in commerce, orinvolving commerce?          MR. NAGLE:  Involving commerce, in section 2,                             91 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the coverage.          QUESTION:  That's quite different than involvedin commerce.  You can say someone is involved in commerce.I think that's quite different from saying that somehowthis -- it's a contract involving commerce.          MR. NAGLE:  I -- I'm sorry, Your Honor, I'm notusing the phrase, involved in --          QUESTION:  I think it's important to your casethat involving commerce is a broader concept than involvedin commerce.          MR. NAGLE:  Yes, Your Honor.  I"m not aware thatinvolved --          QUESTION:  Involving commerce means pertainingto commerce.          MR. NAGLE:  Yes, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Involved in commerce means prettymuch the same as engaged in commerce, it seems to me, andso if involving commerce is the same as involved incommerce, and involved in commerce is the same as engagedin commerce, you lose.          MR. NAGLE:  Your Honor, I --          QUESTION:  To put it shortly.          MR. NAGLE:  I am not referring to the phrase,involved in commerce.          QUESTION:  Because it doesn't appear.  The10 1    phrase is involving commerce. 2              MR. NAGLE:  Yes, Your Honor. 3              QUESTION:  That's the broad coverage of4 section -- 5              MR. NAGLE:  Section 2, yes. 6              QUESTION:  Of section 2. 7              MR. NAGLE:  Yes.  Section 1's exclusion is for 8    contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, and 9    other workers engaged in commerce.10              QUESTION:  And they could have said in that11    section, don't you think -- do you think it would have12    been any different if they had said, seamen involved in13    commerce, as opposed to engaged in commerce?14              MR. NAGLE:  As Your Honor has recognized, they15    did not use involved in.  That perhaps would have16    supported Mr. Adams' argument that they were trying to17    show parallel construction. I would submit, Your Honor,18    that the fact that the Congress could have ended with the19    phrase, contracts of employment, then we would not be here20    today if that was their intent, or could have used21    parallel language, which would have supported respondent's22    suggestion that they had the same meaning.23              QUESTION:  But isn't the Congress' notion of the24    limits of its power, doesn't that explain why they didn't25    say contract of employment, period?11 1              MR. NAGLE:  I would not, Your Honor, because if 2    section 2 is the coverage provision and Congress was 3    making reference to its Commerce Clause power in coverage, 4    there would certainly be no reason for them to make 5    reference to or be concerned by the limits of their 6    Commerce Clause power in drafting an exclusion from the 7    statute. If they had -- 8              QUESTION:  Well, can you give us a better 9    explanation?  I mean, this goes back to Justice O'Connor's10    question about the oddity of an exclusion which excluded11    those contracts which were most obviously at the time of12    drafting within the congressional power, without touching13    those as to which the power was doubtful, or perhaps14    absent, and as I understood your answer, your answer was a15    suggestion that perhaps politics was simply the answer.  I16    mean, the one particular political group had asked for it.17              Can you think of any other reason to draw what18    to me also seems like an odd distinction in the19    congressional mind?20              MR. NAGLE:  I would point to Judge Posner's21    opinion in the Pryner case out of the Seventh Circuit, in22    which he concluded that the Seventh Circuit concluded in23    his opinion that this section 1 exclusion should be24    narrow.  He pointed again to the advocacy of the seamen's25    union, and the recognition that they were a heavily121    regulated industry that already had a statute in place2    that provided for an administrative process for resolution3    of disputes.45 seamen? 6 7    that the railroad industry, the Railway Labor Act was in 8    the works at the time. 9              QUESTION:  Okay.10              MR. NAGLE:  It was also a similarly heavily11    regulated --12              QUESTION:  All right.13              MR. NAGLE:  -- heavily unionized industry, and14    Judge Posner's opinion goes on that Congress may have15    anticipated, quite correctly, that motor carriers would16    also become a heavily regulated industry, and in the --QUESTION:  Then why didn't they just stop withMR. NAGLE:  His -- Judge Posner's suggestion is1718    that?19              I'm wondering, under your view, are employees of20    travel agents covered within the exclusion, or are they21    covered?22232425QUESTION:  What conclusion do you draw from          MR. NAGLE:  Travel agents, I would -- under ourinterpretation I do not believe that they would be coveredbecause they're not engaged --QUESTION:  How about ticket agents for                  131 railroads?2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. NAGLE:  Railroad employees, to the extentthat they fall within the definition of employee, forinstance, under the Railway Labor Act, I would submit thatbecause railroad employees is a -- or employees is a termunder that statute, which includes various employees --          QUESTION:  So you draw a distinction betweenticket agents who sell them as employees of the railroadand those who sell them as employees of the travel agent?          MR. NAGLE:  I draw a distinction --          QUESTION:  You think that's what Congress had in          MR. NAGLE:  I draw the distinction becauseCongress specifically referred to railroad employees.When we get into travel agents -- and I apologize if youwere saying employees of railroads who are travel agents,but I think --          QUESTION:  -- railroad employees engaged inforeign or interstate commerce.          MR. NAGLE:  Yes, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  But I take it what you're suggesting,you have to give some content to other class of workersengaged in commerce.  Don't you suggest that that'sengaged in transportation or something?          MR. NAGLE:  Yes, Your Honor.  Certainly, in                            14101112    mind?13141516171819202122232425 1    trying to read the statute -- 2              QUESTION:  You see, if we accept your view we 3    have to have a jurisprudence of what transportation is. 4    If we accept the respondent's view, we have to have a 5    jurisprudence on what an employment contract is.  Both 6    require interpretation, but the latter is a statutory7 term. 8              MR. NAGLE:  Yes, Your Honor. 9              QUESTION:  The former is not.10              MR. NAGLE:  I would acknowledge that in order to11    determine the meaning of the final phrase there, any other12    class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate13    commerce, that we need to -- that we need primarily to14    recognize the doctrine of ejusdem generis, and the fact15    that it does follow after the references to seamen and16    railroad employees.17              They are specific groups in a list.  They18    certainly have something in common, that being that they19    are transportation workers, and I would also submit that20    it's inappropriate to read a statute to eliminate the21    reference to seamen and railroad employees.  If reading it22    as respondent contends, it's essentially an exclusion for23    all contracts of employment of all workers engaged in24    foreign or interstate commerce, and that's, as Judge25    Edwards said in the Cole v. Burns Security case --15 1              QUESTION:  Well, I suppose their answer is, 2    Congress has already regulated seamen, they're about to 3    regulate railroad employees, so they want to make very 4    sure that those are excluded, and then they go on to the 5    limits of their Commerce power, which were vague at the 6    time, and give everyone else the same protection that 7    seamen and railroad workers have. 8              MR. NAGLE:  I simply don't think that that 9    conforms with the statute.  If we are just reading the10    exclusion, Congress has -- section 2, the coverage is very11    broad, using the language to demonstrate the breadth of12    coverage.  The exclusion is very narrow, and if one13    chooses to look to the legislative history that Mr. Adams14    and his amici point to, there's very, very limited15    legislative history.  There's essentially one hearing16    before a Senate committee in 1923 with three Senators17 present.18              QUESTION:  Well, skipping the legislative19    history, Mr. Nagle, why is it so narrow?  It says, engaged20    in commerce, and even in 1925 that extended beyond21    transportation workers.  You want the cutoff to be22    transportation workers, I take it.23              MR. NAGLE:  Your Honor, I'm not aware of cases24    that in 1925 would have said, engaged in commerce would go25    beyond transportation workers.  I think that involving161    commerce would -- the section 2 language goes to the2    breadth of it, but in commerce, this Court, as I3    mentioned, Illinois Central Railroad case, the Gulf Oil4    Corporation case, the Bunte Brothers case, in each of5    those the Court said that in commerce is not the6    equivalent of affecting commerce.7              In the Bunte Brothers case the Court said, words8    derive vitality from the aim and nature of the specific9    legislation.10111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  So communications workers, those werenot included as engaged in commerce?          MR. NAGLE:  They would not have been included asengaged in commerce.          QUESTION:  You say as of 1925, the only workersengaged in commerce were those who were engaged in themoving of goods, is that --          MR. NAGLE:  In the movement of people and goodsacross State lines, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Well, if that's the case, then Ithink what we're faced with on your own interpretation isan exclusion which is as complete in relation to thecoverage of employees as the inclusion at the beginning ofthe provision is in relation to commerce in general, andso it seems to me that your argument supports theinterpretive theory that Congress was, in fact, in each17 1    instance, in the coverage and in the exclusion, 2    legislating to the limits, and if the limits change as to 3    the one, we ought to recognize a change in the limits as 4    to the other. 5              MR. NAGLE:  I would disagree, Your Honor, in -- 6    with respect to the example that Justice Ginsburg just 7    gave, with respect to telephone, telegraph workers.  In 8    1877 this Court in the Pensacola Telegraph case had found 9    that telephone telegraph workers affected commerce, were10    involved in commerce, but they were not engaged in11    commerce in that they were not actually moving goods --12    certainly we would acknowledge that telephone operators13    were not moving goods across State lines.14              QUESTION:  When you are talking about all15    workers, a lot of water has flowed over the dam or under16    the bridge since 1925.17              MR. NAGLE:  Yes, Your Honor.18              QUESTION:  I just would like to focus, you to19    focus for a minute on the consequences.  One of the things20    that's strongest for you is that in all the other circuits21    but the Ninth, for a long time have limited to22    transportation workers this exemption.23              MR. NAGLE:  Certainly, Your Honor.24              QUESTION:  So what bad would happen if we bought25    the Ninth Circuit?  That is, in thinking about it, I18 1    thought that the purpose of this act is to stop State 2    court hostility to arbitration.  Isn't that the basic3 idea? 4              MR. NAGLE:  Yes, Your Honor. 5              QUESTION:  All right.  So if we read workers out 6    of it you still have the NLRB there today, and doesn't the 7    NLRB have the power today to protect any worker, just -- 8    you wouldn't need this -- to protect them because the NLRB 9    operating under section 301, or just its general power,10    could protect all these workers adequately, and therefore11    there's no reason not to read them out and to invent12    distinctions between transportation and other kinds of13    worker.  Now, what's your response to that?14              MR. NAGLE:  Well, certainly the National Labor15    Relations Act and the Labor Management Relations Act come16    into play in the collective bargaining context.17              QUESTION:  Who wouldn't they have power to18    protect?  Who wouldn't they have power -- if the States19    become unreasonable in respect to arbitration, i.e., they20    stop enforcing arbitration agreements with workers,21    couldn't the NLRB come right in there and say, don't be22    unreasonable, we want the right rules here, and we'll both23    get the arbitration and protect the workers?24              Is there anyone on -- in other words, on the25    Ninth Circuit interpretation, that's somehow going to be19 1    left out in the cold when they want an arbitration 2    agreement? 3              MR. NAGLE:  Your Honor, certainly the Ninth 4    Circuit started its analysis in the Craft case, which was 5    a collective bargaining agreement case -- 6              QUESTION:  I mean, I'm interested in a practical 7    fact.  This statute is to stop the hostility of the States 8    to arbitration.  I wouldn't want workers who wanted 9    arbitration to be left out in the cold, any more than10    anybody else, and then I thought, well, if we accept the11    Ninth Circuit they're not going to be left out in the12    cold, because they have the NLRB in there to protect them13    and, moreover, it will help them somewhat in terms of the14    purposes because they won't get these agreements shoved in15    their face and they will be able perhaps to have more16    freedom to choose.17              But I'm not -- I'm not expressing a view on18    that.  Whatever the right thing is, we have people there19    on the board to protect them.  That's -- so in other20    words, if I deny your interpretation, am I causing any21    harm?  Leaving the words out of it, I want to know the22    consequences.23 24 25          MR. NAGLE:  The consequences, Your Honor, isthat arbitration and the Federal policy favoringarbitration, which is designed to reduce litigation, will20 1    lead to a period of tremendous turmoil while the courts 2    are trying to grapple with the application and enforcement 3    of arbitration agreements. 4              The extent to which they're enforceable under 5    various laws, choice of law provisions, when arbitration 6    agreements contain a governing law provision, the question 7    that I think is very significant, although it's only 8    mentioned in Mr. Adams' brief in footnote 19, the question 9    of arbitrability of Federal employment statutes, if the10    FAA is taken out of the mix, where this Court relied in11    part on the liberal Federal policy favoring arbitration in12    Gilmer and used that to -- as a consideration with respect13    to enforcement of arbitration agreements, if the FAA is14    taken out of the mix, I think note 19 in Adams' brief15    suggests that there's an effort to avoid arbitration of16    even the Federal claims, and --17              QUESTION:  Well, even if the FAA doesn't apply18    to employment contracts, State arbitration rules can --19    they can be used, can they not?20              MR. NAGLE:  There are State arbitration rules21    which vary dramatically from State to State, Your Honor,22    certainly.  That I think does not solve the issue,23    because, as this Court has recognized on a number of24    occasions, one of the great advantages of the broad25    application of the FAA is providing that substantive law21 1    of arbitrability. 2              If we are to revert back to the State 3    substantive law of arbitrability, we will have the 4    determinations made on various statutes, we'll have the 5    issues that arise when a contract arbitration agreement is 6    entered into in one State, performed in a third, a claim 7    is brought in a third, we'll have removal to Federal court 8    and a question of which State substantive statute on 9    arbitrability --10              QUESTION:  Why would you have removal to the11    Federal court unless you had diversity if it's State law12    that controls?13              MR. NAGLE:  In -- there may be cases where there14    is diversity, just a --15              QUESTION: Well, if these are employment16    relations, wouldn't most of them be diversity -- most of17    them be nondiverse, that is, a worker and employer in the18    same State?19              MR. NAGLE:  I would disagree, Your Honor.  I20    think there are many large national corporations that --21    such as Circuit City which is primarily -- principal place22    of business is in Virginia, and so to the extent that23    large companies have employees in many States there may24    very well be diversity, and then when the matter is25    removed on diversity grounds there will be the question as22 1    to which State substantive law of arbitrability would 2    apply. 3              QUESTION:  Wouldn't it be the place where the 4    work is performed? 5              MR. NAGLE:  Well, it may be, Your Honor.  On 6    some occasions this Court has had arbitration agreements 7    such as in Allied-Bruce, where it was essentially one 8    sentence in a termite prevention contract.  A number of 9    employers since Gilmer, and in reliance on Gilmer, have10    developed very sophisticated arbitration programs which11    include, among other things, governing law provisions, and12    so you may have a corporation which is based in one State,13    has a detailed arbitration rules and procedures, as14    Circuit City does --15              QUESTION:  Nevertheless, it would be State law16    that would control, some State law.17              MR. NAGLE:  It will be some State law.  One of18    the issues that the courts will need to determine is when19    we have a governing law provision such as in the Circuit20    City agreement, specifying that the Virginia Uniform21    Arbitration Act would apply, and then the question will22    arise whether, for instance, California would honor that23    reference to that State statute.24              I think it's simply an issue that the courts25    will have to grapple with for a number of years until231 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425someone returns here on that issue.          QUESTION:  Mr. Nagle, at the time this -- theexclusion was passed, can you tell me whether it wascustomary to require each party to bear a portion of thecost of the arbitration, so was it -- would it have beencustomary at that time to require employees to pay part ofthe up-front arbitration costs?          MR. NAGLE:  Your Honor, I didn't hear thebeginning.  Are you saying in 1925 --          QUESTION:  Yes.          MR. NAGLE:  -- would it have been customary?          QUESTION:  Yes.          MR. NAGLE:  It was an administrative machinerythat was put in place.  I cannot represent to the Courtthat it would have been customary on that.  I do not know,Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Could you tell me just for therecord, what are the best cases that you have to establishthe proposition that at the time this legislation wasenacted it was already well-established that engaged incommerce was not the limit of the Congress' power overinterstate commerce?  What are your best cases?          MR. NAGLE:  Illinois Central Railroad v.Behrens, the Shanks v. Delaware, the railroad case.  Thoseare pre-FAA cases.  Certainly subsequent interpretation,24 1    if you look at Bunte Brothers case, which was involving -- 2    I'm sorry.  In commerce was not equivalent to affecting 3    commerce.  It was sometime later, but it referred to the 4    Clayton Act, which had been passed in 1908. 5              In fact, another point to note on that case is 6    that they noted where it was reenacted in 1950, and that 7    Congress did not change the language, despite the fact 8    that this Court had made clear there was a difference 9    between in commerce and affecting commerce.  The10    reenactment without change seemed to suggest that Congress11    had acquiesced in that.12              I would point out that the Federal Arbitration13    Act was reenacted in 1949 without change, after the law14    had become quite clear over that respect.15              QUESTION:  Have you -- just, I want to be sure16    you give us your best answer to Justice O'Connor's initial17    question as to the reason why there's this rather narrow18    exception from a broad provision.19              MR. NAGLE:  I would say that while Congress'20    motives are not always clear, and the very limited21    legislative history doesn't provide any guidance on that,22    what we know is that Mr. Furiceff of the Seamen's Union23    specifically asked that his union be carved out.  We know24    that seamen and railroad employees were groups that25    already had by statute an administrative mechanism for25 1    resolution of disputes. 2              Pryner and Asplundh Tree both point out that 3    they were heavily regulated, and that there -- I would 4    conclude, if I could, that there is nothing in the 5    legislative history to suggest that Congress was 6    contemplating the scope of its authority when it crafted 7    the words in section 1. 8              If I may reserve the remainder of my time. 9              QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Nagle.10              Mr. Rubin, we'll hear from you.11                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL RUBIN12                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT13              MR. RUBIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please14 the Court:15              We agree with petitioner in response to the16    question from Justice Scalia that the focus of the Court's17    inquiry today has to be on what Congress meant in 1925,18    whether it intended the section 1 exclusion to go -- to19    remain symmetrical with the section 2 coverage.20              QUESTION:  In 19 --21              QUESTION:  Mr. Rubin, if your position is22    correct, why didn't, in section 1, Congress simply stop23    with, shall apply to contracts of employment, period?24              MR. RUBIN:  Congress could have done it that25    way, but it used the language that was presented to it by2612345678    1925.9Secretary Hoover, who stated -- whose letter was both inthe 1923 committee hearing and was also reprinted in the1924 committee hearing.                Secretary Hoover --                MR. RUBIN:  It was enacted into law in February                QUESTION:  '25.1011    the seamen's union expressed concerns not only about its12    application to seamen, but according to Mr. Furiceff to13    seamen, railroad men and sundry other workers in14    interstate and foreign commerce, wrote a letter to the15    chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee in which he said,16    if there appear to be objections to the inclusion of17    workers' contracts, then he proposes that the following18    language be used.19              The language that he proposed is the identical20    language that Congress used in the section 1 exclusion.21 While --22              QUESTION:  That's very good sleuthing, but I23    mean, this is a letter.  This is not even a committee24    report.  It is a letter sent 2 years before this statute25    is enacted, and you want us to assume that that is the27          QUESTION:  When was the bill actually passed?When was the law passed?MR. RUBIN:  Secretary Hoover, just 2 weeks after1    only reason, not only that Congress didn't end the2    sentence in section 1 with employment contracts, but it3    is -- but also it explains why Congress didn't at least,4    if it was not going to end the sentence there, at least5    use the same language in section 1 that it did in section6 2. 789MR. RUBIN:  There is --          QUESTION:  I mean, that is a very difficultthing to explain.101112131415    it.16              QUESTION:  I gather he failed, since he sent the17    letter in 1923 and the bill was passed in 1925.          MR. RUBIN:  There is a linguistic explanationfor what they did.  While Congress could have limited thatway had it been presented in a different way, Congress' --Secretary Hoover asked Congress to expedite passage of thebill to satisfy the commercial interests who were urging18              (Laughter.)19              MR. RUBIN:  He did -- he was successful in20    getting the language that he proposed included in the bill21    immediately after he proposed it, but why is the22    additional language in there, what purpose does it serve,23    because that, I think, is the response to the Chief24    Justice's question.25              Well, we start with the first two phrases, the28 1    first two classes, seamen, and railroad employees.  Now, 2    in 1925, given how limited Congress' Commerce Clause power 3    was, there weren't that many categories of workers who 4    were actually covered by Congress. In fact, the only 5    private sector employees that were covered by any Federal 6    statute under the Commerce Clause power in 1925 were 7    seamen and railroad employees, so not only was -- 8              QUESTION:  They were covered by the Commerce 9    Clause power, or by any Federal statutes?10              MR. RUBIN:  I'm sorry.  They were covered by11    Federal statutes.12              QUESTION:  By Federal statutes.13              MR. RUBIN:  Excuse me if I misspoke.14              QUESTION:  No, I --15              MR. RUBIN:  Then -- then, because the objection16    from labor, which Secretary Hoover at least urged Congress17    to overcome, however quickly or not it might have18    happened, referred more broadly to all classes of19    employees, because the underlying concern was the20    disparity in bargaining power, as this Court acknowledged21    in Prima Paint in its footnote 9, when it referred to the22    section 1 exclusion, because the disparity in bargaining23    power applies between all workers and bosses as perceived24    by labor at the time, and as reflected by Congress in 193225    in the Norris La Guardia Act.  Congress went beyond that.291 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  This would include an employmentcontract between a CEO and a corporation, I assume, right?You're --          MR. RUBIN:  There is --          QUESTION:  I mean, you're painting this as --          MR. RUBIN:  Our position is yes.          QUESTION:  Your position is simply covering thehard-hat-lunch-bucket worker, but I assume it would covera contract between a CEO and his corporation.                MR. RUBIN:  Just like FELA at the time, we      believe, would have covered an on-the-job injury by a high      executive of a railroad company, it is our construction      that worker and employee means anyone employed by a      company.  There is an amicus brief that argues otherwise.                QUESTION:  Yes, because you'd say that it covers      workers, and workers might have had a definition at the      time that did not include the CEO.                MR. RUBIN:  That is possible.                QUESTION:  We don't have to decide that.                MR. RUBIN:  You certainly do not have to decide                QUESTION:  Mr. Rubin, what was well-established23    as of 1925 about the meaning of Congress' power?  Was it24    well-established that engaged in commerce was narrower25    than Congress' full power?  Was there already the30101112131415161718192021    that.221 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425affecting commerce notion --          MR. RUBIN:  There was not.          QUESTION:  -- floating out there?          MR. RUBIN:  There was not.  We have citednumerous statutes, as well as cases of the time.  There isnot a single statute in effect in 1925 or a casedescribing the commerce power as it pertained to employeesthat used a broader term than engaged in.          QUESTION:  What about the case cited by opposingcounsel, Behrens.          MR. RUBIN:  Behrens and Shanks.  The Behrens andShanks case arose under the amended FELA, the 1908 versionof FELA.  That act referred initially to engaged in, butthen on two separate occasions had what we characterize asa temporal limitation.  It said, while engaged in.          It specifically limited the scope to less thanthe full commerce power, as would have been expressed bythe term, engaged in, and in Shanks and in Behrens, and inseveral other cases, this Court expressly noted thatwhether workers were covered by the amended FELA or not,turned upon whether the injury they suffered occurredwhile they were engaged in.          It didn't focus on the type of work theygenerally performed.  It -- for instance, in Behrens, Ibelieve, the worker was working on an interstate --31 1    intrastate traffic.   His job often included interstate 2    traffic.  He would be engaged in commerce, but because at 3    the time he was hit by the locomotive he was engaged in 4    solely intrastate work, the Court said that, given the 5    temporal limitation of FELA, it doesn't apply. 6              So those cases support our position.  Shanks in 7    particular supports our position because Shanks goes to -- 8    the FELA law was very complicated.  There were many, many 9    cases coming before this Court trying to decide who is and10    who is not covered by the various limitations.  Shanks11    goes through and summarizes the Supreme Court12    jurisprudence of the time under FELA and makes very clear13    that engaged in is as broad as it gets, because it14    includes not just those narrowly working on the trains as15    they were going down the tracks, but everyone whose job is16    sufficiently related as to be practically a part of the17    interstate commerce.18              So at the time, in 1925, engaged in was a term19    of art.  It was a term of art that reached to the full20    scope of Congress' commerce power.  That is to complete21    the answer as to -- actually, it doesn't quite complete22    the answer, because there are still some words that we23    have to address.  That explains, we believe, why there was24    the reference to in -- engaged in foreign or interstate25    commerce, because that was the common use of art321 whenever -- 2              QUESTION:  But it wasn't -- but then they would 3    have used it in section 2.  I mean, you have a very 4    difficult phenomenon to explain, that is the fact that 5    Congress obviously and intentionally used different 6    language in section 1 and section 2.  That is just 7    terrible drafting, just terrible drafting if Congress was 8    trying to do what you say they were trying to do. 9              MR. RUBIN:  The two sections were drafted at10    different times by different people.  A --11              QUESTION:  That may well be, but --12              MR. RUBIN:  A --13              QUESTION:  -- that's terrible drafting.14              MR. RUBIN:  The --15              QUESTION:  I mean, Congress is supposed to come16    up with a coherent bill, and we usually assume it was all17    drafted at the same time and somebody sat down and used18    the same words to mean the same things throughout the19    statute, and we usually assume that when they use20    different words they mean different things.21              MR. RUBIN:  There is a reason why the locutions22    in section 2 are different from those in section 1, and23    that is because the language in section 2, the coverage24    provision refers to -- and it's an odd locution, one that25    we've certainly not seen in other statutes -- contract33 1    evidencing a transaction involving commerce. 2              The word engaged, had engaged come first, would 3    not have fit in that phrase, because there can't be a 4    contract evidencing a transaction engaged in commerce, 5    because a transaction cannot engage in commerce. 6              By the same token, in the section 1 exclusion it 7    would have made no sense to use the word, involving, 8    because workers aren't involving commerce.  Now, perhaps 9    they're involved in --10              QUESTION:  They're engaged in businesses11    involving commerce.  Workers in businesses involving12 commerce.13              MR. RUBIN:  Then that has --14              QUESTION:  I mean, it's so easy to do.15              MR. RUBIN:  It both adds more words, it does not16    respond to the concerns of those --17              QUESTION:  If you're worried about adding words,18    they could have ended it after workers and it would have19    achieved the same result.20              MR. RUBIN:  It does not address the concerns of21    those who were objecting, because it used the exact22    language that they proposed.23              There's one more phrase that I haven't24    addressed, and that's the any other.  I know Justice25    Kennedy asked about the class, but the complete phrase is,34 1    any other class of workers and, as this Court has stated 2    on several occasions, when Congress uses terms such as -- 3    in fact, when it uses the language, any other, it means 4    exactly that, any other.  That's as broad as it gets. 5              That is language without limitation, and instead 6    of saying, any other class of workers in transportation, 7    which is essentially what petitioner's argument would have 8    the Court read section 1 to mean, commerce was a defined 9    term of art.  Section 1 itself defined commerce as,10    interstate or foreign commerce, as broad as it gets.  It11    didn't say, commerce means transportation.12              Petitioner would not only have the Court adopt13    the illogical explanation that Congress excluded from this14    bill those workers over whom its commerce power was the15    clearest and federalize the law of arbitration only those16    as to whom I believe Justice O'Connor said was most17    questionable --18              QUESTION:  Mr. Rubin, there's also the phrase,19    contract of employment.  You were candid in telling us20    that you consider workers to include any employee, even21    managerial employees.  What about collective bargaining22    contracts?  Are they -- where do they stand as -- do they23    fall within the section 1 exclusion?24              MR. RUBIN:  Yes, and in fact the majority of the25    circuits agree with the proposition that collective35 1    bargaining agreements are excluded.  Various amici have 2    totalled up, I think 5 to 3, but yes, collective 3    bargaining agreements -- 4              QUESTION:  How was that consistent with -- we're 5    told that the Ninth Circuit is the only one that holds 6    that all employment contracts are out under section 1,7 but -- 8              MR. RUBIN:  I believe the more accurate 9    statement would be that those circuits that focused solely10    on individual employment contracts drew that distinction,11    because in fact, going back to 20, 25 years, the majority12    of the circuits have said the collective bargaining13    agreements are excluded.14              The practical effect is minimal, because the15    Labor Management Relations Act, Section 301, as this Court16    clearly held in Lincoln Mills v. Textile Workers, does17    ensure the Federal common law of arbitrability for18    collective bargaining agreements.19              QUESTION:  What was the reasoning in the20    circuits for saying that collective bargaining contracts21    are excluded?  Is it that they were not contracts of22    employment?23 24 25          MR. RUBIN:  No, no, no.  It's precisely theopposite, because they were contracts of employment of anyother class of workers.361 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  And some of the examples involvecollective bargaining agreements outside of thetransportation industry.          MR. RUBIN:  Yes.  Yes.          QUESTION:  But why wouldn't those courts havesaid that the National Labor Relations Act is just asuperseding statute?          MR. RUBIN:  The National -- the -- section 301of the LMRA is a different statute.          QUESTION:  Or, LMRA, yes.          MR. RUBIN:  Is a -- well, this Court in LincolnMills was faced with a choice as to whether, in decidingto hold collective bargaining agreement arbitrationprovisions enforceable, it should do so under the FAA, asthe lower court had held, by the way, in the Fifth Circuitin Lincoln Mills, or whether to hold it enforceable undersection 301, which was enacted in 1947.          The Court chose section 301.  The Court made noreference whatsoever in its opinion to the FAA, and that'swhere Justice Frankfurter in his dissent first laid outthe argument that we're following up on in our briefs tosay that the FAA is inapplicable for this --          QUESTION:  Why doesn't the 301 reasoning explainwhat the circuits have done and say, well, these are justcontrolled by another statute?371 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112131415161718192021222324    mine.25              The question I have is the same I addressed to38          MR. RUBIN:  The circuits who have drawn thatdistinction have not relied on 301.  Sometimes the casesarise in the question of which statute of limitationsapplies, whether you borrow the Federal Arbitration Actstatute of limitations or not, but that hasn't been thedistinguishing characteristic and, of course, this casenot being a collective bargaining agreement, certainlyLMRA section 301 does not apply to this case.          QUESTION:  Is it true that all the othercircuits but the Ninth have restricted this totransportation workers?          MR. RUBIN:  No.  Some have, as we pointed out,restricted it to employees of common carriers.          QUESTION:  Well, all right, but I mean,restricted it, then it can't be that there are a lot ofcircuits that have held that collective bargainingagreements are excluded as a contract of other workers.MR. RUBIN:  Well, there are --QUESTION:  All right.MR. RUBIN:  I think the First, Fourth, Fifth,Sixth, and Tenth have -- and the Ninth.          QUESTION:  I don't see the consistency there,but I need -- that isn't your problem at the moment, nor 1    your brother over -- as I understand it -- this is 752 years ago. 3              MR. RUBIN:  Yes. 4              QUESTION:  It's an old statute. 5              MR. RUBIN:  Yes. 6              QUESTION:  And it's possible the language is 7    open and, given that possibility, I'd like to know what 8    the consequence is.  As far as I understand it, when I'm 9    focusing on workers -- and I believe there still is10    hostility to arbitration in the States, and I also think11    that there are a lot of unfair arbitration agreements, but12    there are even more that are fair and many of them help13    the average worker, maybe not your client.14              All right.  Given that background, who's going15    to be left out in the cold?  Are there a class of workers16    such that if we accept the Ninth Circuit they will17    suddenly not be able to get arbitration agreements that18    might help them because of State hostility or complex19    State rules, et cetera?20              MR. RUBIN:  No.21              QUESTION:  Can the NLRA, NLRB take jurisdiction22    over such a class?23              MR. RUBIN:  There --24              QUESTION:  Is there a problem?25              MR. RUBIN:  There are several levels of391 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425responses, but I think to address what I understand yourconcern to be, workers and employers can always enter intovoluntary arbitration agreements.  They can always decidebetween themselves after a dispute arises, for example,that they choose to pursue an arbitration mechanism ratherthan to go into court.          If they agree to arbitrate, there is no problem.It's not like the old common law hostility to arbitration.There's no question that it would be enforceable.          QUESTION:  Your response is, then, look, theycan still agree, just not in the employment contract.          MR. RUBIN:  They -- in a few -- the ultimateissue here is whether States can determine whether theemployment relationships in those States, whether anarbitration agreement is enforceable or not.          QUESTION:  Well, you're going to be --          MR. RUBIN:  In those --          QUESTION:  You're going to be arbitrating underthe kind of agreements you describe simply between the --either under State law or under Federal law, aren't you?I mean, there's no other way to do it.          MR. RUBIN:  If someone is to go to court --          QUESTION:  Yes.          MR. RUBIN:  -- to enforce an arbitrationagreement that one side is objecting to --                            40QUESTION:  Right.12345678    things.9              I really don't think that that's what's going on          MR. RUBIN:  Yes.  It's either the State law orthe Federal law that will apply in this case determineswhether --          QUESTION:  Mr. Rubin, your argument assumes thatgiving a broader modern meaning to section 2 and giving abroader modern meaning to section 1 are one and the same10    here.  I mean, what you're really asking us to do is to11    change the language of section 1 in light of the fact that12    we now know that Congress could have gone further than it13    chose to go in that language.  I don't know any other case14    where we've done that.15              You're not asking us to simply give that16    language its modern, more expansive meaning.  You're17    asking us to say, you know, in light of the fact that we18    now know that it's not just employees engaged in19    interstate commerce who can be covered.  Had Congress20    known that then, they would have written a different21    provision and so, Supreme Court, why don't you rewrite it22    for Congress, because they surely would have put it this23    way if they had known then what we know now.  Do you know24    any case where we've done that?25              MR. RUBIN:  I'm not asking you to rewrite the41 1    language, Justice Scalia.  I'm asking you to accept that 2    Congress in 1925 saw a symmetry, saw an objection, 3    responded to it by making sure that any worker that might 4    be -- if there were any worker out there whose contract of 5    employment evidenced a transaction involving commerce, 6    they would be taken out of the act completely. 7              QUESTION:  You're saying they saw a symmetry 8    which now no longer exists because we've given the first 9    part a much broader meaning, and now this other part,10    which they once thought was symmetrical, is no longer11    symmetrical, so now we should read it to mean something12 more --13              MR. RUBIN:  To --14              QUESTION:  -- than a class of workers engaged in15    foreign or interstate commerce.16              MR. RUBIN:  To get back to the very first17    question you asked petitioner's counsel, what did Congress18    mean by the language used in 1925.  Involving, which had19    never been used before in a commerce relationship and has20    never been used since, could not have meant anything more21    than engaged in, because engaged in was as far as it got.22              So to the extent there has been a rewriting --23    and I'm not contending there's been a rewriting.  I'm24    contending there's been an application under the modern25    interpretation of the Commerce Clause.  As this Court in42 1    Terminex said, you have to look to see what Congress is 2    trying to achieve.  What were the purposes?  And when the 3    Court read, involved in -- 4              QUESTION:  Even when it doesn't achieve that by 5    reason of future changes, future changes in the law, or 6    future changes in circumstances.  What you're asking us to 7    do is, in light of future changes in the law, make this 8    statute read the way Congress thought it was going to 9    operate when it was enacted, but we don't usually do that.10    If, in fact, engaged in interstate commerce is something11    narrower and is no longer symmetrical, tough luck.12    Congress can amend it.  But we don't go around rewriting13    it in order to preserve symmetry.14              QUESTION:  Maybe your answer is, we've already15    rewritten section 2.16              MR. RUBIN:  In fact, in Terminex in 1925,17    that -- that's what happened.  The language in 192518    maintained that symmetry, maintained that symmetry for19    purposes that were stated that are in the record.  There20    is no indication of any reason why Congress would have21    disrupted that symmetry, what purposes could be served,22    how it could be --23              QUESTION:  But it isn't symmetry.  I mean,24    there's different language used in the two sections.25              MR. RUBIN:  It's symmetry, Your Honor, in the431    sense that because some felt that the coverage language2    might encompass workers' contracts of employment,3    Congress, to the fullest extent it could, pulled those4    workers out. 5 6    symmetry. 7 8    The concept is the word that I'm trying to convey to the 9    Court, and the concept is the concept of ensuring that no10    contracts of employment that might be covered under11    Congress' commerce power would be covered.  One provision12    should not be read dynamically, as this Court did in13    Terminex, while the other is read statically.  There's no14    indication that Congress intended that.15              Congress didn't use the word, transportation.16    It had enacted numerous statutes by 1925 that had limited17    the scope to transportation, or to common carriers, or to18    common carriers by railroad.  It had that language readily19    available to it had it intended the carve-out, but there20    is no gap between the section 2 coverage and the section 121    exclusion and, therefore, just as in 1925, all workers'22    contracts of employment were excluded, any other class of23    workers, the broadest possible language, so, too, we urge24    the Court to construe the statute that way now.25              If there are no further questions --44QUESTION:  That's a very odd definition ofMR. RUBIN:  Symmetry may not be the right word. 1              QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Rubin. 2              MR. RUBIN:  Thank you. 3              QUESTION:  Mr. Nagle, you have 2 minutes4 remaining. 5                REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID E. NAGLE 6                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 7              MR. NAGLE:  Thank you.  Very briefly, first, 8    with respect to the particular questions that have arisen 9    regarding our citation of Behrens, I would ask the Court10    to look at the sections on pages 7 and 8 of our reply11    brief, where we specifically tried to address that the12    1925 Congress that had used the words, engaging in13    interstate commerce, that -- I'm sorry, with respect to14    Behrens, had indicated that that applied only to employees15    who were actually engaged in interstate transportation or16    closely related functions, and not to other employees that17    Congress had the constitutional authority to regulate.18              QUESTION:  You cite Behrens -- you cite -- never19    mind.  Go ahead.20              MR. NAGLE:  Yes, Your Honor.  With respect to21    the questions on section 301 of the Labor Management22    Relations Act, that, of course, affects those in the23    unionized context.  I would note, as Justice Scalia had24    pointed out, that this would lead to the anomalous result25    that a CEO of a multinational corporation who has an45 1    arbitration provision in his or her employment contract, 2    that it would not be enforceable pursuant to the FAA. 3              I would note that in Prima Paint, at note 7, the 4    Court made reference -- albeit it in dicta the Court made 5    reference to certain kinds of employment contracts being 6    excluded under section 1, which is consistent with our 7    view that it was not intended to cover the entire range of 8    that which was covered. 9              Ultimately, I would suggest that as the court of10    appeals have consistently held, the narrow reading of11    section 1 is the only reason which is based on and12    consistent with the text, that makes use of the full text13    and conforms with the principles of statutory14    construction, so that we don't read words to be15    meaningless and that we do apply the canon of ejusdem16 generis.17              As this Court noted in Allied-Bruce, and18    particularly in Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion19    there, there's value in uniformity and stability of the20    case law which has developed.  Since Gilmer, untold number21    of agreements to arbitrate employment claims have been22    entered into in reliance, and I would suggest that23    Congress is certainly well aware of this case law24    development, has had the opportunity to correct it if they25    thought the Court had gotten it wrong, and they have461 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425declined to do so.          If there are no further questions --          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Nagle.The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m. the case in the above-entitled matter was submitted.)47
