Mr. Wallace and Mr. Hawkins, wewill recess at noon, come  back at 1:00 and finish up.          Mr. Wallace.           ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. WALLACE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court:          The National Labor Relations Act confersorganizational, representational, and bargaining rights onemployees, broadly defined, including professionalemployees, but it expressly excludes supervisors from thatprotected class.          The term, supervisors, is defined in section 211of the Act, which is set forth on page 2 of our brief, oralso on page 2 of our petition, and to be a supervisorunder this provision an employee must have authority inthe interest of the employer to perform one of 12specified supervisory functions, or effectively torecommend that such action be taken, and the employee'sexercise of that authority must not be of a merely routine3                                                                                                                                                 1    or clerical nature, but must require the use of 2    independent judgment. 3              In 1994, in NLRB v. Health Care and Retirement 4    Corporation, this Court held that the board had mistakenly 5    applied a special test of supervisory status for the 6    health care industry based on an incorrect interpretation 7    of the phrase, in the interest of the employer. 8              The Court held that the board had set up a false 9    dichotomy between action taken in connection with patient10    care and action taken in the interest of the employer,11    which is in the business of patient care, and in so doing,12    the Court did not at all suggest that the problem of13    reconciling the coverage of professional employees with14    the exclusion of supervisors was an insuperable one for15 the board.16              It suggested some possible approaches that17    might result in a defensible solution.  It specifically18    agreed with the proposition that phrases in section 21119    such as independent judgment and responsibly to direct,20    are ambiguous, and the board needs to be given ample room21    to apply them to different categories of employees.22              QUESTION:  So there were those three phrases23    that could possibly justify the exclusion of registered24    nurses generally, and one of them was disposed of in the25    earlier case.  There are two left, independent judgment,4                                                                                                                                                                                     1    and responsibly to direct, but the Government has chosen 2    not to put both in play in the present case, right?  Only 3    independent judgment is at issue here, so that if you lose 4    on this one, you still have the third swing, right? 5              MR. WALLACE:  Well, this was a determination 6    made by the board in going back to the drawingboard, so to7 speak. 8              QUESTION:  Well, that's the Government, right. 9    I understand.10              MR. WALLACE:  Yes, of course, but the board made11    a determination that responsibly to direct in the abstract12    need not be defined because it is always qualified by the13    exercise of independent judgment not of a routine nature14    in order for these determinations to be made, and early15    on, after Taft-Hartley was passed, the board got burned by16    courts of appeals in trying to interpret responsibly to17    direct, particularly in a case called Ohio Power.18              QUESTION:  The trouble is that hanging it all on19    independent judgment is -- that's much the broader way to20    go.  I think that suggests that no professional exercises21    independent judgment if he is acting on the basis of22    knowledge that is peculiar to his profession, or her23    profession, in the case of nurses, for the most part.24    What -- you really think you can sustain that position?25              MR. WALLACE:  Well, the board I think quite5                                                                                                                                                                                     1    properly on the basis of textual analysis of this 2    provision holds that there must be a nexus between the 3    exercise of independent judgment and the exercise of one 4    of the 12 categories of authority that define who is a 5    supervisor, because that is what is qualified by the 6    phrase, requiring the exercise of independent judgment. 7              QUESTION:  But your basic position is that 8    professional judgment is not independent judgment, that if 9    something is required to be done, and any qualified10    professional would do it that way, this is not independent11    judgment.  It comes closer to routine.12              MR. WALLACE:  Well, the -- if we're talking13    about when an employee is performing his own functions,14    his trade or his profession, carrying out his own tasks,15    that is not one of the functions that makes one a16    supervisor.17              QUESTION:  No, but let me give you a18    hypothetical, one that concerns me.19              Let's say that you have a registered nurse in20    charge of a health care facility, and one of her tasks is21    to assign the other health care personnel to one or22    another patient.  She says, we need more help here.  This23    patient is in more need of help.  The other patient is in24    less need of help.25              That seems to me to be supervisory activity,6                                                                                                                                                                                     1    even though it is based upon her medical expertise. 2    That's opposed to the situation in which the registered 3    nurse is merely supervising one of the practical nurses in 4    the care of a particular patient, and she says, you know, 5    put a bandage here, you know, or give him two aspirins. 6    There, you're not directing the employee to one task or 7    another.  You're telling that employee how to do the task 8    that employee is doing. 9              Well, if the registered nurse is really10    assigning all of the people, and saying, we need three11    more over here, we need two more down there, I don't know12    why that is not supervisory work.13              MR. WALLACE:  Well, assignment is a separate14    category in this, but let me respond more directly to your15    question.  If the nurse did not have anyone assisting her16    and had to decide which patient was in more acute need of17    care, the nurse would be making a professional judgment18    and carrying it out.  If the nurse has an extra pair of19    hands available with which the nurse has to communicate by20    more than brain waves in order to exercise the same21    professional responsibility, and this is a less-skilled22    employee, and the direction to that employee once that23    professional determination has been made falls into the24    category of routine, in giving the directions to the25    assistant, so that it would be in -- for purposes of7                                                                                                                                                                                     1    dividing labor and management, which is what this is 2    about, in the category that also would include the 3    journeyman directing his apprentice -- 4              QUESTION:  Sure, I understand.  I'm not sure 5    where you came out on the hypothetical I gave you.  Is 6    that nurse who is assigning other health care personnel to 7    one patient or another, on the basis of her expert medical 8    judgment of which patients need help more, is she in a 9    supervisory position, or not?10              MR. WALLACE:  That would depend on further11    inquiry about whether she is making determinations about12    how the staff is to be deployed beyond direction that she13    got from her --14              QUESTION:  Yes.  No, no.  It's her independent15    judgment.  The owner of the home tells her, you know, we16    have 30 personnel here, and you know, some of them are in17    this ward, some in that ward.  We don't know which ones18    are -- should be where.  It's up to you to assign them19    where they should be.20              MR. WALLACE:  That would be much further along21    what I think of as a spectrum between the journeyman22    apprentice and the managerial employees.23              QUESTION:  Mr. Wallace, maybe you can tell us24    when an RN, under the board's current definition, when25    would an RN not -- would be an uncovered employee and8                                                                                                                                                                                     1    would be ranked a supervisor, so that she would not come 2    under the Act's protection.  Maybe that would be better. 3    Give us examples of RN's under this test who would not 4    qualify as employees, but would be excluded as 5    supervisors. 6              MR. WALLACE:  Well, it was stipulated that the 7    nursing coordinator here, who had authority to hire and 8    fire, and made staffing decisions about who would be 9    working in the wings of this facility was a supervisor.10              QUESTION:  Isn't that just the question that11    Justice Scalia asked about staffing, making staffing12    decisions, who goes to which ward?13              MR. WALLACE:  If it became comparable to that,14    yes.  I mean --15              QUESTION:  Well, I thought in this very case,16    and maybe I'm wrong, but there is a mechanism whereby17    there's a registered nurse who's the building supervisor18    when the other folks aren't there, and that that amounts19    to about 72 percent of the time, in terms of total hours20    that the building is open, 24 hours a day, and there is an21    internal memo which states that these registered nurses,22    as building supervisors, are in charge of the facility,23    and all rehabilitation staff, and are ultimately24    responsible for quality patient care.25              Now, why isn't that using independent judgment?9                                                                                                                                                                                     1    I have a hard time understanding why a person under those 2    instructions, who is in charge, and the only person there 3    at the building, isn't exercising independent judgment 4    under your proposal. 5              MR. WALLACE:  Well, there's also a finding that 6    these registered nurses usually work on their own, without 7    any assistance in performing their duties, and the other 8    employees who may be present -- we're talking about the 9    evening hours when less is going on, are -- do not report10    to the nurse, whether she's the building supervisor or11    not, and are performing tasks that are laid out for them12    by management in the facility, so of course she would be13    using judgment in performing her own nursing services, to14    the extent they're called for.15              But what the board found in this case, the16    regional director found in the representation hearing, was17    that all that the building supervisor designation meant in18    practice was that she was to try to see to it that19    prescribed numbers of staff, and we're talking about20    rather small numbers, were met, previously prescribed21    staffing --22              QUESTION:  Mr. Wallace, I am less concerned23    about, you know, the outcome of this case, whether these24    particular nurses were, indeed, supervisory, as I am with25    the rationale that the board used, and the rationale that10                                                                                                                                                                                     1    it used -- I'll quote it from your brief. 2              It is that an employee's exercise of ordinary, 3    professional or technical judgment in directing less- 4    skilled employees to deliver services in accordance with 5    employer's specified standards is not the exercise of 6    independent judgment. 7              Now, if that's the principle on which the board 8    is proceeding, it seems to me that would say that in the 9    hypothetical I gave you before, that nurse, who is using10    her expert judgment to direct the less-skilled employees,11    you go here, you go there, she would not be a supervisory12    personnel, because she's using her professional judgment13    to know, you know, which medical services are needed14    where, and it seems to me she is a supervisor, on any15    reasonable analysis.16              In other words, I think maybe you have to take17    the third swing, and go back and, you know, try to resolve18    this case under the remaining test, which is, what is it,19    authority to direct.20              MR. WALLACE:  Well, what -- that standard that21    we've articulated was based on longstanding board22    experience with other employment situations involving23    skilled crafts, team leaders, lead men, group members, who24    they on their experience, or their superior technical25    knowledge, direct discrete tasks to be performed by other                                  11                                                                                                                                                                                     1    members of the group that management has assigned to be 2    members of that team.  They're not deciding for themselves 3    who should be members of the team to perform the function. 4    This has come up in a wide variety of -- 5              QUESTION:  But most supervisors don't 6    necessarily decide who shall compose the people that 7    they're going to supervise.  That's usually a given by 8    management. 9              MR. WALLACE:  That's precisely my point, Mr.10    Chief Justice, that management is deciding who the team11    shall be and who shall be in the position of the leader.12              QUESTION:  Why should the fact that management13    gives you a team of, say, 30, be fatal to your position as14    a supervisor, the fact that you don't pick them yourself?15    That can't be right.16              MR. WALLACE:  Well, if you're exercising one of17    the 12 kinds of supervisory authority, of course you would18    be a supervisor, regardless of whether management19    prescribed the team, but that's one indication of the20    limited role that the team leader is playing.21              QUESTION:  Well, doesn't this turn on what the22    authority to direct consists of?  If all the supervisor23    has -- the purported supervisor has authority to do is to24    tell the mechanic, no, turn the screw clockwise, not25    counterclockwise, okay, if that's all he has authority to12                                                                                                                                                                                    1    do, you're turning the screw the wrong way, that's not2    supervision.3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          But if, on the basis of his expert knowledge, hesays, listen, I want you to go over to this other jobwhich needs immediate assistance, I want to take threefellows off of this job, put them over there, that'ssupervision, and -- but that's not the basis on which theboard decided this case.  It decided it on the basis thatthere's no independent judgment when you're using yourprofessional standards, and that seems to me to be muchtoo broad.          MR. WALLACE:  Well, it is qualified by thedegree of discretion that the particular skilled employeeor professional is given, and the degree to which theexercise of any direction to others or assignment ofpeople who had been put on the shift to discrete tasks iscabined by standards both express and implicit in the --          QUESTION:  Is --          QUESTION:  Well --          QUESTION:  I thought that what Justice Scalia istalking about is not really involved in this case, so Imust not understand it, because I thought there were threeseparate things.  One is a situation where you have acarpenter, and he has an assistant carpenter.          Now, the assistant carpenter may tell the                            13                                                                                                                                                 1    carpenter a lot of things, all about carpentry, and if 2    that's what's going on, that isn't supervision, because 3    they're experts, they're carpenters, and as long as 4    they're talking about carpentry, that falls within the 5    rule we're talking about.  Am I right? 6              And that describes the relationship between the 7    registered nurse and the licensed practical nurse.  The 8    licensed practical nurse does things, gives shots or 9    whatever, so that's the expertise point, but I thought10    this case primarily involved two other things.  One is,11    what does the woman do who is the nurse, let's say, during12    the night hours?  Now, if she's ordering building people13    around, like maintenance people or others, maybe she's a14    supervisor, but there was a finding she did nothing.15    She's just there, doing her nurse's job.16              And then there was a second thing.  It isn't17    quite true she does nothing.  In fact, she can call in18    substitutes, but when she calls in the substitutes, they19    don't have to come, or she has little discretion there.20    Now, that I thought was the key question.  When she deals21    with those substitutes who are coming in when there's a22    shortage, that if I'm right, that doesn't have much to do23    with that aspect of the case that Justice Scalia's talking24    about.25              That's a little long, but that's how I was14                                                                                                                                                                                    123456 me. 78 910111213141516171819202122232425seeing it, and I'd like you to correct me if I'm wrong.          MR. WALLACE:  I think what you have saidreflects the facts at issue in this case very accurately,Justice Breyer.          QUESTION:  Then maybe your opponent will correct          MR. WALLACE:  And the findings and the recordare quite clear that her responsibility as the buildingsupervisor is just to see that the prescribed head countthat management has prescribed is there, so to speak, andin doing that she first asks for a volunteer that'sfalling short.          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Wallace.  We'll resumeat 1:00.          (Whereupon, at 12:00 noon, the Court recessed,to reconvene at 1:00 p.m.)15 1                         AFTERNOON SESSION2 (1:00 p.m.) 3              QUESTION:  You may continue, Mr. Wallace. 4              MR. WALLACE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 5    may it please the Court: 6              If I may briefly mention a couple of other 7    hypotheticals along the spectrum which may shed some light 8    on what the board has to decide here, supposing a nurse 9    either has a broken arm, or has her hands tied up with10    another patient, and another -- and a different patient11    needs something administered that requires two hands, and12    she directs someone to do that, even selecting from among13    the staff assigned to her someone that she knows knows how14    to do that, that would be very similar to the team leader,15    the skilled electrician or carpenter who is doing one16    thing and asks another man of his team to do the other17    thing that's required.18              Moving much more toward management on the19    spectrum, if the nurse is anticipating a difficult night,20    and can authorize someone to stay overtime in addition to21    the regular staff, and therefore commit the employer's22    resources to decide how the business should be run, rather23    than what happens here, just seeing to it that the24    preordained head count is met, that would move the25    judgment much more toward the managerial side along the16                                                                                                                                                                                     1    spectrum.  Perhaps it would move back a bit if this 2    discretion were cabined by rather specific criteria from 3    the employer. 4              The task of the board is to place these various 5    fact-intensive situations, and we've shown them in many 6    other areas of the workforce, to place them accurately 7    along this spectrum and to decide where the line is to be 8    drawn, and if there is to be coherence in the 9    administration of the Act in this respect, it is important10    that when the board reasonably does so the court defer11    rather than second-guess those judgments.12              QUESTION:  Mr. Wallace, I agree with that, but13    my -- again, my problem is, why is it that the phrase,14    independent judgment, is the key to distinguishing among15    those various hypotheticals?  Why is that the key?16    Independent of what?  I gather the Government's position17    is, independent of the professional expertise of the18    individual, and I don't see how that distinguishes among19    the various hypotheticals along the spectrum that you've20    described.21              MR. WALLACE:  Independent of managerial22    directives, or the implicit understanding of the way that23    particular supervisory functions should be utilized,24    because the same question arises with respect to the25    function of assigning, with respect to the function, other17                                                                                                                                                                                     1    functions that appear in section 211. 2              QUESTION:  No, but with respect, it's not 3    independent of managerial judgment, because even in the 4    case where, in the first hypothetical, where she clearly 5    is not supervisory, she's just telling another nurse to do 6    this or that, that's independent of the managerial 7    judgment.  It's her judgment as to whether this nurse 8    should do this or that, so it isn't independent of 9    managerial judgment.10              The position of the Government has been that it11    has to be independent of her professional expertise, and12    for the life of me I can't understand how that has13    anything to do with distinguishing among these various14    hypotheticals.15              MR. WALLACE:  Well, because the exercise of her16    own professional expertise in carrying out her17    professional tasks is not one of the 12 functions of a18    supervisor, and the judgment that she's exercising in19    selecting the helping hands, if it's merely of a routine20    nature within the meaning of the other part of the21    independent judgment clause, would not make her a22    supervisor.23              If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of my24    time.25              QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Wallace.18                                                                                                                                                                                    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          Mr. Hawkins, we'll hear from you.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. HAWKINS               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS          MR. HAWKINS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          This Court must reject the board'sinterpretation of independent judgment and the definitionof supervisory status in this case in order to assureAmericans throughout this country that when they put theirloved ones in nursing homes, health care facilities, andhome care facilities such as our client, that they areassured of an environment which will be supervised and10111213    well-managed.141516171819202122232425          No one in this room, or this country, would putthemselves or their family or loved ones into a nursinghome or health care facility where, unknowing to them,there was no one in supervision for 72 to 75 percent ofthe time.          QUESTION:  But that's the description that theregional director gave.  I looked back at it, and he saidthat the only thing that the building manager, or -- whatwas the term that was used?          MR. HAWKINS:  Building supervisor, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Building super -- the only thing thatshe did was to make sure that the count was met, that she19                                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425had no discretion to order anybody to show up, that shejust counted how many people were there.  She was toassure that the shifts were fully staffed, period, andthat she had no further authority than that, so those arethe fact-findings that were made.          MR. HAWKINS:  Well, Your Honor, all I can say isthat the regional director must have read some differentrecord, because he didn't read the record in thisparticular case.          QUESTION:  Are you saying that finding isclearly erroneous?  The only additional duty assumed by abuilding supervisor is to obtain needed help if for somereason a shift is not fully-staffed.          MR. HAWKINS:  Yes, Your Honor, I would say thatthat is completely erroneous.          QUESTION:  Did you raise that before the board?          MR. HAWKINS:  We raised it in --          QUESTION:  And then the board has said what, inresponse to your statement that that statement's clearlyerroneous?  What did the board say?          MR. HAWKINS:  They take the position that theytake, and that they're right.          QUESTION:  You raised, as a matter of objection,there's a finding, the only additional, et cetera, whichJustice Ginsburg raised.20                                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213    specifically?14              MR. HAWKINS:  The Sixth Circuit did.  The board15    did not address it.16              QUESTION:  The board did not address your17    statement, so when I read the record I'll find, objection,18    it was clearly erroneous, and the board just didn't19    address it.20              MR. HAWKINS:  Your Honor, the way this process21    works, this was our case hearing, and what ends up taking22    place is, it goes to the board, and then they issue a23    complaint for summary judgment for the employer's refusal24    to bargain, so you don't have a full, adjudicative burden25    of proof, burden of evidence hearing before the NLRB21                                                                                                                                                                                              MR. HAWKINS:  Well --          QUESTION:  All right.   You say, you raised tothe board that that finding was clearly erroneous.  Myquestion to you is, in response to that statement to theboard, what did the board say?          MR. HAWKINS:  The board gave the rhetoric thatit gave in this case.          QUESTION:  Did it say, it is clearly erroneous,or it isn't?          MR. HAWKINS:  No, they did not find -- the boarddid not find it erroneous, but the Sixth Circuit did.QUESTION:  Did the board address it1 itself. 23 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  They don't have a system where youraise an -- you object to an ALJ's finding, and -- theydon't?  This is the first time I've heard --          MR. HAWKINS:  Well, the employer in this caseraised an objection to the regional director's decision.That was just rubberstamped by the NLRB.  We appealed tothe --          QUESTION:  I'm not used to words like,rubberstamped.  I'm used to words like, there's astatement, somebody objects to that, and then there's afinding by the higher administrative body.          MR. HAWKINS:  Well, what I'm getting at, YourHonor, is that there is not a formal determination by theboard.  It is a, we reviewed it, we agree with theregional director, the employer technically refuses tobargain to get this issue before the Sixth Circuit, andthat's what this employer did in that situation.          QUESTION:  It's an enforcement action.          MR. HAWKINS:  So -- it's an -- yes, sir.          QUESTION:  So there was no -- I take it --implicit in what you're saying is, there was no way foryou to raise a specific objection to that finding beforethe board itself, is that correct?          MR. HAWKINS:  Other than raising the issue about                            22                                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9the board's regional director's determination.  You raiseit with the board, the NLRB --          QUESTION:  You say, okay, I object to theregional director's determination.  Do you have anopportunity to say, and, in particular, the finding thatJustice Ginsburg just read was clearly erroneous?          MR. HAWKINS:  In the --          QUESTION:  You have the opportunity to say that?          MR. HAWKINS:  In odd case situation, which thisarises out of, the employer's ability to challenge it isby refusing to bargain.  The NLRB --          QUESTION:  Is the answer to my question, then,          MR. HAWKINS:  The answer to your question is no.          QUESTION:  Okay.          MR. HAWKINS:  You do not have a formal processto resolve it before the board.          QUESTION:  So the first opportunity you had tomake a specific claim that this was clearly erroneous wasbefore the Circuit?          MR. HAWKINS:  No, Your Honor.  You have theability to raise the erroneous nature of it before theboard, but you do not get a hearing before the board.          QUESTION:  Do you have an opportunity to make aspecific objection with respect to the specific finding23                                                                                                                                                10111213    no?141516171819202122232425123456    level.78          QUESTION:  Well, regardless of who did it, wasit done before --that it is clearly erroneous?          MR. HAWKINS:  Yes, you do, Your Honor.QUESTION:  Okay, and you did not do that?          MR. HAWKINS:  No, that was done, to myunderstanding.  I did not handle the case at the board910 Honor. 1112    practice works.  The evidentiary hearing is before the13    regional director, or before an ALJ?14              MR. HAWKINS:  It's -- no, it's not before an15    AL -- it's before a hearing officer --16              QUESTION:  Before a hearing officer.17              MR. HAWKINS:  -- of that particular region.18              QUESTION:  And he makes findings.19              MR. HAWKINS:  Yes.20              QUESTION:  And then what happens?21              MR. HAWKINS:  And then the -- well, he doesn't22    make findings.  He apparently makes some recommendations23    to the regional director, and the regional director writes24    up a report based on those recommendations.25              QUESTION:  And then, if that is unsatisfactory24                                                                                                                                                                                    MR. HAWKINS:  To my knowledge, it was, YourQUESTION:  Well, let's get into how this 1    to a party, the party has a right to appeal it to the 2    NLRB? 3              MR. HAWKINS:  It's not really an appeal.  You 4    raise your objections about that determination, i.e., in 5    this case that these individuals were supervisors, as 6    opposed to were not supervisors.  That process then ends 7    up forcing an election.  You don't have a choice about it.8 They hold -- 9              QUESTION:  Okay, but -- so you're dissatisfied10    with the regional director's finding.  Does that go11    automatically to the board, without any submission on your12 part?13              MR. HAWKINS:  No.  You -- they order an election14    and schedule an election.  You're stuck with that process.15              QUESTION:  So there's no way that you can ask16    the NLRB to change the finding of the regional director?17              MR. HAWKINS:  Not in that process, no.  They18    direct an election, the regional director directs an19    election, and -- he has an election.  The way you20    challenge that issue is by refusing to bargain and they21    end up filing a technical 8(a)(5) charge against the22    employer, the employer refuses to bargain, and then if23    your way of -- they file a motion for summary judgment.24    On a motion for summary judgment --25              QUESTION:  A motion for summary judgment where?25                                                                                                                                                                                    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. HAWKINS:  The NLRB general counsel files amotion for summary judgment with the NLRB, and the NLRB --I mean, every case, our case I've had, they end upgranting the motion for summary judgment.          QUESTION:  But you opposed the motion forsummary judgment, I take it?          MR. HAWKINS:  Yes, I did, in the lower level.          QUESTION:  May I ask, in the unfair laborpractice proceeding against you for refusal to bargain,are you limited to the evidence that was adduced1011    originally?          MR. HAWKINS:  No, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  It's a de novo proceeding.  You canbring in new evidence about --          MR. HAWKINS:  Well, you don't have a newhearing.  You're stuck with the record.          QUESTION:  Oh, you are stuck with that.  That'swhat I was asking.          MR. HAWKINS:  Yes, you are stuck with the          QUESTION:  You are stuck with that record?          MR. HAWKINS:  Correct, and -- so the way inwhich you get review of it by a court is with the refusalto bargain, and then you end up with --          QUESTION:  Yes, but in answer to the board's                            26                                                                                                                                                121314151617181920    record.2122 23 24 251 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 911              MR. HAWKINS:  That's my understanding.12              QUESTION:  On what did you base --13              QUESTION:  And did they rule on that?14              MR. HAWKINS:  They grant summary judgment.15              QUESTION:  But they did not make a ruling16    specifically --17              MR. HAWKINS:  They don't issue you a formal18    decision and write-up, and we find this, and we find that.19              QUESTION:  Mr. Hawkins, could you please tell me20    on what basis you urged it was clearly erroneous, because21    I went back to read Mr. Eichol's testimony, and it22    corroborates what the regional director reported exactly.23              He said that the only authority that they had as24    building supervisor was to call employees, and they could25    use a list of employees who live nearby, the building27                                                                                                                                                                                    complaint you can assert as a defense one of the findingsof fact was clearly erroneous, can't you?          MR. HAWKINS:  Yes, and the Sixth Circuit soagreed that they were clearly erroneous.          QUESTION:  And you did do that before the board?          MR. HAWKINS:  Pardon, Your Honor?          QUESTION:  You did, in your answer to thecomplaint before the board, on the refusal to bargain, you      did make the point that this finding of fact was clearly10    erroneous.1    supervisor had no authority to compel -- Mr. Eichol's2    testimony is perfectly consistent with what the regional3    director found.4              MR. HAWKINS:  Your Honor, I believe this Court's5    standard is the record as a whole, and it's not on one6    particular page of a transcript.  If you look at the7    record as a whole --8              QUESTION:  Well, isn't that -- that's not in9    the -- where is it in the joint appendix?1011    appendix?12              QUESTION:  Is there anything in the joint13    appendix?141516    appendix is consistent with what the regional director17    reported.18              MR. HAWKINS:  Well, Your Honor, if I may I'll be19    glad to point out some things to you.  Some 11 times in20    the transcript, in the administrator's testimony from21    transcript 138 to 221 he references responsible or22    responsibility 11 different times.  He talks about23    judgment, or judgment calls --24              QUESTION:  I would like to know specifically,25 what --28                                                                                                                                                                                    MR. HAWKINS:  Where's what in the jointMR. HAWKINS:  Yes --QUESTION:  Everything that I read in the joint 1              MR. HAWKINS:  Okay.  Pages 140 -- 2              QUESTION:  Mr. Hawkins, a statement was made 3    that she has no authority to order anyone to stay, that 4    yes, she can write somebody up, but anybody else can write5 anybody up. 6              Is there any -- anything that contradicts the 7    statement that -- what was the expression that was used, 8    that it was just to count, to make sure that the count was 9    met, and that she could ask people to stay, if they said10    no, she had no authority to compel them to stay, she got11    not one penny extra for that building supervision --12              MR. HAWKINS:  Your Honor, there's nothing in13    section 211 that talks about pay being an issue.  I would14    submit to you at J.A. -- joint appendix 62, 63, and 64,15    which are the three memos in question, and if you take all16    of Mr. Eichol's testimony in total, you will find that17    these individuals clearly had supervisory authority, and18    clearly had authority under 211 that surpassed and was not19    routine, and much more significant than anybody else in20    that building during the time that they supervised.21              They had the ability to call in people for22    overtime, and even the hearing officer --2324    happened?25              MR. HAWKINS:  According to the memo, they have29                                                                                                                                                                                    QUESTION:  If a person said no, then what 1    the authority to write them up, and I know the regional 2    director made a to-do, well, they didn't write anybody up, 3    but that assumes that all your employees must totally 4    disrespect you as a supervisor, and that you have to be 5    writing everybody up. 6              QUESTION:  But where is it that says that 7    somebody is obliged to say yes to the request for 8    overtime?  I didn't find that. 9              MR. HAWKINS:  Well, it says in the J.A. 63,10    please write up anyone who does not comply with the11    request immediately.  There was also testimony --12              QUESTION:  With what request?13              MR. HAWKINS:  The request to work, or to cover14    the unit, or to pull someone from one unit to another, and15    so therefore, if -- it was also testified that -- and it's16    in the record, that every employee in the facility had to17    sign all three of these memoranda, read them, to18    acknowledge -- I mean, a company and an employer cannot do19    anything more significant and more strongly to communicate20    to every one of their employees, this person is the21    supervisor, they are in charge of the building and you22    will follow their lead, to the point that --23              QUESTION:  We're talking about a legal24    definition.  We're not talking about who you can call a25    supervisor or not.  Call anyone you want.  And I didn't30                                                                                                                                                                                     1    know until you started, which is why I was asking, that 2    there were any facts in dispute in this case. 3              I thought, when I read the Sixth Circuit, that 4    it was perfectly consistent with what the ALJ had found, 5    and I thought the key facts are that KRCC directs that the 6    registered nurses, 1) may direct the LPN in dispensing 7    medicine.  I didn't think that was in dispute.  I thought 8    that, 2) they regularly serve as the highest ranking 9    employees in the building.  I didn't think that was in10 dispute.11              MR. HAWKINS:  Correct, Your Honor.12              QUESTION:  I thought 3) they seek additional13    employees in the event of a staffing shortage, all right.14              MR. HAWKINS:  Yes, Your Honor.15              QUESTION:  And I thought that they move16    employees between units as needed.  That I better put a17    question mark on, but I suppose if I read that carefully18    in the ALJ I'll find they have some authority to do that.19              MR. HAWKINS:  Correct, Your Honor.20              QUESTION:  And they have the authority to write21    up employees who do not cooperate with staffing22    assignments.23 24 25          MR. HAWKINS:  That's correct, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  All right.  Now, I didn't know thatthere is a factual dispute.31                                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. HAWKINS:  I'm not disputing those facts.  Iguess really more what the issue, then, is, is thesubstantial evidence issue, and that's --          QUESTION:  Why is it substantial evidence?  Ithought that the issue is whether the legal label calledsupervising can fit on those facts, as the record willsupport them, I imagine to some extent, and so we'redealing with a question of law, and normally you'd sayit's -- on that kind of a question we'd give a lot ofdeference to the board.          MR. HAWKINS:  Unless there --          QUESTION:  But here, you wanted -- the SixthCircuit said, the board does not have the legal power tosay that the other side has the burden of proof, namelyyou.  They didn't have that legal power, and the otherthing they said was that they have been saying certainthings in the past, mouthing a standard but doingsomething the opposite, so we're not going to give them asmuch attention as normal.these --we --MR. HAWKINS:  Well, Your Honor, if we look atQUESTION:  Is that  -- am I right?  What areMR. HAWKINS:  Well, you certainly --QUESTION:  I'm trying to get what our issue is32                                                                                    1 here. 2345678 law. 9          MR. HAWKINS:  This Court in Chevron and a numberof the other cases said you certainly do not give theboard deference when their interpretation of the Act andapplication of it is irrational --                QUESTION:  Obviously not --                MR. HAWKINS:  -- and is not consistent with the                QUESTION:  -- but the classic case was the case10    of the newsboys, wasn't it -- they were called newsboys at11    that time -- are they employees, or are they supervisors,12    and I believe that this Court in that first case said that13    the board gets a lot of deference because they know about14    these things, and we don't.15              MR. HAWKINS:  This Court in HCR and Yeshiva, and16 Bell --17              QUESTION:  Yeah, a lot of them --18              MR. HAWKINS:  -- all these cases, is not giving19    deference to the board.20              QUESTION:  You mean you're saying we shouldn't21    give deference to the board on such a question?22              MR. HAWKINS:  No, you should not give deference23    to the board in this case because their interpretation of24    this particular statute is so irrational and so25    inconsistent with the Act.33                                                                                                                                                                                    1              In fact, addressing Justice Scalia's point2    earlier, you raised the question, Justice, about this3    issue of responsibly direction, the board go back, and4    come back, is that going to be the next one we're going to5 have. 6789          If you read the definition that they have ofindependent judgment, and I would really address this andtell the -- suggest to the Court that you pay attention tothis -- the board continues with employers to not beproactive.  They just keep telling employers what it'snot.  It's a shell game.  What it's -- they never say --if I read through the enter carpenter's brief you can'tfind where they say what independent judgment is.  Theykeep saying what it's not.10111213141516171819202122    somewhere?23 24 25          But in looking at their definition of it, and ifyou stack that up against Senator Flanders' comparison ofwhat responsibly direct is, they have literally writtenout of the Act, responsibly direct.          QUESTION:  What is the board's definition?          MR. HAWKINS:  The board's definition --          QUESTION:  Is that found in the briefs          MR. HAWKINS:  Yes.  They set it forth in thepetition for cert, item number 1 and index 1, which is thereverse of, it's not independent judgment if an RN34                                                                                                                                                 1    exercises ordinary professional technical judgment in 2    directing less-skilled employees to deliver services in 3    accordance with employer's specified standards. 4              Well, what did Senator Flanders say in the -- at 5    pages 14 and 15 of our brief, what did Senator Flanders 6    say was responsibly direct?  Guess what?  He said, it's 7    exercise personal judgment based on personal experience, 8    training, and abilities.  He says, it's the direction of a 9    department and the men under him, the less-skilled people.10    He says he determines under general orders what to do, and11    he gives instructions for its proper performance.12              QUESTION:  Mr. Hawkins, then every professional13    employee would be excluded, because everything that you've14    read to me is what professional employees do.15              MR. HAWKINS:  No, I disagree, Your Honor, and16    let me explain why.  If you look at what Senator Flanders17    was talking about as to the definition of responsibly18    direct, he's hit all of these points.19              He has hit the fact that you exercise personal20    judgment based on your skill and training, i.e., a21    professional.  He has hit -- this is not what all22    professionals do, direct their men under them, do it23    pursuant to general orders of the employer, and gives24    instructions for its proper adoption.25              QUESTION:  The typical thing, I thought, that35                                                                                                                                                                                     1    the RN who says to the LPN, do this injection, and 2    supervises that process.  I thought that that would fall 3    within the definition of professional employee, but not 4    supervisor. 5              MR. HAWKINS:  Well, Your Honor, I'm aware of the 6    concern and the dissent that you wrote in HCR about this 7    issue concerning when is someone -- 8              QUESTION:  There, the board was trying to have 9    some special definition just for nurses and health care10    people.  Now, as I understand it, they're saying, we're11    not creating any different definition for nurses than any12    other professional employee.  We're trying to distinguish13    between professional employees on the one hand, and14    supervisors on the other.15              MR. HAWKINS:  And I would submit, Your Honor,16    they have not done that.  In fact, all they've done is, in17    different terms, defined professional.  If you look at18    their definition of independent judgment, and if you took19    it and put it up on a board next to definition of20    supervisor and definition of professional, and said, which21    one does this fit, you'd say, it fits professional.  Their22    definition of independent judgment is a professional.23    That's why it's wrong, and that's why it's inconsistent24    with the Act.25              QUESTION:  Can I come back to the facts in this36                                                                                                                                                                                    1 case? 2345 6 7 8 9          MR. HAWKINS:  Yes, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Is it really uncontested that thebuilding supervisor had the ability to, as one of thesememos say, if necessary, pull from one unit to another.          MR. HAWKINS:  They had the ability to do that.          QUESTION:  Well, you say they had.  Is thatconceded?  I thought that the accuracy of these memorandaas a description of what their genuine authority was, wascontested by the board.  They said these memoranda is justwords on paper, and that's in fact not how it worked.          MR. HAWKINS:  Your Honor, those memoranda wereintroduced without objection.  In fact, it was -- whenthey were introduced --          QUESTION:  Well, that's okay.  I mean, you canintroduce -- basis for -- so on, right.  The point stillremains, did they reflect the actual duties of the,responsibilities of the building supervisor, and the boardsaid that in fact they didn't.  Isn't that what the board1011121314151617181920    said?2122 23 24 25          MR. HAWKINS:  Well, they may -- yes, they didsay that they didn't.          QUESTION:  Okay.  Now, how can we say that thatwas wrong?          MR. HAWKINS:  On the substantial evidence                            37                                                                                                                                                12345    Honor.6standard.  This Court --          QUESTION:  Well, what evidence do you have thatit did represent --          MR. HAWKINS:  I'll give you a few examples, Your                QUESTION:  Well, maybe the burden's on them, I 7    guess.  It is a memoranda that goes to all nurses.  They 8    don't deny that it went to all nurses. 9              MR. HAWKINS:  And they don't deny that all the10    board signed for it.11              QUESTION:  And they -- but they're just saying,12    it never happened?13              MR. HAWKINS:  No, Your Honor, they're not saying14    those different things did not happen.  Let me go through15    a few of these points in the record, and these are some16    questions that were posed by the hearing officer herself17    in this case.18              In the record, it's very clear that there19    typically was oftentimes one individual on duty.  There20    was one question at J.A. 36 where the administrator was21    asked, even if you're on duty, say, beyond 3:00 and this22    building supervisor is there, what ends up happening, and23    would you handle it?  He says, no.24              In other words, if I'm in the building, I would,25    you know, be surprised if they came to me and said, looks38                                                                                                                                                                                     1    like we're going to be a little short on night shift, what 2    do you think we should do?  In other words, the question 3    is going to be asked of the building supervisor, not me, 4    the administrator.  She's in charge of that issue.  That's 5    as strong a granting of the right to independent judgment 6    and section 211 duties as any. 7              QUESTION:  Well, that just concerns being short 8    on night shift, and that is really just a mathematical 9    call.  That doesn't take any independent judgment there.10    You're supposed to have 30 people there, we have only 29,11    pick up the phone and see if you can get a thirtieth in.12    That's just not independent judgment.13              MR. HAWKINS:  Your Honor, if you apply that14    principle, then the vast array of supervisors throughout15    the United States are not going to be supervisors, because16    I believe, as Mr. Chief Justice indicated, it's very17    frequently the exact situation, where management tells18    you, these are how many people are allocated to your19    department, you're going to get the job done, if enough20    people don't show up, call people in, hold people over for21    overtime -- that is an inherent part of supervision,22    making those judgments.  We can get the production out23    today with less people, so I won't call anybody in.  No,24    we can't get the production out today, we need to call25    someone in.39                                                                                                                                                                                    1              QUESTION:  She wasn't given that discretion.  As2    I understood it, she had to make the call when they were3    understaffed.4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. HAWKINS:  Your Honor, at page, transcript206, concerning overtime without restriction, the questionby the hearing officer again was, so is there norestriction on that concerning overtime assignment andcalling people in, and the answer was no.          Even a question at transcript --          QUESTION:  What is the that, no restrictionon -- yeah, she was supposed to try to get them up to thefull count, and to call people, but where is there --          MR. HAWKINS:  But there's no -- the point thereis no restriction on overtime, and then at 208 she's gotthe ability to call in to increase the unit above five,and at transcript 334 one of the residence assistantssays, yeah, I've been asked to stay over and called in alot, so she clearly had those responsibilities.          QUESTION:  I don't see how to deal with the caseunless we're like a super-NLRB, unless -- I could go thisfar, we take the facts as stated in the Sixth Circuit, youknow, and we say that insofar as those are conclusory,what they actually mean, as long as it allows it, is whatthe board said.          I mean, we'd go back to the opinions of the                            40                                                                                                                                                 1    board, which I agree is just a summary affirmance, so 2    you'd go back to the opinions of the district director and 3    say that's what the words mean, so when they talk about 4    it, you know, when they talk about her super -- how -- 5    unless you want us to go -- you're saying we should go 6    read through the whole record and decide whether all7 these -- 8              MR. HAWKINS:  Your Honor, I'm not saying that 9    you have to go read through the whole record.  I'm saying10    that, absent showing that the Sixth Circuit was in some11    way arbitrary and capricious about the way in which they12    handled this matter, they should be affirmed.13              The other point I would make, and I would like14    to propose, and I've been doing this work for some 2515    years, and not unlike what this Court did in Ellerith &16    Ferriger, it provided good determinative standards for17    employers to follow to be able to comply with the law, to18    define in this situation what is a supervisor, and I'd19    like to propose six points for this Court that I think20    address these issues.21              One is that the individual in question should22    have the authority from their employer to engage in one of23    the twelve activities.  In our case, they had the24    authority to assign, transfer, and responsibly direct the25    employees by those definitions.41                                                                                                                                                                                    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          Two, the individual should be responsible forother employees, a shift, a department, a unit, afacility.  In our case, the RN was in charge of thebuilding and the shift, and of the residents, and thefacility in general.          Senator Flanders talks about that in terms ofdirection of department, men under him.          QUESTION:  Well, and you say it was her judgmentas to how many of the extant employees would be in each ofthe various units.  She said, you know, we need eighthere, rather than just five, so I'm going to pull threefrom the next-door units.  She could do that.          MR. HAWKINS:  If the census was down in aparticular period of time, if it was up she had thosesorts of abilities.          QUESTION:  No, no.  Everybody's there, the fullcomplement of the staff is there, and you say she hadauthority to say, we need more in this unit than they needin the other unit.          MR. HAWKINS:  Yes, she did.          QUESTION:  I'm going to transfer three people tothis unit.          MR. HAWKINS:  Yes, she did, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  And that, and the evidence for thatis the memorandum which says, if necessary, pull from one42                                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425unit to another.          MR. HAWKINS:  It's more than that, Your Honor.It's also at transcript 155.  It's also at transcript 140,142, 43, 45, 146, 150, 206, 220 to 221, 227 --          QUESTION:  Well, could you give us an example ofwhat those citations -- is that the testimony of a witnessthat you're referring to?          MR. HAWKINS:  These are testimony of variouswitnesses about being assigned, calling people in, keepingthem over --          QUESTION:  I'm not talking about calling peoplein.  I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking aboutassigning the employees that are there and saying, I amgoing to make the independent judgment that we should havemore people in this unit than the employer originally putthere, because this unit has special needs today, and I ammaking that judgment, three people come from this unit andgo here.          MR. HAWKINS:  At --          QUESTION:  Now, what evidence is there for that,beyond the statement in the memorandum?          MR. HAWKINS:  At joint appendix 24, forsituational issues building supervisors can decide ifstaffing is inadequate and that additional employees areneeded.  Building supervisors can situationally ask for an43                                                                                                                                                1    increase.2345 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  Well --          MR. HAWKINS:  I'd also like to address --          QUESTION:  Let me ask one question.  You'vegiven us so much detail it's really kind of hard to followthe argument.          Am I correct in assuming that the factual basisfor your position is entirely found on page 18a and 19a ofthe appendix to the cert petition?  That's what the SixthCircuit relied on, as I understood it.          MR. HAWKINS:  Yes, Your Honor, we rely on whatthe Sixth Circuit --          QUESTION:  And so you don't think it's necessaryto call our attention to any other facts than those thatthe Sixth Circuit relied on?          MR. HAWKINS:  Well, I do to the extent theboard's wanting to say these people aren't engaged inindependent judgment, because I think these --          QUESTION:  They have said, though, that thesefacts are sufficient to establish their status as101112131415161718192021    supervisors.22 23 24 25          MR. HAWKINS:  Right.          QUESTION:  And so either -- it seems to me youeither agree or disagree with what they say on that page.          MR. HAWKINS:  With the Sixth Circuit, correct,                            44                                                                                                                                                1 Your Honor. 2              QUESTION:  Your six points on what's the 3    correct -- are they in your brief, because I'd like to -- 4              MR. HAWKINS:  No, they're not, Your Honor, and 5    I'd like to finish those quickly.  The fourth one is the 6    authority they have in exercise under section 211 is 7    different from those they supervise and thus not routine, 8    and I think that addresses the routine issue.  It also 9    addresses Yeshiva at 690 about it not being routine, and10    when you look at the totality of the activities that these11    RN's are engaged in, they're not routine as compared to12    the others they supervise.13              Fifth, that the authority to exercise does not14    consist only of record-keeping or filing, and thus not15    clerical, and sixth, in exercising their authority they16    are not subordinate to those that they supervise, and use17    their personal judgment based upon experience, training,18    and ability, thus they use independent judgment, and these19    standards are rational, they're reasonable, they alleviate20    any concern that we're trying to suggest that all21    professionals are supervisors, or that somehow or22 another --23              QUESTION:  What RN under those standards -- what24    RN would ever be professional and not supervisory?25              MR. HAWKINS:  Well, certainly in large health45                                                                                                                                                                                     1    care facilities you'll have a floor in a hospital, as an 2    example, where everybody's an RN, and you'll have one unit 3    supervisor.  You wouldn't say all of those RN's, just 4    because they simply periodically tell another nurse aide 5    or LPN, oh, adjust this -- 6              QUESTION:  Well, typically isn't it so in 7    hospitals nowadays that you have a lot of subpeople under 8    -- who are not RN's but are LPN's, and then other 9    categories, and that the nurse on the shift would be10    telling those people -- she wouldn't be the nurse in11    charge of assigning anybody any place, but she certainly12    would be directing the nurse's aides and the LPN's.13              MR. HAWKINS:  Well, Your Honor, if the RN is14    directing the facility, as this one was in this situation,15    they would be a supervisor.16              QUESTION:  I asked you to tell me who, under17    your definition, what nurse, assuming that the nurse is18    going to give instructions to an LPN, to a nurse's aide,19    and to other people who work in the hospital, what nurse20    would not fit the standards that you just read?21              MR. HAWKINS:  A nurse that doesn't have the22    authority from the employer to direct those employees.  A23    nurse that's not been told you're in charge of the unit.24              QUESTION:  What nurse in any hospital setup25    would not have the authority to direct the LPN, supervise46                                                                                                                                                                                     1    the LPN in the way a treatment is administered, a 2    treatment ordered by a doctor? 3              MR. HAWKINS:  Your Honor, as an example, in some 4    of the other cases that this Court has dealt with you 5    talked about whether the individual is aligned with 6    management or not.  That is a key component.  Is a nurse 7    just performing her duties in a project sort of the 8    straw-boss lead person, or are they actually aligned with 9    management and charged with the responsibility of10    directing the facility or the unit or the group of11    individuals.12              QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Hawkins.13              MR. HAWKINS:  Thank you, Your Honor.14              QUESTION:  Mr. Wallace, you have 6 minutes15    remaining.16171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Mr. Wallace, I hope at some point inyour 6 minutes you'll tell us on what basis the boarddisregarded and apparently didn't accept the truth of thememorandum which said that these nurses had authority, ifnecessary, to pull from one unit to another.         REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. WALLACE:  Well, the only nurse who testifiedsaid she had not read two of the three memoranda that hadbeen introduced and had never been shown it.  The -- on47                                                                                                                                                 1    page 16 of our reply brief we respond -- 2              QUESTION:  What does that prove? 3              MR. WALLACE:  -- with record citations to some 4    of these factual claims. 5              I do think, to put this in context, it's 6    important that the Sixth Circuit did not set aside any of 7    the board's findings in this case as erroneous.  It just 8    reached different legal conclusions based on its view of 9    what constitutes supervision, based on the board's --10              QUESTION:  The Sixth Circuit did say that, in11    its opinion, that they have the authority to move12    employees between units as needed, and I don't think the13    board said that.14              MR. HAWKINS:  The board did not say that, and15    that is not my understanding of the findings.  I will say,16    I'm holding in my hand here the response to the general17    counsel's motion for summary judgment in the unfair labor18    practice proceeding before the board, and there was no19    effort to introduce any further evidence on any of the20    matters that we're talking about.21              The only request to introduce further evidence22    was on the question of whether the employer was exempt23    from coverage because it was an arm of the State24    government, or because its board was controlled by public25    officials.  They --48                                                                                                                                                                                              QUESTION:  Well, do you -- Mr. Wallace, do youchallenge the Sixth Circuit's -- you say the Sixth -- youagree the Sixth Circuit said there was the authority tomove.  Now, do you challenge that finding?          MR. WALLACE:  Well, to --          QUESTION:  You can answer that yes or no.  Try,(Laughter.)          MR. WALLACE:  I -- the board did not make such afinding, and I don't know the basis on which the SixthCircuit made the finding.          QUESTION:  Well, you have the memos in therecord, and to follow up on Justice Scalia's question, yousay that a nurse, one nurse testified she had read onlyone of the two memos.  Was there other -- what was theother factual basis for the board saying these memos werenot accurate, or were not used?          MR. WALLACE:  Well, they -- what the regionaldirector said was that paper authority differs fromauthority in practice, and --          QUESTION:  What was his authority for sayingthat?  I mean, what was the testimony, or reason that hesaid that?          MR. WALLACE:  All of the testimony was aboutwhat, in practice, the nurses understood their authority49                                                                                                                                                1234567    anyway.8 910111213141516171819202122232425 1    to be when they were acting in the capacity of building 2    supervisor as well as in conducting their other 3    activities. 4              The board does have a procedure for review of 5    the regional director's findings, and that review was 6    denied in this case, and that is in an order in our 7    appendix to the petition for certiorari, which appears on 8    page 34a, because they found that nothing requiring review 9    had been presented, no substantial issues had been10    presented.11              There is a practice of not receiving new12    evidence in the unfair labor practice proceeding unless13    there is something newly discovered, or there are special14    circumstances warranting it, because otherwise the15    contestants in the representation proceeding would not16    have sufficient incentive to present all of the relevant17    evidence and get that proceeding decided accurately.18              QUESTION:  Can I take it as some concession on19    this?  The Sixth Circuit says, they have, the registered20    nurse has authority to, quote, move employees between21    units as needed.22              In respect to that -- that's the only one that23    wasn't there before.  In respect to that, you say on page24    16 of your brief, the building supervisors, namely the25    nurses here, transfer employees from one unit to another50                                                                                                                                                                                     1    simply, quote, to make sure the head count is there, end 2    quote. 3              MR. WALLACE:  That is -- 4              QUESTION:  So I don't really see the conflict. 5              MR. WALLACE:  That is our view, and we have 6    citations on page 6 of our brief as well. 7              QUESTION:  So they do have authority to move 8    people to make sure the head count is -- 9              QUESTION:  Well, wait, I don't understand that.10    As needed means to make sure the head count is there.11    They have a full complement of people.  How -- if you're12    short-staffed, moving it to another unit can't increase13    the head count.  I mean, it clearly means in that14    memorandum that they can decide they need more in one unit15    than are assigned to that unit normally.  Doesn't it16    clearly mean that?17              MR. WALLACE:  I don't think it's clear.  There18    certainly is indication that it's for the head count, and19    the burden wasn't sustained, and the burden is on the20    proponent of the exception.21              CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.22    Wallace.  The case is submitted.23              (Whereupon, at 1:40 p.m., the case in the above-24    entitled matter was submitted.)2551
