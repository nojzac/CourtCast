United States.      Mr. Elwood.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOODON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. ELWOOD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      It has long been a bedrock principle ofAmerican law that aiding and abetting liability requiresproof that an accomplice act with purposeful intent tofacilitate or encourage the crime of conviction and thatmere knowing assistance is insufficient.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you agree that the jury could find the defendant guilty of the firearms charge under a proper instruction? In other words, was there sufficient evidence so that if a proper instruction were given, there could have been a conviction?MR. ELWOOD: Even if the ­­ I think in this particular case, even if the jury had been given a proper instruction, it would have been a difficult charge to make out because the government never really argued facilitation after getting knowledge of the3￼￼1 firearm. There was never evidence of foreknowledge; the2 government never asserted evidence of foreknowledge.3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I guess we can get4 into later to whether or not if you know a firearm is5 being carried and if you then facilitate the commission6 of the underlying felony by driving the car,7 participating in the transaction, whether that's8 sufficient.9 But let me ask you this: Would the10 instruction that was given, which was at JA 196, would11 it be okay if Paragraph 1, "The defendant knew his12 cohort used a firearm," I think there is a real problem13 with that, because it's retrospective.14 Would the instruction have been sufficient15 if the defendant knew his cohort would use or was16 carrying? Would that change it?17 MR. ELWOOD: Well, I think at least that18 would have required foreknowledge. But I think it would19 still have been problematic because it would only have20 required knowing facilitation. And courts,21 traditionally, have required intentional facilitation,22 that is, they intend to further the crime.23 JUSTICE SCALIA: You do not agree, then,24 that if you know that there's going ­­ that there's a bank25 robbery afoot and you're cooperating in that, you're ­­4JUSTICE SCALIA:MR. ELWOOD:JUSTICE KENNEDY:    No, no.Knowledge is not itself intent.￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425you're the wheelman, and you also know that the ­­ youknow that the people who are conducting the bank robberyare carrying firearms, you say that there's no criminalliability for the firearms unless you intended them touse the firearms; is that your position?MR. ELWOOD: It's our position that you could infer from the fact that you're assisting the transaction involving ­­                              Justice Scalia can protect ­­ hisown question.  But the question is:  What ­­ what doesthe jury have to find?  I know they can ­­ I know whatthey can infer, but the question from Justice Scalia is,you're the ­­ you drive ­­ you drive the car, you knowfirearms are there and might be used, is thatsufficient?  And that's his question.MR. ELWOOD: I ­­ I think that that would be ­­ that would support a verdict. That would support a verdict. The only question ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, wait. It would support a verdict ­­ you're saying it would support a finding of ­­ of intent.MR. ELWOOD: That's correct. But the question is whether you don't even have to instruct a51 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425jury ­­      JUSTICE SCALIA:￼                             Let's assume there's a lotof evidence that he didn't really want them to usefirearms, that there's no way you can say he intendedthem to use, but he knew that they had firearms.MR. ELWOOD: And I think that you can conclude from that that his purpose in assuming that he's driving ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: No. No, no, you can't. It's my hypothetical. And you cannot conclude from that. There is so much other evidence. This ­­ this man hates firearms. He does not like firearms. There is no way he could have intended them to use firearms. But he knew they had firearms.MR. ELWOOD: You know, I hate to be accused of resisting the hypothetical, because in that ­­ in that case, I don't think it matters whether you have the subjective desire, like you think, boy, I sure wish those firearms weren't involved. But because at that point, your goal is to facilitate and make sure that this bank robbery ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Facilitate the crime.MR. ELWOOD: ­­ with the gun succeeds. The whole thing with the gun.JUSTICE SCALIA:So you don't have to ­­ you6￼1 don't have to ­­2 MR. ELWOOD: But that is your ­­ we would3 say that that is the purpose in facilitating. And the4 question is not just that. The question is whether5 you ­­ 67 crime8 crime9JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So if you intend a ­­ if you intend a crime and you know that the is being conducted with firearms, that's enough.MR. ELWOOD: I don't think that that ­­ I that you have to have the fore ­­ the10 think11 foreknowledge. And I think that there are certainly12 hypothesize ­­13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Beforehand. Before ­­ you14 know beforehand that the crime is going to be15 perpetrated with firearms. That's all you do. You know16 beforehand, and you facilitate the crime.17 MR. ELWOOD: I think that you ­­ the18 question is whether ­­ you can't even conceive of the19 circumstance where knowing ­­ that is, participation ­­20 knowing that a firearm would be used or carried.21 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, give me an example of22 that. Give us ­­23 MR. ELWOOD: For example, if you agree to24 drive your neighbor to pick up drugs at some place in25 Philadelphia or ­­ let's make it Pittsburgh. And then7￼1 you drive him to West Virginia to spend the weekend2 dealing. On the way there he tells you, the guy who3 distributed these to me, you know, he always carries a4 Derringer in his boot.5 And at that point, you don't facilitate his6 use or carriage of the gun with respect to the drug7 distribution offense. It has no role in ­­ in the8 crime. And so I think you can conceive of enough9 circumstances ­­10 JUSTICE ALITO: And I don't ­­ I don't11 understand the example. The ­­ the alleged aider and12 abetter learns about this after it's happened? That's13 the idea?14 MR. ELWOOD: Yes, but he's still15 facilitating the drug distribution offense at a time he16 knows that a gun is, you know, being carried in relation17 to it.18 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me change ­­ let19 me ­­ maybe this is the same as Justice Scalia's20 hypothetical, but let me try it. Suppose that two guys21 have a meeting and it's ­­ it's in a place that's ­­22 where there's an electronic eavesdropping device. In23 fact, there's a camera. So it's all recorded. So we24 know exactly what was said. And the principal says,25 here's the deal, I'm going to rob a convenience store8JUSTICE ALITO:See ­­ so I don't really￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425and I'm going to carry a gun.      And the aider and abetter says, well, allright.  I'm in on the ­­ you know, I'm in on robbing theconvenience store, but I don't want anything having todo with the gun.  I think you should carry a baseballbat.      The principal says, no, that's the deal.I'm robbing the store.  I'm carrying a gun.  Take it orleave it.  Are you going to drive me there?      And ­­ and the other guy says, I hate guns,I don't want to have anything to do with guns.  I ­­ Ihate this idea about the guns.  They go back and forth.      And the ­­ the principal says finally, look,this is it.  This is the deal.  I'm robbing the store.I'm using a gun.  Are you going to help me or not?And the guy says, well, all right. I'm going to drive you, but I want it noted for the record that I'm opposed ­­ I'm opposed to the use of a gun.(Laughter.)MR. ELWOOD: And at that point, it's his purpose to facilitate a transaction and to, you know, help it succeed and it's at a time when he knows that a gun will be used and that ­­ I think you can conclude that that is his purpose.925 JUSTICE ALITO:But you facilitate ­­￼1 see ­­ I can't ­­ I can't think of a situation where a2 person facilitates the crime, knows what the crime is3 going to be, knows that a gun is going to be used but4 doesn't intend for the gun to be used.5 MR. ELWOOD: The question is ­­6 JUSTICE ALITO: In those two situations,7 knowledge and intent, seem to me to be ­­ to be the same8 thing.9 MR. ELWOOD: The question is whether there10 are ­­ because there are just no instances that are more11 like my hypothetical than like your hypothetical. So12 you don't even have to bother troubling the jury about13 whether they had the intent.14 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I didn’t understand15 your hypotheticals. If you could give it to us again.16 MR. ELWOOD: Well, the point of it is that17 at a time when you are ­­ when you are still18 participating in the underlying offense, the drug19 trafficking offense, you know that a gun is being20 carried in relation to it. But you don't have any21 intent to facilitate it. You don't care one way or the22 other if it gets used. You don't intend to facilitate23 it, and you don't facilitate it. And the question is24 whether there are ­­10JUSTICE KENNEDY:MR.

The jury, it seems to me, could say you dofacilitate it if in these hypotheticals you drive theMR. ELWOOD:      JUSTICE KENNEDY:gun might be used.      MR. ELWOOD:be used in your act of facilitation.  It may be usedover in Philadelphia, and you aren't doing ­­Well, that's ­­ that's aBut the thing is ­­     ­­ with knowledge that theNo, but the gun is not going to      JUSTICE KENNEDY:have been used if you didn't drive the ­­ or carried ifyou didn't drive the car.MR. ELWOOD: But I think the jury could equally well conclude that you did not intend to facilitate the use of the gun and you did not facilitate the use of the gun. And the question is whether you even need to trouble the jury with it. Because the government's instruction conclusively presumes both knowledge ­­ or conclusively presumes intent from knowledge alone and it conclusively presumes facilitation of the gun from facilitation of the11￼1 underlying offense.2 JUSTICE ALITO: Or in my ­­ in my3 hypothetical, could a rational jury say he knew about4 it, but he didn't intend it?5 MR. ELWOOD: I think that in your case with6 the foreknowledge and where he, you know, facilitates,7 he carries the gun and he carries the person to the8 offense, I think that that would be a tough slog. In a9 case ­­ but ours is a case where there isn't10 foreknowledge and the government never argued that he11 knew before the gun ­­ before the gun was fired that it12 was his associate who was the shooter.13 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, in my case ­­ and I'll14 finish. I want to ask another question about this. But15 in my case, if the judge had given the instruction, it's16 enough that he knew about it. He facilitated the crime17 when he knew there was a gun. Would that be error?18 MR. ELWOOD: I think it would be error19 because you're instructing them on the wrong elements.20 It might be harmless error. But the point ­­ both sides21 agree here that you have to facilitate the crime of22 conviction and you have to intend that the gun be used.23 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think it's ever24 harmless error to not instruct the jury ­­ or to25 instruct the jury not to find one of the elements of the12￼1 crime. If, indeed, intent is necessary, it seems to me2 he has to instruct the jury to find intent. It's not up3 to the court to say, well, there surely was intent4 anyway so it's harmless error. The jury has to find5 intent.6 MR. ELWOOD: I think ­­ you know what, I'm7 fine with it being a harmful error, too. But my point8 was merely to note that I think that it is something9 that you have to instruct the jury on as a proper10 element ­­11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:12 we instructing ­­13 MR. ELWOOD:14 making a difference.15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:16 driving at here, and I think this is the moment you're17 resisting, but to me, and as you can tell from my18 colleague's questions, if you know that someone's19 carrying a gun, and whether you want them to use it or20 not is irrelevant, if they take it out and use it and21 you have gone along with them in the crime, you're22 guilty. Okay? That ­­ that's what we're driving at.23 Assume that I believe that. Assume that I24 believe that if you have knowledge of the gun, and that25 I am participating in the crime with your knowledge of13       Excuse me.  But what are­­ even if it winds up not       I think what we're￼1 that gun, whether the knowledge is secured before the2 crime starts or during the crime, if I continue to3 participate in the crime knowing that you have a gun,4 then that's knowledge of the gun and intent to5 facilitate.6 I thought the example that you were relying7 on here or the issue that got confused in the briefs was8 whether or not, from the sequence of facts in this case,9 you can actually discern that intent to facilitate the10 crime because the alleged shooter, which your client11 said was someone else, jumped into the car and the car12 took off before anybody could abandon the crime. That's13 what I actually thought this case was about: At what14 juncture do you instruct the jury to say that you have15 to be a participant with knowledge of the crime?16 But you're saying something different right17 now. You're almost suggesting that there has to be a18 pre­knowledge that the gun will be used.19 MR. ELWOOD: No, I don't think ­­ I don't20 think that there has to be pre­knowledge. My point is21 this: That there are circumstances I think where you22 can know of a gun and be participating in the underlying23 ­­ underlying predicate offense and not facilitate the24 use of the gun. And I ­­25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:14I'm hard to imagine￼1 that. Give me an example.2 MR. ELWOOD: For example, if you ­­ your3 job, you're the lowest level guy in a drug organization.4 You stand on a street corner every night and you hand5 out drugs to anybody who comes up. You don't carry a6 gun. Nobody has ever carried a gun at that street7 corner. One night you're doing it and you see that the8 guy is ­­ that the guy who you work for, his enforcer is9 coming by and you know he always carries a gun. He10 walks behind you and, you know, he's present and around11 you for about 90 seconds, but during that time, you do12 exactly what you always did.13 I think a jury could conclude ­­ and I'm not14 saying that they couldn't conclude otherwise, but they15 could conclude that he didn't facilitate the use or16 carriage of the gun. He was just ­­17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:18 instruction look like?19 MR. ELWOOD:20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:21 it look like to capture the difference you're trying to22 convey?23 MR. ELWOOD: It would just say that the ­­24 that the jury has to find that the defendant facilitated25 the use or carriage of a gun during and in relation to a15What would theIt would just ­­       To ­­ to ­­ what wouldso.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:MR. ELWOOD:       Well, then you come ­­­­ and that they intended to doJUSTICE SCALIA:MR. ELWOOD:MR. SCALIA:    Yes.Right.  Exactly.So what did you mean by ­­ by￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011121314151617181920212223242526crime of violence or a drug trafficking offense ­­      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:the government's argument that you don't have tofacilitate every element.MR. ELWOOD: Right. But that's the thing. Those are what we think would be the proper instruction, that they just have to be instructed on the facilitation and on the intent.JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm surprised to hear you say that you don't need prior knowledge.     JUSTICE KENNEDY: I am too.     JUSTICE SCALIA: I think you need prior knowledge.MR. ELWOOD: I think you have to have prior knowledge before you facilitate it. I think that ­­you don't need prior knowledge?MR. ELWOOD: You don't need prior knowledgebefore the whole transaction happens.  If you continueto ­­ if there's an act of facilitation after you learnof it ­­JUSTICE SCALIA:After you know.16­­ you come up against￼1 MR. ELWOOD: Right. Exactly. That's all I2 mean by the absence of prior knowledge. But I mean,3 everyone here agrees that you need to have knowledgeable4 before facilitation.5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Elwood, you're6 dealing with all kinds of hypotheticals. But in this7 case we had a jury determination that Rosemond was the8 person ­­ he was convicted of carrying ammunition,9 right? There were two counts of carrying ­­ possession10 of the ammunition. And couldn't one infer from that11 that if he ­­ he possessed the ammunition, he was the gun12 carrier?13 MR. ELWOOD: Two things, Justice Ginsburg.14 First, the government never raised this below and it15 wasn't pressed or passed on below, and so I think under16 Glover v. United States this Court wouldn't ordinarily17 consider that in the first instance, would leave it for18 remand.19 But secondly, I think that it's not clear20 enough. I mean, you can't say beyond a reasonable doubt21 that the error didn't infect that, too, because the jury22 was instructed four times that you can possess something23 through constructive possession, through a confederate.24 And I think when the jury concludes that he is guilty of25 a possession offense, which is 924(c) as a possession17JUSTICE KENNEDY:And was there any evidence￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425offense, as an aider and abetter, and they marked on thejudge's instruction that he used the gun, he carried thegun, that the jury could have believed that they were ­­that he constructively possessed the gun and therebyconstructively possessed the ammunition.JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the evidence that the jury had on whether he possessed the ammunition?MR. ELWOOD: I think the only evidence of possession was that it was inside the gun that was fired. And I think the jury rejected the idea that he was the shooter because the two eyewitnesss said that the shooter was someone else, that the shooter was the guy in the backseat, who was Ronald Joseph.JUSTICE KENNEDY: I just didn't ­­ you said the only evidence was that it was inside the gun?MR. ELWOOD: The ammunition was inside the gun. And the only evidence of his ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what was the evidence? I thought there was evidence that he possessed cartridges.MR. ELWOOD: No. The only evidence was that the evidence was inside the gun ­­ or I'm sorry, the evidence ­­ that the ammunition was inside the gun.18￼1 that he had the gun?2 MR. ELWOOD: The evidence that he had the3 gun was the ­­ the guy who was the other shooter ­­4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, was the evidence5 that he had the gun and the evidence of the cartridges6 are exactly the same?7 MR. ELWOOD: They are exactly the same. The8 only evidence was that the cartridges were inside the9 gun. And the evidence ­­ the two eyewitnesss who were10 at the scene said that the person got out of the11 driver's side, and the evidence suggests that Mr.12 Rosemond was on the passenger side, and that he got out13 of the backseat, and he was in the front seat.14 So the ­­ the evidence, I think, is that he15 was ­­ he was merely in the car, not that he was a16 shooter. And the jury, remember, asked: Do we have to17 answer question 3, which was the ­­ all the different18 ways you can use the gun ­­ if we find him guilty on an19 aiding and abetting theory? Which certainly suggests20 they did not believe he was the shooter.21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did ­­ did he facilitate22 the crime after the shots were fired?23 MR. ELWOOD: The government did not ever24 argue facilitation after the shots were fired, I suspect25 because ­­ they only argued that he ­­ that what19￼1 happened afterwards was evidence he was the shooter. I2 suspect because they appreciated that the offense was3 over with. He was only charged with possession of4 marijuana with intent to distribute. When Mr. Gonzales5 took off with the marijuana and they lost control, you6 know, they went around afterwards looking for him,7 which, you know, there's not even very much evidence of8 that.9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But do we have cases that10 say that assisting flight immediately after the crime is11 not aiding and abetting the crime? The crime is over?12 So everybody says the crime's over. Let's ­­ let's walk13 home.14 MR. ELWOOD: I ­­ I am not aware and the15 government hasn't cited any. I mean, there's ­­16 there's ­­ for different crimes, you know, there's ­­17 there's different law about whether flight is part of18 the offense.19 But in any event, the question is whether20 that would be aiding and abetting that crime, the21 possession offense or some distinct crime, or whether22 that would be being an accessory after the fact. And23 that was never charged.24 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it ­­ is it just25 flight? I thought there was evidence that they were208 the question is, even if they're chasing him,9 be attempt to possess the marijuana to get it10 might be conspiracy to possess the marijuana,11 wasn't ­­ wasn't charged. The only thing was12 possession.that mightback.  Itbut that￼1 chasing the people who robbed them.2 MR. ELWOOD: There was no evidence that that3 intent to chase them was ever communicated to Mr.4 Rosemond.5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, he jumps in6 the car and, you know, they're going after them.7 MR. ELWOOD: That itself was disputed. But13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it might be ­­14 it might be an effort to continue the crime of ­­ in15 other words, it might make a difference whether the16 people who are being chased look and see two guys in the17 car or three guys in the car. If somebody says ­­ and I18 realize you dispute these facts ­­ let's go get them and19 the guy jumps in the car, it seems to me that that's20 aiding and abetting the underlying illegal activity with21 knowledge, of course, that guns were used.22 MR. ELWOOD: I agree. But first, that's not23 a theory that the government ever espoused. They never24 argued that facilitation.25 And secondly, I don't know that that would21￼1 be facilitation of possession of marijuana with intent2 to distribute it. That ended under the court's3 instructions when they lost control of the marijuana4 when Mr. Gonzales disappeared.5 JUSTICE ALITO: I understand your argument6 about intent, but are you also arguing that the ­­ that7 the actus reus instruction was insufficient? The8 instruction about what your client did?9 MR. ELWOOD: Yes.10 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think it's necessary11 for an aider and abetter to facilitate every element of12 a criminal offense?13 MR. ELWOOD: We're not saying that. We are14 saying that when you ­­ you have to instruct them did he15 facilitate the actual crime of conviction. Because what16 the government is doing here, what their instruction17 does is it conclusively presumes that he facilitated the18 distinct offense, which this Court has said, the19 entirely new crime of 924(c), from the fact that they20 did the underlying offense.21 Their favorite example in the brief is a22 mail fraud example. But under the government's theory,23 because you engage in an act of mail fraud, you could be24 convicted of racketeering without any additional actus25 reus because that is a predicate crime to RICO. And2216 risk that you would convict someone twice17 serve two consecutive sentences under the18 you suggest, but we still say they should19 whether they facilitated the right crime.20 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but the crime of21 conviction was ­­ was a drug offense with the use of a22 firearm, right?23 MR. ELWOOD: It was 924(c), a crime with the24 long name.25 JUSTICE SCALIA: And so I thought ­­ I23￼1 that's the thing is we're just saying you can't presume2 the full offense ­­ facilitation of the full offense3 from the fact that you just facilitated one element.4 JUSTICE ALITO: So if there were not ­­ if5 the ­­ the drug offense itself were not illegal, there ­­ there6 wasn't a drug offense and then the ­­ the additional7 firearm element, it wouldn't be necessary for him ­­ for8 the defendant to facilitate every element of that9 offense. It's dependent on the fact that there's this10 other criminal conduct.11 MR. ELWOOD: We're just saying that they12 have to be ­­ the jury just has to be instructed to ask,13 did he facilitate the crime of conviction? And they're14 asking a different ­­ they're asking a different15 question, essentially.

And the14 government is trying to get the jury to conclusively15 presume from the fact that you did the one crime, that16 you must also have facilitated the other. And we just17 don't think that that is something that you can say with18 100 percent certainty so you can remove it from jury19 determination.20 JUSTICE KAGAN: Isn't criminal law ­­ isn't21 criminal law replete with crimes which have lesser22 included offenses as part of them?

ELWOOD: There are some courts that3 apply this, our rationale to lesser included's as well.4 But lesser included crimes are the same crime for5 Blockburger purposes. You can't be sentenced to both6 the greater and the lesser. And I think most courts7 require that you show the intent that the gun be used.8 They don't as often require9 discreet use of or carriage10 JUSTICE ALITO:11 earlier hypothetical about the taped conversation.12 Suppose that the alleged aider and abetter there says, I13 intend for you to use the gun.

Mr. Bash.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. BASH       ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. BASH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      I'd like to start by defining exactly whatthe government contends the mens rea requirement is foraiding and abetting, and then give the Court anexample ­­ two examples to show how it differs both from28But only ­­ you say it's￼1 what Mr. Elwood is saying and how it differs from a2 knowledge standard.3 Aiding and abetting requires an intent to4 facilitate or encourage the commission of an offense.5 And I think that breaks down into two constituent parts:6 One, an intent to make some action easier or to7 encourage some action by the principal; two, the8 knowledge that the principal intends to commit a crime9 of which that action is a constituent part.10 What Mr. Elwood is saying is something quite11 different. It's that you have to intend that the crime12 succeed. If that's true, all paid accomplices are out13 if they don't intend that the crime succeed. If the ­­14 if the bank robbers say, hey, can you look the other15 way, security guard, while we go into the bank, we'll16 give you a thousand dollars if you do it, that's not17 aiding and abetting under his theory if the security18 guard says, well, I only wanted a thousand dollars; I19 didn't care whether you ultimately succeeded in the20 bank.21 We give an example in our brief: If the22 person actually gives the gun so it meets the actus reus23 requirement that Mr. Elwood has proposed, he actually24 gives the gun to somebody, not because he cares if that25 person commits the crime, which he knows he intends to29￼1 commit, but as a favor or as a friendly gesture ­­2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a very3 fanciful hypothetical, because the one thing the guard4 is going to know, that if the robber gets caught, he's5 in great jeopardy of ­­ of being caught himself and6 convicted. Of course he wants the crime to succeed7 because he doesn't want the people to be there and being8 pressured by investigators or whatever to say, okay, you9 know, who was in on ­­ who was in on this with you?10 So if you're ­­ if you're being paid for a11 crime, to assist in the commission of the crime, you12 want it to succeed.13 MR. BASH: Well, if your payment is not14 coming from the loot, I don't think that's really true.15 But let's take that as true as given. I mean, go back16 to my example about the guy that's just doing a favor17 for somebody. Sure, you can use my gun to commit a18 robbery. I don't have any stake in it. If you decide19 tomorrow that you don't want to commit the robbery,20 that's fine with me.21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He has a stake in22 it. If the guy is caught, the police are going to say,23 where did you get the gun? He may turn him in or not,24 but it's certainly a danger, a danger that wouldn't be25 there if the crime succeeded.30￼1 MR. BASH: I don't ­­ I don't think that's2 the sort of intent requirement that Mr. Elwood is3 talking about. I mean, I think he's talking about an4 intent that's abstracted from the idea that if you get5 caught, everybody might go to jail. I mean, that sort6 of seems to beg the question of whether you're actually7 going to be liable for the gun.8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why don't we just9 take it that we have a crime, the underlying crime, it's10 a 48­month crime, and then if you have a gun in11 connection with that crime, it becomes 120 months12 consecutive. And your position seems to be that all you13 have to prove is facilitation of the underlying drug14 offense. And it seems to me to ­­ to get 10 years of15 your life for the government proving no more than the16 48­month charge is a bit much.17 MR. BASH: It's not proving no more than the18 48­month charge. And I'll just ­­ as a footnote, it's19 10 years only if the gun is fired. It's 5 years if it's20 carried or used, and which obviously creates a much21 greater danger to people's lives and property if it's22 fired.23 But it's not only proving that you24 facilitated the drug offense. It's facilitating the25 drug offense with the foreknowledge that a gun was going311 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425to be involved in it.      JUSTICE KENNEDY:￼                              But this instruction atJ196 says that the defendant "knew his cohort used afirearm."  It really should say that "knew his cohortwould carry a firearm."MR. BASH: Justice Kennedy, two points.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because as I ­­ when I read this, I thought, well, given these confusing facts, a jury might think that there's liability if he knew that a firearm was used, which is a very odd interpretation, but that's ­­ the instruction lends itself to that interpretation.MR. BASH: Justice Kennedy, that is an oddinterpretation and it's wrongliability could be imposed ifonly after your participationthat.      JUSTICE KENNEDY:taken by itself, that one could be read that way?MR. BASH: Well, I don't think read in the context of the full instruction. If you look at ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: I said taken by itself.MR. BASH: Oh, so not the instruction taken by itself, but one phrase in the instruction taken by itself?32and we do not contend thatyou learned of the gunended.  A couple points onBut do you agree that,￼1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.2 MR. BASH: I think it's possible, but I3 think if you read it in the context of the full charge4 and what reasonable jurors would think, you have the5 formulation right above that on page 196 that mirrors6 exactly the Peoni standard. And I don't think7 reasonable jurors reading that in conjunction with the8 more specific instruction on count 2 could think that he9 could be liable if his participation ended only after10 the firearm was used.11 And, Justice Kennedy, nobody below thought12 that, because Petitioner never objected on the grounds13 that the particular wording of this instruction allowed14 conviction if you gained knowledge only after your15 participation. So at minimum ­­16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, he proposed ­­17 he proposed a different instruction that departed from18 the instruction that was given on that point.19 MR. BASH: Mr. Chief Justice, first of all,20 under Rule 30 it is not enough to propose an alternative21 instruction that does not contain the defect. You have22 to lay out the specific grounds for your objection. He23 did not do that here, so it should be plain error24 review.25 That is doubly true here where his33￼1 instruction had its own error. His instruction would2 have required intentional facilitation of the gun, which3 is the question on this Court granted certiorari. His4 instruction had ­­5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Two ­­ two wrongs6 don't make a right.7 MR. BASH: Two wrongs don't make a right,8 but he certainly did not comply with the Rule 309 standard for raising the objection with respect to10 foreknowledge that he ­­ that he's proposing now. So,11 at minimum, that should be reviewed for plain error.12 In addition, even if the Court believes that13 we waived the harmless error argument by not raising it14 below with respect to his primary argument, the Court15 should certainly hear our plain error ­­ or harmless16 error argument with respect to the ammunition counts,17 with respect to the instructional error that18 raise below. We should have the opportunity19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Look at his ­­20 instruction and think about the bank robbery21 hypothetical with the driver of the car. His number 222 is that they intentionally took some action to23 facilitate or encourage the use of the firearm. I think24 that would be an okay instruction in the bank robbery25 hypothetical.34he did not­­look at his￼1 MR. BASH: It would be ­­2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: He drove the car.3 Principal object was to rob the bank, not to use the4 firearm, but he facilitated the use of a firearm. I can5 see that a judge could give that instruction.6 MR. BASH: I think the only way Petitioner7 fits that instruction into his view of the law is8 because the driver started out driving the people9 bank, so he says, oh, well, you are satisfying my10 reus requirement because you actually transported11 guns to the bank.12 But tweak the hypothetical a little bit.13 Suppose the getaway driver is paid only to show up at14 the end and to, you know, ferry the bank robbers away.15 He knows all along that it's going to be a firearm16 offense. I'm pretty sure Mr. Elwood would say: Because17 you took no act facilitating the gun in that case, you18 only sort of showed up at the end, even though you knew19 a gun would be used, that that's not facilitation.20 So I take your point, Justice Kennedy, that21 in a wide swath of cases it may not matter, but I think22 in some cases it is going to matter. And ­­ take his23 intent requirement. I mean, the person that lends the24 gun just to be a good guy, not because he cares about25 the offense, I'm pretty sure he is out. And if the jury35to theactusthe￼1 is convinced, hey, I knew he was going to commit a2 robbery or assault but I just did not care, if the jury3 is convinced by that, he is acquitted, and that can't4 possibly be right. He would not be guilty of any 924(c)5 offense at all. I mean not only the ten­year ­­6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you talk7 practically about what the difficulties are for the8 government in these scenarios? It's nice to put9 hypotheticals in where you know, where you say someone10 knew X, Y and Z. The reality is in most cases you11 don't. Occasionally you get a co­conspirator that will12 tell you, but in most cases you have just the act. A13 defendant is present during a crime, a gun is pulled,14 and he leaves with his cohorts. You don't know whether he15 had advance knowledge that the gun would be used because16 he wasn't carrying it and he may have done nothing but17 be present during the crime, left, and got a split of18 the money later, correct?19 MR. BASH: If he continued participating20 after he learned of the gun, yes.21 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's your point,22 right?23 MR. BASH: Yes.24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's your ­­25 MR. BASH: If he learned of the gun and364 arguing that ­­ that some form of5 crime with knowledge that the gun6 required. You are really arguing7 proof has to go.8 MR. BASH: Well, I ­­participation in theis being used isabout how far the￼1 said, hey, I'm out of this, he's not guilty.2 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So isn't this really an3 argument about how you define facilitation? You are not9 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because your adversary10 keeps saying mere knowledge that the gun's being used is11 not enough.12 MR. BASH: I think it's more qualitative13 than that and the question suggests it's purely14 quantitative. It's qualitative in the sense that the15 facilitation can relate to either element. So it can16 relate to the gun in particular or ­­ and this could be17 the guy that set up the drug deal knowing that a gun18 would be involved, or set up the robbery knowing that a19 gun would be involved.20 I think you see in the courts of appeals21 cases here the practical difficulties that come in22 because, although most court of appeals, I think eight,23 have technically adopted the position that you have to24 facilitate the gun in a direct way, if you look at the25 actual holdings of the cases it doesn't differ in371 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425practical application from our approach.      It's ­­ there is one case, I think it'sPrice out of the Third Circuit, where the guy may havelearned of the gun ­­ I may have the case name wrong,but the guy learned of the gun only as the robberywas ­­ was taking place, but he continued to participatein the robbery while his confederate brandished the gun,he collected the money and so forth.      And as far as your question about thepractical problems, I think explaining to a jury whatdoes it mean to facilitate the gun in a specific wayduring a crime like that is incredibly difficult.  Imean, we say in the brief:  What if you are exchangingthe money while the other person is brandishing thefirearm?  Maybe that person ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What is so hard about saying, did you have knowledge that the gun would be used, either ­­ and you facilitate ­­ but you continue to facilitate the crime?MR. BASH: We ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ the underlying crime. MR. BASH: We agree that that is law. JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Bash, what aboutthis case?  Suppose that there are two guys and they aretalking about committing a crime, and they have the same38￼￼1 kind of conversation that Justice Alito was referencing,2 you know, one guy says I want to bring a gun, the other3 says, no, I think that's a really bad idea. But this4 time, the guy says: Okay, you've convinced me, it's a5 bad idea to bring a gun, I won't bring a gun.6 And so then they go out and they rob7 whatever they are robbing, and in the middle of it, you8 know ­­ or they do a drug transaction, and in the middle9 of that drug transaction the guy who said don't bring a10 gun looks over and he realizes that, notwithstanding the11 promise, his confederate did bring a gun. But there12 they are, they are in the middle of their drug13 transaction.14 So the guy, you know, they're right ­­ they15 are handing the money to each other and the guy keeps on16 doing it, all right? Is ­­ is that enough, even though,17 you know, there's foreknowledge, there's acts after he18 ­­ he realizes that the guy has a gun? Is that19 sufficient?20 MR. BASH: If the gun is drawn and the21 person continues to facilitate the drug crime or the22 violent crime, that is enough.23 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, what exactly would you24 want him to do at that point to not be convicted of25 this, of this offense? Would you want him to just say,39￼1 you know, sort of like drop everything, I'm out of2 there? Is that the idea?3 MR. BASH: Yeah. Take this case. This is4 an $800 marijuana deal. It's a small­scale drug deal5 that happens all the time without firearms. As Mr.6 Elwood says, usually this kind of deal is not done with7 a firearm; only 5 percent of marijuana offenses have a8 firearm.9 Yes, if you are on that kind of small­scale10 deal and all of a sudden it becomes an armed offense,11 you do have an obligation to withdraw. Now, of course,12 I think you might have a duress defense if you felt like13 if I withdraw I'm going to get shot, or something like14 that.15 JUSTICE KAGAN: Right. I mean, I guess16 that's the question: Is there always a reasonable17 opportunity to withdraw after you see that there's a gun18 in the offense that you didn't expect to be there? And19 do you think that there has to be a reasonable20 opportunity to withdraw, or would you say, no, everybody21 has a reasonable opportunity to withdraw all the time;22 you can just leave?23 MR. BASH: Two points on that. First, I24 think a lot of that would come in through the duress25 defense. I mean, if you really feel like, oh, my God,40￼1 this guy has a gun and he might shoot me if I withdraw,2 I think you have a pretty solid duress defense.3 The other point I would say which is maybe a4 little tangential to the hypothetical, is there's a5 traditional doctrine of aiding and abetting law. This6 is at 2.06 of the Model Penal Code. It's in the LaFave7 Treatise and the Wharton Treatise, that if you8 countermand your assistance after you have assisted but9 before the crime is accomplished or completed ­­ for10 example, if your assistance was only encouraging and you11 start discouraging, or if you take all actions possible12 to prevent the crime ­­ for example, you assisted, you13 have a change of heart, you call the police to prevent14 the crime, you are not liable for aiding and abetting.15 And I think that reflects a broader point,16 which is that the traditional common law contours of17 aiding and abetting work pretty well with the18 contemporary purposes and problems that this statute was19 designed to solve. I mean, this is a statute about the20 mix of guns and drugs or guns and violence. And I don't21 see why Mr. Elwood contends that if you assist one side22 of that equation or the other it is a different result.23 I think if you assist either side of that equation,24 knowing that the equation is going to happen, by the25 principle, that is aiding and abetting. It's aiding and41￼1 abetting under the historical test, I think it's aiding2 and abetting under this Court's cases, and I don't see3 why it would be a different result here.4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bash, would you5 explain why in this situation the gun abetted a drug6 deal when there was no drug deal? It had been thwarted.7 The drugs were stolen. They were not engaged in any8 attempt to sell the drugs. That was a failed attempt.9 So how is this done, abetting a drug deal, when the deal10 failed?11 MR. BASH: Well, of course, the12 prosecution's principal theory was that he was the13 gunman; he brought it along to facilitate his drug deal.14 But assuming the theory of the facts that the gun was15 fired after Gonzales absconded with the drugs, I mean, I16 think one way to think about it is like this: Suppose17 that what had happened is that Gonzales had gotten ten18 paces, and Petitioner or Joseph had tackled him and19 immediately snatched the drugs back. I don't think this20 Court or courts generally would expect the government to21 charge two counts of possession with intent to22 distribute for that brief period in which someone23 snatches possession away and you get it. That was24 certainly what the prosecutor thought here, and it's25 obviously not the issue in this case.42MR. BASH:JUSTICE KENNEDY:MR. BASH:JUSTICE ALITO:Yes.       You agree with that.Carried or used, yes.￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      The only way that question comes into thiscase is that Mr. Elwood is trying to say that theprosecutor understood that ­­ that you didn't needforeknowledge of the gun.  And that's not what theprosecutor understood.  The prosecutor understood thatthis offense could continue for at least some periodafter in which the Confederates gave chase to ­­ toreclaim the drugs.      And that may have been a wrong theory, butno one below ever understood that you could be convictedif you didn't know of the gun until your participationended.  That's why Petitioner never objected on thatground, and that's why, of course, we submit that itshould be reviewed for plain error.JUSTICE KENNEDY: And ­­ and you agree that for aiding and abetting, you must ­­ the gun offense, you must have knowledge that the gun is being carried by the cohort.                            Could the defendant herehave ­­ could the defendant here have been convicted ofpossession of the ammunition on the theory that ­­ underthe instructions ­­ would the instructions have allowed43￼1 that conviction on the theory that the defendant aided2 and abetted somebody else's possession of the3 ammunition?4 MR. BASH: I don't think so, because the5 judge never instructed that if you aid and abet, that's6 is the equivalent of constructive possession of ­­ of7 the bullets. And, in fact, I mean, what constructive8 possession means is that you have the ability to9 exercise control over this ­­ over the ammunition. So10 it doesn't gel with his theory that, oh, I didn't know11 about the gun until after the shots were fired.12 I mean, I don't think anyone thought that13 you could get a conviction because the shells were on14 the ground or something and you could pick them up after15 they were fired. The obvious view was that he was ­­16 the person who shot the gun ­­ and at minimum, I think17 those convictions, because there were no aiding and18 abetting instructions on them, show that he must have19 known about the gun ahead of time if he could exercise,20 at minimum, constructive possession over the ammunition21 fired from ­­22 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What ­­ what's the23 point of charging him with possession of the gun and24 possession of the bullets in the gun? It would seem to25 me that the proof would be pretty much the same.44￼1 MR. BASH: The proof ­­ the proof was the2 same in this case. They didn't charge him with3 possession of the gun. They charged him with use or4 carrying during and in relation to the drug trafficking5 offense. And then there were two counts of possession6 of the ammunition, which were linked to his felony7 status and his alien ­­ unlawful alien status.8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess, then,9 the question is: What's the point of charging him with10 possession of the bullets if you're not charging him11 with possession of the gun?12 MR. BASH: It ­­ we could have charged him13 with possession as a felon. We didn't. It's not14 totally clear to me why we didn't. But we certainly15 could have charged him with being a felon in possession16 of a firearm in this case.17 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Bash, you know, what18 sticks in my craw a little bit about your position is19 this: Usually, we want punishments to ­­ two people and20 they do very different things and they have very21 different intents, we want them actually to be punished22 differently.23 And what you're suggesting is that there24 is ­­ let's say a crime, two people are involved in it.25 One person does almost everything. You know, he does45￼1 90 percent of the stuff. And the other person does just2 a little thing, but something, you know, that goes to3 the offense that helps facilitate the offense. But it's4 really pretty small compared to the overall crime.5 And then in addition to that, that person6 does not have really full­fledged intent, just has a7 kind of knowledge that this other person with real8 purpose of intent is going to bring a gun.9 So ­­ so, you have a lesser act and a lesser10 intent, and notwithstanding that, you're saying that the11 person ought to be punished in the exact same way as his12 confederate.13 MR. BASH: We are saying that. I think14 that ­­ that ­­ that gels with the historic law of15 aiding and abetting, which, as Judge Friendly said in a16 case we cite in our brief, Garguilo, assistance of even17 slight moment counts. And ­­18 JUSTICE KAGAN: But I guess what I would19 have thought was that the actus reus can be very small,20 but almost to compensate for that, you have to have21 full­fledged intent. You have to have a really kind of22 purpose of ­­ a ­­ a purpose that the crime succeed as23 opposed to just knowledge of ­­ of what will happen.24 MR. BASH: Justice Kagan, I don't think that25 can be right for the examples I gave, paid accomplices46￼1 that don't have a stake or the person who lends the gun2 to be a good guy. And let me contrast that ­­ I never3 got to this example ­­ with what a pure knowledge4 standard would look like.5 Suppose there was looting, and the defendant6 breaks into the ­­ a store to facilitate his own entry7 in the store to steal goods. But he knows there's 208 people coming behind him, and he has now facilitated9 their entry into the store, too. That is not aiding and10 abetting under our theory because he did not even bear11 the intent to facilitate, by which we mean the intent to12 make some step in another person's crime easier. He13 knew it would do that, but that was incidental to an14 intent to facilitate his own crime.15 So I do think the mens rea is significantly16 ratcheted up from what a pure knowledge standard would17 look like.18 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you agree that in19 order to show aiding and abetting ­­ and I'll just quote20 from a California case here ­­ that, "The aider and21 abetter has to have knowledge of the criminal purpose of22 the perpetrator and the intent to facilitate it"?23 MR. BASH: Yes. I think what that24 formulation masks is exactly what intent to facilitate25 means, and I think that might be part of the47￼1 disagreement among the parties. And what we say is that2 it means an intent to make some step in what you know is3 a crime that he intend ­­ the principal intends to do4 easier. And we think it's got to be that.5 That's also the formulation in the6 historical sources we cite at page 47 at Footnote 10 of7 our brief. It's either the intent to commit the crime8 yourself or knowledge that the other person has that9 intent. And I don't see how it can be anything else.10 I mean, if ­­ if you assist someone in a ­­11 just to be a good person, not because you care if the12 crime succeeds, and if you ask them in ­­ with the truth13 serum, do you want the crime to succeed, you say, well,14 I'm totally indifferent to the crime.15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you ­­ would you16 agree that the statement ­­ that the first part of the17 instruction that the district court gave, "defendant18 knew his cohort used a firearm," is inaccurate? Is19 incomplete?20 MR. BASH:21 JUSTICE KENNEDY:22 MR. BASH:23 misleading. I think in context, how reasonable jurors24 would understand this and how the parties understood it,25 because nobody raised an objection to this below, I48Not ­­       Potentially misleading?In isolation, potentially￼1 think they understood that your knowledge had to arise2 before your completion ­­3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You would ­­4 MR. BASH: ­­ of your participation in the5 offense.6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You would never ­­7 if you got a call from the U.S. ­­ assistant U.S.8 attorney in the field said, this is the instruction I'm9 going to use, you would tell him, no, don't do that.10 MR. BASH: We ­­ we wouldn't. But the11 reason this Court has ­­ or the reason courts generally12 have objection rules is when questions about particular13 verb tenses and phrasings arise, the defendant or one of14 the parties is supposed to actually object to that in15 the district court. That didn't happen here.16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I know you have17 arguments about failure to object and harmless error.18 But on the substance of it, you think the instruction ­­19 you would never counsel someone to give that20 instruction.21 MR. BASH: Well, I think as we said in the22 brief, it would have been clearer to say "would use" or23 something that ­­ that makes absolutely clear that you24 required foreknowledge. I think if the Court has25 questions about this sort of case­specific issue along4914 you say in context, it15 MR. BASH:16 instruction ­­ or part17 paragraph immediately before18 JUSTICE SCALIA:just mirrored ­­That's it?  Just that?  "Into commit a crime, it iswillfully and knowingly￼1 with the forfeiture and waiver and harmless error and2 plain error issues, it could do this, and this would be3 a sensible result, it could clarify, one, facilitation4 with respect to either conduct element is enough as far5 as actus reus. Two, the intent to facilitate means an6 intent to make some step in that crime easier combined7 with knowledge that the principal bears the intent to8 complete the crime. And then it could remand to the9 court of appeals to say, sort out whether this10 instruction was wrong, whether that objection was11 forfeited, whether harmless error or plain error12 concepts come in here.13 JUSTICE SCALIA:      Why ­­ why do you say ­­was okay.  What ­­ what context?The ­­ Justice Scalia, theof the same instruction, the19 order to aid or abet another20 necessary that the defendant21 associated himself in some way with the crime."22 MR. BASH: Well, to help make the crime23 succeed. And I think a reasonable person reading that24 would not think I helped make ­­ helped make the 924(c)25 crime succeed if I didn't even know about the gun until50￼1 I was after doing ­­ I was done doing whatever I was2 going to do.3 And I also point the Court to page 194,4 which makes clear that "knowingly," in that second part5 of the instruction, is defined as voluntarily and6 intentionally. So you certainly had to intentionally7 participate in the drug trafficking crime. And that ­­8 part of the context, as this Court has said, is also9 just ­­10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Knowing that a gun would11 be used. You had to intentionally participate knowing12 that a gun would be used.13 MR. BASH: Basically a slight tweak, which14 is knowing that the principal bore the intent to use a15 gun. Obviously, you can't know the future. It's that16 you know that the principal bore that intent, which is a17 little bit different, but I think we're saying the same18 thing.19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I ­­ I don't see how20 "make the crime succeed" helps you because you would say21 the crime that he has to help make succeed is the22 underlying drug offense, not the use of the firearm.23 MR. BASH: No, Mr. Chief Justice, we24 wouldn't say that. This umbrella instruction applied to25 Count 1 and 2. The crime you're help making succeed is51￼1 924(c). What I was saying earlier was that, what does2 it mean to help make a crime succeed? It makes ­­ it3 means intent to make one ­­ at least one step in that4 crime easier, knowing the other person bore the intent5 to do the crime.6 And I think that's how we normally think7 about it. If there's an armed robbery, and you say,8 well, I'll drive the getaway car, I think you would9 naturally say in ordinary English you intended to help10 make that crime succeed even if you didn't bear a11 specific intent with respect to the gun.12 I certainly think on ­­ you know, if this13 had been objected to below, it might be a different14 matter with Mr. Elwood, but he did not object to this15 below. He didn't ­­ he didn't raise this ­­ this16 wording issue even in the court of appeals. He raised a17 sufficiency challenge with respect to foreknowledge.18 But he ­­ even in his court of appeals brief, he didn't19 say that the instructions in this case were wrong20 because it said "used" versus "would use."21 So I don't think the issue is properly here,22 but I think it would be a sensible resolution if the23 Court were to remand these case­specific issues after24 clarifying the basic standard of aiding and abetting to25 the court of appeals to work through the forfeiture and521 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425waiver of harmless error and so forth.If there are no further questions.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Elwood, you have four minutes remaining.     REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD       ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. ELWOOD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.      One point that I want to emphasize is apoint made by Justice Kagan, which is that traditionallybecause the actus reus is relatively small for aidingand abetting cases, that is exactly why courts haveadopted a standard of purposeful intent.  And they havesaid that because the act of an accomplice tends to beless harmful and tends to be more equivocal than that ofthe principal, that they ordinarily require purposefulintent.      And as Professor Wayne LaFave said, whoobviously doesn't have a stake in the case:  "Liabilityhas seldom been imposed on the basis of knowingassistance.  The background rule is that it has to bepurposeful intent."      JUSTICE BREYER:for that?      MR. ELWOOD:      JUSTICE BREYER:    What cases should I look upI think ­­    That is to say, I thought53￼1 generally in the criminal2 illegal act is liable for3 act. That is the general4 mean, people use all kinds of terminology, different5 kinds of terminology, but I thought that's the basic6 principle.7 MR. ELWOOD: The standard for accomplice8 liability requires purposeful intent. It's generally ­­9 JUSTICE BREYER: When you say "purposeful10 intent," He didn't want it, but he knew it would happen.11 MR. ELWOOD: It was his purpose ­­12 JUSTICE BREYER: And moreover, he helped to13 produce the occasion on which it would happen.14 MR. ELWOOD: It was his purpose for doing15 it. And the cases you can look at are Nye & Nissen ­­￼law a person who commits anthe known consequences of thatrule.  I can't think ­­ I1617 where 1819 Nye &20 where21 Hand case Peoni, that adopted the purposeful intent standard.22 And Peoni is obviously a very important case as well.23 But Hicks. In Hicks, in 1893 this Court24 reversed a conviction because the jury instruction did25 not require proof of intent to encourage the crime.54JUSTICE BREYER: Well just tell mein the brief they are, or whatever's easier.MR. ELWOOD: I mean, Nye & Nissen, the ­­ Nissen, which is a case of this Court from 1949, the Court adopted the standard from the Learned1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE BREYER: They used the word "intent."Some people used it in order tosituation ­­encompass theof the known butMR.

You have tohave purposeful intent ­­JUSTICE BREYER:MR. ELWOOD:JUSTICE BREYER:CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, do you haveanything for us on Rule 30?MR. ELWOOD: You know, on Rule 30, I won'tpretend that it was a model of clarity in preserving theerror about after­arising intent.  But I will say thatthere is no contest.  I mean, that is to us just a signof how messed up the jury instructions are.  But we didpreserve, we say, our objection both with respect to theabsence of facilitating the right offense, and theintent to commit the crime as opposed to knowledge thatthe gun would be used.  And so ­­CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How did you preserve that objection?MR. ELWOOD: With respect to intent, by objecting to their instruction on the basis that it didn't include intentional facilitation of the 924(c) offense.      And if there are no further questions, wewill rely on our submission.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.56    LaFave.LaFave, Wayne LaFave.LaFave.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425The case is
