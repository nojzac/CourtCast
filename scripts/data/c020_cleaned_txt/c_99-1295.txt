Gitlitzversus the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.          Mr. Hallett.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARRELL D. HALLETT               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MR. HALLETT:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it pleasethe Court:  As a result of the position taken by theCommissioner of Internal Revenue on the brief before thisCourt, the issue the Court needs to decide is a limitedone.  And that issue is whether the amount of debtdischarge or cancellation of debt of an insolvent debtorwhich is excluded from income under Section 108 is income,such that it amounts to an item of income which increasesthe  shareholder's stock basis under Sections 1366 and1367 of the Internal Revenue Code.          The Commissioner rests his entire case in hisbrief on the argument that under Section 108 no income isrealized by the insolvent debtor.  Your Honors, thatposition is clearly contrary to the statute.  And if I mayrather than paraphrasing initially, read the statute, Ithink it's really critical to this issue and resolves thisissue.  And that statute is section 108(a)(1) in the3 1    appendix to the petition, at Page 34. 2              And it states as follows:  Gross income does not 3    include any amount which, but for this subsection, would 4    be  includable in gross income by reason of the discharge 5    of indebtedness of the taxpayer if the discharge occurs 6    when the taxpayer is insolvent. 7              To paraphrase that, Your Honors, what that 8    subsection (a) says in hopefully plain English is that an 9    item is only excluded under Section 108 if it otherwise10    would have been included in gross income under Section 61.11              QUESTION:  Well, I think your argument under the12    statute is a strong one.  But is there any reason in tax13    theory or practical equity why Congress would want to14    allow this result in this particular case?  I mean, I15    understand that the statute may compel this, but is there16    some underlying rationale to support your position?17              MR. HALLETT:  It may well be consistent with the18    restructuring of the Internal Revenue Code in 1954, in19    which Congress said very broadly in Section 61 that gross20    income includes all income from whatever source derived,21    and listed specific items, some 15 of  those, and one of22    them is income from subsection 12.23              And then consistent with that over in Sections24    101 through 138, those items that are included in income25    are specifically excluded from gross income.  So --4 1              QUESTION: What I am asking is why would Congress 2    allow you to use income that you don't pay tax on, to 3    increase the basis and then which would allow you to 4    deduct additional unrelated losses? 5              MR. HALLETT:  Well, first of all, because this 6    statute clearly says that -- 7              QUESTION:  I know that's position number one. 8    I'm asking, is there a reason for this? 9              MR. HALLETT:  There's a reason for it is that in10    the final analysis, the basis reflects the  shareholder's11    equity in the corporation, roughly  speaking, and the12    shareholder gets equity in the corporation by contributing13    capital.  He also gets equity in the corporation when14    income is realized, taxable or nontaxable.  And the15    Congress recognized that if losses have accumulated such16    that they are not deductible because they exceed the17    basis, well when income is realized, nontaxable income18    such as municipal bond interest, that income goes down to19    increase the basis to reflect the fact that there now is20    an increased equity investment.21              QUESTION: Mr. Hallett, it seems that the22    Subchapter S shareholder is the only solvent entity who23    could take advantage of this.  The peculiar thing about24    this provision is that every other taxpayer, say a25    Subchapter C corporation, a partner in a partnership, the5 1    insolvent would have to be that entity, that tax paying 2    entity.  But here you have the peculiarity that the 3    Subchapter S corporation, which is not itself a taxpayer, 4    is the insolvent, while the shareholders are highly 5    solvent.  And is there any reason why Congress would want 6    to give those solvent taxpayers this advantageous7 treatment? 8              MR. HALLETT:  I think what -- they clearly did 9    that in 1984 when the Congress said that in the case of an10    S corporation, the amount is excluded if there's11    insolvency at the corporation level.  They certainly12    recognized that by doing that, the benefit of the13    exclusion would come down to the shareholder who could14    well be solvent.15              And I think to the extent the legislative16    history reflects why they did that, it made it simpler to17    look to the insolvency of the corporation rather than up18    to 75 shareholders.  They may well have recognized that in19    any situation, certainly not all, if the S corporation is20    in trouble, the shareholder is in trouble as well.21              QUESTION:  But it wasn't that way up until --22    and yet, in 1982 -- well, let me put it this way:  Do you23    recognize that if the 1982 law was still in place, the24    government should win?25              MR. HALLETT:  Well, it would depend on whether61    or not my clients the shareholders were insolvent.  If2    they were insolvent then they would be entitled to the3    result that we are seeking.4              QUESTION:  Yes, but in this case where we have5    very solvent shareholders and an insolvent Subchapter S6    corporation.7 8 9          MR. HALLETT:  This particular case, if the lawwould have remained as it was in 1982, then if theshareholder were solvent he would not be able to excludethe amount from gross income.          QUESTION:  So it was the change in '84?          MR. HALLETT:  It was a change in 1984.          QUESTION:  And so we would look to a reason forthat change if we are trying to understand, as JusticeKennedy asked, whether there might be something other thanthe words of the statute going for the position you are1011121314151617    taking?1819202122232425          MR. HALLETT:  That is true.  We would look tothe change.  But I think you would also look to thecritical statutes that existed prior to the change in 1984and the statutes which provide for the basis increase, andthose are Sections 1366 and 1367.          Now when Congress made the change in 1984, theydid not change those provisions.          QUESTION:  Mr. Hallett, is it invariably the                             71    case that this comes as a windfall to the solvent2    shareholder?  Would the government never recapture the3    benefit that the shareholder gets?4              MR. HALLETT:  Well, it's not the case that it's5    a windfall.  It's certainly not the case that it's a6    windfall.789          QUESTION:  Accept my characterization  of it asa windfall.  Would any events in the future enable thatbenefit to the shareholder to be recaptured by the10    government?111213141516171819202122232425          MR. HALLETT:  Well, certainly if you view abenefit excluding the debt discharge amount from grossincome, then if the attribute deduction provisions comeinto play, you could view that as a recapture of thebenefit in the future.          QUESTION:  Well, suppose the corporationsuddenly becomes solvent, its business picks up or in somenew sort of business. I assume that at that point thedistortion would even out for years, say one, two, three,four and five, because the net operating losses whichmight otherwise have been deducted against the new incomeare now diminished by reason of the discharge ofindebtedness income.          MR. HALLETT:  That's correct.          QUESTION:  So there, to answer Justice Scalia's81    question, there might be, I think there might be some2    instances in which this distortion, if we can call it3    that, or windfall, does even itself out?4              MR. HALLETT:  That's correct.  And much as Your5    Honor stated, the increase in basis by the amount of6    discharged debt occurs at the time of the insolvency and7    permits the taking of the losses.  And by taking of the8    losses, the losses of course go away.9              QUESTION:  So it isn't always a windfall or10    distortion, accepting those characterizations?11              MR. HALLETT:  It's not always a windfall.12              QUESTION:  And I guess this was in Justice13    Kennedy's question.  The events that deny the windfall14    character will be in subsequent tax years; is that15 correct?16              MR. HALLETT:  That's correct.  That's correct.17              QUESTION:  Going back to your very initial point18    about Section 108, if Section 108 had read,  items of19    income shall not include , instead of  gross income does20    not include , then the government would be right; is that21    correct?22232425          MR. HALLETT:  Well, I don't think so because it-- it would still presuppose that the item is income.  Inother words --QUESTION:  No. I'm saying if it specifically                   91 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425said income from discharge of a debt shall not be treatedas an item of income.          MR. HALLETT:  Yes.          QUESTION:  Then your whole case would collapse.          MR. HALLETT:  Yes.  If Congress would have saidspecifically that COD is not income.          QUESTION:  So it s the difference betweenexcluding from gross income and specifically stating thatit's not an item of income, as the case turns out.          MR. HALLETT:  Exactly.  And that's a veryimportant distinction that was drawn when Section 108 wasenacted in 1980.          I'd also point out, Your Honor, that if theCommissioner were correct, that COD is not income, thenSection 108 would never apply to an insolvent debtor.  Andif we look at Section 108(b), it only comes into play ifan amount is excluded under Section 108(a).  Now if it'snot income and it's therefore, doesn't come within 108(a)because it otherwise wouldn't be income, then theattribute reduction process which the Commissioner placesso much weight upon would never occur.          QUESTION:  So what's supposed to happen?  Somedisaster must occur in the tax code since the governmentdid at one point push this argument, but it stopped, Iwant to know what disaster occurs if you just take10 1    108(d)(7)(a), in which it says these things will apply at 2    the corporate level.  It says it applies at the corporate 3    level, those three sub -- four subsections, (a), (b), (c) 4    and (g); (c) and (g) are just special cases, but (a) and 5    (b) is the main case.  It says they apply at the corporate 6    level.  What does that mean?  It means it doesn't flow 7    through.  It's very simple; nothing flows through.  The 8    attributes don't flow through.  Nothing flows through. 9              All right.  Now once you say that, that cures10    what seems an anomaly from a point of view of policy.  Why11    don't we interpret it that way?1213 that. 1415    says, in the case of an S corporation, subsections (a),16    (b), (c) and (g) shall be applied at the corporate level.17    Now why can I not take those words to mean they shall be18    applied at the corporate level and only the corporate19    level, i.e., they do not flow through?20              MR. HALLETT:  Because we have to look at what is21    applied at the corporate level.  For example, subsection22    (a), the exclusion from gross income is applied at the23    corporate level.  And that's logically because the24    corporation realizes the income and it excludes it.25              QUESTION:  Right.11MR. HALLETT:  Because the statute doesn't sayQUESTION:  Well, let's see what it says.  It1              MR. HALLETT:  Subsection (b), and this is the2    critical part of the statute, an essential part of the3    statute as amended in 1984, is that the insolvency is4    determined at the corporate level.  But those two5    provisions do not say anything about the basis pass6 through.7 8 9          QUESTION:  I know they say nothing.  They saynothing.  So what I'm doing is suggesting that becausethey say nothing one way or the other, one can interpretthose words  shall be applied at the corporate level  tomean everything to do with 108 applies at the corporatelevel in the case of the Subchapter S corporation, anddoes not flow through.  So what I'm asking you is why canI not do that?10111213141516171819202122    language?23              MR. HALLETT:  The plain language of the24    statute.          MR. HALLETT:  Because the statute doesn't sayeverything occurs at the corporate level.  It says thegross income is excluded --          QUESTION:  I've got that point.  Your point isthe language.MR. HALLETT:  Yes.QUESTION:  Is there anything other than the25              QUESTION:  Nothing else.                                  121 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          MR. HALLETT:  And the failure to say anything ineither 108 or Sections 1366 and 67 about the general ruleof basis -- pass through to basis not occurring.          QUESTION:  So you're --          MR. HALLETT:  There's nothing to suggest that.Not a hint.          QUESTION:  Is it an answer to Justice Breyer,and I may be wrong about this, that if that interpretationprevailed, there would be some instances in which theshareholder was really entitled to a double tax.  In otherwords, if there were basis left and the basis were notdecreased as a result of this interpretation, then theshareholder in effect would be paying a double tax in someinstances, or am I wrong about that?1011121314151617181920212223    reduced.24              MR. HALLETT:  That's true.  That's true.25              QUESTION:  Mr. Hallett, may I go back to an          MR. HALLETT:  Well, I'm not sure it would resultin a double tax.  I think it clearly would read into theCode language that's simply not there.          QUESTION:  Well, that the shareholder would betaxed in effect for discharge of indebtedness income eventhough the corporation was insolvent.MR. HALLETT:  That's true.QUESTION:  Because the basis would not be13 1    earlier colloquy, and that is, as I understand it in this 2    case, the tax attributes, at least under your theory, they 3    wouldn't -- that would be an academic question because the 4    losses here were entirely wiped out against the increased 5    basis.  Isn't that right?  There were no losses left. 6              MR. HALLETT:  True.  Once we go through the 7    process of determining how much the losses exceeded basis 8    for the taxable year, as the statute tells us to do, if 9    the losses are completely absorbed by the COD, if they are10    completely absorbed because of the increase in basis, then11    assuming there's no other attribute, assuming there's no12    basis in assets that can be reduced, that would be true.13              QUESTION:  I take that to be the case here, that14    the losses were totally absorbed.15              MR. HALLETT:  No.  Actually, and I have to point16    out, this is not in the record, Your Honor, the losses17    were totally absorbed but there was some $800 thousand18    basis in assets and properly applied, even though the19    losses were absorbed, the COD income is still there and20    the COD income would be applied in the next taxable year21    to reduce the basis in the assets.22              QUESTION:  But that's not -- we don't have the23    next tax return before us, so we don't --24              MR. HALLETT:  No, no, that's true.  That's25    correct.  And I would just point out, it's a very14 1    important concept of Section 108 that, I think it's -- you 2    read the legislative  history and it does admittedly talk 3    about a purpose is to pick up the income in the future 4    through the attribute reduction, but Congress allowed a 5    very very important exception to that.  And that's the 6    full ability to use net operating loss carryovers or basis 7    in the case of property sold in the year of discharge. 8    Very very important, such that certainly many taxpayers 9    are going to have excluded COD income but they are not10    going to have any attributes to be reduced.11              I don't believe the situation we have here is in12    any way an anomaly.  We have absolute proof of that in one13    of the cases.  The Pugh case, there were no attributes at14    all.  There were no suspended losses, there was no basis15    in assets  to reduce.  And the Court of Appeals of course16    held that the COD passed through.17              So we know that situation.  We know that18    situation exists.19              QUESTION:  Why do you say it's no anomaly?  I20    would think with an ordinary corporation the chance of an21    insolvent corporation ending up with a lot of positive22    income in the year of insolvency is pretty low.  With an23    individual, the chance of an individual ending up with a24    lot of positive income in the year of insolvency is pretty25 low.15 1              In the case of an S corporation, the chance that 2    a shareholder of the insolvent S corporation could have a 3    lot of positive income in that year is pretty high.  And 4    therefore, if we accept your intention for an S 5    corporation, your interpretation, we reach as a practical 6    matter quite a different result in terms of tax windfalls 7    than you do in the other two instances. 8              MR. HALLETT:  Well, I think though in the other 9    two instances, take a corporation that's in trouble and10    has net operating losses, it could well be the situation11    that it doesn't have any basis in its assets in excess of12    the liabilities.  It excludes the amount from income and13    it doesn't have any attributes to reduce.  That's what I'm14    saying; it's not an anomaly to have a situation such as we15    have in this case that whether it's a corporation, a16    regular corporation or a partnership, that we don't end up17    with any attributes to reduce, particularly because they18    can be used in the taxable year  of the discharge.19              QUESTION:  May I ask you a question about --20    nobody seems to discuss in the briefs about, 108(2)(e),21    which says, it seems to say in so many words, (e)(1), it22    says  basis reduction , that -- why isn't that relevant,23    that there's a direct reduction to basis under (e)?  You24    know what I'm talking about?  It's on page 36 of the25 appendix.16 1               Reduction  -- subsection (b) says  reduction of 2    tax attribute  and it lists the things that are reduced. 3              MR. HALLETT:  Yes. 4              QUESTION:  And the last thing listed is the 5    basis  of the property of the taxpayer. 6              MR. HALLETT:  Yes. 7              QUESTION:  Why doesn't that -- 8              MR. HALLETT:  Well, that could come into play if 9    for example, if the taxpayer here had $800 thousand of10    basis in property, not the taxpayer, but if the S11    corporation had the $800 thousand basis in property, then12    that would be reduced.  That would be reduced.  It would13    be reduced though specifically, Section 1017 says it would14    be reduced after the taxable year of the discharge, as of15    the beginning of that year.16              I would just call the Court's attention as well17    to one other section that I think solidifies that income18    is realized as a result of debt discharge and that's19    Section 108(e)(1) on page 43.  And it specifically says20    there is no other insolvency exception to the general rule21    that COD is income to be included in gross income.  And22    that general rule is provided in Section 61(a)(12).23              And finally on this matter, the Commissioner24    goes back to 1923 and cites court cases particularly in25    the depression era, and a Treasury regulation that was17 1    promulgated before the substantial 1980 revisions of 2    Section 108.  And I would point out that those court cases 3    are flawed reasoning.  The notion is that -- 4              QUESTION:  They are what, Mr. Hallett? 5              MR. HALLETT:  They represent flawed reasoning. 6    The rationale in those cases that if a debtor realizes 7    debt discharge, that there is no income if he's insolvent. 8    Of course the Court held in 1931 in Kirby Lumber that as a 9    general  proposition there is income.  And these cases in10    the depression era picked up on some language in Kirby11    Lumber about  the forgiveness of the debt frees up12    assets .  And they said well, if you're insolvent, it13    doesn't add to  assets.  And so there is no realization of14 income.15              That was the rationale of those cases.  And I16    submit that just defies economic reality where a debtor17    has $2 million in debt, or $1 million in debt, or $100,00018    in debt, and that is discharged.  And if he's a few19    hundred dollars or a few hundred thousand dollars still20    insolvent after the discharge, that's a real economic21    benefit.  He can take the amount that otherwise would be22    paid for principal and interest on that debt and apply it23    to expenses to keep going.  When you recognize that the24    insolvency is determined based on the fair market value of25    the assets, it could well have a situation where the real18 1    estate operating assets, the value doesn't exceed the 2    debts. 3              But when a million dollars of debt is 4    discharged, that money is indeed freed up.  It does 5    indeed free up the liquid assets to either pay down other 6    debts or refinance or pay expenses. 7              If that rationale applied, if that rationale 8    applied, that would mean where a debtor is insolvent and 9    sells an asset for a million dollar gain, that -- but is10    still insolvent, and say he takes the million dollars and11    uses it to pay off debt, if that rationale applied, there12    would be no income in that situation.  Because after the13    transaction, even though he's had gain, he's still14    insolvent.  That's not the tax law.15              And I submit that that transaction cannot be16    meaningfully distinguished from the situation where the17    debt is directly discharged.18              Let me turn briefly to the specific language of19    Sections 1366 and 1367.  And I think  there's a question20    of where do you start here.  Do you start with Section 10821    or do you start with Sections 1366 and 67?  I don't think22    it makes a difference.  Because if you start with Section23    108, you go to 108(d)(7)(b).  And that sends you over to24    Sections 1366 and Sections 1367.  Sends you over to25    determine the amount of the losses that are disallowed for19 1    the taxable year of the discharge before you can determine 2    that there is an attribute. 3              And those, I would just point out that 1366 and 4    67 are very, very broad.  This isn't a narrowly drawn 5    statute.  It says in 1366 that all items of income, 6    including tax exempt income, are taken into account in 7    determining shareholder basis. 8              Congress described the reason for the basis 9    increase in some of the legislative history as insuring10    that if an item is nontaxable, then if there's later a11    distribution, the shareholder doesn't have to recognize12    income as a result of the -- it preserves its13    nontaxability.  The Commissioner seizes upon this stated14    purpose of a shareholder basis increase and argues that,15    well, that means that you only could increase basis for a16    nontaxable item if you get cash, money in the till that17    you can distribute in kind.18              Well, the statutes don't require that there be a19    distribution in kind.  The statutes don't say that you20    have to lock the cash up in a safe deposit box and use it21    in the future for a distribution.  The fact is if you have22    municipal bond interest that's collected and used to pay23    debt you are in the same situation on the bottom line24    balance sheet situation of the shareholder and the25    corporation.20 1              But the critical event here, and this is -- I'm 2    glad the Commissioner brought up this notion of 3    realization of income, because commentators and some of 4    the courts have said that, well, you shouldn't give the 5    shareholder the losses because he hasn't had an economic6 loss. 7              Well, the point is, he's had an economic gain. 8    It's the economic gain, the income, that Congress has 9    chosen not to tax, that permits the taking of the losses.10              I would finally point out under Section 108 that11    -- excuse me; before I get to that I would point out that12    what we are asking for is consistent treatment here.  An S13    corporation that gets excludable municipal bond interest14    is entitled to up the basis and take losses.  And we ask15    for the same thing.16              The -- all other debtors who exclude COD income17    get to use their attributes in the year of discharge and18    we ask for the same thing.  And this 108(d)(7)(b) has19    really been a matter of confusion.  It hasn't been read20    closely.  It requires that before you eliminate any losses21    you have to go over to Sections 1366 and 67 and determine22    if there is an excess of losses remaining after the COD23    income is taken into account.2425    rebuttal.I will reserve the remainder of my time for211 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Hallett.          Mr. Jones, we'll hear from you.              ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MR. JONES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleasethe Court.          Congress did not provide to Subchapter Sshareholders the unique double tax benefit thatpetitioners seek.1011121314151617181920    it.2122 23 24 25          MR. JONES: The timing question, we don't thinkthe timing question ever arises in this case, nor has itever properly arisen in any of the other cases.          QUESTION: But you did argue the theory that theTenth Circuit accepted; you argued it in the Court of22          The simple question presented here is whetherthe discharge of debt of an insolvent is an item of incomeor tax exempt income that flows through to shareholdersand increases their basis under 1366.          The plain text of the directly applicablestatutes seems to provide a pretty clear answer to that.          QUESTION: Mr. Jones, would you clarify whetheryou are indeed walking away from the rationale of theTenth Circuit which was not about the characterization ofthis as income, but was a timing question, as I understand1 Appeals. 2              MR. JONES: Actually, I believe the Tenth Circuit 3    developed that theory on its own.  I believe that in the 4    Tenth Circuit as in the other cases our argument has been 5    twofold: that this item has never been regarded in the 80- 6    year history of the Internal Revenue Code as income for an 7    insolvent taxpayer. Secondly, that 108(d)(7) recognizes 8    and is an emanation of that fact. 9              The Tax Court rationale was that 108(d)(7) says10    all of this happens at the corporate level.  And it isn't11    income because it's excluded and it's not tax exempt12    income so nothing passes through.13              QUESTION: To put Justice Ginsburg's question14    another way, if you do not prevail on your argument that15    it's not income, I take it you don't ask us to accept a16    backup position that reflects the view of the Circuit on17 timing.18              MR. JONES: If the Court were to disagree with19    our basic contentions, then you would be faced with a20    problem -- then as a Court the problem would be that you21    have the clear history of the statute that says this is22    not to be treated as income.  It's to be applied against23    tax attributes and then to be disregarded.  So you would24    have that clear history.  You would also have the25    presumptive rule that tax statutes should not be                                  231 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425interpreted to provide a double benefit.          QUESTION: No, we don't think it's a problem.Let's assume that we simply reject that argument.  I wantto know if the backup argument, if you think that as amatter of sound, statutory construction, I think this iswhat Justice Ginsburg was asking, for us to accept thetiming rule adopted by the Circuit.          MR. JONES: It is an appropriate resolution ofthe problem if you reach it, and the reason that is so, isthat 1336(d)(2)requires the losses, the suspended lossesfrom the prior year, to be brought into the corporation inthe year of the discharge.  And then --          QUESTION: 1336 or 66?          MR. JONES: 1366(d)(2).          QUESTION: Now Mr. Jones, we've got some 20 pagesin the appendix of statutory sections.  When you cite astatutory section, could you refer us to the page of theappendix on which it is?          MR. JONES: On Page 53 of the petition appendix.It says, any loss or deduction which is disallowed for ataxable year by reason of the prior paragraph of that samepage, shall be treated as incurred by the corporation inthe succeeding taxable year.          Now this is the point that the Tenth Circuitmade, that this provision brings back into the year of the24 1    discharge the losses from the prior year, the suspended 2    losses from the prior year.  And then -- 3              QUESTION: But Mr. Jones, isn't that antithetical 4    to the -- is it in 1017 the general timing rule that you 5    take this in the next year, not in the year of the -- 6              MR. JONES: It is a different treatment of 7    suspended losses.  It is expressly a different treatment 8    of suspended losses and how they are handled on the 9    Subchapter S return.  These are rules peculiar to10    Subchapter S's.  Yes.  The answer to your question is yes.11    It is a different treatment for suspended losses.  It12    brings them into the year of the discharge.  And then13    under 108 we know that the tax attribute reduction is to14    apply at the corporate level.15              QUESTION: If you think that the timing rule is16    changed here, it's surprising that you didn't make any17    suggestion of that in your brief.18              MR. JONES: Well, I think that it's -- I wouldn't19    call it a fall-back argument but I would call it not a20    correct way to analyze the basic problem that we have in21    this case, which is that the courts have glossed over the22    question of whether this has ever been regarded as an item23    of income, and in particular whether Congress intended it24    to be treated as such, when the history of the statute25    says as clearly as it could that Congress accepted the 80                                  25 1    year old position of the Treasury and the judicial 2    insolvency exception, did not regard this as an item of 3    income, said that it was to be applied to reduce tax 4    attributes and then in the words of both the House and 5    Senate reports, has no further tax consequences. 6              QUESTION: Let me see if I can get you to focus 7    precisely on the point I'm trying to understand.  You have 8    just told us that in the Tenth Circuit brief we will not 9    have found this unusual approach to the timing question.10    We would not have found that in the government's argument.11    We certainly don't find it in our brief in this Court.12    I'm just trying to determine whether the government at13    least considered it an alternate argument in the lower14    courts and for some reason abandoned it here.15              MR. JONES: I think it -- I wouldn't quite put it16    that way.  I think that the right way to put it is the way17    I have put it, which is that with proper -- we are18    presenting this case to you with complete integrity.  We19    think this issue need not be reached in this case.20              QUESTION: Did you present it the same way in the21    Tenth Circuit?22              MR. JONES: Actually, I believe in the Tenth23    Circuit we didn't address the issue.  I believe the Tenth24    Circuit developed its analysis on its own.25              QUESTION: So if I look at the government's261 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9brief, I'll find that corroborated?          MR. JONES: I think that's correct.          QUESTION: Did you address the issue you are nowaddressing in the Tenth Circuit?          Mr. JONES: I'm sorry, Justice?          QUESTION: Did you address the issue you'representing to us in the Tenth Circuit other than --10111213141516    brief?171819202122232425          MR. JONES: Well, you are expressing a closefamiliarity with that and I don't remember footnote 14.          QUESTION: I didn't dig this out myself.  It wasstated in your opponent's presentation.  Is it inaccurate?          MR. JONES: It is -- I have recently looked atour brief in the Tenth Circuit and my recollection of ourbrief in the Tenth Circuit was that we made the same pointand we made the same argument in the context that the taxcourt resolved the issue, which is that first they talked27          MR. JONES: Yes.          QUESTION: -- in footnote 14 of your brief.          MR. JONES: Although in the Tenth Circuit, wewere defending the tax court's ruling.          QUESTION: Yes, but for whatever reason, thisargument that you now say is so obvious on the face of theCode, was this referred to in your argument to the TenthCircuit other than in a footnote, footnote 14 of your 1    about how it's all done at the corporate level.  And then 2    having reached that conclusion, emphasized that there is 3    no item of income and no tax exempt income in connection 4    with this item. 5              QUESTION: This does not constitute income.  You 6    made that explicit argument? 7              MR. JONES: Yes.  In fact, we noted that the 8    Treasury regulations have provided this for 70 years, long 9    before 61 was enacted, long before 108, and that the10    courts had adopted the judicial insolvency exception, had11    agreed with the Commissioner that no income arises from12    the discharge of the debt of the insolvent.13              QUESTION: Are there past cases in which the IRS14    has argued that something is not income, or is this a15 first?16              MR. JONES: Well, it's an uncomfortable position17    for us.  I mean, I would love to be able to resolve this18    case properly without addressing that subject.  But we19    can't because Congress made that the fulcrum of its20    legislative determination.21              QUESTION: You know, it seems a little22    contradictory to say that under Section 108, the taxpayers23    here have to pay some sort of tax whether you call it a24    deferred tax or just a price on something that you say25    isn't income of any type.  It just seems contradictory.28 1    And I'm concerned, if we say it's not income, that there 2    may be other items that are currently considered to fall 3    within section 61 as income that all of a sudden we find 4    aren't.  And I don't know how far that would take us if we5 -- 6              MR. JONES: I don't know of any other.  And of 7    course I don't know if that provides you with any comfort, 8    but let me answer the first part of the question you 9    raised which is, are there other situations where10    something that does not constitute income has an effect on11    basis, or doesn't.  The closest example, and I don't12    believe it's quoted in the appendix, is 1368(b).  And13    1368(b) is a provision that says that if a Subchapter S14    corporation has no earnings and profits and makes a15    distribution to its shareholder, that won't be treated as16    income and under 1367 it will reduce their basis.17              Well, this is a similar determination.  If18    something has happened here that puts the shareholders in19    a position whether they might --20              QUESTION: Excuse me.  That means it won't be21    treated as income to the shareholder.22              MR. JONES: Yes.23              QUESTION: You are not talking about whether in24    the abstract it's an item of income.  They have to say25    that it's not treated as an item of income because29 1    otherwise it normally would be. 2              MR. JONES: Well, actually, if you look at the 3    close words of the statute, it doesn't say that.  Section 4    61 begins with the phrase "except as otherwise provided, 5    discharge of a debt is not an item of income".  And that 6    recognizes the historical distinction that Justice -- that 7    this Court had talked about in Commissioner versus Tufts, 8    in Justice Blackmun's opinion that the whole theory of the 9    discharge of indebtedness doctrine is that the discharge10    frees up the assets of the debtors and he could use them11 to --12              QUESTION: May we go back to the formulation that13    gross income does not include? Well, that same formulation14    is also used for tax exempt bond interest.15              MR. JONES: Yes.16              QUESTION: For life insurance proceeds, and even17    though it says the same exact words, does not -- gross18    income does not include, we know that those do up the19 basis.20              MR. JONES: Not as an item of income though.21    They come in as tax exempt income.  1366 raises the basis22    for items of income including tax exempt income.  Tax23    exempt income is something that really is income, and it's24    an accretion to wealth.  The only example that --25              QUESTION: But the words of the statute are the30 1    same.  Gross income does not include. 2              MR. JONES: Right.  But tax exempt income is real 3    income.  It's something that you receive.  It's an asset. 4    It is an accretion to wealth within the concept of -- 5              QUESTION: And forgiveness of indebtedness -- 6              MR. JONES: Is not.  Forgiveness of indebtedness 7    for an insolvent, as Justice Blackmun pointed out in 8    footnote 11 of Commissioner versus Tufts, doesn't free up9 any assets.10              QUESTION: But that was addressed by your11    adversary.  He said well, suppose you have a corporation12    which is insolvent by a million dollars, and part of that13    is a $950,000 indebtedness.  There's a world of14    difference.  It amazes me that the government says this15    isn't income.16              QUESTION: Or to put it more simply, if my bank17    told me, you know, forget about your mortgage.  Boy, I'd18    feel a lot richer.  You are telling me that that is not an19    accretion of wealth? That's unbelievable.20              MR. JONES: My responsibility to this Court is to21    tell you how Congress, what we understand Congress used22    these terms to mean.  Congress could not have been more23    clear.  They adopted a judicial insolvency exception that24    adopted a longstanding regulatory interpretation.  It25    doesn't matter, this Court doesn't have to resolve the31 1    broader question of whether under Commissioner versus 2    Glenshaw Glass this might be thought to be an accretion of 3    wealth.  You don't have to resolve this question because 4    what is before the court is how did Congress view that 5    difference. 6              QUESTION: Given that is before the Court, what 7    was your answer to Justice Ginsburg. I was having exactly 8    the same problem.  I accept its a loophole, for argument's 9    sake. If it was a terrible loophole, this would not be the10    first loophole that Congress wrote and it won't be the11    last.  And maybe it would be the last, marvelous. There12    are 31 separate -- 29 separate subsections of this statute13    that use the words "gross income does not include". And I14    take it in respect to every one of those but one, you will15    say they are items of income. And obviously one thing I16    would be reluctant to do is to take those same words17    "gross income does not include", and say that those are18    items of income in every instance but this one.19              Or in every instance but three.  Or create a new20    spider web of rules as to when the words "gross income21    does not include" does mean it is none the less items of22    income but doesn't in other.  That's the problem I'm23    facing.  And to say "it's Congress's clear intent" doesn't24    help me solve that problem.25              MR. JONES: But it should help you resolve that321    problem because what's at issue was what was Congress's2    intent when it used the phrase "items of income."3              QUESTION: And are you saying it's always the4    same, those words "gross income does not include" in those5    29 subsections whatever they are referring to is never an6    item of income or do you mean sometimes is and sometimes7 isn't?8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. JONES: I think I'm focused on your problem.I think the answer to your question is probably that inall of those instances it wouldn't be an item of income.          QUESTION: Never? What for example about alessor's income?  There's a reference here to a payment bya lessor of a certain kind of rent which I thought surelywould increase basis.          MR. JONES: It wouldn't be income received in theyear.  And what happens is you are supposed to reduce thebasis and recognize as this Court said in Centennial Bank,recognize that deferred income in future years.  And asthat's recognized then it becomes an item of income inthat sense.  But in the first year it's not treated as anitem of income for this purpose.          QUESTION: Then it's income when it hurts thetaxpayer in later years?           MR. JONES: It's income -- if it's income thenit increases the basis.  And if its not income, it33 1    doesn't.  And if its not income and doesn't increase the 2    basis then it's -- then any income effect would be 3    recognized in subsequent periods. 4               QUESTION: Could you answer one other question 5    which is, -- but it's going to sound as if it's on your 6    side so be tempted to agree but don't agree because you 7    haven't pushed this argument and I want to know why. 8              It seemed to me that the strongest point was the 9    words keeping it at the corporate level. Because if you10    kept it at the corporate level no problem I can think of11    would be caused and it eliminate the loophole and seems12    consistent with the language, but you have not pushed that13    argument. And therefore there must be some disaster in tax14    law lurking.15              MR. JONES: We do. We put it as our second point.16    We don't abandon that argument.  It's definitely addressed17    in our brief. Its sort of an intellectual fussiness that18    causes us to address the income issue first and then the19    shareholder issue, I mean the corporate level issue.  And20    that is because (d)(7) wasn't enacted, as Justice Ginsburg21    pointed out until 1984.  But in 1980 Congress already went22    ahead and said this is not to be treated as an item of23    income; it's to be used to reduce attributes and it is to24    have no further tax consequences.  So we shouldn't have to25    look to 1984 legislation in (d)(7) to answer this34 1    question.  Now (d)(7) is consistent with our answer and 2    therefore and it is a sufficient answer.  But it seems to 3    me to be perfectly faithful to what Congress said they did 4    and to what the text of the these statutes permit us to 5    understand.  We don't have to go to 84.  We can go right 6    to where Congress said.  And I want to point out in this 7    respect that it is solely on the 1980 legislation that 8    professors Victor and Lokin reviewed the history, reviewed 9    the provisions and agreed with us that the discharge of10    indebtedness of an insolvent party does not represent an11    item of income and is to be ignored after it's applied12    against the tax attributes.  Now what Petitioners' is:13    let's not ignore it, let's get a tax benefit from it.14    We'll pass it through as if it were income.  We will get a15    basis adjustment that allows us to deduct the standard16    losses.  And what they have done is used 108 to enhance17    their tax attributes when section 108(b) makes it clear18    that the whole point of 108(b) is to reduce tax19    attributes.20              QUESTION: What do you think Congress did then in21    '84? I take it that taxpayer is conceding that if the 8222    law remained in place a Subchapter S shareholder would be23    just like a partner in partnership and could not get this24 benefit?25              MR. JONES: Well that --                                  35 1              QUESTION: But there was a change in 108, and it 2    seemed to me that what you were essentially arguing is 3    that we should undo the change that Congress made in 108. 4    And you are telling me, no, the change in 108 didn't do 5    anything? Or what? 6              MR. JONES: It didn't change the basic principles 7    of 108 that the amendment in 1984 simply said that the tax 8    attribute reduction would be applied at the corporate 9    level for Subchapter S corporations.  This is in10    108(d)(7)(a).111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION: If they applied at the shareholderlevel then you have a solvent shareholder.          MR. JONES: If they applied it at the shareholderlevel for solvent shareholders they would recognize theincome and pay it on their own returns.  It wouldn't haveany consequence.          QUESTION: Right.  But what was the effect ofsaying take it at the corporate level so that theinsolvent is the corporation?          MR. JONES: Congress said that they were doingthat because they wanted all shareholders to be treatedthe same.  That was the explanation that Congress gave.          QUESTION: Well, didn't somebody point out toCongress or didn't Congress know that a Subchapter Scorporation is quite different from a Subchapter C361    corporation?2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. JONES: Well, this is a special rule actuallythat applies only for Subchapter S's.          QUESTION: But you just me the rationale was thatall corporations should be treated alike.          MR. JONES: All shareholders of this Subchapter Scorporation should be treated the same.  In other wordsthey didn't want to -- Congress said they didn't want tohave shareholder one to be treated differently fromshareholder two although as you are aware for partnershipsthat kind of different treatment can result.  But Congressdidn't think this had anything to do with - that thechange in 108(d)(7) had anything to do with the issue herebecause they had already resolved the issue in 1980 whenthey explained how these statutes were to work.          And I want to point out that in 1993 whenCongress amended Section 108 to extend its application toqualified real property indebtedness, Congress wentthrough the operation of these same provisions and saidthe same thing.          QUESTION: But Congress was explicit there in away it isn't here.          MR. JONES: I don't know how Congress could havebeen more explicit in--          QUESTION: Didn't Congress say that there won't                            37          be any increase in basis?          MR. JONES: That's true.          QUESTION: and here we don't have anything thatsays it won't be an increase in basis.          MR. JONES: We have awfully good indication ofthat.  We have Congress saying it's not income.  It's onlyto be used to reduce tax attributes.  It has no other tax12345678    consequences. 9101112131415161718192022              MR. JONES: 93.23              QUESTION: 93.24               MR. JONES: Yes.25              QUESTION: So I am asking about when they made38          QUESTION: But you will concede that to say basiswill not be increased is something a lot clearer than whatyou are presenting to us?          MR. JONES: Yes, it's perfectly clear.  But to meit's -          QUESTION: So why didn't they make that samestatement with respect to this, knowing that the courtswere all over the lot?          MR. JONES: In 1980 the courts were not all overthe lot.  In 1980 no court had ever suggested that thedischarge of the debt of an insolvent was income.                QUESTION: What was the year of the real estate21    provision?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that change in 93 and they said basis will not beincreased.  Why didn't they just say, well, let's do thesame thing for subchapter S corporations?          MR. JONES: I am sorry. They were talking aboutSubchapter S corporations in 1993.  They were talkingabout exactly the issue we have in this case.          QUESTION: But I'm just simply asking you whydidn't they make that same change to say explicitly basiswill not be increased, since that would have cured --          MR. JONES: The statute wasn't amended in any ofits substantive characters in 93.  They just added anotherprovision to the same statute          QUESTION: Yes, but couldn't they have said "nowwe are adding this provision.  And we are making thisthing explicit.  To make the statute compatible we oughtto make that same provision elsewhere."          MR. JONES: They were talking about, -- When theysaid basis is not adjusted, they were talking about theSubchapter S corporation provisions involved in this case.So they were talking about previously enacted provisionsof Section 108 in describing how they applied.          QUESTION: There are certain words that are used.          MR. JONES: Basis is not increased by --          QUESTION: Yes.  And why wasn't it made clearthen? Basis is not increased, with respect to this                            395 6 7 8 9          QUESTION: No, we are not.  We have a provisionthat says those words expressly.  You are asking them -          MR. JONES: It's not a provision.  It's justlegislative history.          QUESTION: I thought it was in the statute          QUESTION: Its not in the statute itself in any          MR. JONES: It was in the history of the 93subchapter S?          MR. JONES: That is exactly what they said at1234    communicating.that the time in '93.  I'm sorry. We are not10 itself. 11          MR. JONES: No, I am sorry. Now I understand.  Itwas in the history of --121314    case?1516    amendment that Congress in going through how the statute17    operates, explained that for subchapter S corporations18    this is not an item of income; it doesn't adjust basis.19    That is all I am saying.  I am not saying that this is20    binding history.21              QUESTION: Is there a provision of the Internal22    Revenue Code that says basis will not be increased that23    was a change that was made in the statute, not legislative24    history?25              MR. JONES: I am not familiar with that, but it401    is just the contrary.  The statute says only that basis2    will be adjusted if there's an item of income.  An3    Congress said this isn't and item of income.  I know that4 that's -5              QUESTION: Perhaps I will look for it. It's that6    real estate -- I am sure that you must be familiar with it7    and I thought that in that statute itself those words8 appeared. 910111213141516171819 --"20              QUESTION: Yes.21              MR. JONES: Income includes income from discharge22    --232425    says except as otherwise provided, income includes income41          MR. JONES: I am not familiar with that.          The contention that if it is not an item ofincome then its tax exempt income is also fundamentallyflawed for the same reason. Its not tax exempt incomebecause its not an accretion to wealth. Its not income inthe first place.          QUESTION: Except that Section 61 of Title 26says that income includes income from discharge ofindebtedness. I mean that's a germinal provision.          MR. JONES: It says "Except as otherwise providedQUESTION: So that is the normal rule.MR. JONES: Well, that's the contingent rule. It 1    from discharge. 108 says it does not include income from 2    discharge of an insolvent. And that is the 80 year history 3    of the Internal Revenue Code. 4              QUESTION: And it also says it does not include 5    income from a lot of other things. I mean, as Justice 6    Breyer was pointing out earlier, there are a lot of other 7    things as to which it says the same thing. And all it 8    means is that although gross income would normally mean 9    this, for purposes of subchapter S, it will not mean that.10    But that does not mean -- it is in the abstract, not11 income.12              I thought the argument you are making here13              MR. JONES: I don't have any objection to what14    you just said. I think it is perfection correct. I think15    it's a proper concern.  But our point is that what you are16    supposed to, what we have to resolve here is what did17    Congress mean when it said items of income in 1366 because18    that's what flows through. Congress said this is not an19    item of income.  And I say this, I mean the discharge of20    the debt of an insolvent. My only point about the21    congruence of 61 and 108 is that they cannot win on those22    provision because all those provision say is what we say:23    It's not income.24              And what the legislative history of the25    provisions say is exactly - is why we are here today                                  421 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9,which is that Congress has always said this isn't income.Has never permitted it to have any tax consequences otherthan attribute reduction. And I go back again to Victorand Loken. I mean, they are a pretty objective neutralsource on this, and they agree with us, that this is notthe way Congress used the term and that after it is usedto reduce attributes, it's to be ignored.  The reason.          QUESTION: Was this some article in a law reviewyou are talking about.101112131415161718192021    issue.2223 24 25          MR. JONES: It's actually in their treatise.          QUESTION: In a treatise?          MR. JONES: Federal Income Taxation. It is apretty reliable guide.          QUESTION: How has the Court of Appeals come outon this issue?          MR. JONES: The Court of Appeals have been sortof all over the map.  If you are talking about the Courtin this case,--           JUSTICE: No, I meant just the Court of Appeals.The Court or Appeals ruled for the government on this          MR. JONES: Yes.          JUSTICE: Have other Court of Appeals ruledagainst the government on this point?          MR. JONES: Yes, The Third Circuit in the Farley                            431 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9case ruled against the United States, saying that theplain language of 108 makes this an item of income. And Idon't understand their reasoning because the plainlanguage of 108 says it is not an item of income.  And theclear history of the statute says it should never betreated as one. And instead it is to be ignored after youreduce basis. I mean after you reduce the tax attributes.          QUESTION: In fact, no Court of Appeals hasagreed with the government on this point, has it? Is thereany Court of Appeals that has agreed with this argument?          MR. JONES: I don't think there is a Court ofAppeals that has gone through these arguments that we havemade the primary focus of our position in this court.          QUESTION: The answer is no.          MR. JONES: They haven't addressed them, Justice          QUESTION: Why didn't the government argue thisin the other courts?          MR. JONES: Again, I believe what we were doingis that we were defending the rationale of the Tax Court.          QUESTION: Which you now disagree with?          MR. JONES: As I explained to Justice Breyer, wethink that the proper way to reach this, to analyze thisis the way Congress did, to start with 108 in 1980.  Andthen to point out that the amendment to (d)(7) in 1984 was4410111213141516    Scalia.171819202122232425 1    consistent with that result and promoted that conclusion. 2    Now, what the Tax Court did was different.  They said, as 3    Justice Breyer points out that all of this should be done 4    at the corporate level and nothing escapes to the 5    shareholders because it's all handled at the corporate 6    level.  I think that's a correct conclusion. 7              But I think one of the reasons it's a correct 8    conclusion is because there is no item of income that can 9    escape to the shareholders and add to their basis and give10    them this double tax benefit wind fall.  And I do want to11    point out that in each of these cases when a basis12    adjustment is allowed there is indeed a windfall there.13              QUESTION: But that can't be controlling.14    There's no reason to simply distort the tax code to avoid15    a wind fall in this particular case.16              MR. JONES: I don't its controlling but it is a17    presumption that Congress doesn't intend to do that.  And18    so when you look at these statutes and you have the clear19    history, and if you have any uncertainty about the20    application of the plain text of those provisions, that21    uncertainty should be resolved to avoid creating -- either22    denying the intention of Congress or creating the windfall23    benefits.24              QUESTION: I'm sorry.  What's the presumption you25    refer to.45 1              MR. JONES: The presumption is what this Court 2    said in Skelly Oil, that tax statutes should not be 3    interpreted to be provide the practical equivalent of a 4    double deduction, which is exactly what they have sought. 5              QUESTION: Could it not end up being a double tax 6    in the other direction? Let's assume an insolvent chapter 7    S corporation that later recovers.  All right.  The 8    taxpayer would never have gotten the increase of his basis 9    that arises from this reduction of indebtedness and10    therefore could not offset against any future gain that he11    gets from the corporation.  Is that fair?12              MR. JONES: I think that what you are pointing13    out is exactly the opposite of how Congress looked this14    situation.  What Congress said was they are getting this15    immediate benefit not having this treated as income in the16    year that the debt is discharged.  And recognize that they17    might benefit from that in future periods if they have18    income from other sources, Congress said I want to reduce19    the tax attributes, the favorable tax attributes, like20    suspended losses --21              QUESTION: Than you, Mr. Jones. Mr. Hallett, you22    have two plus minutes.23              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DARRELL D. HALLETT24                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS25              MR. HALLETT: With respect to Victor and Eustice46 1    Treatise, what it actually says is that COD income of an 2    insolvent debtor is not gross income.  And it's cited in 3    the brief.  Not one of the authorities cited by the 4    government say that it is not realized.  They say it's 5    excluded from gross income.  With respect to -- if the 6    Commissioner were right that because an item is excluded 7    from gross income, then none of the items excluded from 8    gross income, life insurance proceeds, interest on 9    municipal bonds, none of those would increase basis10    because they are not income and could not be an item of11 income.12              This double tax benefit. There is no tax benefit13    at all without a basis increase.  The item just as well14    have been taxable.  If it was taxable, the income would15    flow down to the shareholder.  His basis would go up and16    he'd be able to his loss against the income.  He'd end up17    with zero basis and zero income just the same position18    where the Commissioner urges he should end up here.19              Finally the Tenth Circuit did not develop the20    timing rule on its own.  That rule is word for word what21    was urged upon it by the Justice Department in that case.22    This case has been a constant moving target.  The only23    time the Commissioner argued the no realization was the24    first time this case was decided before then Chief Judge25    Cohen in Tax Court.  She rejected it.  It was never raised47 1    again until it was raised in the petition for certiorari 2    in this brief. 3              I submit, Your Honor, a plea on behalf of tax 4    practitioners in this country. They should be able to read 5    the Code as written.  They shouldn't have to speculate as 6    to whether or not a result that is called for on the plain 7    language of the statute is too good to be true or is a 8    wind fall.  The tax laws are too complicated to have to 9    get into that kind of speculation.10 Thank you.11              QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Hallett. The case is12    submitted.13141516171819202122232425          (Whereupon, at 10:59 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)48
