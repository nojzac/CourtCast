Sandoz.      Mr. Jay.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. WILLIAM M. JAYON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. JAY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      In our judicial system, the trial judgesfind the facts.  Courts of Appeals review thosefact­findings deferentially under Rule 52.  The Federalcourts apply that familiar standard, even whenever theultimate question is one of law, but it rests onsubsidiary fact­finding.      Now, the Federal Circuit says that claimconstruction is different, that there are no facts inclaim construction, but more than a hundred years ofpractice from this Court makes clear that that's notright.  Facts can enter claim construction and they doso when the trial judge does what this Court hasinstructed her to do, to find what a person of skill inthe art already knows as relevant to interpreting thepatent.3￼￼1 JUSTICE GINSBURG:2 this case and tell ­­ tell us what are the facts to3 which the Federal Circuit should have applied clearly4 erroneous rule?5 MR. JAY: Certainly, Justice Ginsburg.6 There are three in our view. The first is that the7 Federal ­­ the Federal Circuit failed to defer to the8 trial court's finding about the presumed meaning of the9 term "average molecular weight" in the ­­ in the10 relevant context.11 The second is that the trial ­­ Federal12 Circuit failed to defer to what the district court13 expressly found resolving an expert dispute was the14 import of Figure 1 and where the peak of the curve in15 Figure 1 appears.16 And the third is how a person of ordinary17 skill in the art would have read a piece of the18 prosecution history.19 So if I may, I'll begin with why the ­­ the20 reference to average molecular weight in the patent and21 the ­­ and the specific reference to size exclusion22 chromatography, the particular technology being used to23 find that, fits the rule that we're asking this Court to24 adopt.25 Before you ­­4Can you bring it down to1 JUSTICE KENNEDY:￼              I ­­ I want you to answer­­ would you say that it's whether a2 that, but would3 skilled artisan4 of the finding?5 MR. JAY:6 knowledge of a skilled artisan. That's right.7 Sometimes ­­ sometimes the finding is just about pure8 science, how an invention works, what ­­ what this Court9 called it in the Winans v. New York and Erie case is10 terms of art or the state of the art. And the way the11 state of the art can enter the analysis is when you're12 using science to construe the patent.13 So, for example, at this temperature the14 invention would work; at that temperature the invention15 would not work. Therefore, you know, the temperature16 must be Celsius and not Fahrenheit, for example.17 When you do that, when you're using science18 and not words or structure as the ­­ as an19 interpretative guide, that rests on fact­finding just as20 much as ­­ as knowing the meaning of terms of art to21 people with skill in the art does.22 Now, the terms of art has a lengthy pedigree23 in this Court's cases, not just in patent cases,24 although it's certainly strong in patent cases as well.25 But in the interpretation of other written instruments,5would make this inference?  Is that partPart of the finding is the1 the ­­ the meaning of terms of art in a community to2 which3 judge4 trial5­­ an interpretative community to which the trialdoes not belong is exactly the kind of thing thatjudges need the input from experts to determine.JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that's not true of of art in statutes, is it?￼6 terms 78 Alito, are not ­­ are nonetheless written to be read by9 the general public. And what ­­ when they have a ­­MR. JAY: Terms of art in statutes, Justice10 when they have a legal meaning, the determination of11 that legal meaning is still12 JUSTICE ALITO:13 technical, and I doubt that14 has any understanding of some very technical terms that15 appear in statutes. So would they not be read in light16 of what someone who is knowledgeable in that field would17 understand the ­­ the term to mean?18 MR. JAY: I think it's very rare for19 Congress to adopt statutes that have terms ­­ that have20 terms that are meant to be read by a specialized21 audience ­­22 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I'll give you an23 example. The Dodd­Frank Act refers to Tier 1 Capital.24 Do you think that the average person on the street has25 any idea what Tier 1 capital is?6a question of law.Well, some of them are verythe ­­ the general public￼1 MR. JAY: I ­­ I expect that it has an2 established meaning, but ­­ although I certainly don't3 know for sure.4 JUSTICE ALITO: Among the general public or5 among people who are knowledgeable in that particular6 area?7 MR. JAY: I think when you're interpreting a8 statute that it's generally clear at least what the9 right frame of reference is. Now, in the ­­ in the10 patent case, what the frame of reference is is itself a11 question of fact, as this Court said in Graham v. John12 Deere. Ascertaining the level of skill in the art, who13 is the skilled artisan, who is this patent written for,14 that is itself a factual question, and then figuring out15 what that ­­ what that person knows is also a factual16 question. You know, that's terms of art or the state of17 the art.18 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Jay, could you tell19 me what you see as the difference between your position20 and the government's?21 MR. JAY: I think that the government agrees22 with us that the answer to the question presented is23 that Rule 52(a) applies and24 should apply to findings of25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:7that clear error reviewfact.  I think ­­    To some, because they￼1 differentiate others.2 MR. JAY: I think that ­­ I think that our3 test is largely the same as well, but we disagree on how4 the test comes out on these facts. We submit that the5 three fact­findings that I mentioned to Justice Ginsburg6 at the beginning of the argument are ­­ they are factual7 findings. The government agrees that some but not all,8 and they ­­ we agree on the ultimate disposition that9 the Federal Circuit's judgment can't stand.10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If you and the11 government can't agree, why should we defer to a12 district court? Why don't we defer, as has been done13 now forever, to the Federal Circuit and let them review14 these things de novo?15 MR. JAY: Respectfully, Justice Sotomayor,16 what's been done forever is deferring to district courts17 on matters of subsidiary findings. And I think it's18 significant that in the first patent case that came to19 this Court from the Federal Circuit, the new Federal20 Circuit, Dennison, what this Court did was direct the21 Federal Circuit to apply deference to subsidiary22 fact­finding in the context of obviousness. And this23 Court has ­­24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What we did ­­ in25 Martin, we ­­ we talked about claim construction being8￼1 the odd hybrid.2 MR. JAY: It is an odd hybrid ­­ well, it is3 a hybrid. I don't know that it's odd, Justice4 Sotomayor. I think that it actually fits of a piece5 with other mixed questions of law and fact. And the6 universal practice for mixed questions of law and fact7 is that when they rest on subsidiary fact­finding, you8 review the fact­finding part deferentially, even when9 the leap from the fact­finding to the ultimate legal10 conclusion is a short one.11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In the Markman context,12 the trial judge says to the jury: Now, the construction13 of the claim is for the court, and the court's14 construction of the claim is X, Y, Z. Could that15 determination by the district judge, which is for the16 trial judge, involve some subsidiary questions of fact17 as to which he must be given deference?18 MR. JAY: Sir, I may have missed the ­­19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a jury case like20 Markman and Markman says the construction of the claim21 is for the court, and the court tells the jury: This22 claim is to be construed as follows, A, B, C, D. Does23 that determination, that interpretation by the district24 court ­­ would that error contain factual determinations25 as to which deference must be given to the trial judge?9￼1 MR. JAY: A claim construction can contain2 factual determinations. It might not. In many cases it3 will not, because the ultimate question is a question of4 law and when it rests just on looking at the words in5 the patent and applying the canons of claim6 construction, it remains a pure question of law.7 When ­­ when facts enter the analysis, those facts8 decided by the trial judge in the context of findings9 are reviewed deferentially.10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, is ­­ is it the same11 question whether a particular fact has to be submitted12 to the jury? And whether a particular fact­finding by13 the judge is entitled to deference or are they ­­ are14 they the same question?15 MR. JAY:16 Justice Scalia.17 JUSTICE SCALIA:18 MR. JAY:19 question for claim construction in Markman, but ­­ and20 there were no subsidiary fact­findings of the type that21 we've been talking about in Markman, because22 Mr. Markman's expert was an expert in document23 construction. That ­­ that's not the kind of rule that24 we're advocating here. We're advocating for deference25 to classic fact­finding.10They are not the same question,       I didn't think they were.This Court resolved the judge/jury￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You ­­ you've2 referred several times to subsidiary facts. You know,3 the difference between questions of law and fact has not4 always been an easy one for the Court to draw. What do5 you mean by a subsidiary fact?6 MR. JAY: I simply mean, Justice ­­7 Mr. Chief Justice, that the ultimate question this Court8 said in Markman is a question of law, but it often rests9 on factual findings, knowledge of the ­­ excuse me ­­ of10 the state of the art and of how the art works. And11 that's ­­ that's just as true in other mixed question12 cases.13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what's your14 definition of subsidiary fact?15 MR. JAY: A subsidiary fact is a fact that16 is not the ultimate question the court is looking at,17 but one that is an ingredient in that ­­ in that18 judgment. So in the context of claim construction, what19 often happens is the beginning of the analysis is: What20 is the meaning of this specialized term to people in the21 art? That may not be controlling because the22 interpretation of the patent may show, as a legal23 matter, that that can't be the right meaning because the24 text of the patent itself, under ­­ applying the canons25 of claim construction, for example, or simply applying11￼1 the patentee's own definition, rule out the ordinary2 meaning to skilled artisans, making that finding3 irrelevant. Then it wouldn't be a subsidiary finding of4 the ultimate claim construction at all.5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then maybe the evidence6 shouldn't have come in.7 MR. JAY: I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg.8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The evidence should not9 have come in.10 MR. JAY: Well, Justice Ginsburg, the court11 may not anticipate at the time what the ­­ what the12 ultimate outcome is going to be. At the time, the court13 must make a judgment about which experts to allow. But14 I think that's an important point, that the judge15 retains gatekeeping authority, and ultimately the judge16 will decide how many terms she will allow the parties to17 dispute and which ­­ what evidence to take and in what18 form to take it. So ­­19 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If these are ­­ these are20 truly fact questions, then what happened to the Seventh21 Amendment?22 MR. JAY: I think, Justice Ginsburg, that ­­23 first of all, this is not a jury case. But, of course,24 I'll answer the question for patent cases more broadly,25 in which some are jury cases. These are subsidiary12￼1 fact­findings that go to a threshold question for the2 court and in that respect they're no different than the3 fact­findings that go into other pretrial judgments that4 are not for the jury.5 Rule 52 has been applied to judicial6 fact­finding in any number of jury cases, pretrial and7 post­trial matters that don't ­­ that don't go to the8 jury. And this Court decided in Markman that the9 ultimate question of claim construction is one of law10 and thus not for the jury.11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the government's12 brief said ­­ and I think you agree with this, but13 you'll tell me ­­ that inferences to be drawn from14 fact­findings get de novo review. And my understanding15 is that in a typical civil case, a jury finds the facts16 and can draw inferences from the facts, but here ­­17 well, first do you agree with the government that18 inferences from ­­ from the facts get de novo review?19 MR. JAY: No. I don't think I can agree20 with that, Justice Ginsburg, because that's not what21 Rule 52 says. And we may be conflating jury cases ­­ in22 our colloquy here, we may be conflating jury cases and23 judicial fact­findings because ­­ you know, the scope of24 Rule 52 is set out in the rule itself and in the ­­ the25 Advisory Committee Notes in 1937 and this Court's138 JUSTICE ALITO:Isn't your ­­Mr. Jay ­­Go ahead.­­ I ­­ I just want to make￼1 decision in Anderson all talk ­­ and Pullman Swint as2 well ­­ all talk about the inferences to be drawn as3 being part of the trial judge's role, because the trial4 judge has heard the entire factual record. The trial5 judge is in the best position to draw the inferences6 from the record as ­­ as well as to resolve direct7 head­to­head conflicts in the evidence.9 JUSTICE KAGAN:10 JUSTICE ALITO:11 JUSTICE KAGAN:12 sure I understand your answer to what the gap is between13 a certain kind of fact and then the ultimate question of14 law. So when an expert gets on the stand and gives15 testimony about what a person in the field, a skilled16 artisan in the field, would understand to be the meaning17 of a particular patent term, and you are saying that18 that's a ­­ that's factual and that the decision whether19 to credit that or not is a factual determination. But20 how is that different from the ultimate legal question21 that the Court has to answer, which is kind of the same22 thing, it's how a person ­­ a skilled artisan in the23 field, what ­­ what that person would understand a24 patent to mean.25 MR. JAY: Well, the difference is that the14￼1 instances, and they will be frequent, where it's not2 kind of the same thing. Let me ­­ let me spell that3 out. The first part of your question is, is what the4 expert says factual, the meaning to skilled artisans.5 And it absolutely is, just as it is in this Court's6 contract and tariff cases where the Court specifically7 says that the meaning of a term to people in a8 particular field, to which the judge doesn't belong,9 that's a fact question, and ­­ so as to whether there is10 a specialized meaning.11 But where there is no specialized meaning or12 any specialized meaning is irrelevant because the patent13 itself, through the process of document construction,14 tells you what the answer is ­­ so, for example, here's15 the ordinary meaning of this term, but that won't work16 in the context of this patent because it would run up17 against the canon of claim differentiation. That won't18 in this patent because it would make the invention not19 work. That wouldn't work in this patent because then20 the preferred embodiment in the ­­ in the specification21 wouldn't ­­ wouldn't be encompassed.22 JUSTICE KAGAN: So what you're saying is23 that in certain cases the factual finding truly is the24 legal determination, but that in other cases, other25 matters can come in to drive a wedge between the two.15￼1 MR. JAY: Correct. And I think that this is2 a case where the out ­­ the facts come very close to3 pointing to the correct outcome because ­­4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Two ­­ two cases, and this5 is part of Justice Kagan's question, I think. Case one:6 District judge says a reasonable police officer would7 think this is probable cause. Case two: A person8 skilled in the art would think that this was an average9 molecular weight. Do the courts give the same deference10 or lack of deference in each case.11 MR. JAY: I think, as I understand your12 question, Justice Kennedy, in each question the person13 on the stand is actually opining about the ultimate14 question. But if ­­ if I may, in each case ­­ for15 example, if the ­­ if the question is did the police16 officer see the gun, that ­­ that may rest on a17 credibility finding about whether the police officer is18 telling the truth or lying. The resolution of that19 question may be absolutely dispositive of whether there20 was probable cause or not, on and off. One way there's21 probable cause; the other there isn't. But it's still22 an underlying factual finding as the Court said in ­­23 JUSTICE SCALIA: But to say ­­ to say ­­ I24 don't ­­ I don't agree with your response to Justice25 Kagan. To say that the ­­ that the fact­finding will be16￼1 dispositive of the legal question is not to say that it2 is the same as the legal question, which is what I think3 you responded. I don't think it's the same as the legal4 question. The legal question is are you liable for5 violating this patent. And indeed, it ­­ it may be6 that ­­ that given a particular meaning that is7 established by a factual finding, the outcome is ­­ is8 virtually dictated, but it is not the same. It is not9 the same question.10 MR. JAY: I do agree that it's not the same.11 It's not even ­­ it's not even the same as the ultimate12 question of claim construction. But the ­­ the step13 from the factual finding to the claim construction may14 rest on something as simple as this: There is nothing15 else in this patent to get me, the judge, off of the16 ordinary meaning of this term to people with skill in17 the art.18 JUSTICE KAGAN: But how would you define the19 standard? I mean, it's absolutely true what Justice20 Scalia says, that at a certain level of generality there21 is a gap. But I thought that in order to determine22 liability, what the court has to inquire into is how a23 person with ordinary skill in the relevant art at the24 time of the invention would understand the claim. And25 that seems like exactly the question that the expert is17￼1 testifying to.2 MR. JAY:3 how the person4 patent writ at5 ultimate question for the Court. What the expert is ­­6 can testify to and what Dr. Grant testified to in this7 case is how particular terms in the patent have a8 recognized meaning with ­­ within the art. The art is9 not going to take a position on how the doctrine of10 claim differentiation applies, for example, but the11 skilled artisan can testify about what the established12 meaning of the particular term is.13 JUSTICE BREYER: So let me try this and if14 you don't agree with it, just say no and I'll stop.15 Okay?16 MR. JAY: Okay.17 JUSTICE BREYER:18 distinction is pretty much what I think Justice Scalia19 was driving at, that there are a certain number of20 factual questions where the question is of the kind,21 does this label belong on this thing, this thing being22 not in dispute. It might be a South African yellow23 canary up there. The statute might use the word "South24 African yellow canary." But we are not certain whether25 that is a South African yellow canary.18       The expert is not testifying toof ordinary skill would understand thelarge.  And the patent ­­ that is theI thought the classical1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      If we call in a bird expert who looks at itand says it is, that is a question of fact.  If we callin a lawyer to say how are these words being used in thestatute and does that fit within it, then it is aquestion of law.MR. JAY: I think that that's basically right, Justice Breyer. Though in this case, we have an expert who came in to testify about why these terms have a particular meaning.JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. But we also have the Federal Circuit in the two cases where you disagree with the government accepting the fact that, in fact, the experts or the lawyer who talked to the patent guy did use the wrong words. They accept that. And then what they say is, well, in their view it is that that didn't￼really concernthat the judgein the patent.legal question.  Have I got that right basically, whatthe argument is?MR. JAY: That's more or less what they've said.         the Federal Circuit, but for the weight         gave when trying to interpret the termsWell ­­JUSTICE BREYER: And that at least is aMR. JAY:JUSTICE BREYER:And what do you say in19￼1 response?2 MR. JAY: I ­­ I say two important things in3 response. One is that in predicting what the Federal4 Circuit would do under the correct standard, I don't5 think you can disaggregate the pieces of its incorrect6 analysis because it rested on the ­­ on the view that7 everything went in favor of Respondents and nothing went8 in favor of Petitioners here.9 But the second thing ­­ this is also very10 important ­­ on the ­­ you alluded, Justice Breyer, to11 the prosecution history piece, but that skips over the12 very important piece, what the specification, the use of13 size exclusion chromatography as the technique in the14 specification teaches. And as the district court found,15 page 43a­44a of the petition appendix, the presumed16 meaning of that term "average molecular weight" when you17 ­­ when you're using this technology is peak average18 molecular weight. And the ­­ there are other19 technologies such as osmometry and light scattering that20 give rise to a different presumed meaning of what21 average molecular weight is, because they produce22 different measurements. But the only kind of peak23 average that you can read from the chromatogram is peak24 average molecular weight.25 And the Federal Circuit went right by the20￼1 finding that the presumed meaning would be peak average2 molecular weight and gave ­­ essentially treated the3 three possibilities, peak, number and weight average, as4 though they were equal. But that's not what the5 district court found in the context of this technology.6 JUSTICE ALITO: In a recent law review7 article written by two authors, one of whom is a ­­ is8 the deputy solicitor in the Patent and Trademark Office,9 the office ­­ the authors said that they surveyed a very10 large number of cases to try to find any in which the11 difference between de novo review and clear error review12 of factual questions by the Federal Circuit made a13 difference in the outcome and they couldn't find any14 case in which this fascinating legal debate had a15 practical significance.16 Now, you want to introduce a level of17 complication to this. The Federal Circuit says de novo18 for everything, and you want the court ­­ you want the19 Federal Circuit now to struggle to determine which are20 factual questions as to which there's clear error21 review, which ones get de novo review, whether it's the22 ultimate question. Is it worthwhile as a practical23 matter?24 MR. JAY: It is, Justice Alito. I'd like ­­25 like to respond to your question and then, if I may, to21￼1 reserve my time for rebuttal unless you have follow­up.2 First of all, does it matter? It does3 matter. It matters in cases like this, and I don't know4 whether the study that Your Honor referred to would pick5 up this case because that's ­­ that's precisely the6 problem. If you read the Federal Circuit's opinion in7 this case, you ­­ it makes no reference to the8 fact­findings as fact­findings and you would not9 understand, for example, the finding that I was just10 alluding to about presumed meaning because it's not11 referred to anywhere.12 There are a host of cases like that. There13 have been for years. And more systematically, as14 Professor Menell points out in his amicus brief, I think15 pages 17 to 18, the de novo standard produces the16 problem that encourages the Federal Circuit to blow17 right by the skilled artisan's perspective. It doesn't18 talk about it; it doesn't talk about the evidence that19 supports it. So that's one point.20 Another point is about whether the Federal21 Circuit could handle this. This is the ­­ this is the22 standard, disaggregating subsidiary factual questions23 from ultimate legal questions, that courts of appeals24 apply all the time and that the regional courts of25 appeals did in fact apply before the Federal Circuit221 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425came along.  The best example of that is the Harriescase we've cited in our brief written by Judge Hand.      So to apply that standard practice we thinkwould not be unduly disruptive to the Federal Circuit,and it would not insulate every single claimconstruction from review.  It simply would make the ­­have facts treated as facts.      If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance ofmy time.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Jay. Ms. Anders.ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS      ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,         AS AMICUS CURIAEMS. ANDERS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      Just to start with the distinction betweenfactual findings and legal inferences here, we thinkthat factual findings are those that are based, at leastin part, on evidence that is outside the patent and itsprosecution history and that concern matters that aredistinct from the patent itself.  So those could befactual findings about what kind of data a particularscientific technique produces or how the inventions,prior inventions in the field worked.  Those are factual23￼￼1 findings.2 We then think that when the district court3 takes those findings and now it can understand the ­­4 the concepts that are described in the patent because5 it's made those findings, when the district court takes6 those findings and then looks at the patent and asks how7 would a person of skill in the art interpret the words8 in this patent in light of all the pieces of the patent9 document and the canons of claim construction, those10 inferences that it draws are legal ones.11 So I think to take ­­ to take the size12 exclusion chromatography as an example of this because13 it's probably easier to discuss it concretely, I think14 what happened there was that the district court made a15 factual finding that when SEC is used the type of data16 that ­­ that just is spit out is ­­ produces peak17 molecular weight, and if you wanted to produce any other18 measure of molecular weight you would need to do more19 calculations. That's the factual finding that the20 district court made.21 It then took a look at the patent document22 and said, in light of that, what inference can I draw23 from the specifications referenced to SEC, and the legal24 inference that it drew was that probably the patent25 meant to refer to peak molecular weight when it used the24￼1   term "molecular weight."  And I think the court of2   appeals understood the factual finding in the same way3   that the district court did.  I think it accepted that4   when you use SEC, the data that comes out is MP and you5   would need further calculations to produce other types6   of data.  But what the ­­7 8 91011   told us that the peak, and that that's a fact­finding.  But12   you don't accept the other two things that Mr. Jay13   characterized as fact­findings.  Can you tell us whyJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why do you reject what Mr. Jay tells us were also fact­findings?MS. ANDERS: I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg?JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think you have just14151617181920212223   calculations to do other things.  The district court24   then made a legal inference where it said because ­­25   because the specification uses SEC, we know that ­­ that25not?MS. ANDERS: Well, to take SEC first, Ithink what ­­ I think we agree ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: To take what first?MS. ANDERS: SEC, which is the use of sizeexclusion chromatography in the specification.      I think we agree that it's a fact­finding tosay that ­­ that if you use SEC, then peak molecularweight is produced and that you'd need further￼1 the patent, in the context of the patents­in­suit ­­ and2 this is a quote from the district court's opinion: "In3 the context of the patents­in­suit, the meaning of4 'average molecular weight' must be peak molecular5 weight."6 That's a legal inference because it's ­­7 it's taking one part of the document and using it to8 interpret another part of the document. The Court in9 Markman said that that is classic textual analysis, when10 you look at the patent and you say, this part of the11 specification tells me something about the claims.12 So we think with respect to SEC what the13 Federal Circuit did was it disagreed with the legal14 inference that the ­­ that the district court made.15 JUSTICE KAGAN: But suppose an expert just16 says, in my field skilled artisans think that molecular17 weight means the following. Is that a ­­ and then the18 district court accepts that finding. Is that a factual19 determination in your view? Because I think Mr. Jay20 would say it is.21 MS. ANDERS: I think ­­ well, first of all,22 that's not what the district ­­ what the expert23 testified to here and what the district court found, so24 I think we disagree about what the district court25 actually said in its opinion.26￼1 But if that were what the expert testified2 to, then I think that would be a statement of fact, that3 in ­­ in the world we understand generally that SEC4 means MP. I think that would be a finding of fact.5 But I would make two points about that. The6 first is that there is then a significant legal analysis7 that the district court has to do to figure out how to8 construe the patent, and I think that's particularly9 clear in the context of indefiniteness, which is what10 this case is about, that even if the district court has11 some evidence that generally artisans might understand a12 term in a particular way, the court then has to look at13 the claims themselves, the terms that ­­ that surround14 the term we're trying to construe, the specification,15 the embodiments in the specification, the prosecution16 history. It has to look at all of that and decide,17 given all of that, would a person of skill in the art be18 reasonably certain about how to construe this patent.19 So that is a legal inquiry that the court20 would have to do after receiving the fact­finding.21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under your view, two22 different district courts construing the same patent23 could come out to opposite results based on a subsidiary24 factual finding, and neither of those would be clearly25 erroneous, and yet on a public patent that is going to27￼1 bind a lot of other people, people won't know what to2 do. You have two different interpretations of the3 patent. What happens then?4 MS. ANDERS: Well, I think that concern is5 overstated for ­­ for two ­­ two reasons. I think the6 first is that it's ­­ it's pretty unlikely that that7 scenario is going to occur, and the second is that, even8 in the rare circumstances in which it did, there are9 reasons to think that that's not actually a ­­ a problem10 from a policy standpoint.11 So ­­ so just to elaborate on that, I think12 because ­­ because this inquiry needs to remain13 primarily legal, because even after the court makes14 fact­findings, it needs to engage in a contextual15 analysis of the patent as a whole in light of the canons16 of claim construction, we think that the legal questions17 are generally going to predominate in the ­­18 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's just19 kind of avoiding the question. I mean, you can easily20 envision this case coming up differently in the district21 court depending upon what district courts find as the,22 you know, accepted understanding to artisans.23 And again, each of those opposite results,24 neither one may be clearly erroneous.25 MS. ANDERS: Well, I think another point is2820 could 2122 right 2324 do ­­ 25reach different factual conclusions.MS. ANDERS: I think that is exactlyand I think ­­JUSTICE BREYER:CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:29All right.  So what do we       No.  It's because￼1 that district courts I think have a way, have ample2 tools to try to avoid that scenario from occurring.3 They can, when there are seriatim cases, there can be4 pre­trial coordination in the same district so that ­­5 so that the situation doesn't arise. Of course,6 preclusion will ­­ will prevent a patentee from having7 an issue of claim construction decided against it and8 then coming back and trying to relitigate the issue.9 JUSTICE BREYER: What do we do when there's10 a bus accident on a technical thing and different people11 who were injured sue in different places at different12 times? Same problem, isn't it?13 MS. ANDERS: I'm ­­14 JUSTICE BREYER: Same problem. I mean, you15 can think of a thousand cases like that where ­­ where16 you have a big bus accident, technical problem with the17 motor, different place ­­ people from different places18 who are victims and they sue in different places at19 different times. Juries or tried to the bench, they￼1 you have a patent which is a public document that is2 binding the world in terms of what other inventors can3 do and another inventor looking at it can say, well,4 what can I do?5 JUSTICE BREYER: Right.6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:7 That is very different than just a particular negligence8 case that comes up.9 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, I was actually10 curious what we did, because I can think of examples in11 antitrust, I can think of examples in corporate law, I12 can think of examples versus every area of the law,13 where often it does happen, as the Chief Justice says,14 it could ­­ the different factual things have enormous15 public implications.16 What I was interested in and asked because I17 wanted to know, what are the legal devices for dealing18 with that?19 MS. ANDERS: Well, I would make two points.20 I think that, first, because of the way preclusion21 works, it only runs against the patentee. All right.22 So if the patentee loses on an issue of claim23 construction or indefiniteness, he cannot then24 relitigate that issue, but other ­­ other accused25 infringers can relitigate it and try to build a better30He doesn't know.￼1 record.2 We actually think that that ­­ that keeps3 this from being a policy problem, the possibility that4 you could have a subsequent decision that reaches a5 different conclusion.6 JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess a deed is a private7 document that's ­­ has public effect, right? It8 prevents certain people from trespassing on the property9 that is conveyed, and I suppose that could be construed10 in the various courts that reach different results. So11 the mere fact that ­­ that this binds the public is ­­12 is not conclusive.13 MS. ANDERS: I think that’s right. And of14 course in the patent system now, there's a ­­ there's15 toleration of a certain amount of disuniformity and I16 think that’s because we generally think that there are17 other values that ­­ that supersede that uniformity.18 So, for instance, you could have, in the case of19 infringement, you can have two different accusers in20 different suits; one makes a better record than the21 other, and the patent could be held to infringe one22 product but not infringe another materially similar23 product.24 JUSTICE ALITO: And you say that factual25 findings that are subject to clear error review must be,31￼1 quote, "in some sense distinct from the meaning or2 validity of the patent." I don't understand what that3 means when the issue is the meaning or validity of the4 patent. If the evidence is ­­ is relevant, then it5 is ­­ there is a connection. So what does that mean, in6 some sense distinct?7 MS. ANDERS: Well, it means that the8 district court is making a finding based on ­­ based on9 science, based on expertise, somebody's ­­ somebody's10 expertise in the field and making a finding about a11 matter that isn't just what does this term mean in the12 patent. It's making a more broad finding.13 So for instance, what does this type of14 scientific process, what type of data does it produce?15 You can say that's related to the patent because of16 course the patent uses SEC and one question is what kind17 of data does it produce. But it is also a finding of18 fact to say, as a general matter, the way science works19 is that SEC produces MP without further calculation.20 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that sounds like every21 factual finding. It sounds like you're saying that22 anything that is a factual issue is subject to clear23 error review. But I thought you were saying something24 less than that.25 MS. ANDERS: Well, I think that’s a factual321 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425finding, but then what the district court has to do istake that information which allows it to assume the ­­the perspective of a skilled artisan and then decidewhat it tells it about the patent itself.  And that's aquestion of looking at ­­ at the document itself.  Sothe fact that the patent uses SEC, does that raise aninference about what the term "molecular weight" in thepatent means or not.  That's a question of textualanalysis.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. Anders.      Mr. Phillips.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPSON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTSMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:      It seems to me that the two questions thatwere asked in the opening portions to my colleagues andfriends ­­ one came from Justice Alito, one came fromyou, Mr. Chief Justice ­­ are matters that this Courtalready has effectively decided in the Markman case andare the reason why de novo review is appropriate underthese circumstances.      In effect, Justice Alito asked the questionis all of this worth the candle, because the debate33￼￼1 between the government and the Petitioner in this case2 and the difficulty of trying to decide which facts do3 you defer to and which ones don't you defer to and when4 is it a credibility determination, when is it not. This5 Court said unanimously more than 15 years ago in Markman6 that all of those kinds of issues get subsumed within7 the fundamental question of how best to interpret the8 patent, and that that's the ultimate question and that's9 a legal question, and therefore, all of the disputes,10 factual in nature or however you want to describe them,11 get subsumed within that. It seems to me the final ­­12 the ultimate conclusion from that then is whatever13 determination is made is ultimately subject to de novo14 review.15 JUSTICE BREYER: I think that Markman just16 dealt with judge/jury, not which court gets the fact up17 ­­ decides the facts basically, which is where I do18 start. So if you want to ­­ but if I take that as a19 given, then I'd say why should you treat fact matters20 here any different than any other case. The main reason21 for letting the district judge, I've always thought,22 decide facts as an initial matter in a technical case is23 because there are all kinds of facts, you know. We24 happen to have some particularly odd definitional ones25 here, but there are all kinds of facts. In technical34￼1 cases, there are all kinds of facts. And the2 traditional reason is you've seen the witnesses ­­ but3 there is one thing he's done that the ­­ that the court4 of appeals has not done, and in a technical case, it5 seems to me that makes an enormous difference. He sat6 there the whole time and listened to these experts talk.7 MR. PHILLIPS: Actually, that's not true.8 JUSTICE BREYER: And that, I think, is a9 very powerful reason for saying in a technical case,10 don't overturn the judge's factual findings whether they11 are ­­ particularly scientific matters, but no12 particularly here ­­ unless those three judges who will13 not even read the whole record normally and certainly14 won't hear those witnesses, don't let them do it unless15 they are convinced that it is clearly erroneous.16 Now, that's the argument, and I would like17 to say that's different from a statute.18 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. But it's not ­­19 JUSTICE BREYER: Whether or not it is20 different from the ­­ it's different from ­­ it's the21 same as any technical case. Now, why is this different?22 MR. PHILLIPS: I think, Judge, that's the23 question the Chief Justice asked, which isn't it24 possible and isn't it likely when we gave you the25 example of seven district courts interpreting three ­­35￼1 JUSTICE BREYER:2 thing, as we know, could happen in dozens of ­­ of3 technical cases.4 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. But ­­5 JUSTICE BREYER: And you go on importance, I6 could make up some important hypotheticals. You want7 trivial ones, I'll make up some of those. You want to put8 a definition on a thing, fine. You know, we can all9 both ­­ and you're probably better than I am at it. And10 you say is that the only answer that patents are somehow11 different?12 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. Patent claim13 construction is different. I think that's exactly what14 this Court said in Markman ­­15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we go ­­ can we go16 back to the question? If it's technical, it's all right17 for the judge to find the fact. I thought in our18 Seventh Amendment cases we have rejected the notion that19 if an issue is difficult, technical, the judge can20 decide it even though it's a fact.21 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. No. There are lots22 of ­­ there are lots of technical issues that juries are23 allowed to decide. What the ­­ what the Court24 recognized in Markman was that the nature of the inquiry25 under claim construction ­­ and it's important to just36But I mean, that same￼1 step back for a second and put it in context.2 Claim construction is based, first, on the3 plain language of the claims. Regardless of whether4 they are written for scientists or not, you're supposed5 to start with the plain and ordinary meaning of the6 claim language itself. And then as construed through7 the specifications, which are, again, designed to8 provide a reasonably clear exegesis of what the patent9 and the invention is, what the claims mean. And then10 you have the prosecution history, which can, in some11 instances, be complicated.12 But in this particular instance where the13 very specific word in this patent was inquired about by14 two patent examiners, experts in the subject matter, and15 asked what does average molecular weight ­­ excuse me ­­16 mean in this context, they got the answer peak asked in17 the exact same context they got the answer weight. And18 what is ­­ I mean, the notion in that circumstance that19 this is not indefinite under the ­­ in this situation20 seems to me completely indefensible.21 JUSTICE KAGAN:22 MR. PHILLIPS:23 JUSTICE KAGAN:24 MR. PHILLIPS:25 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Phillips ­­ And that ­­  I'm sorry. No, go ahead.  Is your argument that there37￼1 are no subordinate factual determinations in these kinds2 of cases or as you opened by saying, as your argument,3 sure, there are factual determinations; we can come up4 with a zillion of them, but it's not worth the candle to5 figure out which is which.6 MR. PHILLIPS: It's not ­­ it's not worth7 the candle because all you're going to do is create a8 cottage industry of trial lawyers fighting with the9 judge about which bucket some particular evidence fits10 into and whether you can ­­ whether it's ­­11 JUSTICE BREYER:12 not difficult to distinguish13 Sometimes it is. But in the14 I think are vast, did that dial read 7? I have 415 witnesses who said it did, and I have 3 witnesses who16 said it read 5. And now let's complicate that, but it17 all has to do with what happened in a laboratory at a18 particular time. Are we going to have the 3 people from19 the Federal Circuit going in and second­guessing the20 judge without giving him any weight on that kind of21 factual question, which I suspect, I have no reason to22 believe it won't, will turn up comparatively just as23 often?24 MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Breyer, I think25 that ­­ I mean, I don't want to go to war with your ­­ I38But normally, normally isthe one from the other.cases where it isn't, which￼1 don't want to go to war with your hypothetical.2 JUSTICE BREYER: I want the answer. I want3 the answer.4 MR. PHILLIPS: The problem with the5 hypothetical is that it assumes that there ­­ that there6 will be instances in which the question of pure science7 is a matter about which there is disagreement. And8 that ­­9 JUSTICE BREYER: What happened in ­­10 MR. PHILLIPS: And it's very, very uncommon11 and that's why it's not worth ­­ this Court ­­ this12 Court said it specifically in Markman. It said, "Our13 experience in interpreting documents teaches us that14 they will rarely, if ever, be resolved."15 And the evidence we have from the patent16 office is never resolved on the basis of differences of17 opinion by an expert under ­­ under these circumstances.18 So as I was saying before, what are you doing? You're19 creating a cottage industry ­­20 JUSTICE KAGAN: But Mr. Phillips, if that's21 your argument, I mean, then you'd just have to deal with22 Rule 52(a) because Rule 52(a) sets out the very blanket23 rule. It doesn't say except where it's not worth the24 candle. It just says what it says, that these are25 matters for the trial court.39￼1 MR. PHILLIPS: But if ­­ but if, as this2 Court said in Markman, treating interpretative issues as3 purely legal and the reason for doing that is to avoid4 the problem the Chief Justice identified, which is that5 otherwise, you're going to end up with a single document6 that is binding on the rest of the world having7 inconsistent meanings and, therefore, it is different.8 It is different from every other issue in patent law,9 and I think it's different from every other issue of10 litigation. It is a ­­11 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Explain why it's12 different from obviousness because the other side said,13 well, why shouldn't the fact law division for claim14 construction be the same as it is for obviousness.15 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. And the reason is, is16 that obviousness carries with it a whole slew of17 additional factual questions that ultimately will18 predominate whereas ­­ and also begins with the19 proposition this is what the claim means. All right.20 So you start with that as a given, which is a pure21 question of law.22 The obviousness issue at that point can turn23 on the success of the ­­ of the product, can turn on how24 the market responded to it. Those are lots and lots of25 pure factual issues that this Court had already40￼1 recognized in John Deere ­­ Graham v. John Deere, and2 said, you know, there's no reason to have pure question3 of law even if at the end of the day there is a question4 of law.5 What I took Markman to mean ­­ I'm going to6 go back to that same language ­­ treating interpretative7 issues as purely legal is that there are ­­ is that8 it's ­­ it is, it's literally not worth the candle, that9 the right way to analyze it. The only way effectively10 to provide notice to the world is to have one court11 that's expert make the final judgment. That's the other12 part of the analysis, it seems to me at least, worth a13 little bit of comment, which is which is the better body14 for making this decision?15 You say, Justice Breyer, you like the16 district court because the district court, 1, may have17 the opportunity to ­­ to listen to the witnesses,18 although in this case, claim construction was done19 strictly on the papers. There were no witnesses who20 testified.21 But number 2, if you go back to what the22 ultimate inquiry is, which is what does the term mean in23 the context of the patent, which is what Markman says,24 so it's got to be against the claim language, the25 specification and the prosecution history, what ­­ what41￼1 are we ­­ what is the undertaking there, under those2 circumstances, treating it ­­ giving that kind of a3 decision­making process, which is something Federal4 Circuit does every day.5 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, it isn't that I6 like it better. It is that Rule 52(a) says that7 fact­finding of the district court should be overturned8 only for clear error. And once I start down this road,9 well, that's true on some facts and not other facts,10 and ­­ and I get into this. See, I'm not an expert. I11 don't see where the stopping place is. I don't see how12 to manage the system and I am moved by the fact that the13 lawyers here are pretty much ­­ who know patent law are14 pretty much in favor of district courts as far as amici15 are concerned. They're pretty much in favor of district16 courts making the fact­finding. So ­­ so I don't see17 where to go to start drawing the lines you want to draw.18 MR. PHILLIPS:19 agree with your assessment20 world is with the district21 the patent context. My experience is ­­22 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know. Rule 52(a)23 and that's the ­­ what do I do about that?24 MR. PHILLIPS: And it seems to me Markman25 answered 52(a). Markman says it's a pure question of42I'm ­­ I'm not sure I ­­ Iabout how comfortable thecourts making fact­finding in￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425law and it should all be treated as a pure question oflaw in order to guarantee uniformity and to provideadequate notice to the world.JUSTICE ALITO: So if a patent is ­­JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I clarify a point that you made in response a little earlier? You said that this was not a hearing. It is a hearing, but is it always on papers?MR. PHILLIPS: Doesn't have to be.

PHILLIPS: Yes. I mean, I think that's the right answer. And the reason for it is, is that,43Well, Markman hearings25 JUSTICE SCALIA:Even if it's going to be￼1 again, you've got to put it in context. And if you use2 the government's theory, it's particularly striking3 which is if it's a dispute about a scientific principle4 apart from the patent, they're virtually ­­ that doesn't5 happen. I mean, you can read the first 25 pages of6 Grant's declaration. There is no disagreement between7 anything he said and anything that our experts said on8 any of those general principles of law.9 It is only when you get to the10 interpretation in the context of the patent, which is11 language he uses repeatedly, and then tries to ­­ tries12 to take his interpretation, his reading of the patent,13 elevate it to a finding of fact and giving deference to14 the decision­making of the district court.15 JUSTICE SCALIA: So what do you want the16 district court to do? Do you want the district court,17 nonetheless, even though what it finds is not going to18 be given any deference, do you want them to listen to19 witnesses?20 MR. PHILLIPS: Of course.21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or to take at least written22 testimony where there's what you say is a rare23 scientific question comes up?24 MR.

PHILLIPS: Well, no, I think it's perfectly sensible to take the testimony.JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? Why?MR. PHILLIPS: Because it helps inform even the district judge's understanding of what the patent is about in order to be able to apply the claim language, the specification, and the prosecution45Well, I mean, actually, the￼1 history.2 Remember, at the end, all you're talking3 about is if you can't figure it out from everything else4 that's in front of you, which you should be able to,5 will there be a situation where there is some testimony6 about a scientific principle, apart from the patent,7 that could get you there, and the situation is virtually8 unheard of. The patent office says no.9 JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Phillips, can I try this10 out and see if you agree with me.11 If a patent is like public law, if it's like12 a statute or like a rule, then factual findings13 regarding the meaning of that patent are not entitled to14 clear error review.15 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.16 JUSTICE ALITO: Any more than factual17 findings regarding the meaning of a statute are ­­ or18 the Constitution are entitled to plain error review.19 What was the original understanding of the Second20 Amendment?

How many patents?JUSTICE BREYER: How many patents are issued every year? Roughly. Do you have any idea?MR. PHILLIPS: I don't. The SG's lawyer would almost certainly be in a better position to answer that. But obviously it's a significant number of them.JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Phillips, there might be very different kinds of factual determinations that are relevant to patentability than are relevant to interpretation of a statute, so let me just give you one. I mean, suppose that the validity of a patent depended on when a particular invention was made. You know, was it done in 1980 or was it done in 2000.MR. PHILLIPS: Right, the priority date.JUSTICE KAGAN: And that was absolutely critical to your determination of whether a patent was valid. But that seems like so within the province of the trial court and ­­                           Yes, but that's ­­ that's thepriority date and the priority date's always beenrecognized as a question of fact. I mean, the court ­­ JUSTICE KAGAN: So a question of fact whichthe trial court ought to get deference on, no?48￼1 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, absolutely. But that's2 not ­­ that's not a claim construction issue.3 That's just a question of what is the4 priority date for purposes of ­­ you have to go outside5 the patent to get that. Because you've got to be ­­ you6 have to find out at what point other things were7 available, you know, how does it react to other filings8 that would have been made?9 JUSTICE KAGAN: I see, but are you saying10 that there aren't similar things that could arise within11 the context of claim construction, just different12 people's view of what the facts on the ground are? You13 know, is molecular weight usually measured in14 kilodaltons or something else.15 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, but that's the whole16 point. There isn't any disagreement about that. Most17 of the ­­ of those kinds of issues that are completely18 distinct from the patent itself where you're not just19 trying to figure out the language of the patent, there20 are very few differences of opinion about it. Everybody21 acknowledged, even the Federal Circuit acknowledged that22 suggesting that average weight was ­­ implied average23 molecular weight, weight average molecular weight was24 implied by the reference to kilodaltons, right, was a25 misstatement of law. It was a misstatement of science.49￼1 But I think quite rightly, then drew the 2   precise legal conclusion that I would hope this Court 3   would affirm, which is that when a patent holder 4   identifies flatly inconsistent positions in the 5   prosecution history in order to get two separate patents 6   issued, one using a measure for one and one using a 7   measure for the other, where ­­ where, just to be clear 8   about this, this patent is all about molecular weight. 9   The whole purpose of this was to get ­­10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Phillips, why do you11   think that the court below just didn't make that12   holding?  To be frank with you,  when I read the1314151617   didn't actually say that clearly enough.  And I'm going18   to ask on the  rebuttal what Mr. Jay would say if they said19   that.  Is that an issue of law?  If you have20   inconsistent positions in patent prosecution, you're21 bound.22 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. I mean, I think23   that's ­­ I mean, whether you can ­­ whether it's an24   estoppel, I don't know, but whether it's the best way to25   interpret the patent, regardless of what else there is50background of this case, your intuitive or your reactionwas my own.MR. PHILLIPS: Right.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But they didn't. They￼1 in the record and the evidence, I think that's one place2 where the Solicitor General and we are in complete3 agreement, that the one thing you cannot do is take4 fundamentally inconsistent positions in the prosecution5 history, create a record that says, average weight means6 ­­ average molecular weight means weight and average7 molecular weight means peak, when the whole purpose of8 this exercise is to get the weight into a certain range9 of kilodaltons in order to protect it against toxicity.10 I mean, that's the whole patent. You would11 have thought in the ordinary course, if I were writing a12 patent, and I thought everything turned on average13 molecular weight, I might actually bother to define the14 term.15 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. That may be16 true, but what you ­­ and I know I'm not going to get an17 answer from you, because I know what it would18 be.19 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, you always get an20 answer from me.21 JUSTICE BREYER: My question is, where are22 we going if we start carving out one aspect of the23 patent litigation, namely the construction, and say that24 fact matters underlying that, root facts, even when they25 are one witness versus another, are for the court on51￼1 review to decide, but in all other matters, they're2 really clear error. I don't know where I'm going with3 that, because I'm not an expert in this area. But you4 see that I'm nervous about it?5 MR. PHILLIPS: I do. And I guess what I6 would suggest, Justice Breyer, and hopefully this is an7 answer to your question, is that the Federal Circuit has8 followed this path for well more than 20 years.9 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, you've seen the figures10 in here. The figures are they followed the path and11 they reverse non­stop and it's, like, 30 percent or 4012 percent of all the cases get reversed.13 MR. PHILLIPS: But those numbers have14 continued to come down, and the reason they've continued15 to come down is that there was an enormous fight between16 both the district courts and the Federal Circuit about17 the methodology of claim construction. But the en banc18 decision of the Federal Circuit in Phillips made it very19 clear, you look at the claims, the specification, the20 prosecution history, the learned treatises and21 dictionaries, and as a last recourse, if need be, you22 can turn to experts to help you understand it.23 And nobody ­­ and I'm not discouraging,24 Justice Scalia, the use of experts. I mean, there is25 reason to testify. Anybody who wants to understand52￼1 certain kinds of patents are going to want to have2 experts come in. I can guarantee you parties are not3 going to present these cases to the judge without coming4 in with a tutorial that provides a very good explanation5 of how that patent operates.6 All of that's legitimate. And I would give7 a district court, if I were the Federal Circuit, the8 deference that the district judge is otherwise entitled9 to based on the strength of the argument to kind of ­­10 the kind of lesser deference courts pay to courts ­­ to11 administrative agencies in certain circumstances.12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're talking about13 Skidmore.14 MR. PHILLIPS: Skidmore, thank you. I was15 looking for the word, but it wasn't coming to me.16 You know, the notion that you're entitled17 to whatever deference the ­­18 gets you to. But if you use19 said, Justice Sotomayor ­­20 JUSTICE SCALIA:21 the same thing. I mean, you22 if you like, but ­­23 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it's a measure of ­­24 but at least it gives the district court an incentive to25 do harder work in order to be in a position to lay claim53the power of your logicthat test here where, as IIf you're right, we'll saycould call that deference￼1 to more deference.2 But what we do know here is that the ­­ the3 fundamental ­­ the prosecution history creates to my4 mind an insolubly ambiguous patent and there's no way5 out of that box. And then what the district ­­ what the6 court of appeals said is, is there anything in the SEC7 calibration data or the shifting of this and that that8 somehow makes this suddenly become definite enough, and9 the answer to that is no, none of that does anything10 except suggest to a person of skill in the art that peak11 could potentially have been a legitimate way to12 interpret that.13 But none of that gets you out of the box.14 And indeed, every time their expert testified to this he15 kept saying, well, it's because the prosecution history16 refers to peak. But that's only because he discounted17 the other half of the prosecution history that referred18 explicitly and completely to the weight.19 And it's in that context that I would hope20 that this Court, if it decides to go past de novo, if it21 thinks this exercise is worth the candle, will go beyond22 just simply saying there's a new standard to be applied23 and analyze each of the facts of the ­­ that have been24 put before the Court by the Petitioner, and make a25 determination because it's ­­ one, it would be very541 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425helpful to know what the indefiniteness standard meansin light of last year's decision in Nautilus and thatcan be elucidated here.  But two, it seems to me that,whatever else you want to say about this, this is ahopelessly indefinite set of claims.  It is not entitledto protection.  It should be regarded ­­ it should beregarded as invalid, and my client should be able to goforward with the generics that would bring this medicineto ­­ at less expense to the population.      If there are no further questions, YourHonors.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.      Mr. Jay, 3 minutes.     REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAYON BEHALF OF PETITIONERSMR. JAY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Iwould like to make, I think, five points.      One is in response to Mr. Phillips'ssuggestion that there aren't going to be many cases withcontested facts.  This is a case with contested facts.This is a case in which ­­ let's talk about figure onein particular because we didn't touch on that as much inthe top half of the argument.      The meaning of figure one is crucial to theFederal Circuit because it said its understanding of55￼￼1 figure one was that it made it2 interpretation of the patent.3 opposed scientific evidence in4 the peak shift or would it not5 page 375a of the joint appendix, no, it wouldn't. The6 district court found as a fact that, yes, it would.7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why does the government8 disagree with you about that?9 MR. JAY: The government agrees with us10 100 percent about figure one and I think the government11 says, and we agree with this as well, the error on12 figure one is itself a sufficient basis to remand. And13 what might happen on remand I think you can't14 necessarily predict because you can't disaggregate the15 ­­ all of these de novo conclusions from each other.16 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Which From the facts that you17 say are facts and the government says do not qualify as18 to their test.19 MR. JAY: The government says that the SEC20 point about presumed meaning, and I think ­­ the21 government doesn't pay sufficient attention to the22 presumed meaning fact­finding. But we disagree on that,23 and on ­­ relating to the prosecution history.24 Now, Mr. Phillips alluded to the prosecution25 history, and, Justice Sotomayor, this gets to your56hard to credit ourBut there was directlythe district court, wouldshift.  Dr. Ryu said,￼1 question that you asked me to address. Can the2 prosecution history by itself answer this case, and the3 answer is no, it can't. The Federal Circuit couldn't4 say that it did because when you have a patent that is5 sufficiently definite in light of the specification,6 that's the end of the matter.7 As the Federal Circuit said in Phillips, the8 prosecution history ranks below the specification as an9 interpretative aid, and if the patent is sufficiently10 definite in light of the specification, and we say that11 it is, and Dr. Grant said that it was ­­ Dr. Grant12 referred to a number of things besides what Mr. Phillips13 just told you about why peak was the more likely14 meaning. So, for example, number average and weight15 average are usually seen together, peak by itself.16 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry, you didn't17 answer my question. If the Federal Circuit just simply18 said, mistake or not,19 molecular weight, not20 MR. JAY:21 Sotomayor, because its own doctrine says ­­ what you're22 positing is some kind of disclaimer, and a disclaimer ­­23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, I'm positing an24 estoppel of some sort.25 MR. JAY: Well, whichever way you see it,57you said it, you said it waspeak, you're stuck.It can't say that, Justice1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that rises ­­ that requires a clear and convincingstandard, a clear and unambiguous standard that they didnot apply here, they could not apply here.  And inparticular what we have now is the '808 patent.  Thesetwo statements were made 4 years and 6 years after the'808 patent issued.  If it was definite when it issued,it's still definite today.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.MR.
