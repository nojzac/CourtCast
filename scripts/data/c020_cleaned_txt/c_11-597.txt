The United States.            Mr. Goodhart.           ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES F. GOODHART              ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER            MR. GOODHART:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it10111213141516   permanent.171819202122232425            Respectfully, Your Honors, that cannot bethe rule.  There are at least two reasons why.please the Court:            The issue is whether temporary flooding canever constitute a taking under the Fifth Amendment.  TheFederal Circuit said, no, never, ruling that thepermanent consequences of the Government's actions werenot relevant solely because its actions were not            First, the United States must provide justcompensation when its direct physical invasionsubstantially intrudes upon a landowner's protectedproperty interest, regardless of the particular mode orduration of that invasion.            And, second, the Federal Circuit's decisionconflicts with fundamental guarantees that the Takings3￼ 1   Clause is intended to preserve, and, therefore, is 2   manifestly unjust. 3               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about this Court's 4   precedent in, what is it, the Sanguinetti case, where 5   the Court said that for there to be Government 6   responsibility it is at least necessary that the 7   overflow constitute a permanent invasion of the land 8   amounting to an appropriation, not merely an injury, to9 property?10               We would have to withdraw or modify that11   statement, would we not, if you -- if your -- your12   argument prevails?13               MR. GOODHART:  Justice Ginsburg, we would14   say that you would not have to overrule Sanguinetti15   because the language there, "permanent flooding16   invasion," was -- was not how the case turned on the17   result.  The court there did make an inaccurate summary18   of the early flood-taking cases -- Pumpelly, Lynah, and19   Kress.  None of those cases said that flooding had to be20   permanent.  The facts in those cases did have a21   permanent condition of flooding, but that was not made a22   requirement.  And none of those cases said that you23   could not have temporary flood invasions.24               But, Your Honor --25               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Was Sanguinetti -- had we4￼ 1   had any temporary takings cases before Sanguinetti? 2               MR. GOODHART:  Justice Scalia -- 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:  In other words, was 4   Sanguinetti expressing a special rule for flooding, or 5   was it -- was it simply saying there can't be a 6   temporary taking?  If the latter, that dictum if it's 7   dictum or a holding if it was a holding has already been 8   overruled by our later temporary takings cases. 9               MR. GOODHART:  Justice Scalia, there --10   you're correct.  There was no temporary takings prior to11   Sanguinetti.  The Court there didn't have occasion to12   address temporary flooding, whether that could13   constitute a taking.  And all of the cases after14   Sanguinetti that have actually addressed whether a15   direct temporary invasion will -- that substantially16   intrudes upon property interests have held that, yes,17   you can have a temporary --18               JUSTICE BREYER:  Which ones?  Because I19   counted eleven cases which either say, state, some seem20   to hold or support the proposition that when it's21   temporary with a flood it's a trespass, and where it's22   permanent it's a taking.  Okay?23               I mean, I have eleven.  And so I've got from24   my law clerk.  And then I tried to see, well, what are25   the ones that say the opposite?  And so far we've come5￼ 1   up with zero.  All right? 2               You could argue that there were three cases 3   during the war which might be read that way, though they 4   don't quite mention it.  All right? 5               So which of the cases that you -- rather 6   than list my eleven, I'm more interested in what you 7   think, and so I'd like to know which are the ones you 8   think support -- with something like a flood, which it's 9   not -- you're not physically taking hold of the whole10   thing.  You're sending something in that comes back.11   Which of the ones support you that temporary is not a12   trespass, temporary is a taking?13               MR. GOODHART:  Justice Breyer, in the14   Dickinson case in 1947 where the Court found a taking15   from flooding, Mr. Dickinson reclaimed his property,16   effectively reclaimed most of the property that had17   flooded, effectively ending the flood invasion.  And the18   Court there said the taking was a taking when that19   occurred, regardless of whether the landowner does20   reclamation.21 22 23 24 25            Of course, this Court in the war seizurecases, in General Motors, Petty Motor, Pewee Coal,Kimball Laundry, in all of those cases the Court hasfound --            JUSTICE BREYER:  Dickinson -- I got written6￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9down Dickinson.            MR. GOODHART:  Yes, Your Honor.            JUSTICE BREYER:  Kimball Laundry.  KimballLaundry was the -- laundry facilities.            MR. GOODHART:  Yes, Your Honor.            JUSTICE BREYER:  They took the laundryfacilities for 3 years, but there what they did is theywent in and they took this building, you know, took thewhole thing.            MR. GOODHART:  Yes, Your Honor.101112131415161718192021222324   shooting overland.  Right?25               MR. GOODHART:  Yes, Your Honor.  The Causby            JUSTICE BREYER:  The problem with a flood isyou don't take all the land.  You send some stuff in.And the stuff is there for a while, and then it comesback, and -- it's called water.  And so I don't knowwhat to make of the cases like Kimball Laundry where youactually appropriate the property.  I suspect that theyare not quite the same.            Anything else?  I got Dickinson.  I've gotKimball Laundry.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  We have cases about flyingoverland -- -JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, Causby.JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- cases about shooting --7￼1 case -- 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's not water, but it 3   ain't taking, either, in the -- in the narrow sense that 4   Justice Breyer has talked about. 5               MR. GOODHART:  Yes, Your Honor.  The -- the 6   United States flooded the air over the Causby's 7   residence and commercial chicken farm. 8               JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but in Causby, what 9   they did -- there was a question about whether just10   flying some airplanes over is a taking or a trespass.11   But it went on for 25 years, so it was a long time.12   And, therefore, the permanency of it I don't think is at13   issue there.14               MR. GOODHART:  Yes.  Your Honor, in this15   case, the court -- the Court of Federal Claims found16   that these deviations resulted, in over 8 years, 617   consecutive years of recurring flood invasions during --18   during the summertime, during unnatural time periods;19   and that the facts were more compelling than even in20   Causby with the -- the overflights or in Portsmouth21   Harbor with cannon shots flooding the air over22   Portsmouth Landing Harbor Hotel.23               This -- these flood invasions happened each24   year for specific sustained time periods.  The United25   States controlled the timing, the frequency, and the8￼            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, he has.  It'sflooded.  He can't --1   extent of the duration of these floods.2               JUSTICE SCALIA:  What if it hadn't harmed3   the timber?  I mean, you know, the damages claimed are a4   lot -- a lot of the timber that -- that would have been5   valuable was -- was impaired by these floodings.6   Suppose there'd been no harm at all?  Suppose it had7   just been for a certain period of time you were not able8   to use that land for anything?  You couldn't plant9   anything on it.  You couldn't picnic on it.  You10   couldn't do anything.  Would that have been --11   nonetheless, despite the fact that there -- there was no12   harm done except -- except the flooding -- would that13   have been a taking?14               MR. GOODHART:  Your Honor, no.  If -- there15   would not have been a taking unless the landowner could16   show substantial intrusion upon his protected property17   rights.18192021222324259            MR. GOODHART:  If -- Your Honor, if he canshow that the -- he has the right to excludesuperinduced invasions of water, that -- so it doesn'tinterfere with his use and enjoyment.  Here --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  It does.  He can't plow onit.  He can't picnic on it.  How does that not interfere￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425with his --            MR. GOODHART:  Well, and it very may well,Your Honor.  And here, that -- there was that --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  So it would be a taking.Are you saying yes or no?  What is it?            MR. GOODHART:  I'm saying, yes, if he canshow that it intruded on his use and enjoyment, and asyou said, indicated, that type of interference, yes.  Itwould be a -- it would be a substantial intrusion on hisrights to use his property --            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So that would cover aone-time flood.            MR. GOODHART:  Not necessarily, JusticeGinsburg.  A one-time flood that is extensive, it couldkill all the trees on this management area in one flood.However, one flood may not result in substantialintrusion on protected property rights.  So it's goingto depend on the facts, Your Honor, in the case.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I don't understand that.You said if -- if it's one flood, even though itdestroys the trees, and certainly would not make --would make it impossible to have picnics, what -- so ifthat's your position, then you're turning on it happenedsix times, not once.  Is that --            MR. GOODHART:  And, Your Honor, what I'm10￼ 1   saying, it's a proof of facts.  The physical takings 2   analysis is the same.  The legal analysis is the same. 3   But one flood could effectively destroy timber if it is 4   a lake; if it sits there.  We didn't have that in our5 case. 6               We had intrusion during 1993 to 2000, 8 7   years, 6 of which were substantially throughout the 8   summer where this management area sat in water during 9   June, July, into August, basically, stagnated water that10   choked the oxygen from the roots of these trees.  And in11   1999 it was termed a brownout.  It was massive.12               Once the timber inventory was done, it13   revealed that there was over 100,000 trees in a14   6,990-acre area that were either destroyed or were --15   were in the process of dying.  And that didn't include16   the other 11,000 acres that we subsequently inventoried.17               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, all of our18   cases in this temporary versus permanent, as I read the19   cases and I read what the multiple facts that each are20   relying on, it seems to me that our cases have been21   attempting, in the term "temporary," to encompass a lot22   of different concepts.  Both intentionality, because an23   accidental issue is not a taking; causation:  Did this24   -- and that's part of Sanguinetti's holding -- did what25   the Government do actually and directly cause the injury11￼ 1   at issue?  And foreseeability:  Is what you intended 2   something whose consequences you could have seen? 3               And they are using that in a multifaceted 4   test, one that the Solicitor General is not trying to 5   endorse here, but one that I think is more consistent 6   with our general jurisprudence in this area. 7               So there is never a simple answer on the 8   question of permanent damage, because you can have 9   permanent damage that's not a taking, if all of the10   other factors I've just mentioned are not in your favor.11   Is that correct?12               MR. GOODHART:  Yes, Your Honor, you're13   correct.  The -- the invasion has to be direct by the14   United States.15               The Court of Federal Claims found that --16   that it was direct, natural, and probable -- the results17   were -- from the Government's action.18               One thing in water cases is you don't have19   dye in the water.  Mr. Causby could look up and see the20   insignia on the airplanes.  And we knew that the cannon21   fire from the -- from the artillery was coming over the22   Portsmouth Harbor's land was from the Government.  The23   water, you can't always tell.  And so you have to prove24   that that was directly from the United States.  And the25   commission in this case did.12￼ 1               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I guess the problem with 2   this case, and it's part of what's interwoven in your 3   adversary's arguments, is that with flooding it's going 4   to occur naturally anyway.  The Government generally 5   builds dams to control that flooding to the benefit of 6   all of the interests along its affected route.  And at 7   some point, either the Government is going to -- is 8   going to make a decision that's going to help someone 9   and potentially hurt someone.  And the question is,10   isn't all of those situations going to be subject to11   litigation.12               The Government's rule -- I call it the13   Government's rule, but it's -- is basically simple.  It14   can't.  Because, if the deviation is temporary -- and15   that's what the circuit below said -- it's just16   exercise.  It's either a nuisance or temporary trespass,17   and we're not going to hold the Government responsible18   for that loss.  Assuming it's going to occur in part19   because flooding is always going to occur, the question20   is perhaps when.  But in any place you have a dam, it's21   there because flooding was happening.22               Isn't that the basic argument?  And I don't23   know that you've actually announced the rule that24   addresses the essence of the policy considerations that25   are driving the Government decision.  So tell me how13￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425your rule makes this a manageable situation.            MR. GOODHART:  Your Honor, the -- the twoelements of the rule, that there must be direct physicalinvasion by the United States and not from some othercause, and there must be substantial intrusion uponthese protected property rights, the right to exclude,the right to use and enjoy, and the right to dispose,that --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's every flood.            MR. GOODHART:  That runs throughoutthis Court's --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's every flood.            MR. GOODHART:  Yes, Your Honor, it is.  Butthe United States, when it does its flood control --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no, no, I don't-- why is that every flood?  You go through your threefactors, you could have lots of flood that aren't asubstantial intrusion.  You know, you get an extra inchof water, and then it recedes.  And it's -- you know --            MR. GOODHART:  That's --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- you get a notefrom the Corps of Engineers saying, we're sorry, itwon't happen again.  That's not -- every flood is not --            MR. GOODHART:  Not -- you're correct,Mr. Chief Justice.  Every flood is certainly not rising14￼ 1   to the level of a taking. 2               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I guess what we're asking 3   you is, how do you define the baseline of protected 4   expectations for the property? 5               MR. GOODHART:  Your Honor -- 6               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You've indicated, I think, 7   in your brief that one year won't do it.  This was six 8   or seven years. 9               If that's a baseline of expectations, the10   Government cannot change that, even if it thinks that11   there is a higher and -- and more urgent priority in12   protecting some other land?13               MR. GOODHART:  Your Honor, the -- certainly,14   the Government is not the insurer of -- of flood15   control, how they just carry it out.16               There is the case that's cited in the17   Government's brief, United States v. Sponenbarger, which18   says that very thing.  The United States is not the19   insurer of it.  But when it takes water and it controls20   water and releases it in a manner that's not from21   storms, not from natural, but does it in a manner that22   they control how it's released and the duration,23   frequency, and they use property to store that water for24   eight -- you know, over eight years, that in this case25   was -- was compelling.  And the court found that those15￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425facts --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But my question is how doyou define the baseline that gives a legitimateexpectation, if the Corps of Engineers -- did not happenin this case, but in the hypothetical case -- makes thefinding that there is a more urgent and -- and a higherpriority for other lands, and it changes its policy?  Itcannot do that?            MR. GOODHART:  Your Honor, it can go throughits law, the National Environmental Policy Act, theClean Water Act.  It can make changes, and then it canpay for what it's going to take from private landowners.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, what you're sayingis that it can't make that change without paying, right?            MR. GOODHART:  It -- it cannot make thatchange where it's going to burden the landowner andinterfere with that -- those property rights that theFifth Amendment is guaranteeing.            Now, in practice --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Now suppose, at the veryoutset of the dam, the -- the Government says, we've gotto put this water someplace, we're going to put it onthe left bank, not the right bank.  That's not a takingas of that time --            MR. GOODHART:  Your Honor --16￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- if the land was alwaysflooded anyway on the right?            MR. GOODHART:  That may not be a taking.And, for example, in the Bedford case in 1904, where arevetment was in the Mississippi River, it was trying tocontrol natural erosion from a cutoff that had beencreated, the landowner could not show --101112131415   takings.16171819202122232425            And, here again, the United States -- thishas worked well in other cases for the United States,where in Sanguinetti there was no --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But what I want is thedefinition of the operable baseline that we can use inorder to define whether or not there has been a taking.            MR. GOODHART:  And, Your Honor, I guess Imust say it may not be a bright line.  It is -- theanalysis here that this Court has used throughout itsphysical takings cases will separate the torts from the            JUSTICE ALITO:  Should the baseline be whatwould have happened if the dam was never built?            MR. GOODHART:  Perhaps, Your Honor.  And inthis case, for example, the court had evidence that thisland flourished before the dam.  There was evidence thatthis bottomland hardwood forest existed for generations.And when the control plan was put in effect in 1953, it17￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9worked fine because they mimicked natural flow wherelate -- late winter and early spring, you have yourreleases, they dissipate, the water recedes, but youdon't have extensive summertime flooding from a river.            Frankly, anywhere in the country, butcertainly not in the southern part of the United States,these rivers do not overflow during June, July, August.This never happens.            MR. GOODHART:  Yes, Your Honor.            MR. GOODHART:  Yes, Your Honor.            JUSTICE BREYER:  But what do you suggest --what do you suggest -- I looked at the consent.101112131415161718192021222324   rule.25               Now -- so I'm tempted, if I'm right, to say,18            JUSTICE BREYER:  To tell you the truth, Ithink it's permanent.  I think they're thinking it'sintermittent, but permanently intermittent.            JUSTICE BREYER:  The flood comes like threemonths a year every year.  And the erosion, they saythat part that's eroded belongs to the Government now.And if he comes back with his dirt and puts it in,that's fine, but he's trespassing on Government land.            So if I'm right in reading that, if I'mright -- and a big if -- it seems that eleven casessomewhat stand for this, I agree, somewhat arbitrary￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425okay, it's not perfect, but let's go with it.  There arepeople all over the country who have probably relied onthis stuff.  And that would be so absent a better rule.            So what do you suggest would be a better,clearer rule for compensating for flooding where ourproblem is what's a trespass and what's a taking?            MR. GOODHART:  And, Your Honor, I know itcannot be the Federal circuit's rule that you can neverhave temporary flooding as a taking.  And I guessI would --            JUSTICE BREYER:  You know, but I want toknow what your idea -- I understand the difficulties arethere --            MR. GOODHART:  Yes.            JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and I'm willing toaccept a lot you mentioned.            MR. GOODHART:  Yes.            JUSTICE BREYER:  But what I'masking -- which I just did ask -- is what's your idea ofa substitute that would be better?            MR. GOODHART:  Your Honor, the substitutewould be to remain consistent with how this Courtanalyzes the physical takings, not use anything fromregulatory analysis here, but looking at these elements.            And the -- the Corps of Engineers will19￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425need -- when they know that it's predictable, that it isforeseeable, as the court below found, that -- thattheir actions will place water for storage on land thatthey know they can purchase flood easements for --            JUSTICE BREYER:  So a Department of theInterior employee trespasses on Jones's land, tramplingpaths, and even limbs fall off trees.  That's a takingand not a trespass?            MR. GOODHART:  No, Your Honor, it's not.            JUSTICE BREYER:  Because?            MR. GOODHART:  And because the Court said inthe Cress case, it's the character of the Government'saction, not the amount of damages resulting from it, solong as that is substantial.            And in the cases, the Court has looked atwhat is substantial intrusion.  In Loretto, the Courtsaid a permanent physical occupation on a rooftop in Ms.Loretto's building, small area, that is substantial,even though geographically it was very small, because itcut through these valuable property rights to occupysomeone's property.            And so -- substantial may not have to bevery high.            JUSTICE BREYER:  So our department employeetrying to find a shortcut drives his bulldozer through20￼ 1   Jones's land knocking down his favorite redwood, it's a 2   taking? 3               MR. GOODHART:  Your Honor, I think we would, 4   again, use the analysis, separate out the torts, where 5   the action is direct, it's been predictable what would 6   that would result in, the United States should know 7   that, and then the intrusion or interference with those 8   property rights is substantial, there will be a taking. 9               Usually that's not going to be the case in a10   one-time situation, as your hypothetical.  And, again,11   here the court heard six consecutive years of this12   invasion of water.  The commission couldn't turn it13 away.141516171819202122232425            JUSTICE SCALIA:  So our cases -- our casestreat physical occupations differently from other --from other cases, don't they?            The park ranger walking through can hardlybe called a physical occupation.  He's harmed the land,but it's not a physical occupation.            What you're -- what you're arguing here isthat -- is that flooding the land is a physicaloccupation for the period that it's flooded.            MR. GOODHART:  It is, Your Honor.  Whereit's an occupation, it's certainly clearer and moreintrusive.  There can be invasions that don't amount to21￼ 1   an occupation. 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but what you say -- 3   here's what troubles me.  You say it has to be 4   substantial.  But you -- can we -- can we fold into that 5   word substantial a requirement that it have caused 6   substantial financial loss? 7               See, if that were the case, then -- then I 8   could distinguish your case where a lot of valuable 9   trees got destroyed.10               MR. GOODHART:  Certainly, Your Honor.11   Substantial --12               JUSTICE SCALIA:  And I wouldn't say every --13   you know, every flood that goes across a land, even two14   years or three years in a row, would not necessarily be15 a taking.16               MR. GOODHART:  You could look at the17   economic part -- yes, definitely, Your Honor.  What is18   substantial is going to be made as a legal determination19   by the Corps, as a matter of degree.20               And you can look at the extent of the21   damages -- if there is destruction of property.22   Destruction has been -- as in the Kansas City Life case23   in 1950, the taking is to the extent of the destruction.24   Beyond that, though, it's looking at interference with25   use and enjoyment --22￼ 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:  What was the Kansas City 2   case that you are referring to?  I don't -- 3               MR. GOODHART:  The Kansas City Life 4   Insurance case in 1950, Your Honor, was underflow 5   invasion of water percolating up on property in Missouri 6   from the Mississippi River.  And that was found to be a 7   substantial invasion where the property, the 1700 acres, 8   was taken by the United States.  And the Court there 9   said, when you destroy the use of that property for what10   it was being used by the landowner, you owe to the11   extent of the destruction that you have caused.12               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Goodhart, maybe it13   would help to know what you think if we accept your14   position would be left over for the Federal Circuit to15   consider on remand.  You -- you haven't asked to -- for16   outright reversal and have the decision of the Court of17   Federal Claims be the end of the matter.  So if we18   accept your position, then what issues would be open for19   the Federal Circuit to resolve on remand?20               MR. GOODHART:  Your Honor, if I may, after21   answering your question I would like to reserve the22   remainder of my time.23               Your Honor, I wish we could have asked for24   affirmance.  We -- there are several other issues that25   the Federal Circuit did not disturb or address.  They23￼ 1   did not go into the facts of, on appeal, that the United2 States -- 3               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, the question is what 4   do we say to the circuit?  What do you want us to tell 5   the circuit to do on remand? 6               MR. GOODHART:  We want the remand to say: 7   Apply the rule of law here for physical taking and look 8   at it as the Court of Federal Claims did:  Was there a 9   direct physical injury?  Did it result in substantial10   intrusion on the commission's property?  If so, the Just11   Compensation Clause is self-actuating and there should12   be just compensation.13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what were the other14   issues that you just mentioned?  You said we couldn't15   ask for an automatic affirmance.16               MR. GOODHART:  The United States raised17   several issues and the commission cross-appealed in18   asking for regeneration damages, Your Honor, and those19   would need to be addressed on the remand.20 Thank you.21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.22               Mr. Kneedler.23               ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER24                   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT25               MR. KNEEDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it24￼ 1   please the Court: 2               As has been pointed out, this Court has 3   consistently held in its flooding cases and reaffirmed 4   in Loretto that a -- that a taking occurs in the context 5   of flooding only if the flooding is the direct result of 6   the structure itself and if it results in a permanent 7   effect on the property such that it's an actual 8   appropriation.  So -- 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So it's -- there is10   a little confusion about the Government's position,11   there was in the court of appeals.12               Is it -- I'm quoting from your friend's13   brief, and he says:  "The Federal Circuit adopted a14   categorical rule that temporary Government action can15   never be a taking if the Government does not intend to16   create a permanent flooding condition."  Is that an17   accurate statement of your understanding?18               MR. KNEEDLER:  The -- I think the intent19   point, I guess I would modify that.  There are some20   things that -- I think it would have to be an objective21   standard.  In Dickinson, for example, the -- the22   modification was intrinsically permanent.  The landowner23   had corrected for it.  But it was intrinsically24   permanent until the landowner had done something about25   it.  So actually Dickinson is consistent with our --25￼ 1   with our position. 2               But I do want -- there is a critical piece 3   about this case that Justice Kennedy's questions have 4   touched upon that I think it's very important for this 5   Court to focus upon. 6               This case is not about flooding by the 7   project itself.  The reservoir behind the dam, the 8   easements, the flowing easements there, the spillway, 9   the project is the Government and I think it's fair to10   say the Government is occupying the land when the11   Government builds the project.12               What we have here are incidental13   consequences downstream from the dam as a result of the14   flowage.  And there are -- Loretto, when it is summing15   up this Court's flooding cases, makes two points.  One,16   it says it has to be permanent, not temporary invasion;17   but it also distinguishes the category of cases in which18   there is conduct outside the landowner's property that19   has consequential damages within the property.20               JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't -- I don't21   understand what you're saying.  Are you saying that if22   this landowner owned land behind the dam that was23   temporarily flooded as often as has happened here, that24   that would be a taking?25               MR. KNEEDLER:  No. I --26￼ 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, I didn't think you were 2   saying that. 3               MR. KNEEDLER:  No, but what I'm saying is 4   this would be a particularly bad or problematic context 5   for the Court to depart from that. 6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, there are 7   pretty clear findings in the Court of Claims on the 8   question of causation, right? 9               MR. KNEEDLER:  I don't think it's a question10   of causation, and if I could just point out two cases,11   one of which was cited in Loretto in its summing up of12   this Court's flooding cases is Bedford.  Bedford was a13   situation in which a revetment, as counsel pointed out,14   a revetment was constructed in the -- in the Mississippi15   River to protect erosion and access to the City of16   Vicksburg.  It was -- it was clearly shown in that case17   that over time, over a period of 6 years, as in this18   case, downstream by 6 miles it resulted in permanent19   flooding of land as a consequence of that.20               But what the Court said is that is21   consequential injury downstream; it is not occupation by22   the Government.23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, so if the24   Government comes in and tells a landowner downstream25   that every March and April we are going to flood your27￼ 1   property so that you can't use it, from now on, that's 2   the way -- that's part of our plan, that's a taking for 3   those 2 months, correct? 4               MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  I don't think -- 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No?  The Government 6   says you will not be able to use your land because of 7   what we are doing for 2 months -- you have been able to 8   up to now, but from now on, for March and April, you 9   can't.  That's not a taking?10               MR. KNEEDLER:  I don't, and -- and let me11   explain why.  What we're talking about here is the Corps12   of Engineers operating a dam from which it has to take13   into account multiple considerations.  In this case,14   there was marina operators, there were farmers along the15   river, there were drainage districts.16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'll grant you that17   it can decide whose land it wants to take.  I just want18   to know why that's not a taking.19               MR. KNEEDLER:  Because this is a classic20   example of the Government adjusting benefits and21   burdens.  This is why the Federal Government was invited22   in to construct these projects because along -- along23   the river there was very serious flooding.  So the24   Government puts in a dam to control the flooding, it has25   to release the flood waters, and the timing of the28￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425release of the flood waters is something that you haveto take into account --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if the Governmentsays we've got to release the flood waters and whatwe're going to do is we're going to have water truckspull up behind the dam, we're going to load them up andwe're going to drive them down river to this person'sproperty and we're going to dump the water there?            MR. KNEEDLER:  I think that's a differentsituation because the Government itself is actuallyputting the water -- I think that's very close to beingthe reservoir behind the dam.  But -- but typically,when the Government -- I think uniformly, when theGovernment is operating --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But your answer isthat would be a taking?            MR. KNEEDLER:  I think because it wouldbe -- it would be specifically deposited on thatlandowner's land.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I thought --            MR. KNEEDLER:  It would be the same as ifthey put a pipe from the dam --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.            MR. KNEEDLER:  -- to that person's land.But that's not what's happening when the Government's29￼1   operating a dam, and it's operating it with consequences2   for the basin.  It's not aimed at any particular3   landowner.45 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Again, I think theCourt of Claims' findings are to the contrary.            MR. KNEEDLER:  Well --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  They said theGovernment knew that this water was going to go righthere, right?            MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, it was not -- there isno suggestion that it was targeted at this land, whichis -- which is I think something quite different.  Thiswas -- this was an incidental consequence of what washappening downstream.  Again, in the Bedford case youhad permanent --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  A foreseeable and certainincidental consequence.            MR. KNEEDLER:  No, I don't believeforeseeable is enough.  It was -- it could have been --it could have been foreseeable in Bedford.            Let me take a more -- a more dramaticexample that I think illustrates this point.  ThisCourt's decision in Sponenbarger which we cite in ourbrief, that a -- that case discusses a prior holding bythis Court in a case called Jackson, which was a30￼1   situation where a levee, Government built a levee on one2   side of the river which had the effect of flooding3   property on the opposite side of the river because it --4   it kept it from going to this side and channelled it5   into the river and it caused it to overflow the -- the6   land on the other side, and the Court said that is not a7 taking. 8910111213141516171819202122232425            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if theGovernment decides for purposes of flood control -- Idon't know -- I don't know the ecological way -- but thewater has to percolate or whatever down in this area.So it goes onto this person's land and it cuts down $5million worth of his trees.  The same purpose, to assistin flood control.  No doubt that that's a taking, right?            MR. KNEEDLER:  I think that would be --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.            MR. KNEEDLER:  Unless there was someemergency justification.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure, sure.  And sothe Government then comes down and says, we're going toflood your land and we know -- again, looking at thefactual findings -- we know that will result in yourtrees dying, but because we're doing it for floodcontrol, that's just too bad.  Different case when theygo in with a chain saw than when they go in with the31￼17181920   sometimes.  They make electricity sometimes.  Different21   animals come in.1 water? 2               MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  When they go in with 3   the chain saw the Government is actually going on the 4   property and the Government is, to use counsel's term, 5   directly cutting down the trees.  I think it's very hard 6   to explain consequences 110 miles downstream as being 7   direct.  It's -- and there is no case that -- that 8   Petitioner has pointed to with that sort of incidental 9   consequence --10               JUSTICE BREYER:  What is the legal rubric?11   I mean what you're -- what I haven't thought of until12   you've been putting it this way is that the Government13   builds a dam.  When it does it, water backs up behind14   the dam, and that water might flood somebody's land.15   That's a taking, if it's at least permanent, and so16 forth.            Okay.  Now, the Government builds a dam, allthat happens.  Because the Government builds a dam, alot of other things happen.  They release water22               All kinds of things can happen to different23   people 200 yards down.  Some will be 200 miles down,24   200 -- you know.  Some will be helpful, some will be25   hurtful.  Can they never bring a lawsuit?  Can they32￼ 1   sometimes recover?  How do we look at that? 2               MR. KNEEDLER:  I -- I think, under this 3   Court's takings decisions, and specifically those 4   dealing with effects caused by something outside the 5   property, I think it is basically a per se rule. 6               JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, then, suppose what 7   the Government said is, Mr. Smith, you live 150 miles 8   from here, and we have a rule, and our rule is you can't 9   cut down any of your trees, and you can't farm the land,10   and you can't even walk on it without a boat.  All11   right, that would be at least a regulatory taking.12               MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, it would be -- it would13   be analyzed as a regulatory taking --14               JUSTICE BREYER:  So why -- now, they're15   doing exactly the same thing here, but, instead of a16   regulation, they send some water in to do it.  So should17   we analyze it as a regulatory taking?18               MR. KNEEDLER:  It -- it has certain19   parallels in that respect in the sense that the20   Government has to make a choice.  It constructed the21   dam, and its releases are going to help someone and hurt22   someone.  It can't be put in a position where it's going23   to have to pay compensation every time it chooses one --24   one thing or another.25               There's another point I'd like to make --33￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, but that's the issue.            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm totally confusednow.  Is Dickinson decided wrong under your theory?            MR. KNEEDLER:  No.            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They built a dam.  Itraised the water level and flooded the petitioner'sland, and the court gave recompense.            MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  And --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you just said twominutes ago -- or I thought I heard you say -- that whenthe Government builds a dam, even if it floods somepeople and not others, that there's no taking.            MR. KNEEDLER:  I'm talking about downstream,not the -- not the reservoir.  And after it goes --           JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  After it's --            MR. KNEEDLER:  -- after it goes through --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So the baseline -- tellme what the baseline is.  And perhaps you can answerJustice Kennedy's question more directly.  Anything inthe reservoir is a taking.  Anything downstream is nevera taking.            MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, assuming it's permanentin the reservoir, which it's likely to be when theGovernment is constructing it --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, no, not necessarily.34￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Suppose there -- because of a spring melt-off or otherfactors, it's clear that the reservoir for severalmonths of the year will be more extensive than it willthe rest of the year.            MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you could say, just --just as here, that there's only been a temporary takingof some of the land behind the reservoir.            Now, doesn't the -- doesn't the Governmentcondemn all the land --            MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  But that --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- even that which would beonly temporarily flooded?            MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, but that -- thatis covered by this Court's decision in Cress, in whichthe Court said that if you have a situation whereproperty is permanently liable to inevitably recurringflooding, that that's the same thing as a permanent --even though sometimes it's not -- it's not covered, itis permanently liable.            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And the only difference inthat formulation and this case is that it was for sevenyears and not permanent?  Is that your --            MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, insofar as we'relooking at the temporary aspect of it.  It wasn't seven35￼            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It doesn't matterwhether it's permanent, reoccurring -- 1   years, it was -- it was -- it was a series of individual 2   determinations made by the Corps; but -- but for reasons 3   that tie into the downstream effects, it was releasing 4   water from the dam and was making a series of 5   administrative decisions about how to operate the dam. 6               It has a water control manual.  Downstream 7   landowners are protected, not by retroactive award of 8   damages under the Just Compensation Clause, but by 9   public participation requirements --10               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I must be -- I must be11   slow today because I'm -- I'm having significant problem12   with your articulation of your test.13               Basically, you're saying once a dam is14   built -- once a dam is built, no downstream owner has a15   claim?  Or, you're building an exception from when the16   claim can be applied to a downstream owner?17               MR. KNEEDLER:  I -- I -- I think, under this18   Court's current precedence, there would be no claim19   downstream.20212223242536MR. KNEEDLER:  Foreseeable.MR. KNEEDLER:  No, because Jackson,            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- foreseeable oranything else?￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Spokenbarger -- Sponenbarger, the revetment case,Bedford were all cases where --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.            MR. KNEEDLER:  -- where it was -- where itwas permanent.            If I could mention one other point --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, just beforeyou get off, because I think part of the confusion, atleast for me, is the difference between what the Federalcircuit decided and what you're arguing.            You seem to be arguing that it doesn't makeany difference, it's not -- whether it's temporary orpermanent, right?  The Federal circuit thought it wasdispositive that this they viewed as temporary and notpermanent.  So it seems to me that you're fighting, andyou're fighting a lot of the court of claims' veryexhaustive findings, to present a different argument.            MR. KNEEDLER:  No.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It seems to me thatif we disagree, and we think it makes a difference thatit doesn't have to be 50 years, but it might besomething less, then maybe you've preserved all theseother arguments or maybe not, but --            MR. KNEEDLER:  But I think it's -- we haveargued, both below and here, that -- that this is37￼ 1   consequential, and that -- that it's downstream and had 2   those effects. 3               We agree with the -- with the Federal 4   circuit, we are not disagreeing with that conclusion, 5   because this is -- these were temporary -- a series of 6   individual temporary decisions made for their own7 reasons. 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I know, but you 9   agree -- you agree with the Federal circuit, but then10   you're presenting all these other arguments in which it11   doesn't depend.12               So, if we disagree with the Federal circuit,13   it seems to me that we ought to say that, and maybe you14   can make these other arguments about it's too far15   downstream or --16               MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, but -- but I think, in17   deciding what's temporary, you shouldn't divorce it from18   context.  And -- and here, the context is the19   consequences downstream.20               This is -- this is not -- if you were to21   depart from the Court's rule up until this point about22   permanence -- and there has to be -- something less than23   permanent will do, I don't think you should ignore the24   fact that the consequences are not the sort of direct25   governmental occupation of the land like at the38￼ 1   reservoir, but the sort of consequences downstream that 2   affect -- that can affect a whole range of people. 3               And I would like to make one very important 4   point about context, and that is, in 1928, after the 5   Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, Congress first got into 6   the flood control business in a massive way, but it -- 7   it -- it was unwilling to do that if it was going to be 8   held liable for consequential damages from flood waters 9   downstream.10               It therefore included Section 702(c) in the11   Flood Control Act of 1928, which says that the12   Government shall not be liable for any damage to any13   property at any place resulting from floods or flood14 waters.1516171819202122232425            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, that can'toverrule the Takings Clause, can it?           MR. KNEEDLER:  I think what it --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, that's nice thatCongress doesn't want to be liable.            (Laughter.)            MR. KNEEDLER:  No, but Congress -- no,it's -- the point is more fundamental than that.Congress recognized -- and the legislative history showsthis -- Congress recognized that under this Court'sprecedence, there would not be takings liability.  The39￼ 1   Bedford decision is, in fact, cited in that. 2               This Court pointed out in its James 3   decision, which recounts the history of that, that there 4   was a proposal to -- to make the Government responsible 5   under the flood -- flood control projects for any taking 6   or any damage to property.  And this Court said that 7   went way beyond anything the Fifth Amendment would 8   require, and it was cut back.  And Congress said it's 9   not going to be liable for any damage.10               And I think that shows a very important11   reliance interest on the part of Congress with respect12   to the line that this Court has drawn.  Congress was not13 going to --14               JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about --15   Mr. Kneedler, what was wrong with Judge Newman's16   position on this temporary versus permanent?  It said --17   she said that temporary versus permanent, the target18   should not be the Government's action, but the effect of19   that action; that is, if trees are killed and they20   weren't revived, the damage is permanent.  That's where21   we should vote, not whether the Government is going to22   do this year after year.23               MR. KNEEDLER:  I don't believe that that's24   correct.  I mean, that -- that would turn on the25   happenstance of what a particular landowner had -- had40￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425on his property downstream.            And -- and I think the Government, inoperating the general project, cannot be held to do aninvestigation of every property owner.  Again, it'sreleasing water generally.  And if we -- maybe if Icould use the levee example here.            This -- the release changes that were madehere were made to protect farmers so that they could --so that they could plant more crops and not -- and beprotected during their harvesting.            If you shift back to what the Corps -- tothe Corps' regular operating scheme, it affects thefarmers.  There might be a flood --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, the issue is who isgoing to pay for that wonderful benefit to thesefarmers.  Should it be everybody, so that the Governmentpays, and all of us pay through taxes, or should it bethis -- this particular sorry landowner who happens tolose all his trees?            MR. KNEEDLER:  It is in the nature --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  That doesn't seem to meparticularly fair.            MR. KNEEDLER:  It is in the nature of livingalong a river.  Riparian ownership carries with itcertain risks and uncertainties, from weather, from41￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425intervening causes.  The Government is -- there are athousand square miles, more square miles of drainagearea --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think -- one ofthose risks has to be the Government's going to make youpay for protecting somebody else.            Is that one of the risks?            MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, when -- picking up onwhat I said about Congress, Congress would not havegotten into the flood control business without thisprotection of liability.  People --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I doubt that.            MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, this Court in Jamessaid it was an important condition for Congress gettinginto it, that it was not -- Congress was not going to beheld liable for the -- for the damages downstream.            That came to be the basis, the baseline, ofexpectations for people downstream from --            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Or upstream, underyour theory.            MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, if it's -- but theconstruction of the project itself and the flooding ofthe reservoir, the Government condemns that land,purchases that land.  It recognizes --            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, the hypothetical is,42￼ 1   suppose it doesn't.  Suppose that there's some land 2   that's up -- that's fairly far upstream from the main 3   reservoir, but it's flooded once every other year. 4               MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, the question would be 5   whether it falls within the Cress test of whether it is 6   permanently liable. 7               JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Your -- but your position 8   seems to be that if it's downstream, somehow it's not 9   the Government.  There's a series of administrative10   actions and it's not really the Government's water.11   It's like -- it's like the old moral refuge that the12   rocket designers take:  You know, I make the rockets go13   up; where -- where they come down is not my concern.14               MR. KNEEDLER:  It -- it was basically -- I15   mean, it was the rationale of this Court's cases in --16   in Bedford, in Sponenbarger, and reaffirmed by this17   Court in Loretto, a modern takings case dealing with the18   question of physical occupation.  And the Court said19   that -- and it made two points.  Again, it said -- it20   made the temporary versus permanent point, but it also21   made the point about conduct outside the land that has22   an effect inside the land.23               This case has both of those features.  You24   have a series of temporary decisions --25               JUSTICE BREYER:  But building a Government43￼ 1   project, let's say an electricity plant or high tension 2   wires, you could require the taking of some land to 3   build it.  Now, you've got that and you begin to run it. 4   You could run it in such a way that it takes some of the 5   property.  I mean, the electricity could, for example, 6   because of some odd thing run around over somebody's 7   land and kill all the chickens.  That wasn't expected 8   but it happened, and it happened because of the way the 9   Government runs the plant.10               Now, I guess there would be a taking in such11   circumstance if in fact, because of the way it's run, it12   makes that land which no one thought would happen, as a13   consequence of the project uninhabitable; wouldn't there14 be?15               MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, again, it depends.  If16   the Government -- if the Government is occupying the17   land when it happens, yes.  But there's -- as you've I18   think pointed out, there's a critical difference between19   a tort and a taking.  And there -- there can be20   collateral consequences of what the Government does21   that -- that cause injury.22               JUSTICE BREYER:  The collateral consequence23   is to make some piece of land 4 miles away quite24   unexpectedly, but totally uninhabitable.  Now, what's25   supposed to happen there?  That's not just a trespass44￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425because it's permanent.  And even if it's once every2 years, it's permanently once every 2 years.            MR. KNEEDLER:  I think it would depend onwhether -- and there was a -- a case -- I believe it'sthe Baltimore & Ohio Railroad --            JUSTICE BREYER:  What does it say?            MR. KNEEDLER:  It says if the -- it had todo with releasing smoke from -- from a train.  And theCourt said just -- just releasing it into the air --            JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but they made this --            MR. KNEEDLER:  -- but -- but if you focus iton someone --            JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.            MR. KNEEDLER:  If -- if you pipe it -- ifyou pipe it to the person's property, that's a -- thatmay be a different matter.            JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So -- well,that's the part -- that's the point.  The reason theydon't compensate there is it apparently had something todo with everybody suffering the cinders.  But where thecinders went out of the train and they ended up on justone person's property because there were some pipes orsomething, then it was a taking.            MR. KNEEDLER:  It was focused, and that'snot -- not true in the operation of the dam.45￼ 1               JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, here they're focusing 2   it on his land. 3               MR. KNEEDLER:  They're not focusing it on 4   his land.  His land -- first of all, the commission's 5   land has always been subject to flooding and, as we 6   pointed out in our brief, even under -- even under 7   Petitioner's analysis, it results in an incremental 8   flooding of 5, 4 or -- 3 or 4 days. 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not flooding that time of10   year.  That's the problem.  I mean -- yes, flooding at a11   time when it wouldn't harm the trees.12               MR. KNEEDLER:  But it is land -- it is land13   in a floodplain that would be suitable for any sort of14   construction or development.  It is land in a15   floodplain.  And they have -- they have not argued, and16   in fact, their appraiser in this case acknowledged, that17   there is no permanent decrease in the valuation of the18   land.  They are -- they are arguing only about trees.19              And that is -- that seems classic20   consequential tort-type damages, that -- that flood21   waters, it -- we'll assume in somewhat greater22   increments, went on the land and damaged trees.  They23   didn't damage the land.  In fact, the commission --24   there was still hunting on the land during this period25 of time.46￼ 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It strikes me that 2   that's a valuation question.  But I understood you to 3   say that if there was a pipe coming out of the dam and 4   it went to somebody's -- right to the property line of 5   somebody's land and that's where you dump the water, 6   that would be a taking. 7               MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  Because -- 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  I thought the 9   factual findings in the trial court said that was this10   case, that you knew when you opened up the dam that this11   is where the water was going to go.12               MR. KNEEDLER:  First of all, the Court --13   the Court did not say that the Government knew.  In14   fact, it said the Government was unaware -- this15   discussion's between 95a and 99a in the Court of Federal16   Claims decision -- that the Government was unaware in --17 in 1993.18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about 6 years19   later, when it was doing the same thing and the water20   went to the same place?21               MR. KNEEDLER:  The taking goes -- the taking22   claim here goes from 1993 to 1998.  The Court of Federal23   Claims said even as of 19 -- at least until 1996, it was24   generally assumed that the operations of the dam did not25   have a significant impact below the Missouri-Arkansas47￼ 1   line.  Again, this is 110 miles downstream.  This was in 2   no way focused on the -- on the commission's land,3 but -- 4               JUSTICE ALITO:  Are you saying there's a 5   difference between the situation where the Government 6   particularly wants the water to go to a -- to a place, 7   and the situation where the Government knows that's 8   where it's going to go, but doesn't particularly care 9   where it's going to go?10               MR. KNEEDLER:  I think there's a -- I don't11   know about the "intend."  I mean, in the hypothetical12   with the Chief Justice the Government was actually13   transmitting the water.  It was essentially using the14   land as -- as a reservoir.  And that -- that's, I think,15   what Petitioner's counsel was trying to conjure up by16   saying the Government was using this land for storage.17   The Government was not using this land for storage.  The18   -- this wasn't the Government's water.  There weren't19   any outtakes from the commission's land to use this20 water.21               These were flood waters, which again the22   Flood Control Act says the Government is not liable for23   the release of flood waters from a project, that ended24   up on the land that is an incidental consequence of the25   operation of a flood control project.48￼ 1               People who live in a basin where there is a 2   flood control project get enormous benefits in the 3   control of that.  The water has to be released.  And it 4   has long been the case that the way that problem is -- 5   that issue is handled about how it will be released is 6   by ordinary administrative law principles, basically, 7   with the Corps, in operating the dam, they have 8   requirements of public participation.  In this case, the 9   commission participated on ad hoc planning groups.10               This manual had not been updated in 5011   years.  Corps regulations say that manuals should be12   updated to keep apace of changing circumstances,13   population changes, different uses, environmental14   concerns, so that when that happens, the commission15   acted responsibly here and, had --16               JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- you would say that17   even -- even if this land was permanently flooded, okay,18   permanently flooded so he couldn't use it at all, since19   it was downstream, no harm done, right?20              MR. KNEEDLER:  I think that's the21   consequence of this -- but there's no -- the Court22   doesn't have to decide that here.23               JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that's your position.24               MR. KNEEDLER:  That -- that's I think the25   necessary consequence of this Court's holdings in49￼ 1   Bedford, in Bedford and related cases.  And -- it may 2   have harshness in some circumstances.  But again, when 3   you live on a river and you know the consequences of 4   having a flood control project on the river, that -- 5   that's what happens, but this is not arbitrary.  There 6   is this planning process.  There is notice and comment. 7   There's NEPA -- 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If there's notice 9   and comment -- so the choice is, there are 10 landowners10   downstream.  The question is which one you're going to11   flood.  And you flood number 2, and there is a public12   process in which number 1 and 3 through 10 get to say,13   yes, this sounds fine to me.14               (Laughter.)15               MR. KNEEDLER:  No, that's not -- that's not16   what happens.  What the Corps was working for here, it's17   commendable.  The Corps was trying to develop a18   consensus of downstream water users, which is why it19   convened this ad hoc working group:  The commission20   drainage districts, representatives of farmers, the21   marina, the Corps of Engineers, getting everybody22   together to try to come up with a -- with a way to23   handle the problem.  And --24               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But what difference does25   that make?  It's nice that you try to reach consensus.50￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425            If number 2 is not going to be part of theconsensus because he's the one always affected --            MR. KNEEDLER:  Well --            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- you're sayingpermanency -- permanency, repetition, nothing counts,he's just -- loses.            MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  He doesn't lose becausehe has an action under the Administrative Procedure Act.He's not -- the -- the Corps is required to take intoaccount various factors including, specifically, theimpact on other people in the basin when it's making adecision.  If the Corps --            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but he loses becausethe Corps comes in and says, yes, indeed, we did flood2, but, in order to save, you know, 1 and 3 through 10.Right?  And -- and he'd lose.            MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, the Corps cannot bearbitrary in doing that.            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  It's not arbitrary.            MR. KNEEDLER:  But the -- but the Corpsrequires a broad ambit of discretion in managing a riverover time, and it has to be able to change to updatecircumstances without exposing the United States tomassive liability.            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Kneedler, does your51￼ 1   essential argument turn on this being indirect, as you 2   say?  This is consequential; therefore, it isn't -- it 3   doesn't belong in the takings category, anything that's 4   consequential rather than direct? 5               MR. KNEEDLER:  We have two submissions.  I 6   mean, it's the confluence of both factors mentioned in 7   Loretto.  And the Court doesn't have to decide anything 8   broader than that.  It's the temporary nature of the9 decisions.10               These were individual decisions made often11   with a recommendation or concurrence of the ad hoc12   committee.  So it's temporary in nature -- self13   limiting, as everyone knew as part of this ongoing14   planning process -- but, also, particularly in this15   case, where it has only consequential effects16   downstream, which is, again, the way the Court --17   including in Lionel, one of the leading cases -- the18   Court says that this is consequential.19               JUSTICE ALITO:  Why should it make a20   difference whether the court had -- the Corps has a plan21   which says, we're going to release this water every22   summer, and a situation where, year after year after23   year, somebody makes an ad hoc decision in the summer24   that we're going to release the water?25               MR. KNEEDLER:  I don't think analytically,52￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9for the reasons I said about -- about the downstream;but, to the extent the Court is focusing on temporary,these were self-limiting, and there was no guaranteethey were going to be renewed.            And, in fact, at the end of this process,the court -- or the Corps decided not to adopt apermanent change after going through the NEPA process.            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,Mr. Kneedler.            Mr. Goodhart, you have four minutes1011   remaining.1213141516171819202122232425         REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES F. GOODHART              ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER            MR. GOODHART:  Thank you.            As -- as my friend has said about thesedamages being consequential and just affecting trees andnot -- not the land, the -- the court did not find thatthis was just consequential downstream damage; that thiswas direct, natural, and probable from these releasesthat the commission had protested and complained aboutfor years.            That -- that that's in the record, that theyknew that they were using this land to store this water.And the commission could not get their attention to stopit until our director -- it was on Valentine's Day in53￼ 1   2001 -- brought the appraisal to the Corps of Engineers' 2   office, a whole roomful of people from both sides, and 3   placed that report from -- from 2000, that said, over $4 4   million worth of valuable timber is gone, please stop. 5   We -- we were -- we were pleading.  So they knew. 6               And I think the Court of Federal Claims 7   found that they -- they had the understanding that they 8   were using this to accommodate the farmers who were 9   using marginally low property, that the U.S. Fish and10   Wildlife Service says in the record probably should have11   been cleared anyway, but they were wanting to provide12   and adjust the benefits for those landowners and use the13   commission's property to store the water.14               And, Your Honor, I don't know, Justice15   Kennedy, where the line should be drawn, but the cases16   of Sponenbarger and Bedford and Sanguinetti say that17   when it's not the United States' structure or it's not18   the policy -- and the landowner cannot show that, that19   it's from storms or from something in nature -- that's20   not going to incur liability.  Even negligence may not21   incur liability unless it's direct that what -- how it22   caused, and then substantial intrusion.23               And, Your Honor, I think --24               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is the baseline -- go25   back to Justice Kennedy's question -- is it before the54￼ 1   dam or after the dam, and why is it one or the other? 2               If flooding was going to occur more 3   unpredictably before the dam, and possibly summer 4   flooding of this kind could have happened, do you lose? 5               MR. GOODHART:  Your Honor, under that -- 6   under those facts, if it could have happened and the 7   landowner knew that, and that that is -- that is a 8   cause, not the United States, if -- if the United States 9   takes away its flood protection and this land goes back10   to what it would be naturally, then the landowner can't11   prove that it's direct from the United States.  The12   landowner would not recover in that instance.13               In this situation, the evidence --14               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Even though after the15   dam and the dam's plan was to ensure that it didn't16   happen, you would still lose?  If natural conditions --17               MR. GOODHART:  Your Honor --18               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- would have possibly19   caused this, you would lose?20               MR. GOODHART:  If -- if it's not21   super-induced invasions directly from the United States,22   the landowner is going to have that as a natural23   condition.  Here, that was certainly not the case.24   Summertime flooding of this type never happened in25   the recorded history.55￼ 1               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Pre-dam.  In the 2   recorded history. 3               MR. GOODHART:  In the pre-dam or during the 4   whole first 40 years of how this was operated. 5               It was when it was adjusted that the United 6   States used this land and then took the valuable timber. 7               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm not sure that's not 8   open to dispute.  There is some argument here that 9   rainfall that was naturally occurring contributed to10   what was happening to the trees.11               MR. GOODHART:  And I --12               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I think that there is --13   at least that's what I understood some of the factual14   argument to be.15               MR. GOODHART:  No, Your Honor.  I think the16   record is clear that this was directed naturally,17   probably without the -- without the interference or18   addition of nature.19               Thank you, Your Honor.20
