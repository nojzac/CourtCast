PHILLIPS               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Justice Stevens, andmay it please the Court:          At issue in this case is the safety of policeofficers when they attempt to execute a search warrant inan inherently unsafe situation.          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  May I ask one preliminaryquestion, Mr. Phillips?  Do we have before us here anyquestion at all about qualified immunity?MR. PHILLIPS: Well, we do believe that a qualified immunity issue is bound up with the underlying merits. It was addressed that way by the Ninth Circuit because --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But it wasn't -- it wasn't in the questions --MR. PHILLIPS: This Court --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- on which we granted cert? MR. PHILLIPS: This Court in Procunier treatedthe qualified immunity issue as part and parcel of the 31111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 underlying merits of the case and -- and, in fact, skipped2 over the question of what 1983 meant in order to address3 the qualified immunity issue. And presumably --4 JUSTICE BREYER: How -- how --5 MR. PHILLIPS: -- the Court could do the same6 thing here.7 JUSTICE BREYER: How do we do it? It goes right8 to the heart of this from you, the qualified immunity9 thing, for the reason that if you look at the facts and10 circumstances, it sounds to me like a somewhat close11 question as to whether the police did or did not exceed12 the reasonable bounds -- reasonable bounds.13 Now, if it's a close question, you have a jury14 verdict against you, and -- and then I think, well, yes,15 but I begin to come -- become disturbed if I think of16 qualified immunity. I mean, it isn't that clear. So --17 so having read through the thing, I -- I preliminarily18 start by thinking, well, it could have been excessive19 force, I mean, given -- you know, I'm using that in20 quotes.212223 to say it 2425MR. PHILLIPS: Right.JUSTICE BREYER: The jury said it was. Who am I wasn't --MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, this -- this -- JUSTICE BREYER: -- in that situation? But41111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425qualified immunity.  So now, what do I do?          MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, in the first instance, it'sreasonably clear to me that you're not bound by the jury's determination here. This Court has already --JUSTICE O'CONNOR: We -- don't we have to give any weight at all to the jury finding there or --          MR. PHILLIPS:  With respect to the historicalfacts of the case, who did what to whom, of course, youhave -- that -- that's subject to clearly erroneousreview.  On the issue of whether or not the conduct atissue leastthe --here is reasonable, that's an issue of law or ata mixed issue of fact --    JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, a lot of it may depend on          MR. PHILLIPS:  -- and law that this Court hasdecided as de novo.          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- on the music as tohandcuffing and what did they say and what was theatmosphere and what was the garage really like and howrisky was it that there be gang members in the outhousesand -- and all kinds of stuff that you might sense fromthe testimony.MR. PHILLIPS: It -- it seems to me that -- Justice Breyer, that the answer to all of those questions go to the core of what it means to exercise unquestioned51111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 command of the situation, which is a pure legal standard2 that this Court adopted a quarter of a century ago in3 Michigan v. Summers. And that's a question of law.4 To be sure, there are lots of elements of it,5 but what my position would be -- and obviously the6 officers' position in this case -- is that in exercising7 unquestioned command, you can accept all of the facts as8 you've just described them and none of that is excessive9 because it doesn't expose anyone to anything other than10 what is necessary in order to achieve complete control11 under the circumstances in order to ensure the protection12 of the individual officers and -- and candidly of the13 other individuals who were being -- being detained, all14 four of them, under these circumstances.15 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Have you responded to my16 initial question? Have you said all you want to say about17 qualified immunity?18 MR. PHILLIPS: No, Justice O'Connor. My -- my19 basic answer to that is that this Court already addressed20 that issue in Procunier. It considered that the qualified21 immunity issue was part and parcel of the issue, even22 though it hadn't been presented in the question presented,23 and indeed, I think in this case it's actually a -- a24 stronger argument that qualified immunity is in this case25 because that is the way that the Ninth Circuit61111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 specifically addressed the issue. It looked at under2 Saucier. It evaluated whether or not qualified immunity3 was appropriate and -- and did the two-part test, the4 first part being whether it was a constitutional violation5 and the second part whether or not it was reasonable under6 these particular circumstances.7 So if I -- if I cannot persuade you that this is8 constitutional, which obviously I -- I hope I can do, it9 seems to me absolutely unquestioned that there -- that10 what the officers did here under these circumstances were11 perfectly reasonable.12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what is the -- what is13 the function of a jury in this case? What does the jury14 verdict stand for? And the jury doesn't return a special15 verdict and says we find X, Y, and Z. It finds whether16 the police exercised excessive force, and that's all we17 know from the jury verdict.18 Other -- I think what you're saying is that19 these cases should go off on summary judgment or even a20 demurrer. You assume all the facts as the plaintiff21 alleges them and then the Court decides whether that adds22 up to unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth23 Amendment.24 MR. PHILLIPS: I -- I'm not saying that that25 would be true in all cases. I do think in this particular71111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425case you did not need to have a jury verdict. We would have been prepared to stipulate to the facts as they were found ultimately and -- and giving the benefit of all of the inferences to the --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We don't know the fact --what facts were found because all we have is in the juryverdict that this was excessive force.  Period.  That'sall.MR. PHILLIPS: But that's just a conclusion of law, Justice Ginsburg. So the -- the facts that you know are the facts as they're described --JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's like was --MR. PHILLIPS: -- by the respondent's brief. JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the defendant negligent.Is that more or less a conclusion of law?  We don't knowin what respect from the jury verdict.  And here, werethese police officers acting -- did they use excessiveforce.MR. PHILLIPS: Well, we know precisely what they did. They kept her in handcuffs throughout the duration of the -- of the search. We know that. There's no -- there are no additional claims as to having mistreated her physically.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Wasn't there a fact issue asto whether she was handcuffed for -- even for a short81111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 period after the search had been completed?2 MR. PHILLIPS: I don't think there is a factual3 question like that because I don't think that question was4 presented to the jury, and it was certainly not the basis5 on which the Ninth Circuit affirmed the jury's verdict in6 this case. There -- there was never an argument made to7 the jury that this -- that this extended beyond the -- the8 period of the end of the search. The argument that was9 made to the jury was that the search should have -- should10 have been limited to the room where the suspect was -- was11 a resident or that the police should have made a decision12 somewhere in the -- before the end of the 2-hour search13 that she was no longer a threat to them. And then they14 were arguing that -- that it even went a little further in15 terms of the timing of it. But they never asked the jury16 to find that that 15 minutes was the basis for a Fourth17 Amendment violation in its own right.18 JUSTICE STEVENS: But if -- but if it made a19 difference as a matter of law, what -- what should we20 assume about that extra 15 minutes? Do we assume that21 they found the facts in the way that the -- a plaintiff22 argues them or that you think they are?23 MR. PHILLIPS: I think if the jury had been24 asked to make that finding, that you -- and -- and the25 jury determined that there -- that it was unreasonable,91111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 then I think you'd have to conclude that the 15 minutes2 were, in fact -- that it did, in fact, go beyond 153 minutes. I do think there is still a legal issue as to4 whether that's de minimis under the circumstances.5 But -- but I agree. I mean, obviously there is6 a role for the jury's findings, and you have to give them7 a certain amount of respect. But on the core questions of8 reasonableness and suspicion and whether or not the police9 exercised unquestioned command and what those terms mean,10 this Court has already decided that in the Fourth11 Amendment context it has to decide those issues as a12 matter of law to regulate the conduct of all police13 officers and not simply do it on the basis of whatever a14 particular jury would say in a particular circumstance.15 JUSTICE SOUTER: Now, in doing it as a matter of16 law here, should we give consideration to the fact that in17 this case, if -- if I remember correctly, one of the18 officers testified that had they followed normal protocol,19 once they20 building,2122 actually. 2324 25had, I think his phrase was, secured thethe -- the main building --MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the -- all of the groundsJUSTICE SOUTER: Is that the whole compound? MR. PHILLIPS: Yes.JUSTICE SOUTER: That -- that they would have --101111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 they would have taken off the immediate restraints, and he2 wasn't sure why they didn't. We -- do we -- do we3 consider that when we're crafting our statement of law as4 -- as to what is or is not excessive?56 determine7 operating8 certainly9 That -- IMR. PHILLIPS:  I think if this Court couldthat, as a matter of course, the -- the standardprocedures in a particular way, that mightinform the Court's Fourth Amendment analysis.think what's important to keep in mind in this10 context, though, Justice Souter, is we're talking about11 four individuals who are being detained under these12 circumstances, and each of them poses a distinct issue for13 the police officers under the -- under -- when trying to14 decide how best to proceed. One of them had been found15 with marijuana in his possession. One of them had been16 determined to be an illegal alien, and the other two were17 individuals about whom the police knew virtually nothing.18 So, you know, is it possible that police19 procedure, generally speaking, when you're talking about a20 single occupant of the residence, oftentimes concludes21 that he can take away -- you can remove the handcuffs?22 That may be, although I don't think there's much in the23 record here to -- to reflect that.24 But what the police said here -- and I think25 it's extraordinarily important. Officer Muehler testified111111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 that if something had gone wrong, if either a police2 officer had been injured or one of the occupants of that3 house had been shot or otherwise harmed as a -- in the4 context of executing the search warrant, the first5 question that would have been asked is what was the least6 that could have been done to prevent those injuries from7 occurring. And he said to himself and he said it quite8 rightly -- and it's a rule this Court ought to embrace9 under the unquestioned command theory of -- of law -- is10 that if we keep them in handcuffs through the duration of11 a reasonable search, we will make our way through the12 search much more rapidly, much more efficiently in order13 to minimize the detention and we will eliminate -- and I14 mean, literally eliminate -- the entirety of the risk15 either to the individuals themselves, the occupants, the16 detainees, or to the police under these circumstances.17 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. I take it you obviously18 don't want us to -- to come down with a kind of a finicky19 version of -- of excessive force as the touchstone, and I20 take it you don't want us to come down with simply a21 blanket rule saying that essentially the police can do22 anything in -- in restraining occupants so long as it is23 not wantonly cruel. Somewhere in between. Do you have a24 -- a statement that would be the kernel of the holding25 that you want?121111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. PHILLIPS: I'm -- I'm quite comfortable with2 the way the Court analyzed it in Michigan v. Summers, that3 the officer is not required to evaluate the extent of the4 intrusion to be imposed by the seizure. That is, you --5 you have a categorical rule that allows you, in the6 ordinary course, to do whatever is reasonably necessary in7 order to --8 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in the facts there, there9 were no handcuffs. He -- he was just detained. So --10 MR. PHILLIPS: I understand that, and -- but my11 -- my position is that handcuffs don't materially affect12 the detention under these circumstances other than to13 assure what the Court said, which is unquestioned command14 of the situation.15 JUSTICE SOUTER: So -- I mean, I don't -- would16 -- would you say handcuffs are per se lawful for -- for17 purposes of applying Summers?18 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, but it's important to put19 that in context because Summers is a narrow exception to20 the -- not an exception. It's a narrow circumstance under21 the Fourth Amendment. You have to have a search warrant.22 It has to be a validly issued search warrant so that we23 know that there has either been a crime that's likely to24 be taking place in the premises. It only -- it only25 extends to the residents, occupants of the house, and it's 131111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 only when the search is for contraband, not just for any2 evidence. So, for instance, when the police go the 60th3 time to Michael Jackson's estate to go try to find4 evidence of whatever is going on there, I don't think it's5 reasonable to go in and handcuff Michael Jackson and6 anybody else who happens to be on site.7 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it doesn't -- why is8 contraband magical? Wouldn't -- wouldn't your point be9 when -- when the reason they're investigating gives cause10 to believe that there may be physical danger --11 MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Scalia --12 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- from letting people wander13 around?14 MR. PHILLIPS: -- absolutely.15 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is the case with16 contraband, but would be the case for many other reasons17 as well.18 MR. PHILLIPS: I think the important point here19 is that we're talking about guns. These are gangs. These20 are guns.21 dangerous22 likely to23 This is a circumstance that is inherently morethan any other circumstance the police areconfront.JUSTICE BREYER:  But would you be happy then24 with a holding that says just what you said? We reaffirm25 Summers and -- but Summers said special circumstances or141111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 possibly a prolonged detention might lead to a different2 conclusion in an unusual case.3 And the only verdict part that I think we're4 concerned with here -- it was not about four people. It5 was one person, Iris Mena, and in respect to Iris Mena,6 the jury found that there was a violation of her -- of her7 Fourth Amendment rights. And as to her, you could have8 found -- you said -- I don't know if you misspoke. You9 said it could be more than 15 minutes. In looking at it,10 I was certain whether they kept her for 15 minutes more or11 more than 15 minutes more, maybe up to an hour more beyond12 the time that the search ended and kept her in handcuffs,13 both after the time they had secured the place and also14 after the15 basis for1617 basis for18 issue of whether or not they were detained --19 JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. -- Mr. -- but may I20 point out that the judge's instructions did put that issue21 to the jury at page 203. A police officer is required to22 release an individual detained in connection with a lawful23 search as soon as the officer's right to conduct thetime the search ended.  Well, that would seem athe jury's verdict and consistent with Summers.MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, it -- it could have been athe jury's verdict if they had, in fact, put the24 search ends or the search itself is concluded, whichever25 is sooner.151111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. That -- I understand2 that, Justice Stevens, but the point we made in our reply3 brief is there's not a shred of evidence in this record4 and it was never argued to the jury that this search --5 that -- that her detention lasted beyond the period of the6 search in this case. Indeed, counsel for the police7 officers specifically said in his closing argument, there8 is no issue but that she was released at the time of the9 -- that when -- as soon as the search was -- was ended,10 the -- the warrant was executed.11 JUSTICE STEVENS: I wonder why the judge gave12 this instruction then.1314 well, you 1516 there was17 But the two questions, question 5 and question 6, on page18 255 of the joint appendix --19 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes.20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: One question concerns whether21 the force was excessive, and the other one is, do you find22 that she was detained for a longer period than reasonable?23 Those two questions -- my first is a procedural24 question. Did counsel for the defendants object to the25 jury getting -- those two questions being submitted to the161111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MR. PHILLIPS: Because -- because what he's -- know, it's a reasonable instruction.JUSTICE GINSBURG: And why -- why there was --a special verdict of sorts, not a detailed one.￼1 jury?2 MR. PHILLIPS: No, Justice Ginsburg. We didn't.3 And -- and --4 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it seems to me that the5 judge is asking the jury in these questions, one is6 whether there was a -- a detention, was force greater than7 was reasonable under the circumstances, and whether the8 duration was longer than reasonable under the9 circumstances.10 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Justice Ginsburg, you11 have to put that in context. The argument of the12 plaintiff in this case was that the detention should have13 ended at either of two points: after they had completely14 cleared the area and made it safe, or alternatively, at15 some point after that when they had asked her questions16 and determined that she had no particular involvement with17 Mr. Romero. Their argument was anything after that was18 unreasonable, and that's what the jury certainly found,19 was that that was the reasonable break point.2021 notion of22 matter of23 There was24 beyond the execution of that search warrant. It's very25 important to understand that.Our argument is that's not consistent with theunquestioned command and -- and is wrong as alaw.  And there is no evidence -- no evidence.no testimony that she was kept for a period171111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you're saying that the --2 the mere fact that it -- it went to the jury, even went to3 the jury without your objecting to it, does not mean we4 have to listen to what the jury said. Is that -- is5 that --6 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. If it's wrong as a matter7 of law, that's -- then that's absolutely right. But there8 was no evidence in this case that they kept going. The9 only thing he said was, he -- he didn't remember. That10 was -- the question was put to the police officer. Was11 she kept beyond there? He said he didn't remember. He12 wasn't even the police officer who was involved in it.13 There's not a shred of evidence of that.

SHANMUGAM    ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,front oftime. time.AMICUS CURIAE,MR. SHANMUGAM:SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS Thank you, Justice Stevens, anda search warrant to investigate a 181111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 violent crime, officers may routinely use reasonable2 restraints on detained occupants in order to exercise3 unquestioned command over the situation and to facilitate4 the orderly completion of the search.5 The Ninth Circuit erred in holding that the6 officers' use of handcuffs in this case violated the7 Fourth Amendment.8 Under the standard for excessive force claims9 first articulated by this Court in Graham v. Connor, as10 informed by this Court's decision in Michigan v. Summers,11 the degree of force used here was not excessive. The same12 considerations that justified the detention of the13 occupants in Summers, most notably, the paramount concern14 of ensuring the safety of the officers and the occupants15 themselves, will ordinarily justify the precautionary use16 of handcuffs during the detention.1718 have gone 192021 said that22 the circumstances here were reasonable as a matter of law.23 MR.

And2 it's worth noting,3 summary judgment.4 a matter of law at5 motion was denied.6 Now, we also believe that the jury, quite7 frankly, was given insufficient guidance on the excessive8 force issue, and to turn to the jury instruction cited by9 Justice Stevens at page 203, it's quite clear that the10 jury only received one very general instruction on Summers11 detentions.I think, that the officers did move forThey also orally moved for judgment asthe close of the evidence, and that1213 objection 1415 made that16 presented.

Is that any different from the question as --of was this seizure unreasonable?  If you submit the oneto the jury, you may as well submit the other.MR. SHANMUGAM: Justice Scalia, those facts may be disputed in a particular case. We would submit that they really weren't disputed here, but there may actually be a dispute where the officers would say, yes, we used handcuffs and the --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  So when --          MR. SHANMUGAM:  -- or no we didn't usehandcuffs.          JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- when you know all thosefacts, you're willing to send it to the jury to say, givenall of these facts, it's up to you to decide whetherunreasonable force was used or not.MR. SHANMUGAM: We believe that it is -- JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not a matter of law.MR. SHANMUGAM: -- a mixed question of fact andlaw, and once the historical facts are established, it is essentially --          JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why -- why any more so -- whyany -- any more so than -- than whether it's anunreasonable seizure?221111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we would submit that it is2 no different from the question whether officers had3 probable cause or reasonable suspicion on any given set of4 historical facts which this Court held in Ornelas was a5 question subject to de novo review, over your dissent,6 admittedly. And we believe that the primary rationale for7 the rule in Ornelas also applies here, namely that8 officers do need to have a consistent set of substantive9 guidelines by which they can judge the validity of their10 conduct.11 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are -- are you saying that the12 only basis on -- on which the jury could have ruled for13 the homeowner here, the -- the respondent, is that she was14 handcuffed for too long?15 MR. SHANMUGAM: We believe that that certainly16 is the primary issue that was at stake. And in fact --17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think you have to say18 that. Otherwise, we have to uphold the jury verdict, if19 we can assume that the jury might have thought, well, you20 know, the handcuffs -- the police had a right to do that,21 but she was held too long, she was -- they -- they yelled22 at her, she was taken into a -- a place that was23 uncomfortable. If -- if that's true, then we have to24 sustain the jury verdict.25 MR. SHANMUGAM: I think that the handcuffing was231111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 the key factor at trial, and I think that the best2 evidence of that, quite frankly, is that respondent in her3 proposed instructions referred only to handcuffing in her4 excessive force instruction. Unfortunately, that's not5 part of the joint appendix. It is part of the record.6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. But the instruction7 that was given -- and one was read that's in the briefs --8 it seems to me a -- a perfectly good instruction.9 MR. SHANMUGAM: I think that that's true, but I10 think that the instruction didn't really provide any11 guidance on excessive force specifically. It was really12 an instruction with regard to the reasonableness of the13 detention more generally, rather than with regard to14 excessive force specifically. It was not a Graham v.15 Connor type instruction.16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then it seems to me it17 was the plaintiff's obligation to submit a clarifying18 instruction and to bring this -- the denial of that19 instruction here.20 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, there were objections to21 the instruction below, and all I can say22 an argument could be made -- and perhaps23 make the argument on rebuttal -- that it24 included within the questions presented.25 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't know how you can --241111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005is that perhapsMr. Phillips willis fairly￼1 you can say that the only thing that was before the jury2 was the handcuff when the -- there was evidence that she3 was treated very roughly in -- in the first instance, she4 was woken from her sleep, she wasn't told that they were5 police, she thought they were robbers, and she feared for6 her life. That doesn't drop out of the case and what the7 jury was asked to determine.8 MR. SHANMUGAM: Justice Ginsburg, it was the9 primary issue before the jury, and to be sure, there were10 other issues. I think that the other relevant use of11 force was the initial detention at gunpoint, but -- and12 those -- and I would add that those are the two factors on13 which the Ninth Circuit relied in affirming the jury's14 verdict. Our submission is that both with regard to the15 initial use of force and with regard to the continued use16 of force, the justifications of Graham v. Connor support17 the officers' use of force in both instances.18 JUSTICE STEVENS: But -- but may I just ask19 sort of very basic question? One of the instructions20 reads, a detention may be unreasonable if it -- if it21 unnecessarily painful, degrading, prolonged, or if it22 involves an undue invasion of privacy. Now, are you23 telling us that you think the answer to that question24 question of law that the judge should provide rather than25 the jury?251111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005aisis a￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. SHANMUGAM: Assuming that that instruction is correct -- and that might very well be a valid instruction --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, it was correct.MR. SHANMUGAM: It may very well be a correct instruction --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  All right.MR. SHANMUGAM: -- with regard to a challenge to the manner of the detention itself. In that instance, then the jury does have a certain amount of leeway, but I think even then the teaching of Ornelas --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Then it's not a question oflaw.  The answer to whether it was unnecessarily painful,degrading, prolonged, or involved undue invasion ofprivacy, is that a question of law or a question of factto the jury?MR. SHANMUGAM: It is a mixed question of law and fact, and the jury's job is --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  It's a mixed question?MR. SHANMUGAM: The jury's job is to -- to resolve the underlying factual issues and then --          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, I understand thehistorical fact, but I'm -- I'm questioning you about theconclusions that you draw from the unreasonableness,degrading, and so forth.  Is that partly to be decided by261111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 the jury or entirely by the judge?2 MR. SHANMUGAM: We believe that that actually is3 ultimately a judge issue in the same way that the issue of4 whether or not probable --5 JUSTICE STEVENS: So this instruction should not6 have been given.7 MR. SHANMUGAM: That's correct --8 JUSTICE SOUTER: I thought your position was9 that it -- it may be submitted to the jury, but that it10 may be reviewed as a question of law simply because that's11 the way we are able to set standards for later cases.12 MR. SHANMUGAM: I think that's exactly right,13 and I think that that is the teaching of Ornelas. And it14 may very well be that a more specific instruction should15 have been given so as to make clear that the jury had16 specific issues of historical fact to resolve. But17 ultimately we do believe that it's a question of law in18 the sense that it should be reviewed de novo for precisely19 the reasons given in Ornelas.20 And if I could just say a couple words on the21 substantive issue of excessive force. We believe that in22 cases involving violent crimes, officers should routinely23 be allowed to use handcuffs. In this case, I would just24 add that there were several additional case-specific25 factors that justified the use of handcuffs. In addition271111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 to the fact that this was a violent crime, the officers2 had reason to believe that at least one and possibly two3 members of a violent gang were living at the house. In4 addition, the officers had previously visited the house on5 two occasions to investigate other violent crimes and had6 encountered resistance on at least one of those occasions.7 And our fundamental problem with the Ninth8 Circuit's rule is that it seems to suggest that officers9 in the course of a detention should really stop and10 investigate whether or not each -- each individual that11 they encounter poses a safety threat. And we believe that12 that rule is as unworkable as it is unwise. It would13 effectively divert officers from the primary task at hand14 and could perversely have the effect of prolonging rather15 than expediting the completion of the search. And for16 that reason, we believe that the Ninth Circuit's rule, its17 substantive constitutional rule, was erroneous.18 JUSTICE STEVENS: How long did it take them to19 find out whether the -- these other dangerous people were20 there?212223 afraid of 2425 that they281111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MR. SHANMUGAM:  To find out whether?JUSTICE STEVENS:  Whether the people they werewere -- were on the premises?MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, you know, I don't knowever actually made a -- a determination other￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425than that Mr. Romero was not on the premises.  I thinkthey figured that out once they had actually identifiedeach of the individuals, which was fairly early on in thedetention.          JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you.          Mr. Hoffman.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL L. HOFFMAN                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MR. HOFFMAN:  Justice Stevens, and may it pleasethe Court:          Let me start on the issue of -- that Mr.Phillips said we made up.  Actually we didn't make it up.The claim that Ms. Mena was detained past the time of thesearch was made throughout the case.  If you look atfootnote 3 in the Ninth Circuit opinion in 2000, the issueof the length of the detention was a factual issue thatprecluded summary judgment.  Ms. Mena claimed that thedetention lasted for 2 to 3 hours.  The officers claimedthat it lasted 90 minutes.But more than that, the -- the jury -- the -- the special verdict asked the jury to find whether Ms. Mena had been kept for a longer time than reasonable, and in fact, in the closing argument, it was argued that Ms. Mena had been kept beyond the time that the search ended.And not only is there not any -- not only is 291111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 there evidence in the record, there is overwhelming2 evidence in the record that Ms. Mena was kept for a period3 of time, at least 30 minutes, give or take, and possibly4 as long as an hour. And this is not based on Ms. Mena's5 testimony.6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you find that the -- that7 the -- do you define the end of the search as before they8 started videotaping everything they had done?9 MR. HOFFMAN: Well, they were videotaping during10 the course of the search. But if I can go through the11 facts which might clarify things.12 Officer Muehler, who was the officer in overall13 charge of the -- of the search, testified at trial that14 the search ended at 8:40 a.m. Officer Brill said a little15 bit later than that. He tied -- but there's a second16 video. There are two videos. The second video is from17 8:50 to 8:57. At the time that the second -- the second18 video started at 8:50, Officer Brill testified that the19 search was over. The -- the evidence log -- the last20 entry on the evidence log is 8:45 in terms of evidence21 being logged into the -- into the case.22 Officer Brill testified that Ms. Mena was kept23 for at least 10 or 15 minutes after the end of the second24 video and her handcuffs were not released until she was25 brought back around from the -- the separate converted301111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 garage back into the house and --2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where -- where is that3 testimony?4 MR. HOFFMAN: The testimony -- Officer Brill's5 testimony? Is actually -- they cite joint appendix number6 -- on 75 where he says he doesn't recall. On the next7 page, in joint appendix number 76, he's asked -- they8 continue to ask the question. And isn't it your memory9 that about 10 or 15 minutes after that, Iris Mena was10 released? That would sound consistent. And that's 10 or11 15 minutes after 8:57.12 In addition, Ms. Mena testified that she was13 kept between 2 or 3 hours, and that was actually14 consistent with prior testimony by the videographer15 herself, who testified in deposition and was impeached at16 trial, that it was 2 or 3 hours that the search lasted.17 The -- the point being -- and if you take the18 distance between Officer Muehler's testimony and Officer19 Brill's testimony, Ms. Mena was -- was kept in handcuffs20 at the end of a very long detention in handcuffs, for a21 period of approximately 27 to 33 minutes, if you don't22 even take Ms. Mena's testimony into account.23 And one of the ironies of the case is that24 there's testimony that Mr. Romero, the actual target of25 the case, was released at 8:45 at the time the search311111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425ended. And so while this --JUSTICE GINSBURG: But not from these premises. MR. HOFFMAN: No. But in fact, this was a --the search warrant was for two premises. He was picked up at his mother's house. And in fact, Officer Muehler had -- was -- was to radio the start of both searches, and so there was --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the -- the -- I thoughtthat this poorhouse, or whatever it was called -- that thewarrant covered weapons that were there.weapons.MR. HOFFMAN:  Yes.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That they were looking forMR. HOFFMAN:  They were looking for a gun.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  They were not looking for agun at Romero's mother's house, were they?MR. HOFFMAN: Well, I think the --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did they have a warrant, asearch warrant?MR. HOFFMAN: I think the warrant covered -- I think they were looking for the gun wherever it was found, and -- and the -- I believe the warrant --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, this was a -- this wasa pretty extensive search warrant that they had.MR. HOFFMAN: Yes. 321111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did they have something like that, the same kind of warrant for the --MR. HOFFMAN: Well, it's the same warrant I believe, Your Honor, in terms of -- we don't have -- there's not a lot of information in the record about --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, wasn't -- I thoughtthat this warrant referred to a particular address, aparticular house, not -- not any house where one mightfind Romero.          MR. HOFFMAN:  No, no, no.  It -- it referred tothe two houses, one on Cimmaron.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, was the other house hismother's house?          MR. HOFFMAN:  Yes.  The location number one ishis mother's house, 2646 Cimmaron, and that's -- andOfficer Muehler and this team was in charge of both ofthese searches pursuant to the same warrant.  They hadinformation that -- the reason they did that is that theyhad information that -- that he lived in this poorhouse,that he rented a room from the Menas at the poorhouse, andthat he also visited his -- his mother from time to time.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then that would make it even more curious if the place where the dangerous man was wasn't searched extensively and -- and the mother -- nobody was put in handcuffs, and yet for this -- they knew331111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 pretty soon that Romero wasn't on the premises.2 MR. HOFFMAN: Well, they knew right away.3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. And that's, I guess,4 your -- your point, that the place where the dangerous man5 was is not --6 MR. HOFFMAN: I think that that explains one of7 the reasons why the jury imposed punitive damages here8 because they -- they knew that at 8:45, at the time that9 Officer Muehler said that the search was over and all the10 officers were out of the house and -- and everything was11 done, that Mr. Romero was cited and released for marijuana12 possession. And at the same time, from 8:45 until13 sometime after 9 o'clock, probably as long as 30, maybe14 longer, Iris Mena was sitting in a cold, damp, converted15 garage with her hands behind her back.16 JUSTICE BREYER: You might be able to keep your17 verdict, I -- I think. But I think the problem here is18 the Ninth Circuit -- you go to the Ninth Circuit and you19 say, you know, there was excessive force here on anybody's20 definition for reasons that you say. And -- and the Ninth21 Circuit says, oh, it was a clear violation of the22 Constitution and we'll tell you why, and then they give23 some reasons. And two of those reasons are, A, four and a24 half pages written the reason that this was25 unconstitutional is because they asked her questions about341111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 her immigration status, which you -- I don't think you2 even raised. Maybe you did. But anyway, that's -- that's3 the bulk of the -- of -- of -- that's the bulk of the4 analysis.5 And -- and these are the words that I think6 they're objecting to. And by any standard of7 reasonableness, Mena was -- the -- the officers should8 have released her from the handcuffs when it became clear9 that she posed no immediate threat. And that was long10 before the -- the -- because she wasn't a threat. And11 that was long before the end of the search.12 And what their point is on that is, you know, if13 that's the rule, that's going to interfere with our SWAT14 teams because they can't operate that way. They -- they15 can't evaluate the individual. They put the individual --16 if there are guns and gangs and danger that she'll grab a17 gun, they put her in handcuffs, and they hold her there18 for the search for a couple of hours, then they release19 her. Now, that's their argument.20 So they're objecting not so much to -- to the21 fact they have to pay $30,000 -- or they may object to22 that. But they're -- they're objecting to the holding of23 the Ninth Circuit, and if they're right on that, then I24 guess we have to send it back and say, do this over again,25 though I'll be sorry about that and maybe there is a way351111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425not to do it.          But -- but I want to know your view of what Isee as those two issues here, that the Ninth Circuit'sanalysis was wrong.MR. HOFFMAN: Yes. I mean, first of all, I'd -- I'd say that the -- the Court could affirm the judgment in this case and the verdict in this case on the ground that we --          JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but then we can't reallyreach the issue.  That's a possibility.  I see that.          MR. HOFFMAN:  And in fact -- and I -- I thinkthat would be the appropriate thing to do.JUSTICE BREYER: Well, but then suppose that the reason that this case is here is because of the implications --          MR. HOFFMAN:  Right.          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- of the Ninth Circuit'sanalysis --          MR. HOFFMAN:  Right.          JUSTICE BREYER:  -- not necessarily the extra 30minutes because I see your point on the extra 30 minutes.          MR. HOFFMAN:  I think -- I think that there -- Iwould divide my response to that, Justice Breyer, into twoparts really.  On the questioning issue, I would just saythat that -- that was not an issue that was presented to361111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 the jury for its verdict as a separate Fourth Amendment2 violation. It wasn't. And we didn't argue it in the3 Ninth Circuit.4 What we did -- we did say in our -- in our brief5 to the Ninth Circuit that she was questioned about her6 immigration status about an issue that was unrelated to --7 to Summers detention. We did say that.8 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, we could say is their9 opinion -- that's their opinion. It's beside the point,10 et cetera.11 MR. HOFFMAN: Right. So, I mean, I -- I think12 on questioning, you know, we -- we haven't been pushing13 that issue.14 JUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if two of the reasons15 that the Ninth Circuit gave are in our view incorrect, why16 wouldn't we reverse and remand for them to do it without17 -- to make the judgment without taking those two factors18 into account?19 MR. HOFFMAN: Well, I think what -- first of20 all, it's a separate alternative holding. What they said21 is that there was a separate Fourth Amendment violation22 while they affirmed on the basis that we actually won on.23 The jury found that she had been detained longer than was24 reasonable and with more force than was reasonable. This25 is a jury verdict. The Ninth Circuit affirmed that.371111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 And we've argued in our brief that if the Court2 did something on questioning, it would really be issuing3 an advisory opinion in this -- in this situation. And,4 you know, we've -- we've argued the point and we're5 prepared certainly to argue about the merits of that6 question because it's obviously an important question. In7 our view, the questioning issue should be governed by the8 more traditional Terry kind of idea that you can't9 question when it goes beyond the scope of the limited10 purposes of the intrusion, but we also understand that11 that's contested.12 JUSTICE13 JUSTICE14 JUSTICE15 that --KENNEDY:  Well --SCALIA:  I don't --KENNEDY:  -- well, it does seem to me16 JUSTICE17 JUSTICE18 me that the Ninth19 on this key point20 officers should have released her when it became clear she21 posed no immediate threat and did not resist arrest.SCALIA: Excuse me.KENNEDY: It -- it does seem -- seem to Circuit's opinion is questionable on -- of when she had to be released. The22 MR. HOFFMAN: Well --23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think that is critical to24 its holding.25 MR. HOFFMAN: Well --381111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that implies that they2 have a -- a duty at the outset to determine whether --3 what her status is rather than to go around looking for4 guns and -- and to secure the premises. That's -- that's5 one of my concerns with that.6 MR. HOFFMAN: Well, I would have a different7 position on that. First of all, I think that the judgment8 can actually be affirmed on the first ground regardless of9 this issue because it was a -- a jury verdict and -- and10 the damages were asked for either/or in terms of question11 5 or 6.12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the first ground being?13 Just an unreasonably long --14 MR. HOFFMAN: Detained beyond the -- the length15 of the search. And so I think technically the judgment16 can be affirmed on that ground.17 But with respect to the handcuffing, the18 position that we would say is that, first of all, you --19 you would have to view the facts in the light most20 favorable to the verdict. Now, it's been -- there's been21 a lot of questioning about what that means and what the22 jury's role is. As we understand it, if Ornelas applies23 to this decision, which we assume the Court would do --24 and that is, that you would first have to take the light25 -- all the facts in the light most favorable to the391111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 verdict, including the possibility that the -- the jury2 rejected as being incredible the statements that the3 officers made in terms of justification, if there was4 evidence in the record to show that there was5 contradicting evidence, which there is in this record.6 And so the facts that -- that the other side has tried to7 argue are the facts on which you would make that8 constitutional decision are not the facts in the light9 most favorable to the verdict.10 In the light most favorable to the verdict,11 there was -- there was lots of planning. There was a12 tactical plan in writing that the jury got to see, which13 said that the -- the plan here was to go in and make the14 SWAT entry, to see if there were non-suspects there. They15 would be patted down, identified, and released. The jury16 was entitled not to believe the other side's claim that17 they didn't say when they were going to be released and18 believed that the plan was to release them as soon as it19 was ascertained that they did not have the connection in20 -- in the situation. And in fact, there's testimony from21 the officers that they knew that they weren't gang members22 and they knew that they weren't connected to the crime.23 And they were completely cooperative, and they didn't24 resist arrest and they didn't flee. And Iris Mena is 525 foot 1 -- 5 foot 2 inches, and the jury had a videotape of401111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 exactly how they looked.2 The officers had a total plan. They -- they3 exercised their command of the situation from the4 beginning. They cleared it. They made sure it was safe.5 They took people outside through the pouring rain, which6 actually they say there wasn't evidence about that.7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Medium -- medium rain.8 MR. HOFFMAN: Well, actually at -- at joint9 appendix number 183, Officer Allegra, who was one of the10 entry team, said it was pouring. So -- and in fact, the11 stipulation of facts said it was heavy. So Iris Mena was12 being -- was being demure when she talked about that. You13 can even see the rain on the videotape.14 And so they took her outside. They took all of15 them outside. They put them in this little room, which is16 not connected to the house. They had one or two armed17 officers outside. There was no place for them to go.18 They couldn't interfere with the facilitation of the19 search because they were in this room. They couldn't flee20 because there's only one way out, a door. There were two21 armed guards there. And -- and if all they had to do was22 sit these four people, who were not connected to any gang23 activity, as to which they had no suspicion ever developed24 that they had any connection to Mr. Romero, who had25 already been arrested at his mom's house --411111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA: They can't have a flat rule2 that while you're conducting a search, you -- you can3 restrain anybody that you find assuming the search is for4 a crime that -- that involves violence.567 that call 89 that callMR. HOFFMAN: Well, I think that the --JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't want to have to make all the time, you know.MR. HOFFMAN: Well, but -- but officers do make all the time. They make it in the context of10 Terry stops. They make it in the context of lots of11 Fourth Amendment issues.12 In Summers -- in Summers, the man was detained.13 In many of the post-Summers cases, including many cited by14 the other side and the Government, handcuffing is not15 viewed as routine. Handcuffing is viewed as something16 that substantially aggravates the nature of the seizure --17 JUSTICE BREYER: If that's true, is it routine18 in -- I mean, here what sort of pushes the other way on19 this is this is a dangerous gang. They have lots of20 weapons and they have previously gone to this house, which21 I gather -- sometimes when I read it, I think it's like a22 warren of little rooms. On the other hand, maybe it23 isn't. I haven't seen the house. There are a lot of24 buildings around, and they think a lot of people here --25 we don't know who's what, and we make a mistake in this421111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 and we're dead. You know, I mean, so that's painting it2 the other way.3 But where you have guns and -- and houses and4 gangs and so forth, now that's why they say that it's5 reasonable in those circumstances to say, when we find6 someone in the house, we handcuff them through the search.7 We might let them go earlier, but that's up to us and we8 don't want the courts second guessing us on that.9 Now, what's -- what's painting it their way, and10 I'd like you to respond.11 MR. HOFFMAN: I -- I understand that. I guess12 the -- the problem with that is that that means that no13 matter who they find -- and in this case is a good example14 of it. They were worried that they might find the gang15 member who had a gun there, and that's what they were16 looking for. Okay. And so they used the SWAT team. That17 seems perfectly reasonable that they would use a SWAT team18 the way they did. And they went in and within literally 419 or 5 minutes, they had -- this is a tiny, little house.20 They had cleared the house. They had figured out all the21 occupants. They put them in a room completely under their22 control where they couldn't get away from anything. They23 knew there were two 40-year-old people, a young hippie,24 and -- and an 18-year-old girl that was 5 foot --25 JUSTICE BREYER: Did they search that room?431111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. HOFFMAN:  Yes.  They searched that room.  Sothe room was searched before they went there.  Theysearched all the rooms.  They searched Ms. Mena's room andfound absolutely nothing there.          And -- and the testimony -- and this goes toJustice Souter's question.JUSTICE SOUTER: Did they -- did they search the individuals too to make sure --          MR. HOFFMAN:  Yes.          JUSTICE SOUTER:  I assume they did.          MR. HOFFMAN:  Oh, yes.  They -- they searchedthe individuals. They -- they -- you know, they completely made sure that -- that when they put them in that back room, there was nothing in the room. There was nothing on the individuals. There was nothing that -- that could cause them danger.And -- and the jury, I think, was entitled to -- to look at those facts and -- and to hear the facts and to see the facts --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  How did the qualifiedimmunity question get resolved here?MR. HOFFMAN: Well, the --          JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  And what -- what role didthat play in all of this?MR. HOFFMAN: Well, at the -- at the district 441111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 court level, the -- the district court heard a rule 59.2 But one of the things about this case is it was tried3 right around the time that Saucier v. Katz came out, and4 in the Ninth Circuit, there was a question about who got5 to decide qualified immunity. This was June 20016 actually. And so there was a rule 59 motion about whether7 the proper standard of qualified immunity had been8 applied.9 The district judge, looking at the facts, found10 that there were facts to sustain the verdict, including11 evidence that Ms. Mena had been kept after the end of the12 search. The district judge found that. And then in -- in13 the Ninth Circuit, of course, the Ninth Circuit's14 published opinion deals with qualified immunity on both of15 these issues.16 And basically the -- the qualified immunity --17 on the -- on the over-detention claim, I think they've18 conceded that there just isn't any justification for -- I19 mean, a de minimis exception doesn't extend to 30 minutes.20 I mean, that -- this Court has debated whether 15 or 20 is21 too long on a -- on a Terry stop when there's actually22 reasonable suspicion. Here, there's nothing to hold her.23 With respect to the24 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is25 MR. HOFFMAN: Well,451111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005handcuffing issue --it clear that it was 30?I think in viewing the light￼1 most favorable to the verdict, I think the Court has to2 assume that -- that the jury could have found an hour.3 But what I'm saying is based on the officer's own4 testimony alone, viewed in the light most favorable to the5 verdict, it's at least 27 to 32. And so you've got6 something that just could not possibly be considered de7 minimis under any kind of exception.8 And -- and that's why they fought it on the9 facts. They haven't even made an argument on the law at10 any point in this.11 And with respect to handcuffing, I think our12 position on the handcuffing is that Summers, first of all,13 doesn't deal with handcuffing. And the other side has14 consistently tried to equate detention with restraint.15 And I think what -- what Summers indicated was that this16 Court was willing to allow people to be detained during17 the course of a search for three specific reasons. And18 when balancing the nature of the intrusion against the19 justifications, this Court specifically said it was20 endorsing21 very much2223 point that it's not clearly established at least?24 MR. HOFFMAN: Well, no. I -- I don't think that25 is the case, Justice Kennedy, because in -- in -- Summersa limited intrusion, and that it wouldn't be different asking someone to sit around -- JUSTICE KENNEDY: Doesn't that just go to the461111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 doesn't authorize what they did. Graham certainly talks2 about having to justify force based on a -- on a Fourth3 Amendment analysis. And Franklin v. Foxworth, which is a4 Ninth Circuit case that happened before this case, the5 Court, first of all, used the -- the analysis that we have6 argued is appropriate based on Summers and Graham to7 decide that a particular Summers detention was carried out8 in an unreasonable manner.9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that was ill10 individual, a single individual --11 MR. HOFFMAN: Well --12 JUSTICE KENNEDY: --13 MR. HOFFMAN: No. I14 facts were more egregious, but15 for a reasonable officer from a qualified immunity16 standpoint -- for a reasonable officer reading that17 opinion, you draw at least three conclusions I think. One18 is that the proper analysis to determine whether19 handcuffing or some additional form of restraint is -- is20 allowed has to be decided under the kinds of21 justifications that Summers provides and under a Graham22 analysis when it comes to force. And there's lots of23 cases that -- that allow officers to do that. Lots of24 lower court cases. In fact, our view is all the lower25 court cases follow that kind of analysis and just come out471111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005unclothed, et cetera ---- I understand that the the -- the Court's analysis￼1 differently depending on the facts and circumstances2 confronted.3 The second thing, the -- the point about the4 disabled person and the particular facts made that case5 particularly egregious, and the Ninth Circuit said those6 were additional factors, not the line. The Ninth Circuit7 didn't say that the constitutional standard was8 particularly abusive or egregious. It9 traditional Fourth Amendment analysis.10 And finally and I think very11 dealt with maybe in the briefs as much12 that the Ninth Circuit in -- in Franklin rejected a13 blanket handcuffing policy. That's what the policy was in14 Portland. The Portland police department had a policy15 that said you are to handcuff everybody until the search16 is over. And the Ninth Circuit said you can't have that17 kind of policy because Summers and -- and Graham require18 it to be individualized justification for that -- for an19 additional intrusion beyond the limited intrusion that's20 allowed in Summers.21 And in fact, in Summers, the Court went out of22 its way to say to compare with what the Court was allowing23 to what it -- to -- to the circumstances in Dunaway, to --24 to circumstances that start to look like an arrest. And I25 don't know how much more intrusive you could be than what481111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005-- it appliedimportant and notas it should be is￼1 these officers did to Iris Mena, and I think that's one of2 the -- the issues here. If -- if the --3 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And what do we do if we think4 the Ninth Circuit was off base in -- in whether Mena could5 be questioned about her immigration status?678 important 9MR. HOFFMAN: Well, I -- I think that -- JUSTICE O'CONNOR: That seemed to be anpart of the Ninth Circuit's rule.MR. HOFFMAN: Well, it's certainly -- it'san alternative ground. It's not -- it doesn't think, our verdict. And so I think what -- I10 certainly11 affect, I12 mean, I suppose the Court could dismiss that question as13 improvidently granted, could say to the court that it --14 that it should reverse that part of the ruling.15 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: It might be useful to say16 they were wrong in --17 MR. HOFFMAN: Well, that -- you -- you could say18 that. I mean, I would -- on the merits of the question, I19 -- I would like to -- if we were reaching that, I would20 argue that the Ninth Circuit -- that -- that there is --21 there should be a limit on questioning in a -- in a22 Summers detention, and the Court should apply the kind of23 Terry analysis that the majority of the -- the circuits24 apply.25JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what will do if we 491111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 thought the Ninth Circuit was egregiously wrong on that2 and that its opinion was, to use the most polite word,3 disingenuous when it talked about a garage? That -- that4 was somewhat off-putting to me when it was a converted5 garage with a bed.6 MR. HOFFMAN: Well, I mean --7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, I -- I thought this8 woman was standing in -- by some grease rack or something9 and she was --10 MR. HOFFMAN: She wasn't standing by a grease11 rack, but she was made to sit initially by an open door12 because the door had basically been obliterated on a very13 cold, rainy February morning where she was very cold, and14 after -- and had been taken through the -- the pouring15 rain in bare feet and with only a T-shirt and was left16 there for at least 20 or so minutes without being given a17 coat or shoes. And she was made to sit by there and she18 was very cold and uncomfortable. And she did complain19 that the handcuffs were too tight and she complained that20 they were 2122 vision of23 -- the jury did look at it because it had a videotape of24 this. You could see that the -- the occupants were made25 to be in a very uncomfortable situation that wasuncomfortable and could they be removed.It's not a garage in -- in the way that theit, but also if you look at it, it's -- and the501111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 unnecessary. And that -- that was clearly established law2 in the Ninth Circuit certainly under Franklin that the3 manner of a search that was unnecessarily prolonged or4 painful or an unnecessary invasion of privacy was clearly5 established law in the Ninth Circuit as of 1994.6 I think in the Heitschmidt case, which is very7 similar in a lot of ways to our case, that came out after8 the search, but applied the same reasoning to a 19949 search. You had the same kind of handcuffing of a non-10 suspect as to whom the -- the officers didn't have that --11 that kind of -- of suspicion. And the Fifth Circuit found12 that that was a violation and denied qualified immunity to13 the officers.14 So from our standpoint, on the issue of being15 detained past the time, I think it's just a clear case. I16 think the other side has conceded that if -- if there's17 this evidence in the record, which there is, the judgment18 has to be affirmed on that basis.19 On -- on the handcuffing issue, we believe the20 same principle has to apply because the facts have to be21 viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, and22 when you view those facts, I -- it -- it is -- no23 reasonable officer would believe you could do those things24 to Ms. Mena in these circumstances based on the law at the25 time.511111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 And I think that it would be -- what the -- what2 the United States and -- and what petitioners' counsel is3 asking for is really for a radical change of law4 themselves. We're happy with Summers and Graham and the5 way that applies, and the -- the jury instruction was6 based on -- on Summers and Graham and on Franklin. The7 language is taken directly from those cases.8 And -- and the -- the jury in a case like this9 -- qualified immunity obviously provides some protection10 for -- for officers that when -- when a reasonable officer11 wouldn't know these things. But jury verdicts also play a12 crucial role in a civil rights case. In this case, a jury13 of our community found that Iris Mena had been subjected14 to an abuse of -- a specific abuse of authority in being15 held beyond the time of -- of the search, even at a time16 when the prime target was -- was free to go about his17 business with a citation, and was held in these painful18 handcuffs for a period of over 2 hours in circumstances19 where, in the totality of the circumstances, she was20 treated much more harshly than anything this Court, I21 think, contemplated in the Summers case.22 And I think that officers know how to --23 officers know how to handle the Fourth Amendment issues24 involved in this case. They don't need a special rule25 because that rule would end up meaning that when you go in521111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 and you don't find what you're afraid of, that everybody2 is still going to be subjected to this kind of serious3 intrusion on their individual liberty. And so we would4 urge the Court not to go down this new path that the5 United States and the petitioners are asking and to affirm6 the judgment because it was based on clearly established7 principles that this Court and other courts around the8 country have -- have established.9 Thank you very much.10 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Hoffman.11 Mr. Phillips, you have about 3 and a half12 minutes.13 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS14 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS15 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Justice Stevens.16 I want to start with essentially the question17 that Justices Breyer and Kennedy raised, which is what do18 you do when you know that the Ninth Circuit is wrong, that19 the questioning here violated the Fourth Amendment, and20 what do you do when you know that the Ninth Circuit was21 wrong in saying that the officers have an affirmative duty22 in the middle of a Summers detention to make an assessment23 on an individualized basis as to the risks posed by any24 individual detainee. Those are rulings that I submit to25 you are plainly erroneous and warrant reversal on that531111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 basis alone.2 At that stage, if the respondent wants to argue3 to the Ninth Circuit that that 15 minutes is, in fact,4 proved by the facts of this case, that's fine, but5 understand, those issues were put to the Ninth Circuit,6 and the Ninth Circuit did not affirm on the alternative7 ground that there were 15 minutes here. The Ninth Circuit8 expressly never -- or didn't expressly but never said one9 word about a period of time after the search ended in this10 particular case, and that's not an accident because there11 is no testimony. The officer said he didn't remember and12 when asked, well, would 10 to 15 minutes be consistent13 with your memory, well, of course, it would. He didn't14 remember anything. So there's nothing in that evidence,15 and there's no way -- I have looked at that tape. I ask16 you to look at that tape. I guarantee you there's no way17 you can draw any inference as to at what point in this18 process she was released vis-a-vis the end of this19 particular -- this particular search being executed.20 JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so do we have the tape21 here?22 MR. PHILLIPS: I assume you have the tape. It's23 part of the record. It should be in the clerk's office.24 If you don't have it, I'd be more than happy to send you a25 copy.541111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425The --          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there was no -- there wasno objection to that question going to the jury, was theduration unreasonable.MR. PHILLIPS: Of course not, Justice Ginsburg, because the issue before the jury was whether or not the -- we had an affirmative duty to make an evaluation in the middle of the search as to whether or not she posed a -- a threat. That was --JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the jury --          MR. PHILLIPS:  -- their theory of the case, andthat's what the Ninth Circuit said, is yes, we do havethat affirmative obligation.JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the jury answered the -- just the general question, was the duration unreasonable, and the jury said yes.          MR. PHILLIPS:  Not of the search.  Of herdetention.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.          MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, of her detention.  And thatwas based on the jury's determination that we had detainedher beyond the period we had done the sweep.          JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So if the district court gotit right and the Ninth Circuit wrote a poor opinion, whyshould we upset the judgment in the case?  In other words,551111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 if what we had here was a trial that was okay, a district2 judge that behaved -- gave a proper charge, then the Ninth3 Circuit writes an opinion that doesn't seem to deal with4 what the district court and the jury decided.5 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the -- the court of6 appeals' obligation here was to evaluate our argument that7 we should -- we were entitled to judgment as a matter of8 law. The court of appeals put forth what it regarded as9 the most legitimate bases on which to affirm the judgment10 in this case. The fact that neither of those withstand11 serious scrutiny, Justice Ginsburg, seems to me to be a12 basis for13 matter to1415 in -- you16 de novo review. Punitive damages, exactly like a punitive17 damages cases. Juries make punitive damagesreversing the Ninth Circuit and allowing thego back at this point.And -- and that is exactly what this Court doesknow, said it will do in Ornelas, that it is a18 determinations every day and every day courts of appeals19 and trial judges review those damages awards de novo20 because they -- because the question is not just what are21 the historical facts -- that you give deference to the22 jury on -- but on the fundamental question of what is the23 rule of law that will govern the police officers in the24 execution of search warrants in circumstances like this.25 They need protection, Your Honor.561111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112131415161718192021222324251111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400Thank you.JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Mr. Phillips.The case is submitted.(Whereupon, at 12:06 p.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)57 1-Washington, DC 20005
