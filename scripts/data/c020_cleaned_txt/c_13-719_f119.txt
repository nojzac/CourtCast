Owens.      Mr. Berreth.     ORAL ARGUMENT OF NOWELL D. BERRETHON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. BERRETH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      In Section 1446(a) Congress established apleading standard for the notice of removal, not ademand for proof.  The plain language in Section 1446(a)tells us this.  The plain language of Section 1446(a)provides that a notice of removal shall contain a shortand plain statement of the grounds for removal.      And that mirrors language that has been usedin Rule 8 for more than 80 years and that has never beenheld to require evidence with the complaint.JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, how do we know that the reason the court of appeals did ­­ did not ­­ or sustained the refusal to take it, how do we know that the reason was that they disagree with you on what the standard ­­ what the court of appeals' reason was? How can we ­­3￼￼1 MR. BERRETH: Well, we know that the court2 of appeals let stand a district court decision.3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right, and so your ­­4 your ­­ your job is to argue that that was an abuse of5 discretion, because the statute says that they may,6 right? They may take it­­7 MR. BERRETH: Well, an abuse of8 discretion ­­ an abuse of discretion is not necessary to9 be shown here. It can be shown here, because what the10 circuit court did here was let stand a decision that did11 many things.12 And it's an unusual situation in the law,13 Justice Scalia. It let stand a decision of the district14 court that flouted the plain language of the statute.15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it always an abuse of16 discretion for the court of appeals to let an erroneous17 decision stand?18 MR. BERRETH: Not necessarily always. In a19 case like this, however, when the decision that was20 let ­­ let to stand flouted the plain language of the21 statute, is a situation where if it's not corrected by22 this Court, it may never be corrected. And what the ­­23 the problem that will never be corrected is this lack of24 uniformity among the circuits on a matter that's so25 clearly established by Congress.4￼1 Congress does not require there to be2 evidence in a notice of removal. And defendants in3 Florida or defendants in California don't have to4 include evidence within 30 days in their notice of5 removal. Defendants in the six States at issue in this6 case do. They are treated differently.7 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that seems a little8 extreme to say it may never be corrected. I mean, this9 was a decision that was made by eight judges. There are10 now twelve judges. Maybe the additional four will make11 a difference. Maybe even those eight will think twice12 about it the next time around. I mean, in fact we just13 don't know, right, because we don't know why they acted14 the way they acted.15 It might have been because they thought that16 the district court's decision was right, or it might17 have been because they thought it ­­ that ­­ that18 question is better ­­ was better decided in some other19 context, or it might be because they were just feeling20 too busy that day.21 And ­­ and an abuse of discretion standard22 would go, you know, to the ­­ just the decision whether23 to take it, not knowing what that decision was based on.24 MR. BERRETH: Well, Justice Kagan, in this25 situation, given what the Tenth Circuit has done and5￼1 given that the case has made it this far, as Judge Hartz2 pointed out in his dissent below, it's highly unlikely3 that a situation like this would arise again. It's ­­4 it takes an unusual confluence of circumstances to have5 a case get here in the first place.6 But now that we are here, lawyers in the7 Tenth Circuit are more unlikely than ever to ­­ to allow8 this problem to happen in the future, to allow this9 to ­­ to re ­­ recur.10 And so that is a main part of why this is an11 unusual situation. It's not a garden variety decision12 by the court of appeals that we are faced with.13 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not sure you're14 joining issue with the question Justice Kagan asked. Do15 we really not know why the Tenth Circuit did what it did16 in this case?17 MR. BERRETH: Well, the Tenth Circuit did18 not explain the reasons for its decision.19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the dissenters20 in the case thought ­­ explain why they thought it was21 wrong. Don't you think if the Tenth Circuit relied on a22 different reason they would have said so?23 MR. BERRETH: Well, they may have, they may24 not have. They're not required to. But they're not25 allowed to insulate their decisions from review simply6￼1 by ­­ by not explaining them, especially in a situation2 like this involving the unusual situation and involving3 a circuit that ­­ that is ­­ that is wayward, a circuit4 that is not applying the plain language of Section5 1446(a).6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I mean, I'm not sure7 what ­­8 JUSTICE ALITO: Go ahead. Has there been9 any suggestion at any point in this case ­­ in the10 district court, in the court of appeals, in the papers11 that have been filed here ­­ that the decision was based12 on anything other than the reasoning of the district13 court? Any other reason been given?14 MR. BERRETH: There has not been another15 reason that's been given, and the reason that the16 district court gave was clearly erroneous. The district17 court clearly thought that she was constrained to ignore18 evidence that all parties agreed is sufficient to19 establish removal of jurisdiction in this case.20 This is a case where there's no dispute21 about whether all of the elements necessary for Federal22 court jurisdiction exist. The only impediment to23 Federal jurisdiction right now is that the district24 court felt constrained to ignore that evidence solely25 because of ­­ of a timing restriction that is not found7￼1 in the plain language of the statute. And when ­­2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm ­­ I'm wondering in3 some later case, could attorneys who want to remove4 within the 30­day period seek mandate from the Tenth5 Circuit to mandate the judge not to require the6 evidence?7 MR. BERRETH: Well, they could ­­ I suppose8 they could try something like that. I think that9 they're not required to. Congress has told us that10 they're not required to go to such extreme measures.11 Congress has told us that what defendants are supposed12 to do is, within 30 days of receiving the complaint or13 another paper, either of which would put them on notice14 that ­­ that there is the amount in controversy in play15 here, that they are required to file their notice of16 removal.17 And in the Tenth Circuit, they have to go18 get affidavits. Perhaps the CEO of the company is in19 Hawaii or something. And frequently, lawyers aren't20 even hired for a couple of weeks after a complaint is21 filed.22 And so you can have a situation where, in23 the Tenth Circuit, unlike in other circuits, maybe24 there's only 10 days to go find the CEO to get the25 affidavit that thought – that is thought to be necessary,8￼1 when that requirement simply does not exist in the plain2 language of the statute. And it doesn't exist ­­ it's3 not enforced in any of the other circuits.4 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Berreth, I ­­ I5 apologize for going back to this not merits question,6 but on the question of why the Tenth Circuit did what it7 did, Judge Hartz, who was, of course, dissenting from8 denial, made reference to the fact ­­ and I'm just9 quoting here ­­ that the judges were very busy, and the10 appeal presented a knotty matter that requires a11 decision in short order.12 So even he, who was trying to suggest that13 an appeal should have been taken, was not suggesting14 that the court did what it did because the court agreed15 with the trial court.16 MR. BERRETH: Well, in a case like this17 where all parties agree that there's a case in the court18 of appeals, so that there is jurisdiction under Section19 1254, the Forsyth v. Hammond case confirms that this20 Court has the power, the certiorari power to ­­ to look21 to the whole case, to look to any aspects of the case.22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought Hohn, which23 I think you used as explaining why the case is in the24 court of appeals, but Hohn said the only thing that you25 can review is the COA, certificate of appealability.91 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425You can't use that handle to get to the merits.      So the only question is whether thecertificate was improperly denied and not the merits. MR. BERRETH: Well, Justice Ginsburg, thedifference in that case was that the government concedederror.  Government conceded that the merits question wasnot in dispute.  So this Court didn't need to go aheadand reach the merits.  This Court has reached the meritsin a similar situation in the Nixon v. Fitzgerald case.JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I thought ­­ are you saying that all parties concede that this case is in the court of appeals, both with respect to the proper exercise of the court's jurisdiction in taking the case and as to the merits?MR. BERRETH: That's right. Once the case is in the court of appeals, under Section 1254, Forsyth confirms that this Court has the power to review any aspect of the decision ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I ­­ I think that's contrary to Hohn, as Justice Ginsburg has just indicated.MR. BERRETH: Well, Hohn did not purport to overrule Nixon v. Fitzgerald ­­JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. And one's a COA, and then the other's ­­ is the statute10￼￼1 there. There may be a difference there’s, but I don't2 see the difference.3 MR. BERRETH: Justice Kennedy, this ­­ this4 case presents different issues than were in play in5 Hohn. And a case that presented issues very similar to6 this is Nixon v. Fitzgerald. And in that case, the7 court did both steps. The court took both steps.8 The court, number one, confirmed that it had9 jurisdiction under Section 1254, which exists here; all10 parties agree. And number two, the court in Nixon v.11 Fitzgerald went ahead and addressed the merits question,12 which is what we asked the Court to do in this case,13 because if the Court doesn't go ahead and address the14 merits question in this case, there is a high likelihood15 that the merits question won't be addressed, and that16 we'll have one circuit alone that has this requirement17 out there that flouts congressional intent.18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The reason is that any19 careful lawyer in the Tenth Circuit will ­­ will know20 that we ­­ we'd better put the evidence in the notice of21 removal. So a lawyer is not going to risk failing to do22 that to make ­­ to correct the Tenth Circuit's error.23 MR. BERRETH: That's right. And ­­ and this24 sort of belt and suspenders approach is not what25 Congress tells us defendants have to do.111 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      JUSTICE SCALIA:opinion is not ­­ certainly not circuit law, so I thinkyou exaggerate when you say it establishes bad law forthe circuit.  It just doesn't.MR. BERRETH: Well, the ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: The circuit let the district court decision stand, but that doesn't make the district court decision circuit law.MR. BERRETH: The district court was relying on circuit law in making its decisions.JUSTICE SCALIA: And maybe it was wrong.MR. BERRETH: Well, the circuit law, which started this, the Laughlin case from 1995, is wrong, we would submit. And that is the case that got the Tenth Circuit off on this track.JUSTICE SCALIA: I see. You're just not relying on this case; you're relying on the fact that the district court relied on an earlier case.MR. BERRETH: That's right. This ­­ this so­called Tenth Circuit rule, which came into effect in about 1995, what set this circuit off its ­­ off track, and this is the case that can bring this circuit back on track.      And to ­­ to not require the district courtsto feel constrained as the district court here felt ­­12￼But the district court's￼1 the district court here felt that she was constrained by2 Laughlin and by a couple of other cases in the Tenth3 Circuit that established this Tenth Circuit rule.4 And based on that constraint, which, again,5 finds no basis in the text of the statute, she refused6 to consider evidence that all parties agree establishes7 the amount in controversy. The amount in controversy in8 this case as established is more than four times the9 amount in the statute.10 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. How ­­ how11 would you answer this question: How did the circuit12 abuse its discretion?13 MR. BERRETH: The circuit abused its14 discretion by letting stand a decision that so plainly15 violated the plain language of the statute that exists16 in a case in which further review is highly unlikely, so17 that if it's not corrected now it may never be18 corrected. And in doing so, it ­­ it ­­ it ran counter19 to this Court's desire for uniformity among the circuits20 in the law, especially uniformity in a matter this21 important and this ­­ and in which Congress has spoken22 as clearly as it has.23 JUSTICE BREYER: To put it more simply, you24 think that the circuit abused its discretion by relying25 upon an improper legal reason.131 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR.

But youthink there's a good chance they did.  So then I guessthat you would like us to say, if that was your reason,it's improper and wrong.      Now, we'll sendsome other reason.      MR.

So if this Court doesn't have to wait for a8 circuit court to act, it shouldn't be restricted from9 doing what is right merely by a10 not to explain its reasoning.11 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:12 either way. We say they abused13 relied on the wrong law, or we go right to the law14 because we have that power to do it.15 MR. BERRETH: That's right, Justice16 Sotomayor. We ask you to review the Tenth Circuit's17 decision. There is choices the Court can make in how to18 handle this. We think the most logical way for the19 Court to handle it is to review the Tenth Circuit's20 decision, and in doing so, to look through that, to what21 the Tenth Circuit did. And when you do that, you find22 this clear error of law, this failure to appreciate23 Congress's plain language, this failure to appreciate24 the fact that this is not a case that's likely to come25 up for review in the future.15What else is in the argumentrequired to find an abuse offavor in this case.  Becausecircuit court's decisionIn other words, you wintheir discretion if they￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA:2 Tenth Circuit did. You say the Tenth Circuit's3 decision. The Tenth Circuit made no decision. It4 declined to take the case, didn't it? It may ­­ the5 statute says it may, and it said we won't. And we don't6 know why they said that. Even the dissenters in the7 petition for en banc didn't say, oh, the court was wrong8 to stand by our earlier decision which you – which you9 complain about. No, they said, you know, this was an10 important issue and we should have taken it. Now, you're11 saying we are going to review that decision as an abuse of12 discretion that you should have taken it. Right?13 MR. BERRETH: I'm saying that once the14 application for an appeal was filed, there is a case in15 the court of appeals, therefore, this Court's power is16 so extensive it can review any aspect of a decision.17 It's not hampered by a lack of an explanation for the18 decision by the Tenth Circuit.19 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that right? It seems to20 me the statute gives the power to the court of appeals.21 It says the court of appeals may decline to take it. We22 can't override their judgment not to take it unless23 there is something unlawful about that judgment. You24 give us too much credit, you know, we don't have total25 power to make decisions, the courts of appeals are16We don't know what the19 other case, we find out what20 dissent, it doesn't sound to21 JUSTICE SCALIA:22 description of the dissent?23 said that that was the reason?24 MR. BERRETH: The dissent said that the25 district court felt constrained by this pre­existing17￼1 supposed to make.2 MR. BERRETH: Justice Scalia, under Forsyth,3 though, this Court does have the power4 constrained by the district court's ­­5 JUSTICE BREYER: I thought6 be, of course, he is right. But there7 unlawful about this decision. Suppose8 rested on his religion. Unlawful, wouldn't it have9 been? Suppose they didn't tell us but the dissent told10 us. So the question is you're arguing, yes, there was11 something unlawful. The unusual thing about the case is12 the person who tells us what they were doing is the13 dissent.14 Now, I don't know why the dissent says that15 was a reason ­­ as I read the dissent. Maybe other16 people read it differently, but as I read the dissent,17 the dissenter was telling us that that was a significant18 factor in their decision. All right. As found in theto not beyour answer wouldis somethingthe decision hadthey did by reading theme to be totally unusual.Do you agree with thatDo you think the dissent￼1 Tenth Circuit precedent to refuse to consider the2 evidence.3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. But the dissent4 didn't say why the court of appeals refused to take the5 case, did it? It didn't say the court of appeals6 refused to take it because it agreed with that prior7 decision. It didn't say that, did it?8 MR. BERRETH: It did not explain that.9 That's right.10 JUSTICE BREYER: You have different judges11 who possibly read different language in the dissent to12 suggest what the dissent is thinking. So he doesn't say13 it literally, but when I read it, I thought that's what14 he means.15 MR. BERRETH: But based on what happened16 here, there is just simply no way that the Tenth17 Circuit's decision can satisfy an abuse of discretion18 standard.19 JUSTICE ALITO: Let me give you an example20 of something that happens quite frequently and maybe you21 can tell me if this situation is any different from22 that.23 A district court has to make a decision on24 something as to which the district court has discretion.25 A party urges the district court to make a particular18￼1 decision based on one ground. And the one ground is2 based on a legal error. The district court rules in3 favor of that party but says absolutely nothing. Now4 the issue is raised on appeal, the argument is that the5 trial judge abused his or her discretion.6 Now, would that be insulate it from review7 for abuse of discretion on the ground that, well, we8 really don't know why the judge did what the judge did?9 The judge didn't say anything. So the judge might not10 have based the decision on this one ­­ on this legal11 error, the only ground that was urged upon the court.12 It might have been based on something else.13 MR. BERRETH: No ­­14 JUSTICE ALITO: What would be ­­ is that15 different from this situation?16 MR. BERRETH: It's not very different from17 the situation. A classic abuse of discretion is an18 error of law. And there was an error of law here19 because the district court felt constrained ­­20 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Berreth, that assumes21 that when an appeals court decides whether to take an22 appeal, all they are doing is making a merits23 determination. And if that's all that appeals courts24 were doing when they decide whether to take an appeal,25 then you would be right. But, in fact, we know from19￼1 everything we do every day that when a court decides to2 take something or not to take something, they are not3 just making a merits evaluation. They are doing a4 thousand other things as well about how they think it's5 best to arrange their docket. And what we don't know is6 whether the Tenth Circuit here did one of those things.7 MR. BERRETH: I believe that what we do8 know, what we can glean from this, though, is that by9 failing to correct this clear error of law, that was an10 abuse of discretion.11 I don't believe an abuse of discretion was12 necessary here because this Court isn't constrained13 under the Forsyth case by what the district ­­ by what14 the circuit court did because this Court can act before15 the circuit court acts. But an abuse of discretion is16 shown here. We can show abuse of discretion. It's the17 classic abuse of discretion, of a clear error of law.18 But there isn't a floodgates problem here, I think, with19 respect to every time a circuit court commits a clear20 error of law that it has to be appealable.21 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I guess it's an abuse22 of discretion whenever we fail to correct a clear error23 of law on a petition for certiorari. Right? And I'm24 not going to mention any names, but is that the case?25 It's an abuse of discretion. I thought we just had the20￼1 power to say we don't feel like taking it.2 MR. BERRETH: I don't believe it would be an3 abuse of discretion for this Court. This Court's power4 is different than the circuit courts'. The circuits5 courts do not have the benefit of the broad, nearly6 unlimited power of Forsyth ­­7 JUSTICE KAGAN: But this statute gives the8 appellate courts tremendous discretion on this area. It9 says it may take an appeal, it may not take an appeal.10 Think of the thousand things that you want to think11 about, not anything invidious, not anything permissible,12 but, you know, whether to take an appeal. And that's13 the only thing we know about it.14 Here's a question for you, because I15 sympathize with you. Because the next half­hour is16 going to reveal that, actually, most of us agree with17 you on the merits. Right?18 JUSTICE ALITO: That might be a little19 premature.20 JUSTICE KAGAN: All right. I will limit it,21 I agree with you on the merits. All right? But I just22 don't see how to get around this. Here's my suggestion.23 Would it be sufficient for your purposes,24 you're worried about the sort of continuing effect of25 this, to just sort of get rid of this case, dismiss this21￼1 case, but to ­­ we often explain why we dismiss cases2 and to suggest that we are dismissing it because we3 don't know whether the Tenth Circuit made a decision on4 the merits. And if and to the extent that the Tenth5 Circuit wants in the next case to make a decision on the6 merits, and if and to the extent that the Tenth Circuit7 wants in the next case to make a decision on the merits8 when it denies an appeal, it should say so, so as not to9 insulate that decision from review.10 That seems like a fair thing to say to the11 Tenth Circuit. Don't insulate your merits decisions12 from review. But it also seems to be, you know, to13 reflect what is true about this case, which is that we14 don't know whether it made a merits decision.15 MR. BERRETH: Well, this Court doesn't need16 to know whether the Circuit Court made a merits decision17 to reverse in this case. This Court's discretionary18 power, this Court's certiorari power, once there's a19 case of the court of appeals doesn't require this Court20 to know why the circuit court did what it did.21 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think it's22 appropriate for this Court to dismiss certiorari, in23 other words, the case is not before us, and then opine24 on the merits of the case?25 JUSTICE KAGAN:22No.  No.  No.  I was not￼1 suggesting that we opine on the merits of the case. I2 would think that that would be not appropriate.3 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought the4 suggestion was that we tell the Tenth Circuit that this5 was wrong?6 JUSTICE KAGAN: No. No. No. That is not7 my suggestion, it might be your suggestion.8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if we simply9 dismiss certiorari, what do you think we have the10 authority to say other than the reasons for dismissing11 certiorari?12 MR. BERRETH: Well, I think number one, you13 have the power to rule in favor of my client in this14 case. I think you have the power perhaps to remand the15 case to the Tenth Circuit, this case, and require the16 Tenth Circuit to consider the appropriate factors.17 I don't think it would be appropriate, given18 where we are, given how far we've come, given the fact19 that all parties agree there's a case in the court of20 appeals, given that Forsyth teaches us that this Court21 need not know why the circuit court did what it did to22 find abuse of discretion, if an abuse of discretion is23 necessary, I would submit at a minimum, that this Court24 would remand the case to the Tenth Circuit for an25 appropriate balancing of the factors.23￼1 But I don't believe that that is necessary2 because I believe that because of Forsyth and because of3 this Court's power, this Court has the power to reverse4 this case similar to what happened in the Standard Fire5 case.6 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How can ­­ how can7 we remand for an appropriate consideration of the8 factors if we don't say that what took place was9 inappropriate?10 MR. BERRETH: That's ­­ a decision on the11 merits would cover all those bases, Mr. Chief Justice.12 A decision on the merits here would correct the error;13 it would correct the error in this case, and it would14 correct ­­ keep any errors from happening in future15 cases in the Tenth Circuit.16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the only way that we17 can do that is by granting cert before judgment?18 MR. BERRETH: I don't believe that that's19 the only way that that can be done. I think that it20 happened in ­­21 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let's assume that we22 think the case that Hohn controls and this case is in23 the ­­ in the court of appeals only for the purpose of24 determining whether the appeal should be taken. If we25 make that assumption, then isn't the only way for us to24￼1 reach the merits to grant cert before judgment?2 MR. BERRETH: Justice Kennedy, the Court's3 certiorari power is broader than that, I believe. So I4 don't believe a cert grant before judgment is the only5 way because this Court does not need to wait for the6 circuit courts to act. But if this Court does wait for7 the circuit court ­­8 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, do we grant it on9 the ground that it's interesting? I mean, I don't know10 what your ­­ what your standard is.11 MR. BERRETH: You grant cert on cases of12 national importance, on cases in which there is one13 wayward circuit that's so flouting the plain language of14 the ­­ of the statute that it ­­ that it ­­ that it15 should ­­ needs to be corrected, that defendants in the16 heartland of the country, in these six states, should17 have the same benefits as defendants in those other18 states.19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, we grant20 cert to the district court?21 MR. BERRETH: This Court can grant cert to22 the district court in very rare circumstances.23 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's the only way we24 can do it, it seems to me, if you assume that the case25 is in the court of appeals only for the purpose of25￼1 determining whether to take an appeal.2 MR. BERRETH: Well, the Nixon v. Fitzgerald3 case, though, confirms that the court is not so4 constrained.5 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but we would sort of6 frustrate the statute, wouldn't we? The statute gives7 the court of appeals the discretion to decide whether8 there will be an appeal or not. And you're saying, oh,9 no, if they decide there won't be you ­­ you just reach10 in, and you have cert before judgment. I think that's a11 real frustration of the purpose of this statute, which12 says these matters, you know, are not all that13 significant. So it doesn't come to federal court. It14 stays in state court, who cares? We trust our state15 courts.16 I mean, the whole purpose of the statute is17 to make this, you know, a quick and dirty judgment.18 That's why they don't have to state reasons. They just19 say no appeal, or appeal.20 And you're saying, oh, no. It suddenly21 becomes laden with ­­ with all sorts of requirements22 that if they're not observed, we ­­ we grant cert before23 judgment. I wouldn't think of doing that, well, with24 this statute anyway.25 MR. BERRETH: Well, when Congress provides261 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425in 1453 for appellate jurisdiction over the remandorders, Congress is providing for jurisdiction in thisCourt because Congress didn't legislate to the contrary.      When ­­ when Congress wants to prevent thisCourt from having the ability to take up a writ ofcertiorari, it does so, as it did in the AEDPA context,when it explicitly restricted this Court from hearing apetition for a writ of certiorari or granting one.Congress didn't so legislate here. This Court has full power to address both the ­­ address the merits question in this case.I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. Mr. Sharp.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF REX A. SHARP       ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTMR. SHARP: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:      The remand order should stand for at leasttwo reasons.  First, 1447(d) bars this Court'sjurisdiction to review this case at all, on appeal orotherwise, because the Tenth Circuit did not accept theremand appeal under 1453.      Consequently, this Court has no jurisdictionat all to review this matter on appeal or certiorari or27￼￼1 any other way.2 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So ­­ so if the3 court of appeals said we are not accepting this petition4 because of the race of the person seeking removal,5 that's just too bad? We can't review that?6 MR. SHARP: If they give a reason, I think7 this Court can review a reason. But if it doesn't give8 a reason, it just simply does as this Court sometimes9 does with a petition for certiorari ­­ denied ­­ there's10 nothing to review.11 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if every case in12 which parties seek removal, a particular race of a13 person seeking removal, their case is denied 100 out of14 100 cases. We still don't have any basis and they know,15 gosh, the one thing we ­­ we can't do is say why we are16 doing it. They have a blank check? They can do that17 forever without any review by this Court?18 MR. SHARP:19 blank check, because at20 court, then comes up on21 would review the final judgment on whether the remand22 was proper.23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it was just pointed24 out that lawyers in the Tenth Circuit are not going to25 take that risk. The Tenth Circuit precedent, which the28No.  I don't think you have athe time it goes back to statefinal judgment, and this Court￼1 district court followed, says you must produce in the2 notice of appeal evidence.3 So what lawyer is going to say to his4 client, now, we can easily do that, but I won't because5 I want to test whether the Tenth Circuit precedent is6 wrong.7 As a practical matter, this will be8 unreviewable because the lawyers will simply conform to9 what the Tenth Circuit says is the law.10 MR. SHARP: Your Honor, I think that's what11 the dissent pointed out, is that, what lawyer would not12 put on evidence after having that Tenth Circuit rule set13 forth as it has been for the last 20 years. But yet, we14 do have this case where evidence wasn't presented. Why15 their evidence was not presented, no one knows, but it16 was clear that Dart had the evidence to present at the17 time of this notice of removal but didn't present it.18 Perhaps it wanted to challenge this issue to19 the Tenth Circuit ­­20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Maybe ­­ maybe because it21 thought there wouldn't be any controversy. Maybe they22 thought the defendant thought the plaintiff would agree23 that the amount was over the jurisdictional order.24 MR. SHARP: That's a good point, Your Honor,25 and that's entirely possible. That, as it turns out,2925 JUSTICE BREYER:Yes or no?￼1 would not be this case, because as we get deeper into2 the evidence in this particular case, this one doesn't3 meet $5 million. It's not going to get close to meeting4 $5 million.5 JUSTICE BREYER: You actually started out by6 saying 1447(d), which I thought had nothing to do with7 this case. That is, I thought that they ­­ they were8 going ­­ the relevant statute is 1453(c)(1), which says9 a court of appeals may accept an appeal, notwithstanding10 Section 1447(d), from an order of the district court11 granting or denying a motion to remand. All right?12 So we are not talking about 1447(d); we are13 talking about 1453(c)(1).14 Now, what they did is they said they have an15 order, and the order says, no, we won't accept it. And16 the question is, is that order reviewed in this Court?17 I didn't think there was disagreement that it is18 reviewable.19 If they had said, We will not accept it20 because if we think that it only applies to stoppage in21 transitu cases, they would have their reason. Their22 reason would have been wrong, and I guess we could23 review it. Is that right or not?24 MR. SHARP: Well, Your Honor ­­301 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. SHARP: No, Your Honor.JUSTICE BREYER: No, we can't review any case when they turn it down, no matter what their reason. Do you have any authority for that proposition?MR. SHARP: 1450 ­­ as you pointed out, 1453(c) and 1453 in total adopts the entirety of 1446 and 1447, with limited exception.JUSTICE BREYER: No. It doesn't adopt it. It says notwithstanding Section 1447(d), a court of appeals may accept an appeal. So please accept my appeal; court of appeals says no.      My question to you is, does this Court havethe authority to review the order that says no?MR. SHARP:JUSTICE BREYER:MR. SHARP:JUSTICE BREYER:And my answer is still ­­     No, it doesn't ­­­­ still the same ­­     No matter how terrible the￼reason, it doesn't. That's your answer?MR. SHARP: No. My answer is because theydid not accept the appeal, then you go back to1447(d) ­­JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I'm saying my hypothetical is they do not accept the appeal.MR. SHARP: As in this case.JUSTICE BREYER:They say we do not accept311 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the appeal because 1453 only applies to stoppage intransitu.  Okay?  A totally wrong reason.      Now, are you saying we do not have thejurisdictional authority to review that order which says"denied"?MR. SHARP: Denied for some clearly improper reason?JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, denied for some clearly improper reason. Are you saying that? And if so, I'd like to know the authority for that because we have plenty of cases that go with the analogous certificate of appeal in habeas cases ­­ cases where we take it.MR. SHARP: I understand, Your Honor, and I don't think I have any cases, but ­­JUSTICE BREYER: All right. If you don't have any cases, we might file the other way. If you agree, and you don't ­­ all right, I don't know where to go from here because if you're going to say we can't take authority where they absolutely can't hear the case, where it's absolutely clear they're wrong, then I don't know where to go.MR. SHARP: Well, let me see if I can ­­JUSTICE BREYER: I don't do that, but, I mean, but I'm not going to get you to say anything more.32￼24 JUSTICE SCALIA:25 did that here.You don't think Congress￼1 MR. SHARP: Let me see if I can address it,2 Your Honor. Hohn and Miller L. are not remand cases and3 Nixon was not a remand case. 1447(d) expressly deals4 with remand cases and Section 1453(c)(1) says when there5 is an accepted appeal under 1453, then 1447(d), it6 doesn't apply. But all the rest of 1447(d) applies and7 all of 1447 applies if the appeal is not accepted.8 That puts you right back into the 1440(c)(d)9 realm and 1447(d) says this Court doesn't have any10 jurisdiction under Gravitt. This is a similar case to11 like Kircher v. Putnam Funds where this Court basically12 said the district court got it wrong, but we don't have13 jurisdiction to hear it.14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think it's ­­ it's15 constitutional for Congress to say that certain minor16 issues or what it regards as minor issues shall not be17 appealable for any reason whatever? So even if it's18 decided you're going to do it for a plainly improper19 reason, like religion or race or something, still and20 all it ain't ­­ it ain't worth our trouble, right?21 Could Congress do that?22 MR. SHARP: Your Honor, I don't think23 Congress can ­­ no, I don't think Congress ­­33￼1 MR. SHARP: I don't think they did that2 here. I think they made a ­­3 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think you're going to4 lose then.5 MR. SHARP: I think they made a simple6 declaration in 1447(d) that remand orders are not worth7 the time of the Court to handle on review, and with8 respect to class actions, we're going to let the court9 of appeals make that choice of whether it makes ­­ if it10 merits any attention on appeal. And if the court of11 appeals says it does ­­12 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you pay any attention13 at all to the obvious purpose of the Class Action14 Fairness Act, which was to get cases out of the State15 courts and into the Federal courts? Usually, we don't16 have that strong Federal policy of having the17 adjudication in the Federal court.18 MR. SHARP: Yes, Your Honor. CAFA, I think,19 made clear that certain larger cases, interstate type20 cases, belong in Federal court. This isn't that kind of21 a case, but if it was, you also have ­­22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said that you would23 argue that the amount in controversy was not satisfied24 and it seems to me that most plaintiffs who are bringing25 class actions are not going to be argued, oh, we can't34￼1 prove $500,000.2 MR. SHARP: Your Honor, as much as my client3 would like to see this be a bigger case than it really4 is, this particular case, as the Court knows, when the5 original allegation was made on a conclusory basis of6 $8.2 million, that was made on the basis of all of the7 potential damages for all of the royalty owners.8 But in this oil and gas context, about 629 percent of all of the oil and gas leases were express10 deduction leases; in other words, they expressly11 authorized the deductions that we complained about.12 There goes about 40 percent of our damages right there13 as a matter of law.14 The second thing is that it turns out, as we15 get deeper into this case, that Dart doesn't have all of16 the working interest in this particular oil and gas17 patch. They have more along the lines of half. There18 goes another half of our damages. Now we're down to 2019 to 25 percent of the total damages.20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You had alleged in your21 complaint that the damages that you were seeking were22 under $500,000. If that's what you thought, then you23 would be ­­24 MR. SHARP: We ­­ we had no idea at that25 time, Your Honor. We didn't know how much. We just35￼1 didn't have any information whatsoever at that time.2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But when they ­­ when3 they did allege in the notice of removal that the amount4 in controversy was met,5 MR. SHARP:6 We already had taken on7 evidence was presented to us that they had not proffered8 any evidence with the notice of removal. Under ­­ under9 the JCV's ­­ the JVCA ­­10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what you didn't say11 is that there is no such evidence and that our damages12 are less than $500,000.13 MR. SHARP: We ­­ we didn't know ­­ we14 didn't have any evidence at all as to what the amount in15 controversy was so we didn't allege it in our petition.16 And when that was removed without anything other than an17 allegation that it was worth 8.2 million, we couldn't do18 anything other than say how do we know? Where's your19 evidence? We have nothing.20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's a peculiar ­­21 this State doesn't require the complaint to state the22 amount in controversy. But if you were bringing this23 case in the Federal court in the first instance would24 you have said as plaintiff, the damages that we seek are25 under 5,000 ­­ 500,000?36you didn't contest that.We didn't need to at that time.the issue long before any￼1 MR. SHARP: In ­­ if I had been in ­­ in2 the ­­ in the know at the time this case was filed, I3 would have alleged what the amount of damages were. I4 also may have alleged the case in a completely different5 way than I did. But I didn't have that evidence. So6 consequently, when the removal was made without any7 evidence at all from which we could determine what the8 amount in controversy really was, we said let's remand9 this case because you haven't come up with the actual10 evidence.11 They should have waited and presented all of12 the damage evidence and waited for another paper, like13 most of the ­­ other defendants do, but they didn't.14 They wanted to jump the gun and get it into Federal15 court and they didn't come with their evidence like they16 were supposed to. The JVCA is not governed by ­­17 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If there's only one18 circuit then, I mean, that is so antithetical with the19 whole notion of the Federal rules that you don't plead20 evidence. Plain statement doesn't include evidence and21 it is quite an extreme interpretation and counter to the22 whole thrust of the Federal rules, which you make a23 plain statement and then the evidence comes later.24 MR. SHARP: Well, the ­­ the way I read the25 JVCA in 1446(a) is that the grounds must be just plainly3725 JUSTICE KAGAN:But I don't see where you￼1 stated, just like a regular pleading. The grounds are2 diversity. The grounds are a Federal question. And3 then (c)(2) specifically addresses the amount in4 controversy. (A) does not say anything about the amount5 in controversy. (C) and (c)(2) addresses the amount in6 controversy. And (c)(2)7 says ­­8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I just have never ­­ I'm9 a little hard­pressed to understand why the district10 court would be without power to decide this question.11 They came in with evidence afterwards. Why couldn't you12 have come in with evidence and the district court decide13 which one is right?14 MR. SHARP: Certainly, that could have been15 done if they had gotten over the procedural hurdle to16 begin with. The Tenth Circuit rule is pretty simple and17 it also follows the JVCA, which basically says if you18 want to jump the gun into Federal court and you're not19 going to wait on the plaintiff to virtually admit their20 way into Federal court, then you're going to have to put21 on some evidence. In the Tenth Circuit, they require22 prima facie evidence. If plaintiff looks at that prima23 facie evidence and does nothing, under Wilson, you're24 in. There's nothing more that need be done.38￼1 get that. You know, you say (c)(2), which is the2 preponderance standard, but that's just a standard that3 the court is going to use to make the determination4 about whether to be in Federal court or not.5 But it seems to me that the statute is best6 read ­­ is really only read to comport as Justice7 Ginsburg said, with the rest of the Federal rules. It's8 notice pleading, then the original plaintiff has a9 choice. The original plaintiff can contest the ­­ the10 removal and present evidence and in that case, the11 defendant comes back with evidence and the defendant12 bears the burden of proof and the court makes its13 decision on the basis of that two sets of evidence.14 But why one should think of the original15 notice as needing to contain evidence is just ­­ I guess16 I don't understand where that comes from.17 MR. SHARP: Well, the reason for that, I18 think, is that the original notice is not a pleading.19 It is not like plaintiff originating the case in Federal20 court. It's not a pleading. It's actually a motion.21 And as with most motions, you generally have to submit22 your evidence, you have to prove a motion, and you23 usually have to submit your evidence with the motion.24 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But this is ­­ this is a25 provision for removal. It tracks the language of Rule39￼1 8(a). And so you're asking for ­­ oh, even though it2 copies Rule 8(a), which certainly doesn't require that3 you plead evidence, we do have to do it for notice of4 removal.5 MR. SHARP: You have to for the notice of6 removal because (c)(2) does a couple of things. (C)(2)7 says if plaintiff alleges something less than the amount8 in controversy, that's golden and conclusive. It9 doesn't matter that defendant thinks it's different or10 that it's higher and would meet the Federal11 jurisdictional amount. It's done.12 But under (c)(2)(a), if there's a silent13 petition in the State court, defendant can jump the gun14 and say, you know what, I want to allege. I want to say15 how much I think is at issue. You can allege that under16 (a). But that's not conclusive. There's nothing in17 (c)(2)(a) that says what defendant says is conclusive.18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If ­­ if the plaintiff19 wanted to challenge that, I could understand your20 position and then you would have the respective parties21 putting in their evidence.22 But if the defendant makes an allegation23 amount in controversy is met and the plaintiff doesn't24 say no, doesn't say that we don't have the amount in25 controversy.40￼1 MR. SHARP: Justice Ginsburg, in this case2 as in most class actions, plaintiffs have no evidence3 that they could possibly put on. They couldn't dispute4 anything that the defendant actually said. But this5 particular issue as to when the ­­ when the evidence6 must be presented, the reason it's done with the notice7 of removal is so that the evidence is out there for the8 court to make a sua sponte decision if the court wants9 to or plaintiff to make ­­10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But when you bring a11 class action, you're looking for big bucks and the12 likelihood that it's going to be controverted, that the13 plaintiff who's brought a class action in the State14 court is going to say, oh, no, we can't ­­ we can't make15 the amount in controversy, that sounds very strange to16 me. Most class action plaintiffs are not going to17 contest that their claim is worth at least $500,000.18 MR. SHARP: Well, in this particular case,19 this case really isn't worth $5 million. So there was20 nothing ­­ no way, though, at that point for us to21 contest one way or another. If the plaintiff is going22 to make any kind of a contest, there has to be some23 presentation of evidence to begin with. There's not24 going to be anything other than a plaintiff saying if ­­25 if the simple allegation is, well, it's worth more than41￼1 $5 million, plaintiff has nothing.2 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I don't follow that3 because ordinarily a plaintiff would state what the4 plaintiff's damages are.5 MR. SHARP: Plaintiff in a class action6 generally does not have the evidence of how many class7 members there are or how much they've been damaged.8 It's the defendant that deals with all of the class9 members on a class­wide or company­wide basis. The10 plaintiff generally does not have that information11 available, defendant does, and it usually has to be12 determined through a discovery process which usually13 occurs in State court, at which point the defendant14 sends a request for admissions or ask at a deposition.15 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In ­­ in the ­­ let's16 take a case in the Federal court, a class action case.17 Plaintiffs don't state what the amount in controversy18 is?19 MR. SHARP: If they know what the amount in20 controversy is, they could state what the amount of21 controversy is. But they generally do not. I certainly22 did not in this particular case. And in most class23 actions that get filed that I'm aware of, plaintiff24 doesn't know what their damages are before they filed25 the suit.42￼1 JUSTICE GINSBURG:2 all that the plaintiff would say is we meet the amount3 in controversy?4 MR. SHARP: They could say the amount in5 controversy is 5 million or it's 7 million or whatever6 it may be. Whether that has any validity at all after7 this Court's ruling in Knowles v. Standard Fire, I don't8 know. It's clear that you can't allege something lower9 to try to stay under the limit. I don't know whether10 you can say something over. I'm not sure that you have11 the authority to bind the class until you're already a12 class representative, have already been appointed as13 class counsel.14 Nonetheless, these particular cases end up15 in which the defendant has the evidence, plaintiff does16 not, and this particular case and this particular17 statute shows that that evidence has to come in at the18 time of removal. If it doesn't come in at the time of19 removal, their suggestion is it comes in at the time of20 remand. If that were the case, you would find this21 evidentiary requirement in the text under 1447 where the22 remand rules are found, not in the removal of 1446. You23 wouldn't find it at all there. You'd find it ­­24 JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry. I just ­­ you25 said if it doesn't come in at the time of removal, it43But you would say that￼1 comes in at the time of remand. But there's an2 alternate position, which is the notice of removal is3 just the allegation, if the plaintiff wants to contest4 that, the plaintiff can contest that, and then the5 defendant has to come forward with something because the6 defendant has the burden of proof.7 Likewise, if the court thinks that the8 allegation is not appropriate, the court can sua sponte9 say, you know, you have to show me more because I'm not10 sure I have jurisdiction over this.11 But either way, it all happens in the12 Federal court after the notice of removal, which is13 merely an allegation, is filed. And that makes perfect14 sense. It means that most allegations will just be15 accepted as is and the only ones that everybody will16 have to come forward with evidence are when there's some17 reason to contest it, when either the plaintiff or the18 court has some serious doubt about it.19 MR. SHARP: Well, plaintiff usually has20 absolutely no idea what the allegation may be. For21 instance, when they came forward and said the amount of22 damages is 8.2 million, we had no way to contest that23 with any evidence of any kind.24 Now, if all we had to do to contest it was25 say, we contest it, we don't think it's worth $8.2441 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425million, prove it, every plaintiff would say:  Show meyour hand; you've got to show your cards.JUSTICE BREYER: Not necessarily. I mean, it's the same as a complaint. They allege paragraph 1, paragraph 2, paragraph 3, and the defendant comes in and says admitted, denied; admitted, denied; not enough information. All right. So you do the same thing. What's the problem?MR. SHARP: It ­­ it could be ­­ if 1446 was written such that 1446(a) was the end of it and there was no further part of the statute, then all they would have to do is make an allegation and that would be the end of it. And under 1447 ­­JUSTICE BREYER: They have to allege the facts. They have to allege facts. They have to say the allegation is and so forth. And you say they're not.MR. SHARP: Yeah. And that was part of the district court's opinion. There were two parts. One was that there wasn't any evidence; and the second part was that it was conclusory, that there were no facts. All you said was 8.2 million. And so both of those were possible ­­JUSTICE BREYER:MR. SHARP:JUSTICE BREYER:     Isn't that a fact?Excuse me, Your Honor?     Isn't 8.2 million a fact?45￼￼1 MR. SHARP:2 JUSTICE BREYER:3 said in their view ­­4 MR. SHARP:5 JUSTICE BREYER:6 what a conclusory fact is as7 That seems like a lot of money to me, but I ­­8 MR. SHARP: I would agree with Your Honor.9 And it sometimes is difficult, but I think we deal with10 those a lot now that Twombly has been adopted by this11 Court. Conclusory ­­ conclusions are not sufficient in12 terms of pleading for the plaintiff. And if this13 particular Court were going to find that evidence is not14 required under 1446, we urge the Court to at least say15 go ­­ go the distance and ­­ and treat the 144616 allegation like a Twombly allegation and conclusory17 would not be sufficient.18 That's what the district court found, both that you19 should have put on some evidence, if you had it you20 should have put it on; and secondly, that what you did21 say was conclusory.22 But let me ­­ let me draw back to this ­­23 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where ­­ where was that24 said about conclusory? I thought that the district25 court's position was, sorry, you're too late; I won't46It's a conclusory fact.     Well, it's a fact.  TheyIt's a conclusion.     All right.  I don't know     opposed to a regular fact.￼1 entertain anything about 8.2 million or whatever it was.2 MR. SHARP: The district court did both,3 Your Honor. You are exactly correct. It said: I see4 you've got some evidence, but you didn't put it on when5 you were supposed to; and secondly, she said the 8.2 was6 not sufficient by itself because it was conclusory.7 That's consistent with Tenth Circuit law and I think she8 followed the Tenth Circuit law.9 What the Tenth Circuit ultimately decided I10 have absolutely no idea. They simply denied it. We11 don't know whether they denied it for constitutional12 grounds, whether they denied it because their docket was13 too busy, they denied it because they didn't think this14 was a clean vehicle to ­­ to change their Tenth Circuit15 rule.16 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, one thing we17 know is that they denied it upon careful consideration18 of the parties' submissions as well as the applicable19 law. Was there anything in the parties' submissions20 other than the question on which we granted cert?21 MR. SHARP: The ­­ no, I don't think so,22 Your Honor. I think the issues that were provided to23 the court there in the Tenth Circuit were very similar24 to what you see here in this Court, with the exception25 of whether this Court has jurisdiction under either47￼1 1447(d) or, as this Court has suggested, maybe under2 Hohn; and under Hohn, then, that this Court would have3 some type of review of whether that was an abuse of4 discretion to simply say, denied.5 But no one has come to this Court and said,6 we want certiorari granted on ­­ what should be the7 factors, what should the Court decide, when it says8 we're not going to take that appeal under 1453.9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do I remember it wrong10 in ­­ in thinking that in your briefing you didn't raise11 this question? You just argued what the notice of12 removal must contain and it wasn't until there was one13 green brief Public Citizen that brought up this14 question. So you were content until a friend of the15 court made the suggestion to argue this case on the16 merits.17 MR. SHARP: Your Honor, I'm comfortable and18 have argued this case on the merits as ­­ as you know,19 but nonetheless, I think I'm duty bound, as all the20 parties are, to determine whether this Court has21 jurisdiction and what the extent of that jurisdiction22 is. You are correct that the amicus first raised the23 issue of jurisdiction. In the reply brief, they had the24 opportunity to say what they thought was the25 jurisdictional issue which they believed was under48￼1 Nixon. I don't believe Nixon or Hohn, either one of2 those cases, govern here because neither of those cases3 are remand cases. I think 1447(d) controls on the4 remand side only because of the limited exception, not5 because of the ­­6 JUSTICE BREYER: Briefly, the Court has7 jurisdiction of cases in the court of appeals.8 MR. SHARP: Certainly, Your Honor.9 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, when in10 fact a party appeals a district court's remand, he files11 that appeal paper in the court of appeals. The case is12 there. Before they decide it, we could take it. After13 they decide it, and if they affirm it, or if they decide14 to hear it, we could take it. It's there.15 But suppose they say no.16 it from the court of appeals? If the17 question, which is your position that18 now this Court can't take it, then it19 anything. It can't take the same things down in the ­­20 in the habeas cases. It can't take the attorney's fees21 things. It can't take anything, I would guess because22 it would say where a court has discretion and says, no,23 we are not taking it, it's not reviewable in this Court24 because it's no longer in the court of appeals.25 Now, what's ­­ is that your position? You49Does that removeanswer to thatyou're arguing, iscan't take      MR. SHARP:Honor.      JUSTICE ALITO:I believe that's correct, Your    Any reason whatsoever is50okay?￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425can see I don't think it's a very good position from mytone of voice.  But if there's something else, maybethere's a better one.MR. SHARP: Well, then I won't take that position, Your Honor.JUSTICE BREYER: Well, no, you ­­ I mean, I'm often wrong in these things.MR. SHARP: But the position I would take is that there is a clear distinction in 1447(d) that addresses remand and has nothing to do with Hohn or Miller L or Nixon. And so this Court was not wrong in Miller L or Hohn or Nixon because, of course, those cases, as the Court points out, were in fact in.      But so was Gravitt and so was Kircher.Those cases were in fact in the court of appeals whenthe Court granted certiorari.JUSTICE ALITO: Maybe you answered this before, but is it your position that under the Class Action Fairness Act the court of appeals has absolute discretion, unlimited discretion, to decide whether to take an appeal or not?￼1 MR. SHARP: Any reason whatsoever is okay,2 as long as ­­ I would guess, as I think Justice Scalia3 pointed out, as long as it's not a constitutional4 violation.5 JUSTICE ALITO: So what if the court of6 appeals says, we are not taking this because we just7 don't like the Class Action Fairness Act. We think it's8 bad public policy; we are never going to take one of9 these. That's okay?10 MR. SHARP: I don't know if that would be a11 constitutional violation, Your Honor. I think if it's12 not a constitutional violation, I think it probably13 would be okay. But if it is a constitutional violation,14 it probably would not, and I think that's a question15 that I'm ill prepared to answer.16 But I do think that there is that discretion17 and that discretion is ­­ is relatively absolute. It's18 not completely absolute because the Tenth Circuit is19 bound to honor the Constitution before it does any of20 the congressional issues.21 JUSTICE ALITO: I was going say ­­ and this22 is not certainly true of the Tenth Circuit ­­ but23 suppose things change and we get to the point where each24 judge on the Tenth Circuit is sitting on ten cases a25 year, and so they can have a ten­ month vacation. And51￼1 they say, well, we don't want to take this, because, you2 know, we may not have a ten­month vacation, we'll have a3 nine­month vacation. Would that be all right?4 MR. SHARP: Again, I think it ­­ it's that5 line of what ­­ when the judge is doing his job, when he6 is not doing his job, and whether there's a7 constitutional violation. But that's the necessary evil8 with respect to discretion in an ­­ in an appeal. You9 have that discretion and that discretion is fairly10 absolute. There are no ­­ in 1453 there's no ­­11 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, all the Class Action12 Fairness Act says is, I believe, is that the court may13 take the case. It doesn't ­­ it doesn't specify the14 scope of discretion. It doesn't say it's absolute.15 MR. SHARP: It doesn't, Your Honor. You are16 absolutely correct. It doesn't provide any parameters17 whatsoever as to whether that is an absolute discretion18 or how that discretion is to be exercised. And so19 consequently, the circuit courts have no ­­ they have no20 direction from Congress and at this point no direction21 from this Court as to how much discretion they have22 under 1453 when they deny that particular appeal, and23 whether this Court then has anything from which it can24 say, well, I've seen why you denied it and we would like25 to review that.52probably is not absolute, butsomething more is not clear.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: MR.

BERRETH: It's ­­ it's simply improper3 to allow courts of appeals to insulate their decisions4 from review by not giving reasons for ­­ for their5 decisions. If ­­ if Congress wants to prevent this6 Court from exercising its power to review decisions,7 Congress can. It knows how to do it. It did it in8 AEDPA, as I mentioned before. And it didn't do it here.9 Instead, through 1453 Congress enacted a statute that is10 a grant of jurisdiction to this Court.11 It's one of the unusual ­­ the rare12 instances where Congress granted jurisdiction over13 remand issues. And the Forsyth case answers a lot of14 questions in this case. It provides that the power of15 this Court, the certiorari power of this Court, after16 the Court has jurisdiction of a case, which it does17 here, the certiorari power of this Court may be18 exercised before or after any decision by that Court and19 irrespective of any ruling or determination therein,20 irrespective of any determination or ruling therein.21 This Court's power is comprehensive and it22 should result in a reversal in this case.2324 you. 25If there are not any more questions, thank54CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
