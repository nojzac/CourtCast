Floyd Hicks.          Mr. Howle.              ORAL ARGUMENT OF C. WAYNE HOWLE                  ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER          MR. HOWLE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleasethe Court:          I would like to make three principal points thismorning.  The first is that state officials should not besued in tribal courts.  Tribal jurisdiction over stateofficials would be inconsistent with their status.          QUESTION:  You mean, ever, for anything, nomatter what?          MR. HOWLE:  Yes, Your Honor, as long as theywere acting in a representative capacity for the state.          QUESTION:  This comes to us in the context of astate official who went to the tribal court to getauthority to carry out a search warrant, and was given awarrant with certain terms and conditions to go on thereservation and carry it out.  And if the allegation isthat the officer did not follow the limitations in theauthorized warrant, you think the tribal court can neverhave jurisdiction over those actions of the officer?3                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. HOWLE:  Your Honor, I --          QUESTION:  That's your position?          MR. HOWLE:  Yes, Your Honor, that is --          QUESTION:  Suppose he just goes and buys somegasoline and doesn't pay for it.  Say he drives up to thetribal gas station, buys some gasoline, drives off,doesn't pay for it.  I mean, can they sue him for themoney in the tribal court?          MR. HOWLE:  The answer is no, Your Honor, not intribal court, but in state or federal court, and there isa remedy there.  We're not here to suggest that there's noremedy --          QUESTION:  Okay, what is your authority for thisbroad initial proposition you're making?          MR. HOWLE:  The authority is --          QUESTION:  What case?          MR. HOWLE:  Oliphant, which describes adivestiture of tribal jurisdiction which is inconsistentwith the tribe's status.it not?QUESTION:  But that's criminal jurisdiction, isMR. HOWLE:  Yes, Your Honor, it was.QUESTION:  How about civil jurisdiction?MR. HOWLE:  In the case of civil jurisdiction,the case of National Farmers Union also requires an                             4                                                                                             1    examination of the tribe's sovereignty, and to the extent 2    it's been divested. 3              QUESTION:  I read another brief -- a 1934 4    opinion of the Solicitor General who said that the tribes 5    under Acts passed by Congress had the basic sovereignty 6    that they had for generations, unless it was taken away. 7    And I guess for generations they could have sued people 8    who went and bought gasoline without paying for it.  I 9    don't know if it always would have been gasoline, but I10    assume a basic contract action would be within their11    grant, wouldn't it?12              MR. HOWLE:  Well, Your Honor, first of all I'm13    not prepared to concede that much regarding even a14    nonmember in a private capacity, but with regard to state15    officials, there are special considerations.  The state16    officials are protected, we know, with a certain immunity17    which has constitutional dimensions.  And our position is18    that that in conjunction with the Court's instruction to19    examine the extent to which tribes have been divested20    implicitly because of their statuses as tribes results in21    the rule that jurisdiction over state officials has been22    divested.2324 25          QUESTION:  Mr. Howle, I could understand aposition that says when a state official is actingpursuant to state authority -- there's a warrant, a state5                                                                                             1    warrant -- that that person can't be questioned in tribal 2    court.  But suppose this officer, instead of going in with 3    a warrant, just went in, rammed down the door, beat up the 4    plaintiff.  He's still wearing his state uniform, and he's 5    still looking for evidence of whatever animal that was -- 6     would you say that even in such a case there would be no 7    tribal court jurisdiction? 8              MR. HOWLE:  We would, Your Honor.  No tribal 9    court jurisdiction.10              QUESTION:  You're not even making a distinction11    that's often made in these public employment cases between12    acting within the scope of one's authority and going so13    far beyond the pale of anything that would fit within that14    authority as to be on a frolic of one's own.  You wouldn't15 --16              MR. HOWLE:  We're suggesting a higher standard,17    and that being acting in a representative capacity, and18    that's a standard that we see employed, albeit in an19    ambiguous fashion --20              QUESTION:  What does that mean?  He at least has21    to believe that he's pursuing the state's business?22    Suppose he's wearing his uniform and he just goes on the23    reservation to beat up one of the members of the tribe24    that he doesn't like, but he's in uniform and he's on25 duty.6                                                                                                                                1234 all. 5          MR. HOWLE:  That's a difficult case, Your Honor.I'll concede, but this is --                QUESTION:  Gee, I don't think it's difficult at                MR. HOWLE:  That isn't this case, though. 6    There's no allegation that our officials acted outside of 7    any state authority.  The only allegation regarding scope 8    of authority is the constitutional violation alleged, and 9    otherwise the complaint alleges that they were acting as10    game wardens.  The do what game wardens do, and they get11    warrants and search for evidence of crime that was12    committed off the reservation by a reservation member.13    And this is a core state function.  It's a peace officer14    function.  Nevada has to be able to enforce its criminal15    laws within its own borders.16              QUESTION:  May I be sure I understand your17    position -- are you saying that your immunity rule would18    only apply when the state official is acting within the19    scope of his authority?  Is that what your position is?20              MR. HOWLE:  I phrase it differently, Your Honor.21    I suggest a representative capacity being the standard.22              QUESTION:  Well, supposing he goes beyond his23    representative capacity and does what Justice Scalia24    describes.  Would he be immune or not?25              MR. HOWLE:  Well, I think that -- I think in7                                                                                                                                 1    that case the analysis then falls back to a different 2    test, and that being the ordinary test for a private3 citizen. 4              QUESTION:  But that isn't this frolic of his own 5    or something like that? 6              MR. HOWLE:  Surely he'd be treated differently 7    if he were an officer, but unrelated to any of the state8 business. 9              QUESTION:  But why don't you go the whole hog10    and say that it's your position that it ought to be a11    question for the state court and not for the tribal court12    whether, in fact, he was just going in to beat up a tribal13    member he didn't like, or he was going on state business.14    That's doubtless going to be one of the issues in the15    case, and that whole case should belong in state court16    rather than tribal court?  That's not an irrational17 position.18              MR. HOWLE:  No, it isn't, Your Honor.19              QUESTION:  Is that the position you're taking?20              MR. HOWLE:  I'll take that position, Your Honor.21              QUESTION:  Why not take it?22              (Laughter)23              QUESTION:  But if you take that position, what24    about the case in which the officer acknowledges that he's25    not on state business?  How about that officer?8                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. HOWLE:  That officer would then have to betested under the appropriate standard for a privatecitizen, and tribal jurisdiction over private citizens.          QUESTION:  So then your view is that theimmunity attaches if the officer acknowledges that he wasnot within his state authority.attach --MR. HOWLE:  I'm sorry?  The immunity would notQUESTION:  It's backwards, yes, you're right.MR. HOWLE:  That's correct, Your Honor.QUESTION:  Does your argument depend on the factsimply that there is uncertainty under the jurisdictionalstandard as to how far the tribal court's jurisdictiongoes, or would your argument be the same if the statutewere clear beyond a peradventure of a doubt that someonewho was acting in what you describe as official capacitybut is being sued in his individual capacity wouldnonetheless be subject to jurisdiction?  In other words,are you making this argument in order to construe a vaguejurisdictional grant, or are you making this argument intosomething that would be entitled to prevail no matter howclear the statutory grant was?          MR. HOWLE:  First of all, Your Honor, there is -- I'm sorry, I may have misapprehended.  There isn't astatutory grant here, save for the civil rights law of the9                                                                                            1    federal government.  But our first position is that there2    is a categorical rule that state officials doing state3    business should not be subject to the tribal court's4    jurisdiction.5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  If I agree with you on that as tostate officers enforcing the state's criminal laws, whichis what was at issue here, do I have to agree with youwith regard to all other state officers?          MR. HOWLE:  Not that -- yes, Your Honor, I think10 so. 1112    Anybody else?  I mean, there's a distinctive aspect of the13    enforcement of the criminal law, and that is that the14    tribe has no authority to stop the state from enforcing15    its criminal laws on the reservation, and one can very16    plausibly argue that along with that goes no authority to17    determine whether persons acting in that criminal law18    enforcement capacity have gone beyond the scope of their19    authority.  That's very rational.20              But I wouldn't have to extend that to other21    state officers, would I?  Because in the civil field the22    state can't just walk in and take over the enforcement of23    civil laws on the reservation.24              MR. HOWLE:  Your Honor, you're correct.  The25    state can't take over a reservation, but the state carries10                                                                                                                                QUESTION:  Professors at state universities?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425on a multitude of functions on reservations outside ofthose --          QUESTION:  Well, do you take the position thatthe state has authority to send its criminal lawenforcement officials onto a tribal reservation to carryout state criminal law functions?          MR. HOWLE:  I do take that position, but Iacknowledge that it's tentatively based --          QUESTION:  There's some question about that,isn't there?          MR. HOWLE:  There is indeed --          QUESTION:  Like the right to exclude on the partof the tribal authorities?          MR. HOWLE:  Yes, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  From the reservation?  There is no -- what would you point to for the extraordinary notionthat the state criminal law enforcement officers havetotal freedom to go on a reservation to carry out criminallaw functions?          MR. HOWLE:  I point to the fact that state --          QUESTION:  Is there some law or some case thatyou can point to for that?          MR. HOWLE:  Yes, the case of Ex rel re v.Martin, and I believe McBrattney described the existenceof state criminal jurisdiction on reservations.  It's not11                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425an exclusive jurisdiction that the tribes --          QUESTION:  For crimes committed off -- I perhapsput my hypothetical a little too broadly, but in fact thetribal courts do not have jurisdiction to try for crimescommitted off reservation, do they?  If a crime iscommitted off reservation, it's not within thejurisdiction of the tribal court, is it?  Even if it's acrime committed by a tribal member, or a tribe --          MR. HOWLE:  I think that's correct, Your Honor.I'd say it with some uncertainty --          QUESTION:  Well, I think it's pretty crucial toyour case, and I assume that to be the case.  I assumethat to be the law -- that the state has the authority toenforce its state criminal laws with regard to offensescommitted off the reservation even when that requires thestate to go on the reservation to get the culprit.          MR. HOWLE:  Yes.  That all is correct with myunderstanding, too.          QUESTION:  It's not up to the tribe to enforcethat law.  It must be up to the state to enforce it.Since only the state can enforce it, I assume the statecan go on the reservation.          MR. HOWLE:  The state also has criminaljurisdiction on reservations over a nonmember crime.          QUESTION:  If that much is right, then getting                            12                                                                                             1    the back-up of the tribal court's approval for the warrant 2    was just a polite gesture, meaning a form that was not 3    necessary legally.  In other words, here we do have an 4    investigation of something that occurred off the 5    reservation.  The warrant is to go on the reservation to 6    investigate, but the crime itself was off reservation. 7              MR. HOWLE:  That's correct, Your Honor. 8              QUESTION:  And I think Justice Scalia asked you, 9    would the tribal court have authority to prosecute a case10    that occurred off the reservation.  I think you said the11    answer was no.12              MR. HOWLE:  I think that's correct.  I am13    tentative on that answer --14              QUESTION:  But you're not certain about it.15              MR. HOWLE:  I know in this case that the tribe16    would not prosecute that crime.  I do know that for a17    certainty.18              QUESTION:  But then the next thing is that the19    crime occurs off the reservation.  The warrant is to go on20    the reservation and conduct a search there.  As you21    understand it, it is not necessary to get any permission22    of any kind from the tribe, because what the state23    official is enforcing is an investigation for a crime that24    occurred off the reservation.  Is that right?25              MR. HOWLE:  Yes, Your Honor.  I believe that the13                                                                                                                                1    state's physical jurisdictions follows its legal2    jurisdiction.3456    reservation?7              MR. HOWLE:  Correct, Your Honor, although I8    admit I          QUESTION:  So you think it was not necessary toget the tribal court's permission to carry out a searchwarrant on a house belonging to a tribal member on the9 --10              QUESTION:  I think that's an unusual11    proposition.  Do you cite anything in your brief for that12    proposition?  I thought we took it as a given that the13    tribal court had to authorize the search.14              MR. HOWLE:  In my reply brief on page eighteen,15    I've referenced some authorities that are indirectly16    related that establish a criminal jurisdiction for the17    states on reservations.  It's only by reasoning and18    inference that I get to the conclusion that we have this19    authority, and if we had not sought the tribal judge's20    approval, perhaps we'd be here on that issue as well.  I21    confess there's -- it's a great area of uncertainty, but22    it is a concurrent jurisdiction that the state and the23    tribe have on reservations.  Reservations are still part24    of the state, and so the state has to be able to perform25    these functions in order to do its job properly with law14                                                                                                                                1    enforcement.2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  I certainly wouldn't think that thestate's ability to enforce criminal laws off thereservation is going to be dependent upon whether a tribalcourt will deign to issue a search warrant or not.  Imean, that would be a tremendous incursion upon thestate's sovereignty that it can't enforce its criminallaws unless it gets a tribal court to let it go on andsearch for the offense.          MR. HOWLE:  Exactly.  And that's the position we          QUESTION:  I assume that to be pretty clear law.10111213141516171819202122232425    occur.have --          MR. HOWLE:  Yes.  Another point we've made isthe way that this --          QUESTION:  Where did you take that position,because I didn't see the --          MR. HOWLE:  I'm sorry.  It's on page eighteen ofmy reply brief, in the second paragraph.  The argumentalso incorrectly assumes state officials are powerless topursue state law enforcement objectives on a reservation,except with the tribe's consent.  And here I've identifiedthe fact that states do have authority over off-reservation crimes committed by tribal members, and thatreservations are part of the state within which they15                                                                                            1              QUESTION:  So now you are confirming that it was2    a matter of a test to ask the tribe, but it was not3    necessary.45678 not? 9          MR. HOWLE:  That's correct, Your Honor, althoughwe did ask the tribal judge on both occasions out ofdeference to the tribe.QUESTION:  And he granted permission, did heMR. HOWLE:  Yes, Your Honor.1011121314151617    reservations.18              QUESTION:  Was that, in effect, pure in Nevada?19              MR. HOWLE:  It was in the past, but it isn't20    now.  All that jurisdiction has been --          QUESTION:  What statutes are there concerningstate criminal law jurisdiction with respect to eitheron-reservation or off-reservation crimes?  Are there somefederal statutes that speak to that issue?          MR. HOWLE:  There is federal statute on thematter.  It eludes me at the moment.  Certainly Public Law280 was a grant to certain states of jurisdiction on2122    280?232425    statutes, one thing you said surprised me, and I just want16                                                                                                                                QUESTION:  Then you're not relying on Public LawMR. HOWLE:  No, we're not.QUESTION:  While we're on the subject of federal1234567 -- 89 10 11 12 13to make sure I understand it.  Is it your position -- doyou understand that there is no federal statutoryrecognition for tribal jurisdiction?          MR. HOWLE:  Not in this case, not with thistribe.  There --          QUESTION:  Well, what about other cases?  I mean          MR. HOWLE:  Treaties and statutes unique todifferent tribes, there's a whole --          QUESTION:  But there are all specific to thetribe or to the jurisdiction?  There is no generalstatutory recognition?          MR. HOWLE:  As far as I know, Your Honor, that's14    correct.1516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Why, just out of curiosity -- notquite just out of curiosity, but why didn't the defendantinstead of sort of engaging in all of these proceedingsfor ten years -- why didn't he simply remove the case tofederal court?          MR. HOWLE:  I'm sorry?  The defendant --          QUESTION:  Why didn't the defendant in this casesimply remove it to the federal court?          QUESTION:  There is no --          MR. HOWLE:  Your Honor, that goes to thequestion brought up in U.S. brief -- I don't see removal17                                                                                            1 authority.2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Well, it says -- you'd have to readthe word state to mean state or a tribe.  But one -- maybeyou can't, maybe you can't.          QUESTION:  Isn't that hard?          (Laughter)          QUESTION:  You say that as though it's thesimplest thing in the world.          QUESTION:  I thought for you it might be.          (Laughter)          QUESTION:  I mean, that is an issue.  But ifthat's possible, then doesn't that offer a perfectsolution?  There's no problem.          MR. HOWLE:  There's no perfect, exact solution.          QUESTION:  Any state official's not bothered,all he has to do is remove, and then that would be the endof any potential conflict.          MR. HOWLE:  That would be a --          QUESTION:  Mr. Howle, if that had been the case,then this Court would not have had to go through themotions it went through in those two cases that says youhave to exhaust the tribe, and then you can go into thedistrict court at the end of the line.  It's only becauseyou couldn't get out -- there was -- I am unaware of anyauthority that says you can remove from the tribal court18                                                                                             1    to any other court. 2              MR. HOWLE:  I'm not aware of any either, Your 3    Honor.  We spent three years in tribal court arguing our 4    immunity questions. 5              QUESTION:  Did you try to remove it?  Maybe it's 6    just obviously impossible to do, and if it is impossible 7    to do, then the conflict of interest that you're talking 8    about exists, but that's why I wondered -- I see a lot of 9    cases where apparently it starts off in the tribal court,10    and then they're over in the federal court, and there are11    injunctions being issued back and forth.  What's the12    basis?  Is there some -- I'm trying to see if this13    conflict of interest is necessarily there.14              QUESTION:  The basis is you can't remove.15              MR. HOWLE:  We considered removal but didn't see16    that it was specifically provided for in the statutes.  We17    also were aware of the exhaustion requirements, and we18    attempted to exhaust.19              QUESTION:  And, of course, removal would not be20    an option -- removal to a federal court would not be an21    option.  The whole matter would have to be left in tribal22    court, even though there was an enforcement action with23    respect to state criminal law, if a 1983 action hadn't24    been part of the claim, if it had just been the tribal25    claim under tribal law.  Then you would have been stuck.19                                                                                                                                 1    Even on the fanciful reading of Section 1441, you couldn't 2    get it into federal court. 3              MR. HOWLE:  Yes, Your Honor. 4              QUESTION:  My question is best reserved for the 5    Solicitor General.  I mean, you're not aware it? 6              MR. HOWLE:  Maybe he can explain -- or she, I'm 7    sorry.  On the question of immunity, we did spend three 8    years trying to exhaust this issue in tribal court, and 9    only then went to the federal court with an independent10    action.  And our position on the immunity issue is that11    immunity is a bar to suit, and it should be decided when12    it's raised.  And therefore, if the tribal court won't13    acknowledge the immunity --14              QUESTION:  What is the source of immunity law15    here?  I mean, I take it your position is it can't just be16    finally determined by the tribe but should finally be17    determined by the law of Nevada?18              MR. HOWLE:  It depends on the claim, Your Honor,19    on a 1983 claim, assuming that there's one available in20    tribal court.  I guess that would be a question of federal21    law.  The other ones would be answered in reference to the22 state law.23              QUESTION:  If it's a 1983 action, then immunity24    is determined under qualified immunity doctrines laid down25    under 1983?20                                                                                                                                          MR. HOWLE:  Possibly so, Your Honor, althoughthat is a question as well.  The whole question of whether1983 is available in tribal court, I think, is cast in1234 doubt. 56 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  What was the basis of the action inthe district court?  It was 1983, was it not?          MR. HOWLE:  In the tribal court, Your Honor?          QUESTION:  No, this case comes to us from theNinth Circuit.          MR. HOWLE:  Yes.          QUESTION:  And so there obviously must have beensome action brought in the district court.  The DistrictCourt of Nevada.          MR. HOWLE:  Nevada brought the action.          QUESTION:  Nevada brought the action.          MR. HOWLE:  It was an independent action toenjoin the tribal court after three years there.          QUESTION:  Those two cases that we had, thatsaid that's what you do.  You go to the district court.And I think in those cases they said the reason why youhave to do that is that there is no removal.  That was thewhole point of Nevada coming into the district court.  Ifyou could have removed to get there, you wouldn't have tobring an action -- an independent action.          MR. HOWLE:  Yes.21                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  I thought that there were statementsin more than one of our cases to the effect that there isno removal from tribal to federal court.  And you say youdon't know?          MR. HOWLE:  I'm not aware of language like that,Your Honor.          QUESTION:  If this case had been brought instate court under 1983, could the tribal claims that werebeing asserted under tribal law be pended to that actionin state court?          MR. HOWLE:  They could be presented to thecourt, Your Honor, and then I think it would be a matterof comity for the supreme court to consider whether or notto acknowledge those claims brought under tribal law.  Itwould be up to the state supreme court, ultimately, so itwould be a question of state law.          QUESTION:  In other words, these claims undertribal law are left to the grace of the state.  The statecan allow them if it wants to, disallow them if it wantsto.  So you're saying, as far as tribal law is concerned,the tribe has no authority, and the state is not obligedto hear those claims.          MR. HOWLE:  Ultimately yes, that's correct, Your          QUESTION:  As you understand it, where does the                            22                                                                                            101112131415161718192021222324    Honor.251 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425tribe get its tort law?  Does it borrow Nevada law?          MR. HOWLE:  As I understand it, yes.  It does -- it uses Nevada law as a guide, which makes it veryuncertain, but it does refer to Nevada law quite often.          QUESTION:  And as you understand the complaint,is the liability under Nevada tort law as borrowed by thetribe, roughly coextensive with the liability under 1983,other than say for attorney's fees?          MR. HOWLE:  Well, first of all the state tortlaw supplies limits or caps on claims, which aren'tavailable under 1983 actions, so there is some --          QUESTION:  Does the tribal law borrow those capsas well, as you understand?          MR. HOWLE:  As I understand it, they would not,Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Well, then, the liability iscoextensive under the tort law theories and under 1983.          MR. HOWLE:  If this were in tribal court, YourHonor, as I understand it.          QUESTION:  All right.  And the tribal courtdoesn't borrow Nevada law insofar as the caps areconcerned, as best you understand?          MR. HOWLE:  That's correct, although I don'thave an expressed statement from the court.          QUESTION:  What is -- the tribal law is                            23                                                                                             1    codified, or is it just common law developed by the tribal 2    court, case by case? 3              MR. HOWLE:  A little of the first and a lot of 4    the latter, Your Honor.  There isn't law and order code, 5    but a great deal of it, I think, is just the custom in6 practice. 7              QUESTION:  Law and order code is civil actions, 8    or just criminal? 9              MR. HOWLE:  It includes civil matters, I10    believe, as well as criminal.11              QUESTION:  Can I still -- I'm not going to give12    up yet on getting your opinion on this.13              MR. HOWLE:  Okay.14              QUESTION:  What the Solicitor General precisely15    recommends is recognizing the policy of the removal16    statute, namely remove -- that's the policy -- that you17    could have what the court did in El Paso which is, quote,18    an injunction given by a federal court against further19    litigation in tribal courts that in practical effect gives20    the same result as a removal.  Now, that's the Solicitor21    General's precise -- which then just like removal would22    eliminate any possibility of conflict between state and23    tribal interests.  So that's what I'd like your comment24 on. 25                                                                                                                                MR. HOWLE:  Okay, Your Honor.  We see a                  241 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425difficulty with the U.S. position, because it works verywell for the federal civil rights claims.  Those areimmediately removed.  The difficulty is with tribalclaims, because there -- the U.S. suggests there's afederal defense, but that --          QUESTION:  In your case it would resolve becausethe whole case would come along, and what you'd say aboutother cases is sufficient unto the day.          MR. HOWLE:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  I guess normally when you remove, theentire case goes with the --          MR. HOWLE:  Yes.          QUESTION:  So if the injunction is the same asremoval, you get to the result that you want in respect toall of the claim.          MR. HOWLE:  Unless there were not a federalclaim to begin with in order to remove it.your --I'd like to reserve the rest of my time withQUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Howle.Mr. Anaya, we'll hear from you.    ORAL ARGUMENT OF S. JAMES ANAYA       ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS          MR. ANAYA:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court:25                                                                                             9101112131415161718192021222324          MR. ANAYA:  We disagree, and the authority ofthis Court will indicate the contrary.          QUESTION:  And what do you rely on?          MR. ANAYA:  Williams v. Lee, and its progeny,Your Honor, which establishes clearly that the sovereigntyof tribes precludes the authority of the state to theextent it interferes with the ability of the tribe to makeits own laws and be governed by them.          QUESTION:  But it's not governed by its owncriminal laws insofar as a crime that occurs off thereservation is concerned.  Could this tribal court havetried this crime?          MR. ANAYA:  Your Honor, the tribal court -- ifthis were a crime under tribal law, and it is not a crimeunder tribal law as far as I know.          QUESTION:  The tribe can make off-reservationcrimes a crime under tribal law triable in the tribal25 court?          This case began when Nevada game wardens soughtthe approval of Fallon tribal court not once but twice, inorder to come on the Fallon reservation and conduct asearch against a tribal member.          QUESTION:  Well, the petitioner says they didn'teven need to get tribal court permission to get a search1234567    warrant.826                                       1              MR. ANAYA:  It could as to members, perhaps. 2              QUESTION:  Oh, crimes by members. 3              MR. ANAYA:  By members. 4              QUESTION:  Not crimes against members. 5              MR. ANAYA:  Yes, Your Honor. 6              QUESTION:  And what if they did make it triable 7    in tribal court -- would the state still be able to 8    prosecute it as a violation of state law? 9              MR. ANAYA:  The state could, in any instance,10    prosecute this case.  What is at issue here is whether it11    can go onto the reservation to execute a warrant.12              QUESTION:  Well, the state's ability to13    prosecute is not worth a whole lot if it leaves the by14    your leave of somebody else to go and grab the person who15    allegedly did the offense.16              MR. ANAYA:  That may be.17              QUESTION:  That's what you're saying -- that the18    state is entirely at the mercy of the tribal court to get19    a search warrant, and I presume an arrest warrant as well.                MR. ANAYA:  Yes, Your Honor, that is what I'm2021    saying.22232425          QUESTION:  That's quite an incursion on thestate's criminal jurisdiction, it seems to me.          MR. ANAYA:  The state judge who issued the statewarrant agreed with that position.  The state judge27                                      1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9himself explicitly said on the face of the warrant thatthe warrant was invalid within the reservation --          QUESTION:  He might have been wrong.  I don'tknow the man.          MR. ANAYA:  Well, he could be wrong, but we --he got it right as far as our position goes, Your Honor.The Attorney General of Nevada himself has issued anopinion, has issued an opinion saying that the state hasno authority to go on the reservation to execute searchesor investigate crimes against members.1011121314151617    --18              QUESTION:  Was that opinion an opinion of state19    law?202122232425          MR. ANAYA:  Yes.  Well, it was an opinion offederal law.          QUESTION:  He was applying federal -- theAttorney General of Nevada was --          MR. ANAYA:  The opinion was applying aninterpretation of federal law, and the lower court have28                                                                                            QUESTION:  Where is that?MR. ANAYA:  Your Honor, that's not in our brief.QUESTION:  I didn't think it was, and I wouldhave sat up, and my eyes would have popped open.          (Laughter)MR. ANAYA:  Well, Your Honor, we were surprised 1    held the same. 2              QUESTION:  What about John Marshall,  Cherokee 3    Nation v. Georgia? 4              MR. ANAYA:  Exactly, Your Honor.  The laws of 5    the state of Georgia have no force in the territory of the6 Cherokee. 7              QUESTION:  But that doesn't quite resolve this 8    question, it seems to me.  Is there some case authority, 9    either in the Nevada courts or the federal courts, that a10    federal -- that a state official seeking to enforce a11    federal, state summons or subpoena or arrest warrant can't12    go on the reservation unless the --13              MR. ANAYA:  Yes, Your Honor.  The Turtle case.14              QUESTION:  The what?15              MR. ANAYA:  The Turtle case that we cited.  I16    believe it's the Ninth Circuit, which specifically17    precluded Arizona from going onto the Navajo reservation18    and trying to execute a warrant against people on the19    reservation.202122232425          QUESTION:  Suppose this had been a federalofficer executing a similar warrant investigatingviolation of federal --          MR. ANAYA:  Well, that would be a differentmatter, Your Honor.  Under the Major Crimes Act, federalofficers do have jurisdiction over the reservations.  This29                                                                                            1    is a state officer, and the weight of authority in the2    lower federal courts and in the state courts interpreting3    federal law is that state authorities do not have the4    authority to go on the reservation and execute warrants -5- 678910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Turtle?  What else?  That's a NinthCircuit case, I gather, right?          MR. ANAYA:  Well, we have authority -- theAttorney General's opinion that I cited to.          QUESTION:  I'd like the cite of that.          MR. ANAYA:  The Attorney General's OpinionNumber 80-42.  Nevada Highway Patrol Jurisdiction onIndian Reservations.  Nevada -- again, Opinion Number 80-42, and we can make this available --          QUESTION:  Wait -- Nevada Highway Patrol.  It'sjust related to what?  The Highway Patrol doing what?          MR. ANAYA:  Does Nevada Highway Patrol actingunder the authority granted by the state, have theauthority to investigate accidents on a reservation?  Togo onto the reservation, investigate accidents --          QUESTION:  An accident that occurred on the                            30                                                                                                      QUESTION:  How much of the authority pertains tocrimes committed off reservation?          MR. ANAYA:  Most of it, Your Honor, or a gooddeal of it, at least, and the Turtle case is -- 1    reservation? 2              MR. ANAYA:  Occurring wherever -- to investigate 3    accidents on the reservation, even to pursue someone onto 4    the reservation.  And the Nevada Attorney General, citing 5    federal authority, citing the opinions of other state 6    courts, says no.  This is the common understanding.  This 7    was the understanding of the state judge who issued the 8    warrant.  It was the understanding of the tribal 9    authorities that the state authorities could not go onto10    the reservation.11              QUESTION:  It's not the understanding of the12    state here.  They had an epiphany or something.13              MR. ANAYA:  I think that's right -- they did14    have an epiphany.  In their opening brief, they didn't15    pick this position.  They did not pick this position.  You16    will recall that Mr. Howle, in articulating the position,17    now referred to the reply brief.  He did not reply to the18    opening brief.  This came as a surprise to us.  If they19    had taken that position, you can be sure we would have20    included sufficient authority for the proposition that the21    state authorities cannot go onto the reservation to22    investigate crimes committed even off of the reservation23    by nonmembers, or allegedly by nonmembers.24              QUESTION:  Mr. Anaya, we've gotten pretty far25    afield, I think, from what we have to resolve in this31                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425case, possibly, and there is remaining, as I understandit, a suit by Mr. Hicks against a state official in hisindividual capacity.          MR. ANAYA:  Your Honor, that's correct.          QUESTION:  And some other people too?          MR. ANAYA:  Yes.  No.  They're all stateofficials.   Three state officers who participated.          QUESTION:  And that remains.  In theirindividual capacity.  The official capacity suits havebeen dropped.          MR. ANAYA:  That is correct.          QUESTION:  The state says these officials havepersonal immunity from that suit.          MR. ANAYA:  Yes, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  In tribal court.          MR. ANAYA:  Yes.          QUESTION:  And that issue was raised by them inthe tribal court, right?          MR. ANAYA:  It's ambiguous.  They raised it inthe context of a motion to quash service of process.  Theyraised the threshold of jurisdictional issues andconflated what appeared to be personal immunity defenseswith those.          QUESTION:  And the tribal court declined towhat?  Rule specifically on the personal individual32                                                                                            1 immunity? 23 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. ANAYA:  That's correct, Your Honor.  Thetribal court only reached the threshold --          QUESTION:  The subject matter jurisdiction?          MR. ANAYA:  That is correct.          QUESTION:  And then the state went to federaldistrict court and said, you, federal district court,should decide these issues.  Is that right?          MR. ANAYA:  That's correct.  The state wentimmediately to federal district court.  The state couldhave --          QUESTION:  Well, immediately after three years.          MR. ANAYA:  After a month, after about twoweeks, I think.          QUESTION:  A month.  Okay.          MR. ANAYA:  In that time period --          QUESTION:  All right.          MR. ANAYA:  -- after the court ruled.          QUESTION:  And the district court did not dealwith individual immunity allegations?          MR. ANAYA:  It did not.  The state could haveimmediately moved for a motion to dismiss.  At that timewe presumed that the tribal court would convene anevidentiary hearing and would have heard the personalimmunity defenses, would have heard --33                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  No, by now we're in the federaldistrict court.          MR. ANAYA:  That's right.          QUESTION:  And the district court didn't dealwith it, and then it went to the Ninth Circuit Court ofAppeals, and it didn't deal with that issue, either.          MR. ANAYA:  The district court, nor the circuitcourt, dealt with the personal immunity defenses becausethey applied the rule of exhaustion.          QUESTION:  Is there a 1983 action here, or not?          MR. ANAYA:  The complaint by Mr. --          QUESTION:  It isn't clear to me.          MR. ANAYA:  The complaint by Mr. Hicks beforethe tribal court pleads violations of United Statesconstitutional law.  Those allegations have been treatedas allegations under Section 1983.          QUESTION:  Well, do you represent Mr. Hicks?          MR. ANAYA:  Yes, I do.          QUESTION:  And is it a 1983 action, or is it          MR. ANAYA:  We -- it is a 1983 action.1011121314151617181920    not?212223    territory of the United States that can interpret 4224    U.S.C. 1983 without review by this Court?  I suppose25    France or England could apply 1983 and we couldn't review34                                                                                                                                QUESTION:  Are you aware of any court within the1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9their -- are you aware of any court interpretation?          MR. ANAYA:  I am not.  I am not, and we're notcontending necessarily the tribal courts would not besubject to review.          QUESTION:  Well, how would that happen?          MR. ANAYA:  It would happen along the devicethat Justice Souter has suggested -- excuse me, JusticeBreyer has suggested -- a device that the United Stateshas suggested as well --          QUESTION:  Even apart from removal?          MR. ANAYA:  Well, that wouldn't be a review, butthat would be a device by which the action could be heardby the federal court.          QUESTION:  You mean injunction?          MR. ANAYA:  Yes, an injunction.  Anotherpossibility --          QUESTION:  You mean an injunction after thetribal court has ruled on the issue, then you enjoin thetribal court because it's made a mistake in interpretationof federal law?          MR. ANAYA:  Your Honor --          QUESTION:  It seems to me that that's more          MR. ANAYA:  It is.                            35                                                                                            1011121314151617181920212223    intrusive24    --251 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112    court?13              MR. ANAYA:  Your Honor, Mr. Hicks at this point14    would choose not to take a position because in litigating15    the case in the tribal court, if this Court were to affirm16    jurisdiction, he would have to explore his options whether17    or not it would be to his advantage to seek some kind of18    review depending upon the tribal court, however --19              QUESTION:  Suppose, at least so far as I were20    concerned -- and I can't speak for my colleagues -- that21    the case turned on whether or not there ultimately could22    be review in the federal court.  Then I would say you23    would have to lose, because you have indicated to me that24    that review is problematic, or at least reserving your25    position, and you're later going to say there is no36                                                                                                                                          QUESTION:  -- than what they're asking for here.          MR. ANAYA:  And we are not saying that we wouldfavor that approach.          QUESTION:  All right.  So under your position,there is no way to review a ruling on a matter of federallaw given by the tribal court.          MR. ANAYA:  That is yet to be determined --could be determined by the lower courts.          QUESTION:  What is your position as to whetheror not a ruling on an issue of federal law in a tribalcourt in this suit can be reviewed ultimately in a federal1 review. 2345678 -- 910111213141516171819202122    court.2324 25          MR. ANAYA:  I simply articulated the position toMr. Hicks.  The position of the tribe and the tribal courtin this case is that there could be review.  There couldbe review after exhaustion, and that would be theappropriate --          QUESTION:  After exhaustion?  I could imagine          QUESTION:  May I just pursue?  And that reviewconsists of an injunction for some kind of abuse ofdiscretion by the trial court, or --          MR. ANAYA:  That would be more the removaltheory of the United States.          QUESTION:  Suppose the removal theory doesn'twork -- is there any other way to review it?          MR. ANAYA:  The review mechanism would worksomething along the lines of the following although,again, this is uncharted territory.  The claims would beexhausted in tribal court, and then assuming that thedefendants were to lose, they could then go to the federalcourt and seek some kind of relief against the tribal          QUESTION:  What -- some kind of -- what kind ofrelief?  I've never heard of such a procedure.          MR. ANAYA:  Well, it would be the same kind of -                            37                                                                                             1    - essentially the same kind of action that defendants have 2    taken in order to challenge the jurisdiction of trial 3    courts -- essentially an injunction action.  But in the 4    course of determining whether or not an injunction should 5    lie, the court would then review the jurisdictional issues 6    as well as the merits, or at least the application of the 7    law in the Section 1983 action. 8              QUESTION:  Why shouldn't the federal court have 9    decided these issues of immunity of the officers when it10    had the case before it?11              MR. ANAYA:  It applied the rule of exhaustion12    that this Court laid down in National Farmers Union, as13    well as Iowa Mutual v. LaPlante.14              QUESTION:  Well, that case really just went to15    exhaustion on the jurisdictional issue.16              MR. ANAYA:  Yes, they did, but it could be that17    the exhaustion could also apply to the merits, and indeed18 could.19202122232425          QUESTION:  But did the district court have thepower to decide that issue when it had the case in frontof it?          MR. ANAYA:  Strictly speaking, I believe it did.This Court has articulated the exhaustion rule as one ofcomity, and so out of comity, out of respect for thetribal court --38                                                                                             1              QUESTION:  But it is correct, is it not, that 2    we've never held that there must be exhaustion of anything 3    other than the jurisdictional issues? 4              MR. ANAYA:  Yes, Your Honor, that is the case. 5    But the exhaustion doctrine is a flexible one, and it is 6    intended to accommodate the interests that might -- 7              QUESTION:  But the exhaustion doctrine assumes 8    that there is some later substantive power to exercise 9    jurisdiction over the case, but you question whether that10    power ultimately exists.  You don't have exhaustion if11    there's not going to be some further jurisdictional12    substantive review.13              MR. ANAYA:  The position of the tribe in this14    case is that there could be substantive review, and --15              QUESTION:  As I understand it, the tribe's16    position would allow for an injunction on either or both17    of two grounds.  One, of course, the jurisdictional issue18    could be reviewed again as the basis for the injunction,19    and if the tribe won the jurisdictional issue, then20    presumably the merits of the 1983 claim could also be21    litigated in the federal court, and if the federal court22    thought the tribal court was wrong on that, it would23    enjoin enforcement of the judgment.  Is that correct?  Is24    that the way it would work?25              MR. ANAYA:  Yes, Your Honor.39                                                                                                                                 1              QUESTION:  But you'd have to wait until the end 2    of the line, and that seems to be at odds with the notion 3    of qualified immunity that you get out sooner rather than 4    later.  Here your positing a case -- and I think the Ninth 5    Circuit supported it -- that you must exhaust in the 6    tribal court, even your qualified immunity defense, you 7    must exhaust in the tribal court before you can come over 8    to seek an injunctive relief in the federal court. 9              MR. ANAYA:  Right.  The way we contemplate it10    working, if such an exhaustion were to apply to a 198311    cause of action or to the tribal cause of action in this12    case, would be for the tribal court to immediately move13    forward to determine the qualified or personal immunity14    defenses.  And at that point, the defendant could go to15    federal court to seek review of that prior to an16    adjudication of the merits of the claim in the tribal17 court.18              QUESTION:  Even in the federal court system, as19    I recall it, we allow the denial of qualified immunity to20    be appealed immediately, because, you know, the belief is21    that the important interests served by it are simply22    defeated if you wait until the whole litigation is23    finished before you tell the governmental agent, well, you24    don't have to worry about it.  Why should there be a25    different rule when we go that far to allow such an40                                                                                                                                 1    interlocutory appeal in the federal system?  It seems very 2    strange to require the government official to go all the 3    way through the tribal court and await an injunction 4    afterwards. 5              MR. ANAYA:  Well, what we're suggesting, or what 6    the model would suggest, is that there would be the 7    opportunity to go immediately upon a determination in the 8    tribal court of the qualified immunity defense to the 9    federal court, so it would be in the nature of a10    interlocutory review.11              QUESTION:  Then if you lost and you went back12    and you exhausted on the merits, there would be another13    opportunity to go into the federal court for a different14    injunction.1516171819202122232425          MR. ANAYA:  Yes, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Okay.  I didn't understand.  Youwould allow it immediately as soon as the qualifiedimmunity --          QUESTION:  But would it not have been consistentwith our cases for the district court in this case to havesaid I'm going to decide the qualified immunity issueright away.  He didn't do that -- it would have beenconsistent with our cases for the district judge to havedone that, would it not?          MR. ANAYA:  Perhaps, Your Honor, but the                            41                                                                                             1    rationale of National Farmers Union of Iowa Mutual, I 2    think, counseled in favor of what the district court did. 3              QUESTION:  If you assume the rationale of 4    exhaustion applies beyond jurisdictional issues. 5              MR. ANAYA:  Yes, Your Honor.  And I think -- 6              QUESTION:  It has not been decided. 7              MR. ANAYA:  And I think it does.  The rationale 8    is to support the self-governance of the tribe, and to 9    support the development of tribal courts and their10    autonomy.  And for the district court to have ruled on11    something --12              QUESTION:  Yes, but it supports them to the same13    extent that it would respect the sovereignty of the14    states.  Of course, if it were a state court involved,15    they would respect the jurisdiction, require exhaustion on16    the jurisdictional issue, but nevertheless might have gone17    ahead on the merits, if this were a state court rather18    than a tribal court.  You're in effect asking for a19    stronger rule of exhaustion in tribal courts than if it20    were a state court.21              MR. ANAYA:  Well, Your Honor, we think that the22    situation here is one in which we have a tribal court23    struggling to maintain its jurisdiction, and the deference24    that the exhaustion doctrine gives to tribal courts is25    warranted, and the interests of the state officials -- the42                                                                                                                                 1    federal interest that might exist in ensuring that their 2    interests are protected, are sufficiently met by the 3    exhaustion rule as long as there is some kind of review 4    and, perhaps, an interlocutory review of the personal 5    immunity defenses. 6              QUESTION:  Do tribal courts routinely hear 7    Section 1983 federal claims? 8              MR. ANAYA:  Not routinely, Your Honor, but there 9    is nothing -- there is no federal law that precludes them10    from hearing a 1983 claim.  The Fallon tribal court is a11    court of general jurisdiction.  The 1983 statute is a12    jurisdiction intended to provide broad remedies for13    violations of constitutional rights and, in the absence of14    an affirmative limitation on the jurisdiction of the15    court, the tribal court, under federal law, it seems to16    follow quite naturally that the Fallon tribal court as a17    court of general jurisdiction would have jurisdiction to18    hear a Section 1983 --19              QUESTION:  It is still not clear to me the20    theory on which any such -- any tribal court21    determinations on such matters can be reviewed in any22    federal court.  What is the theory?23              MR. ANAYA:  The theory is that there is a24    federal interest in ensuring that the state defendants'25    immunity defenses would be sufficiently aired --43                                                                                                                                1              QUESTION:  So is it a federal question?  Use2    federal question jurisdiction to this --3              MR. ANAYA:  Well, that's right.  This would4    assume that immunity defenses would be defenses under5    federal law, and that is the position that the United6    States has taken, and it's a position that the tribe7    accepts -- that these defenses could become federal law8    and hence they would be the basis for review in federal9 court.          QUESTION:  There are other situations where wejust fire off injunctions where we think a federalinterest may be involved?  Do we have authority to do10111213    that?14              MR. ANAYA:  This is a unique context, Your15    Honor.16171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Yeah, it sure is.          MR. ANAYA:  It is.  And the unique context andwrinkles that exist here are because of historicalsituations and patterns that have existed, that havearisen and continued, and require this Court to --          QUESTION:  Well, maybe they require.  I mean,there are two conclusions that you could draw from theabsence of any review provision in the tribal court for a1983 action.  One is that we could invent some never-before-heard-of, and never-elsewhere-used power of this44                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Court or federal courts to issue an injunction.  The otherone is that the tribal court has no authority to entertain1983 actions.  That would solve the problem just as well,wouldn't it?          MR. ANAYA:  That would solve the problem, justlike --          QUESTION:  But not your client's problem.  Iunderstand that.          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Anaya.          Ms. McDowell, we'll hear from you.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA MCDOWELL              ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES          AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING AFFIRMANCE          MS. MCDOWELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          The tribal court has jurisdiction over Mr.Hicks' civil damages suit against the state game wardensin their personal capacities.          QUESTION:  Well, how about a 1983 action?          MS. MCDOWELL:  Well, we would say that thefederal courts have concurrent jurisdiction over that sortof action, as in El Paso Natural Gas.  We think that thereshould be an opportunity effectively to remove the case tofederal court through an injunction.          QUESTION:  I agree, but does it exist?                            45                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9                MS. MCDOWELL:  To the extent it existed in El      Paso, Your Honor, it exists here as well.  Congress has      expressed its preference for a federal forum at a      defendant's request when he has been sued on a federal      cause of action.  That occurs through the removal statute      when the defendant is sued in state court.                QUESTION:  But the Wheeler Act -- is that the      Act -- the Nuclear Power Act -- had a specific provision      for exclusive jurisdiction.  We don't have that here.                MS. MCDOWELL:  Exclusive jurisdiction, Your                QUESTION:  The El Paso case was not a removal                MS. MCDOWELL:  Yes, it was, with respect, Your15    Honor.  It was a removal case.  It was a case in which10111213    case.14Honor --16    there was --17              QUESTION:  Excuse me -- there was an underlying18    congressional act which gave exclusive jurisdiction.19              MS. MCDOWELL:  Only if the defendant raised it,20    Your Honor, the case would be free to proceed in state21    court for a nuclear tort, or in tribal court, unless the22    defendant sought a federal forum. That was the case in El23    Paso as we understand it, and that would also be the case24    here.  The cases under 1983 could proceed in tribal court,25    but if the defendant elects a federal forum, he should be46                                                                                                                                 1    entitled to that at the outset of the case so that the 2    trial of the facts -- 3              QUESTION:  Really making up a statute that 4    Congress didn't pass because that's what happens -- a 5    federal officer is sued in state court.  He can remove it. 6    Why can he remove it?  Because Congress has said so.  So 7    here Congress has said nothing at all. 8              MS. MCDOWELL:  Well, that's correct, Your Honor. 9    That was also the case in El Paso, but the court didn't10    think that Congress' silence in that instance reflected11    any specific intent to leave the case in tribal court if a12    defendant wanted it in --13              QUESTION:  But they don't have to have any14    intent to leave it in trial court, you need an intent to15    get it removed from tribal court.  The extant state of16    affairs is what it is.  What we're looking for is some17    reason to remove it.18              MS. MCDOWELL:  Well, the reason to remove it is19    because the plaintiff has asserted a federal cause of20    action, and we would think that Congress would want a21    defendant sued in tribal court to have the same right as22    the defendants sued in state court to get a federal forum.23    We think that Congress' failure to provide in Section 144124    for removal from tribal court was inadvertent, it doesn't25    reflect a policy choice on the part of Congress that such47                                                                                                                                 1    cases should remain in tribal court.  Simply the fact that 2    -- 3              QUESTION:  No, I don't mean to cut you off -- I 4    thought maybe you would address this.  El Paso was a 5    stronger case for your position in one respect, at least, 6    because in El Paso, I think, as I recall it, the federal 7    statute preempted all other causes of action so that the 8    federal right was, in effect, was exclusive, because you 9    don't have that feature here.10              So if there's an injunction in this case on the11    El Paso model, it in effect would leave the litigation to12    go forward on non-1983 claims arising, I mean, for13    example, tribal tort claims.  So the result would sort of14    be a bifurcation of the litigation and sort of a mess, and15    you didn't have that feature in El Paso.  Shouldn't that16    bear on the question of whether or not we want to follow17    the El Paso model here?18              MS. MCDOWELL:  We don't think that would be the19    necessary result, Your Honor.  As with removal from state20    court, any pendent state causes of action follow the21    federal cause of action.22              QUESTION:  Okay, but I mean this is getting Rube23    Goldberg.  Now there's another rule and pendent24    jurisdictional claims are now being removed by means of a25    novel use of injunction.  I mean, there's a character here48                                                                                                                                 1    that we're making up an awful lot as we go along on your 2    theory. 3              MS. MCDOWELL:  Well, there is a common law 4    nature to much of this Court's jurisprudence with respect 5    to Indian law, certainly the cases -- 6              QUESTION:  But what is the justification, then, 7    for saying to the tribes that they could not proceed in 8    their related tort actions in the tribal courts merely 9    because we think the 1983 action should be enjoined for10    purposes of quasi-removal.  What is the basis for saying11    that they can't receive in their own courts under their12 own law?13              MS. MCDOWELL:  Well, they certainly can choose14    to proceed in their own courts.  They're the masters of15    their complaints, and they can drop the 1983 --16              QUESTION:  No, but what I'm getting at is your17    notion that all -- that these tribal tort law claims would18    be deemed pendent to the 1983 actions and enjoined with19    them.  I am saying what is your basis for saying -- is it20    simply a basis of convenience to the defendant?21              MS. MCDOWELL:  Well, that's typically the22    treatment of state law claims when we remove to federal23    court.242549                                                                                                                                          QUESTION:  But we've got a statute on it.  We'vegot a statute. 1              QUESTION:  How does it work?  That is, in your 2    view on the tribal claims.  Your view is that the torts - 3    - if the tribe -- suppose the tribe has a strict liability 4    tort theory and there is no defense of official action, 5    and it says that all the FBI agents, Bivens agents, 6    Department of Interior agents, anybody you want in the 7    federal government, is now going to be strictly liable for 8    their torts, okay?  Now, in your view they could just go 9    do that.  That's the government's view.  That's the10    federal government's view.1112    defenses.13141516    reservations.17              QUESTION:  So if they're going to have -- and18    are we now going to have a new sort of federal government19    thing we're making up, which -- well, then why not have it20    all in the federal court?  I mean, I'm a little worried21    about what we're getting into when we're making these22    things up.  That's not meant to be a criticism -- I'm just23    quite -- having a hard time foreseeing where this case is24 going. 25                                                                                                                                MS. MCDOWELL:  There would be federal immunityQUESTION:  But where do they come from?          MS. MCDOWELL:  They come from the federalgovernment's unique interest in law enforcement onQUESTION:  Why does the federal government have                  50 1    a unique interest in law enforcement?  My goodness -- it's 2    not only not unique, its interest in law enforcement is a 3    good deal less than that of the states.  They do most of 4    the law enforcement in this country. 5              MS. MCDOWELL:  Not with respect to Indian 6    reservations, Your Honor.  The federal government is the 7    principal law enforcement authority on the reservations. 8    It is delegated some of that authority -- 9              QUESTION:  Not with respect to state crimes that10    occur off the reservation.  I mean, I can see the state -11    - can I ask you?  It matters to me -- it may not matter to12    anybody else, but can you resolve the conflict here as to13    whether state officers are allowed just on the basis of a14    state warrant to enter a reservation to pursue a criminal15    from state justice for a crime that occurred off the16    reservation?17              MS. MCDOWELL:  Not in the circumstances of this18    case.  Footnote seven of our brief cites some cases on the19    proposition.  I think the way of looking at this is in the20    state/state context.  If somebody commits a criminal21    offense in Nevada, yes, Nevada has the right to prosecute22    that offense, but if the person goes to California,23    perhaps even lives in California, if Nevada wants to24    execute a search warrant against that person's California25    home, the Nevada warrant isn't self-executing.  There is a51                                                                                                                                 1    need to go to a California court to get approval of the 2    search, and we would say that the same model applies in 3    the state/tribe situation. 4              QUESTION:  In that situation, I'm just thinking, 5    aren't you really on the other side?  Imagine this is only 6    the 1983 action.  What's the difference between your 7    position and their position?  Their position is that the 8    1983 action has to be brought in federal court.  Your 9    position is that it has to be brought in federal court as10    long as the defendant wants to do it.  That seems to me11    the only practical difference.  Am I right?12              MS. MCDOWELL:  As a practical matter, that may13    well be correct.14              QUESTION:  Then you have to think that the Ninth15    Circuit got it all wrong here, because as I take it,16    you're saying we let the tribal members sue in tribal17    court, but the defendant state officer the next day can18    remove it and there's nothing that the tribe or the tribal19    member can do about it.  It's just kind of we let them20    park for an hour in the tribal court, and then the federal21    officer has the control, or the state officer has the22    control, can get it immediately into a federal court.  Is23    that your position?24              MS. MCDOWELL:  Yes, although the tribal25    plaintiff would have the opportunity to amend his52                                                                                                                                 1    complaint to assert only tribal causes of action, in which 2    case the case would remain at least initially in tribal3 court. 4              QUESTION:  What about the officer's position?  I 5    don't care whether they say it's tribal or 1983 -- I am 6    cloaked with immunity because I was executing a state 7    warrant, and that should be resolved in a state or federal 8    forum, not in a tribal forum. 9              MS. MCDOWELL:  I would disagree with that.  We10    believe that the state officers' personal immunities are11    matters that should be presented first to the tribal12    court, and then only subsequently to the federal court.13              QUESTION:  So that this case could remain in14    tribal court if they just alleged tribal torts, the15    officer says I have qualified immunity, I don't want that16    resolved in tribal court, but it belongs in tribal court,17    in your view of this?18              MS. MCDOWELL:  In our view, in the ordinary19    course the state officer defendant should raise the20    defense first in tribal court and then would have review21    of the defense under the National Farmers Union approach22    in federal court after exhaustion.23              QUESTION:  How far?  How far?  It's only under24    the tribal code.  Qualified immunity is the defense.  At25    what point does that get over into a federal court?53                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MS. MCDOWELL:  May I answer?          QUESTION:  Yes, shortly.          MS. MCDOWELL:  If there's not an opportunitybefore trial for the defense to reach federal court, wewould say exhaustion shouldn't be required.          QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. McDowell.  Mr. Howle,you have four minutes remaining.            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF C. WAYNE HOWLE                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. HOWLE:  Thank you, You Honor.  One of ourmajor concerns in this case is the non-federal claim intribal court, because that's problematic.  The removal ofthe non-federal claim if there's no federal claim to whichit's pendent loses really in tribal court.  And even ifthere's review of the immunity defense, ultimately infederal court, there's no basis for federal courtjurisdiction to review the judgment.          And so it leaves us exactly where we started,which is at the mercy of the tribal court.  That is aderogation of state sovereignty.  This isn't the kind oftreatment that the federal government would accept for itsown officials, and the reference I would make, if I may,in the U.S. brief is footnote twenty-two on page twenty-nine where the whole theory of federal officer immunitiesis set out.  And in the end they conclude, just as we54                                                                                             1    have, that because of the status of the tribes as 2    dependent sovereigns within the federal system, additional 3    considerations may apply to the exercise of tribal court 4    jurisdiction over federal officers even when sued in their 5    personal capacities.  That's exactly what we're asking for 6    in this case as state officers.  We're not asking for any 7    more than the federal government. 8              And perhaps the difference here is due to the 9    fact that the U.S. views states and tribes as coordinate10    sovereigns.  Coordinate sovereigns.  And tribes and states11    are not coordinate sovereigns, they're different.  States12    and tribes are fundamentally different.  State immunities13    have a constitutional dimension, whereas tribes have been14    implicitly divested of their sovereignty to the extent15    that it's inconsistent with their status.  And that's our16    ultimate position in the case and explains the position we17    take.  Thank you, Your Honor.18              QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Howle.19              MR. HOWLE:  Thank you, Your Honor.20              CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  The case is submitted.21              (Whereupon, at 12:05 a.m., the case in the22    above-entitled matter was submitted.)23 24 2555
