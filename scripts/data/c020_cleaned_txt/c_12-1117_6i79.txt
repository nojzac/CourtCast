Rickard.      Mr. Mosley.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL MOSLEYON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. MOSLEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      The Sixth Circuit completely failed toanalyze the second prong of a qualified immunity defensein this case, and that is whether the law was clearlyestablished at the time of the incident in question,such that every reasonable officer would know whether ornot the action was constitutional or not.  Therefore,the petitioners were not given fair warning that the useof force in this case, if it was prohibited, wasprohibited, and they retain immunity, and the SixthCircuit must be reversed.      This is the argument we ­­ we wish toemphasize today relating to the second prong, what wastraditionally the second prong before Saucier, ofcourse, the rigid order of battle was changed.      Had the Sixth Circuit reviewed its own casesas of 2004, it should have concluded that Petitioners4￼￼1 were entitled to qualified immunity.2 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought it said3 not say in its opinion that there was room for4 disagreement or whether this was reasonable or5 they have some such statement?6 MR. MOSLEY: They could not conclude that it7 was reasonable as a matter of law is the statement I8 recall, Justice Scalia. And ­­ and in that regard,9 that's a legal question. It had to answer that10 question, but it didn't do so with reference to prior11 case law of 2004. If anything, it looked at Scott v.12 Harris from 2007 and said that there was a factual13 distinction between Scott, and the devil was in the14 details; and, therefore, it affirmed the district court,15 which, I submit, made the same mistake because the16 district court was looking at Smith v. Cupp from the17 Sixth Circuit, which was a 2005 opinion, to determine18 whether or not the officers violated clearly established19 law.20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would the court, in your21 view, ever have an occasion to decide whether conduct of22 this nature violates the Fourth Amendment? If you ­­23 you were right about clearly ­­ clearly established,24 then could this ­­ could the underlying constitutional25 question ever be, what would be the posture of the case5­­ did itnot? Did￼1 in which it could be decided?2 MR. MOSLEY: Well, I mean, we've argued, of3 course, in our briefs, Justice Ginsburg, that it should4 be decided in this case, although today we're5 emphasizing the second prong. But what would be the6 posture of such a case? The United States has suggested7 that there's factual complexities in this case that make8 it difficult for the Court to rule whether or not, on9 the merits, there was a constitutional violation.10 And I'm not ­­ of course, we ­­ we differ11 with that to the extent that we've argued there was not12 a constitutional violation. But as in Pearson where the13 issue of whether the law was clearly established can be14 resolved relatively easily, I submit that ­­ that in15 this case, that is the case, and the Court should rule16 that Petitioners were entitled to qualified immunity.17 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it the case that the18 court has discretion to reach the second prong if it19 wants to? The court could say it wasn't reasonably ­­20 it wasn't clearly established, but it was an21 unreasonable seizure. It could do that, couldn't it?22 MR. MOSLEY: The way I read Pearson, Justice23 Alito, no. The way I read Pearson, they ­­ Pearson's24 dictate is that they must proceed to the second prong if25 they conclude there was sufficient facts to conclude6￼1 that there was a constitutional violation. They still2 have to decide ­­ one is a question of ­­3 JUSTICE ALITO: No, that wasn't my question.4 The ­­ the court has to, ruling on qualified immunity,5 it has to decide whether there ­­ whether the law was6 reasonably ­­ the rule that's being applied was7 reasonably ­­ was clearly established. But having done8 that, even if it says it was and, therefore, the9 defendant is entitled to qualified immunity, doesn't10 Pearson say that the court has discretion about whether11 to go on to the second prong?12 MR. MOSLEY: Oh.13 Justice Ginsburg's question.14 court certainly has the power15 the merits question. And in this case, if the court16 found it wise to do so, we've argued that on the merits17 this was a constitutional use of force under the Fourth18 Amendment, because it was dangerous. The ­­ the chase19 exceeded speeds of 100 miles an hour. There was weaving20 in and out of traffic. There was a time when a21 particular person pulling a boat was ­­ was cut off.22 Even in the parking lot, the Respondents' decedent never23 threw his hands up, never indicated surrender,24 maneuvered his car in such a manner that a reasonable25 officer could conclude that he was in a threat of7This is in relation toI think so, yes.  Theto ­­ to make a ruling on￼1 serious harm to himself.2 In any event, every reasonable officer could3 not ­­ it is not correct that every reasonable officer4 would not conclude that it was unconstitutional.5 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there ­­ is there6 any situation in which the application of lethal force7 during a high­speed case in your view would not be8 justified?9 MR. MOSLEY: Yes, Your Honor.10 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Give me an example?11 Talking about a high­speed chase, not unlike this one.12 Is there ­­ is there any situation in which it would ­­13 would violate clearly established constitutional law for14 the police to use lethal force?15 MR. MOSLEY: Well, I'll give you one16 circumstance. If ­­ if this Court had a case where it17 ruled where there was a prior ruling, of course, that18 given conduct violated the Constitution. But as far as19 me coming up with a ­­ a particular event, I suspect20 that somebody fleeing at the speed limit, not21 endangering other drivers. I hate to use television as22 an example, but perhaps the way the white Ford Bronco23 fled in the early '90s that everybody saw on TV. That24 seemed to be relatively non­dangerous or at least not a25 danger of serious physical injury.8￼1 In this case, however, there was a danger of2 serious physical injury, given the undisputed events in3 this case. In fact, the Respondents below argued that4 the speed exceeded 100 miles an hour. They argued this5 was a dangerous chase On page 16 of their memorandum in6 response to our motion for summary judgment.7 So, you know, of course, there's a8 jurisdictional issue here that I'd like to briefly talk9 about.10 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I'd like you to talk11 about that.12 MR. MOSLEY: Well, the ­­ below in the Sixth13 Circuit, the Petitioners were willing to concede any14 alleged factual disputes, not legal dispute, but factual15 dispute, in the light most favorable to the Respondent.16 We're still willing to do that. For purposes of17 argument's sake, any alleged disputes should be18 construed, which is proper under Scott v. Harris, to19 determine the ­­ the historical facts in the light most20 favorable ­­21 JUSTICE SCALIA: And is that ­­ is that how22 you think the jurisdictional question should be23 resolved, that whenever ­­ as you know, there's ­­24 there's a disagreement in the courts of appeals as to25 what you do when there are claims that there are factual9￼1 disputes. Some courts ­­ well, we've held that where2 the only issue raised is a factual dispute, there's no3 jurisdiction. Some courts say that so long as you4 assert a claim to qualified immunity, there is5 jurisdiction, okay.6 Let's assume that that's the rule. What do7 we do with factual disputes? Is it your position that8 you ­­ you simply assume them to be in the ­­ in the9 Respondents's favor?10 MR. MOSLEY: Only to the extent supportable11 by the record, as Your Honor held ­­ as this Court held,12 rather, in Footnote A of Scott v. Harris. So yes, I do13 think that there are cases where ­­14 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you would say genuine15 factual disputes. I mean, if ­­ if there's something16 that is not at all frivolous. I mean, it's not17 supported by the record, I wouldn't call that a genuine18 factual dispute.19 MR. MOSLEY: I think it wastes judicial20 resources if there is not true genuineness with respect21 to a particular fact, if there is no support for it in22 the record and clearly established, the argument has23 been raised for the court not to go ahead, assume24 jurisdiction and assume the facts in the light most25 favorable to the extent supportable by the record, Your10￼1 Honor.2 JUSTICE SCALIA: And ­­ and how does that3 work out here?4 MR. MOSLEY: In this case, I ­­5 respectfully, I don't think it's very important. I6 think that there are maybe a couple of alleged factual7 disputes that, even if you assume them in the light most8 favorable to the Respondent, they do not affect this9 Court's analysis under the second prong of qualified10 immunity because this was indisputably a dangerous car11 chase and indisputably the Respondent never gave up12 before force was used.13 JUSTICE SCALIA: You would say that it14 doesn't really matter whether he bumped the police15 cruisers when he was finally cornered, whether he tried16 to back up into one of the officers, that all of that is17 just excrescences, that it was enough to justify the18 shooting that he was driving at 100 miles an hour,19 swerving around the road, endangering human life and20 would likely continue that if they let him to get away?21 MR. MOSLEY: Two responses, Your Honor.22 First of all, I do not concede that those facts are in23 dispute. Rather, if you look at the second volume of24 the Joint Appendix towards the end, the Respondent had25 admitted those in the Supreme Court ­­ in the summary11￼1 judgment record below, that there was some2 qualifications that these are legal disputes.3 JUSTICE SCALIA: Had admitted what?4 MR. MOSLEY: Had admitted that Officer5 Gardner's car was, in fact, bumped by Respondent6 decedent's car, that the cars were rocking back and7 forth, that the front wheels were spinning. That8 occurred. That was indisputably occurred. That9 indisputably shows on Unit 286, which is Galtelli's10 video. And then, it is indisputable that Officer Ellis11 had to step out of the way when Mr. Rickard backed up.12 Those things were not in dispute.13 So, you know, as that goes, I wouldn't say14 that those things have to be assumed in the15 Respondents's favor because those things happened and16 the Respondent doesn't take issue with those things.17 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he does in his ­­ in18 his briefing here.19 MR. MOSLEY: He ­­ he takes issue with20 characterizations. And what I ­­ I submit is that we've21 characterized facts in this case, no doubt. They've22 characterized facts in this case. Just as in Scott v.23 Harris, the videos in many ways speaks for itself. The24 video in many ways ­­ in every way, in my opinion, shows25 that this was dangerous. It continued to be dangerous12￼1 and Mr. Rickard never relented and never gave up.2 And one important fact that is also3 undisputed is that at the time that that contact,4 however you characterize it, was made between the5 Galtelli car and Mr. Rickard's car, Officer ­­ I mean,6 Gardner's car and Rickard's car, Officer Gardner was7 exiting his patrol car. So there was much made about8 the fact that Officer Plumhoff was to the side, the9 front side of the car. Well, Officer Gardner was not to10 the front side of the car. Officer Gardner was exiting11 the car that was being contacted and approaching in12 front. That is a danger ­­ at least a reasonable13 officer on the scene without the benefit of hindsight,14 without ­­ out of the quiet of the courtroom could15 conclude that he was in danger of serious injury.16 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Assuming ­­ assuming that17 at some point in this case, either now or on remand,18 it's appropriate and necessary for us to state ­­ set19 forth what the rule ought to be, what effect, if any, do20 you give to the fact that there was a passenger in the21 car, a passenger who apparently was not involved in any22 illegal activity?23 MR. MOSLEY: The passenger did not make24 Mr. Rickard less dangerous. However, I know of no legal25 framework as of 2004 ­­ I do understand your question is13￼1 about the merits.2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it makes the police3 reaction more dangerous.4 MR. MOSLEY: It does. But we still look at5 the relative culpability of the driver. We look at6 the ­­ I do think under the totality of the7 circumstances, you consider the fact that there is a8 passenger, but you also consider the ­­ the rights of9 the innocent public. And it did not make Mr. Rickard10 less dangerous. I agree with you.11 JUSTICE SCALIA: I could see how the12 passenger could complain, but ­­ but I can't see how13 the ­­ how the ­­ the criminal fleeing felon who put the14 passenger in danger can say, you shouldn't have shot15 because you ­­ oh, you hurt my passenger. Isn't there16 some problem of his standing to complain about that17 problem.18 MR. MOSLEY: Precisely. And ­­ and we've,19 of course, argued that it ­­ it defies logic to me for20 Mr. Rickard to have put Miss Allen in danger and then21 invoke her safety as a reason why he ­­ he should be22 free from the use of force when he is endangering the23 innocent public.24 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did Allen bring a suit?25 MR. MOSLEY:Yes, Your Honor.141 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE KENNEDY: And was that settled out of court or something?MR. MOSLEY: No, Your Honor. That remains in the Western District of Tennessee.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, it remains.MR. MOSLEY: And the issue there, of course, is under the Fourth Amendment, the "shocks the conscience" standard.      But as of 2004 in the Sixth Circuit ­­ goback to what I'm emphasizing here today in the secondprong ­­ there wasn't a ­­ a case that suggested thatthe driver could invoke the passenger's safety as somemeans to suggest that the force was excessive.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. I understand that. Although we're going beyond the necessities of the case, is the rule that the passenger can have a "shock of the conscience" test and it's not limited to the Fourth Amendment, even if the driver is? Is that the way it works?MR. MOSLEY: Well, it's interesting. The circuits go various ways. The Sixth Circuit has vacillated on the issue of whether there's a Fourth Amendment claim of an un ­­ of an unintentional unreasonable seizure, which to me defies logic. But there is clearly a "shocks the conscience" standard15￼￼1 in ­­ under Lewis v. Sacramento the "intent to harm"2 standard under the Fourteenth Amendment.3 We were granted summary judgment ­­ the4 Petitioners were granted summary judgment as to5 Miss Allen's claim, estate's claim, in that regard, but6 the court is now reconsidering in the Western District7 of Arkansas the Fourth Amendment ­­ of Tennessee, the ­­8 the Fourth Amendment claim.9 The Respondent ­­ for the Respondents' part,10 they haven't shown clearly established law violated in11 this case by Petitioners' actions. And it's important12 that, if not stopped in this case, I think reasonable13 officers could conclude that Rickard would continue to14 pose a risk.15 Now, what's important about the prior case16 law to 2004 in ­­ in the Sixth Circuit is that those17 cases ­­ Smith v. Freland, Scott v. Clay County, in the18 Eighth Circuit the case of Cole v. Bone ­­ those19 officers at that time didn't shoot when somebody was20 about to run over someone else. There was not an21 immediate threat that somebody was ­­ just like in Scott22 v. Harris. Officers often wait for a time to take23 action when they don't see civilians around. And to24 suggest that, you know, somebody has to almost be run25 over before deadly force can be used in a situation161 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425where serious harm or injury has been threatened wouldthrow law enforcement into chaos  and I respectfullysubmit it would probably weaken law enforcement in thiscountry.      I'd like to reserve the remainder of mytime.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Mosley.      Mr. Bash.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. BASH      ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATESAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERSMR. BASH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:      I think the correct disposition of this casefollows from two propositions:  One, there is some levelof reckless driving in response to a police pursuit thatauthorizes the use of deadly force, some level, at a ­­in a high­speed chase.  Second, it was not beyond debatein 2004 in the relevant circuits here that the drivingthat the undisputed facts show in this case would haveauthorized deadly force.  It might have been wrong as amatter of the Fourth Amendment, but it was not clearlyestablished.  Respondents have not pointed to a singlecircuit case that would have given officers clear notice17￼￼1 that the undisputed conduct here would not authorize the2 use of deadly force.3 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Bash, could I go back to4 Justice Ginsburg's question, because this is an area in5 which there's no alternative way really to develop legal6 standards other than by doing it in these kinds of7 cases. So if we only focus on the clearly established8 upon case after case after case, we don't make much9 progress in actually telling police officers where the10 line is. So how do we do that? Why shouldn't we do it11 here? When should we do it?12 MR. BASH: I think the general point is13 correct, and as we say in our brief, it would hinder the14 development of constitutional law if courts never15 reached the merits question. And as the Department of16 Justice, we have an interest in that, because we17 prosecute State officials for civil rights violations18 and there's a similar standard of "clearly established"19 in the criminal context.20 Our only point here is not that courts21 should never reach the merits in these cases; it's that22 this is a particularly bad vehicle, particularly for23 this Court, which even in ­­ in nonqualified immunity24 cases often lets difficult constitutional issues25 percolate among lower courts. One, the lower courts and18￼1 really the parties didn't distinguish between the2 different officers here. Three officers didn't fire3 their weapons. Maybe they're the easy case. But two4 officers, although it might be disputed whether assaults5 occurred, heard over the radio that assaults occurred.6 That's what they say in their affidavits. That's at 2137 through 225 of the JA. And you can here on the Galtelli8 video, which is 286, that he heard the report of the9 assaults.10 That's a wrinkle in the constitutional11 analysis that really hasn't been explored by the lower12 court opinions in this case and by the briefs in this13 case.14 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Bash, that15 question about the development of the underlying law,16 that's an issue that we faced and decided when we17 overturned the prior rule that there was a particular18 order of battle and you had to decide the Constitutional19 issue first, isn't it?20 MR. BASH: That's true, Mr. Chief Justice.21 But what Pearson said is that, as Justice Alito said22 earlier, it's discretionary. And one of the factors23 Pearson urged lower courts to consider in deciding24 whether to reach the merits question was whether this is25 the sort of issue that doesn't often arise in a context19￼1 other than where qualified immunity is available, and I2 think that's what Justice Kagan's question was getting3 at. It can arise in some other contexts. For example,4 if there's a policy, a municipal policy that authorizes5 the use of force, you can oftentimes sue the6 municipality and they're not entitled to qualified7 immunity.8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They ­­ they have in9 fact sued the municipality in this case, haven't they?10 MR. BASH: They ­­ they have. I believe11 that ­­ well, they sued the chief of police. I think12 they sued the municipality, too. But I don't think this13 was pursuant to an explicit policy. In fact, some of14 the policies at issue here ­­ they're in the JA at 39815 through 412 ­­ I think might have been violated. So I16 don't know this is going to be the case where they can17 reach the merits because of municipal liability.18 One other point on this question of the19 development of the law. I mean, Justice Kennedy noted20 in his dissent in Camreta v. Greene, even clearly21 established cases sometimes can ­­ can sort of more22 incrementally develop the law because certain principles23 are discussed in the cases ­­24 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I ask ­­ could I25 go back to a question the Chief asked earlier, which is,20￼1 is the use of deadly force always permitted in a2 high­speed chase?3 MR. BASH: We don't ­­4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume a set of5 facts that's different from here, that they had6 surrounded the car and it had not moved. Could they7 have done what the police officer did here, fire into8 the car to get the guy to open up the door?9 MR. BASH: Well, the use of deadly force is10 justified to protect injury to the public or to the11 officers. And if the circumstances of the case show12 that he has, the suspect, has no means of escaping and13 getting back on the road based on where the cars are at14 the time of the stop ­­15 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could have been in a16 ditch or something?17 MR. BASH: ­­ and there's no argument that18 the officers were in danger ­­ or maybe the vehicle is19 disabled ­­ no. It's not punishment for having engaged20 in a high­speed pursuit. It's to protect people on the21 road.22 This case, it's pretty ­­ it's very clear on23 the video that he was aiming to get back on the road.24 The district court found that. It's undisputed. And he25 could have kept driving if the officers hadn't fired21￼1 shots. Now, maybe, even taking all that into account,2 maybe it violated the Fourth Amendment here. Maybe his3 conduct just wasn't dangerous enough. But I don't think4 it would have been beyond debate that it violated the5 Fourth Amendment in 2004 in these circuits.6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Bash, what's the7 government's position on the jurisdictional question?8 MR. BASH: We think there is subject matter9 jurisdiction in this case. And let me explain both how10 I see the Johnson framework generally and then how I11 think it applies here. Johnson said that on an12 interlocutory appeal in a qualified immunity case,13 appellate courts do not have jurisdiction to review14 questions of evidentiary sufficiency. In other words,15 does the summary judgment record permit a jury to find a16 certain fact?17 I think there's two qualifications or ­­ or18 caveats to that. One, in Scott v. Harris, although the19 Court didn't review Johnson, it said if the facts found20 to be disputed by the district court to be genuinely21 disputed is blatantly contradicted by the record, in22 particular, their video evidence like we have here, the23 court doesn't have to credit that.24 Second, I think there are certain sorts of25 issues that are in this context understood to be legal2225 JUSTICE KENNEDY:Is your point that if￼1 issues, not factual issues. So the factual issues are2 the historical facts, how fast was he driving, what was3 he doing, that kind of thing. But the question of what4 level threat he posed to the public or to officers I5 don't think ­­6 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. I understand that.7 But what ­­ what about a dispute as to the purely8 factual issues, if there is a dispute about that? Does9 that mean the court can't ­­ can't take the case?10 MR. BASH: As I understood Johnson v.11 Jones, it said that. Now, Johnson v. Jones was based on12 practical considerations about conserving judicial13 resources and the nature of the question at issue. I14 think as you'll see ­­ as you see in this case and as15 the State amicus brief in this case makes clear, lower16 courts have struggled with that issue and it ­­17 JUSTICE SCALIA: I know that. How would you18 resolve this struggle is what I'm asking you.19 MR. BASH: Well, like you said in Johnson v.20 Jones, we think that Johnson adopted the incorrect21 position, and if it was properly presented in a case, we22 would ask that the Court reconsider the precedent. But23 that hasn't ­­ that hasn't been raised here, but24 obviously, it's within the Court's power to do so.23￼1 Johnson ­­ is your point that if Johnson remains on the2 book, there's no jurisdiction?3 MR. BASH: No, there is jurisdiction in this4 case, because on the undisputed facts it was not clearly5 established in 2004 in the relevant circuits that these6 officers could not use deadly force. It's not necessary7 to reconsider Johnson to decide this case. The8 undisputed facts, and I'm happy to go through them, make9 clear that it was not clearly established in 2004 in10 this case. I took Justice Scalia to be asking a broader11 question about how Johnson has worked in practice in the12 lower courts.13 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but Johnson involved14 only disputed facts. They asked this Court to resolve15 the factual question, period. I understood Johnson to16 say of course you can't take that. But we have here a17 case where, although there may be disputed facts, the18 other side would say ­­ or your side would say that they19 are irrelevant.20 MR. BASH: If the Court were to hold that on21 a core sort of qualified immunity appeal that actually22 raises the question about clearly established, that23 appellate courts have jurisdiction to consider24 subsidiary factual questions of the sort that I think25 you're referring to, we would agree with that position.24￼1 JUSTICE SCALIA:2 that we should resolve them in the Respondent's favor to3 the extent that the record supports that?4 MR. BASH: Correct. It would be the normal5 summary judgment standard. We don't ­­ we don't think6 there are facts resolved in the Respondent's favor here7 that are necessary for the outcome in the context of8 this case.9 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Bash, could I ask you a10 question? Putting aside the "clearly­established" prong11 and if you were just looking at the reasonableness of12 this conduct straight, the Fourth Amendment violation,13 two factors, and tell me how the government thinks they14 both play. One is the degree of force involved, the15 fact that 15 point­blank shots were fired, and the other16 is what Justice Kennedy referred to before, the17 passenger in the car. So how do those two factors play18 in the Fourth Amendment question?19 MR. BASH: Let me start with the latter. I20 think that the ­­ you can see arguments both ways on how21 the passenger fits in. On the one hand, Scott talked22 about the number of lives at risk and the relatively23 culpability of people being put at risk. And so you can24 see how the officer's actions are putting an innocent25 person at risk. Maybe that plays in. But on the other25Okay.  And you would agree￼1 hand, as Justice Scalia said, it's a little bit weird as2 a constitutional rule to say that the suspect put3 somebody else's life in danger and gets a greater4 immunity from suit.5 JUSTICE KAGAN: It is a little bit weird.6 But as I understand the way the lower courts have done7 this is to say that the passenger actually doesn't have8 a Fourth Amendment claim, so there is a "shock the9 conscience" test, which is, of course, a very high10 standard.11 MR. BASH: That's true. And it's only the12 district court so far that has ruled on the passenger's13 Fourth Amendment claim here, and she may have an14 argument on appeal under Brenlan v. California that she15 was seized. Brenlan says if you pull over ­­ you know,16 not through the use of force, through just an ordinary17 stop, pull over everybody in the car, if the passengers18 feel like they are not free to leave, they are seized as19 well constitutionally.20 We haven't evaluated it on the facts of this21 case and how that applies to the sort of force used22 here, but she may have a Fourth Amendment claim, and it23 may make sense to filter those sorts of concerns about24 the innocent passenger through her claim rather than25 giving the suspect who actually put her in danger a26￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425greater immunity from the use of force.      And I think the other question you asked meabout was ­­JUSTICE KAGAN: The degree of force.MR.

Mr. Smith.      ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY K. SMITH       ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. SMITH: Chief Justice Roberts, may it please the Court:This case is a classic jury question. There are, contrary to the Petitioners' and amicus position, several genuine material issues of fact that are absolutely in dispute, and I would like to recite a few of those to set the preface to respond to some of the questions that have already been raised.27￼1 We start with the fact that there was no2 chase at the time that these shots were fired. The3 chase had stopped. This situation was a controlled4 environment, not perfectly controlled,5 but ­­6 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. I did see7 the film, and most of the ­­ there were the three8 initial shots and then the shots after the car was9 moving away from the police officers.

SMITH:17 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:18 MR. SMITH:19 would like to make, Justice Sotomayor, is that we have20 to separate the shooting sequences in this case.21 Officer Plumhoff fired the initial three shots while the22 car is stopped and is blocked on three sides.23 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why do we have all24 these other officers in here? They didn't fire any25 shots, Forthman, Ellis, and Evans.28The last 12.        The last 12.  Let's ­­The first ­­        ­­ divide it ­­­­ the first three were.        ­­ between 3 and 12.And that's one of the points I￼1 MR. SMITH: And that issue has not been2 asked at the district court. It has never been raised3 by the Petitioners in this case that they should be4 treated separately. The Sixth Circuit ­­ the Sixth5 Circuit recognized that in the footnote. And that is an6 issue that should be presented to the district court, I7 would submit. But if we separate ­­8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Go back to ­­ let's take9 the sequences. What was wrong with the 12 shots fired10 at the car as it was driving away?11 MR. SMITH: Okay. That's the first point of12 what was wrong, is that there was no danger at that13 point to the officers, and the only, the only excuse or14 justification that the officers could utilize at that15 time, because they were shot as the car was driving away16 and going down the street, the danger at that point that17 is being created by shooting is to the general public.18 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what do you think the19 officers should have done at that point? What should a20 reasonable officer do when there has been a high­speed21 chase and the car spins out of control? And forget22 about whether there was any attempt to ram anybody or to23 hit to anybody with the car. The car spins out of24 control. It's eventually surrounded by officers with25 guns pointed at the driver demanding that he get out,2920 get out of this encirclement21 right?by the other police cars,22 MR. SMITH:23 JUSTICE SCALIA:24 that point or not?25 MR. SMITH:That ­­     Is he trying to get away atYou can't tell because he is up30￼1 that he put up his hands, stop driving.

SMITH: The first part of your question9 brings in the first sequence when Officer Plumhoff10 shoots the first three shots, and you reference, Justice11 Alito, the statement that he is trying to get him to get12 out of the car, show his hands, etcetera. The video13 shows that that could not have happened. Officer14 Plumhoff gets out of his car drawing his weapon and goes15 to the car and immediately shoots. No delay, period.16 He immediately begins to shoot.17 JUSTICE SCALIA: The car is still trying to18 escape. The car is not stopped and, you know, the19 driver with his hands up. The car is still trying to￼1 ­­ he is bumper to bumper with the Gardner car. It is2 true that the wheels spin forward.3 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What do you mean? He is4 going to the police station?5 MR. SMITH: Well, we don't know. He wasn't6 given the opportunity. What we do know is this: There7 is evidence in this record from which a reasonable jury8 could conclude that he may have been trying to give up,9 because Officer Forthman, who was the one that struck10 him and spun him out, says that once he turned onto11 Jackson Avenue he hit his brakes hard. Now, he didn't12 hit his brakes hard in order to get away from him. And13 at that point, Officer Forthman says that caused him to14 hit him and spin him out. And at that point, the15 momentum of his car caused the light contact between he16 and Plumhoff, who was moving toward17 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:18 had just exited the interstate.19 MR.

Now ­­JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Smith, I was ­­ I was surprised to read what you said in your ­­ in your brief on page 25: At a minimum, reasonable minds could differ on the issue of the Petitioners' objective reasonableness.

And here you have that statement at a7 minimum, reasonable minds could differ on the issue of8 their objective reasonableness. Do you still believe9 that, that reasonable minds could differ on the issue of10 their objective reasonableness?MR. SMITH: It says at a minimum. AndMR. SMITH: That's addressing the constitutional issue, not the clearly established issue.      MR. SMITH:any time that there is a genuine issue of material fact,­­ any time there is an issue,3325 JUSTICE ALITO:So why does it matter what￼1 it can be resolved either way.2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, objective3 reasonableness is a ­­ is at least a mixed issue of law4 and fact, and it seems to me Justice Scalia is correct.5 You ­­ you have the burden to show that this was a6 clearly established standard, and you say that at a7 minimum, reasonable minds could differ on the issue of8 reasonableness.9 MR. SMITH: That's not what that was10 intended to convey. It's clearly not what that was11 intended to convey as you can see from the entirety of12 the brief. If I can get back now to ­­ to the material13 genuine issues of fact that are in dispute, keep in14 mind, Officer Plumhoff, who shot those first three15 shots, did not do it to prevent the car from leaving16 again. He said the only reason that he fired those17 three shots was because he was standing directly in18 front of the path of that car and he thought he was19 going to be killed; and the video 100 percent shows that20 that is not true.21 JUSTICE ALITO: But I thought the22 reasonableness of a Fourth Amendment seizure was an23 objective question, not a subjective question.24 MR. SMITH: It is an objective question.34￼1 reason he subjectively had?2 MR. SMITH: He has to have some3 justification of danger under objective reasonableness4 to make the decision to use deadly force. And he says5 that it was because he was standing in the path of the6 car. He wasn't. That car was bumper to bumper against7 the Gardner car.8 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I know. But if he ­­9 he says I did it because I thought he was going to run10 me over. But an objective officer looking at the11 situation would say that the use of deadly force is12 necessary here to prevent this chase from continuing on13 the interstate and endangering other motorists and their14 passengers. So if that were the situation, wouldn't15 that mean that was a reasonable seizure?16 MR. SMITH: I believe it would not be.17 JUSTICE ALITO: Initiated by the fact by the18 officer who used the force had a different motive?19 MR. SMITH: No. I'd respectfully submit,20 Justice Alito, that it would not because if that's all21 there was, there were other alternate methods to stop22 that car from leaving. It wasn't the reason that he did23 it; but if you assume that you can analyze it on that24 basis, there were several alternate ways to prevent that25 car from leaving.351 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425JUSTICE SCALIA: Such as?

It's a question I don't know the2 answer to. What am I supposed to do?3 MR. SMITH: Well, it is clearly established4 that the danger itself has to be the justification for5 the deadly force. That implies alternative ­­6 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's too general a rule,7 and our cases hold that you cannot appeal to a very8 general rule to say the law is clear. You have to show9 that the law as applied to these circumstances was10 clear. And there's nothing about shooting out tires11 that I know of.12 MR.

Maybe this is the case19 where you ought to go, and if you're suing somebody else20 and introduce a lot of evidence that shows that they21 should shoot the tires out; and then there could be a22 decision on that.

SMITH: It ­­ it ­­ the question is14 different than that, Chief Justice Roberts. The15 question is, when the officers know that there is a,16 quote, "innocent" or another person in the car, that17 should affect their judgment. That should be a factor18 in the determination of whether or not to start pulling19 that trigger.20 It's not ­­ it's not that Mr. Rickard gets21 the advantage of it. It's that it should affect the22 officer's judgment.23 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course it's a factor,24 but is it a factor that your clients can take advantage25 of? That's the issue.48￼1 I mean, maybe you ­­ you can demote the2 policeman who did that. Maybe even a lawsuit by ­­3 by ­­ by the colleague in the car would be successful.4 But the issue is whether your client has any5 reason to complain about that, your client who caused6 the whole thing, who caused the shooting in the last7 analysis.8 MR. SMITH: There is no question that9 Mr. Rickard's conduct was unreasonable and he has10 culpability, but the issue is not him taking advantage11 of it. But the threshold issue is should they have used12 deadly force in that circumstance. And that passenger13 is there. We can't take away the fact that that14 passenger is there. And it should have been a factor in15 the reasonable officer's judgment about whether or not16 to initiate deadly force.17 JUSTICE GINSBURG:18 establishes that? You ­­19 there. What case tells a20 passenger no lethal weapon?21 MR. SMITH: There is no case that says22 specifically if there is a passenger there don't use a23 weapon. But virtually every case talks about the ­­ the24 impact of using lethal force to do it or not to do it25 when relative to innocents, third parties.49     What do you say clearlyyou say the passenger ispolice officer when there is a1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425      It is just ­­ that is an obvious part of thejudgment that should be made, is that you don't endangerthose other than the suspect, and you don't shoot or usedeadly force on the suspect if it is going to endangerothers.JUSTICE ALITO: As to the number of shots, even with all the shots that were fired, Mr. Rickard still was able to drive away for a short distance.MR. SMITH:JUSTICE ALITO:MR. SMITH:JUSTICE ALITO:Yes.    Isn't that right?Correct.    So what does thatdo to theargument that too many shots were fired?MR. SMITH: It's not so much that￼                                              it was toomany.  It is that second phase of shots that are ­­ ifthey do what they are intended to do, and by the waythey did, then you would have created a moving missileby the car because you're going to have the dead driverthat can endanger other people, and you're shooting inthe direction of other people.  Both those factorsshould have militated against the second phase of shots.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There are two ways in which the public is endangered. You're ­­ the point you're making is that if the police are firing somebody in the public might get hit fired by a bullet. The50JUSTICE SCALIA:Okay.

SMITH: Or, Chief Justice Roberts, a greater danger by a car driving down the road with a dead driver behind the wheel, totally out of control, and that almost happened in this case, as you see in the video. There was an oncoming car just before he veered off to the left and hit that house.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you're saying they can't apply lethal force because they may not be successful in ­­ in killing the driver?MR.

I mean, the ­­ the cases have uniformlyheld that the officers are not held to the standard ofreading constitutional law, which invites the inquirywell, how are they going to know what's clearlyestablished law?  That has to be from training; and inthis case, the policy and procedures, which are in theJoint Appendix, which closely tracks Graham.  Closelytracks Garner.  Closely tracks any number of othercases, including from their own circuit, McCaslin, whichheld that qualified immunity did not apply in asituation where the officer felt they why justified inshooting to avoid another escape.      And those are the policies and procedures53up a￼1 that are applicable of the state of knowledge of these2 officers when we look at clearly established law and all3 of those authorities which support the fact that4 qualified immunity should not attach in this case under5 these circumstances.6 JUSTICE GINSBURG:7 that there was a police8 authorize to shoot, you9 job is done?10 MR. SMITH:11 to the extent, in this case, in that second sequence,12 you're endangering other people other than the person13 that you're trying to stop. That's ­­ that's the14 distinction.15 Before my time is through, I do want to go16 back to the jurisdictional question, because in the end17 in this case, the interlocutory was taking nothing more18 than a challenge to the evidentiary sufficiency, the19 facts necessary to consider both prongs. The20 constitutional prong and the clearly established prong21 are the same facts. There is a blending, though the22 consideration may have to be different.23 JUSTICE SCALIA: What facts do you contest24 and we'll just subtract them from the facts that we25 consider.

You can eliminate all those minor facts that you're contesting and it's still a very dangerous situation.MR. SMITH: And he didn't?

MOSLEY: Very briefly.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just to clarify onething, Mr. Mosley.  When were the three shots fired?When he had moved backwards?MR.

MOSLEY: That's correct, Your Honor.And then he moved backwards. He was next to the building. He goes forward briefly three times. You can characterize it however you want to. Unit 286 shows it very clearly. Then shots are fired after the beginning of that and then he backs out and more shots are fired as he backs out and drives away.JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Got it.MR.
