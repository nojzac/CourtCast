Mayle v. Jacoby Lee Felix.           Mr. Chan.the Court: ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATHEW K.M. CHAN       ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERMR. CHAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please           In 1996, Congress made an important change tothe habeas corpus proceedings by enacting a one-yearstatute-of-limitations period.  This Court is now asked toconsider, for the first time, how the relation backdoctrine under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c)(2) isto be applied in the habeas context.           The Warden advocates a rule for relation back isthat the conduct transaction occurrence set forth in theinitial petition is the core of operative facts to supportthe constitutional violations alleged.  This rule is farsuperior to the Ninth Circuit's rule, which a majority ofCircuits have determined effectively nullifies AEDPA'sone-year statute of limitations.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, I take it the issue doesn't even arise unless the amendment is accepted under 15(a).31111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. CHAN:  That's correct, Your Honor.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And if there's been lack ofdiligence, et cetera,State in the delay ofaccept the amendment.           MR. CHAN:           JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Or am I wrong about that?           MR. CHAN:  -- that in Civil Rule 15(a), theCourt has discretion and grants -- needs to grant leave toamend after a responsive pleading has been filed.However, a Petitioner gets to file a responsive pleading-- excuse me, an amended petition, as a matter of right,before a responsive pleading is filed.responsiveand -- or some prejudice to thethe amendment, the Court just won'tI should clarify that --JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, it waspleading --MR. CHAN:  In this case --JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  -- was filedMR. CHAN: -- it was Your Honor.JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  -- in this case.JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How long does it usually taketo file a responsive pleading?           MR. CHAN:  It depends, Your Honor.  It varieswith -- case to case.  In a lot of pro se --           JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  But the State has a certainamount of flexibility in deciding when to respond, does it 41111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-filed before a--￼1 not?2 MR. CHAN: Well, Your Honor, the rule does not3 require the State to respond to petitions until ordered by4 the District Court. And to get back to the question of5 Rule 15(a), even after a responsive pleading has been6 filed, Rule 15(a) does not serve the same purposes as Rule7 15(c). The statute of limitations is strict defense,8 which is meant to apply whether the filing is a day late9 or a year late, whether there is prejudice, or whether10 there is dilatory motive. To ameliorate the harsh effects11 of the statute of limitations, Rule 15(c)(2) provides an12 exception to the statute of limitations, but that13 exception is limited to the parameters of Rule 15(c)(2),14 itself. So when the Court is provided with a untimely15 claim, it determines whether or not that claim is time-16 barred, pursuant to 15(c)(2).17 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, just before we leave18 15(a), let's assume that we do not accept your position in19 this case and there's potential for a gaping hole in20 AEDPA. Does the State have some ability to protect itself21 by filing a responsive pleading and cutting off the22 amendments, or must it do so only if it is ordered by the23 Court to file a response?24 MR. CHAN: For pro- --25 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you see what I'm --51111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MR. CHAN: I do understand, Your Honor. And for2 pro se petitions, without counsel, the State is not even3 aware of the existence of the petition until it is served4 by the Court. And that occurs after the Court has made a5 determination as to whether or not a responsive pleading6 is required. It can happen that a Petitioner will be able7 to amend his petition after the statute of limitations has8 already expired, and we would not even know of that until9 after everything had been done.10 JUSTICE SOUTER: But you -- you have --11 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, please, go ahead.12 JUSTICE SOUTER: I was going to say, if -- on13 the scenario that you have raised, in which you don't even14 know that the petition has been filed, because the -- you15 don't -- the Court hasn't called for a response, the whole16 rationale behind the narrow reading is absent, as I17 understand it, because you point out that the rationale18 for the narrow reading is that the first pleadings put you19 on notice as to the case that you have to meet. And you20 shouldn't then have to be given an entirely new case to21 meet after you've been put on notice and taken whatever22 preliminary steps you've taken. But in the scenario that23 you're talking about, you have not been put on notice,24 because you don't even know there is a petition there yet.25 You have not been led to prepare a case which has now61111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 changed. So it seems to me that your rationale does not2 apply in the case in which you do not yet have notice,3 and, hence, have not filed a response, for that reason.4 MR. CHAN: But even in that scenario, we are5 still prejudiced by the fact that now we have to address6 additional7 do not get89 with that is that a -- the whole point of a relation-backclaims that would otherwise be time-barred.  Wea chance to --JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but that -- the problem10 rule is to get around a time bar. That's why you have11 them. And I thought your argument was, "Well, you12 shouldn't allow them to get around this time bar, because13 we have been put on notice, we have begun to prepare our14 case, and we should not then be presented with an entirely15 new case." And so, that's why, it seems to me, your16 preparation point, in effect, is trying to limit a rule,17 the whole purpose of which is to get around the time bar.18 If you don't have the preparation point, you don't have an19 argument.20 MR. CHAN: Well, I was addressing the situation21 in which we -- in which we can answer first. And I think22 that I responded, in the reply brief, that that would be23 an onerous burden on the State.24 JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, it would be. But, again,25 in the case that you're talking about, the very value that71111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425you're arguing for -- i.e., "We ought to be able to relyon the notice that we have given" -- is an argument whichhasn't arisen yet, because there's no factual basis tomake.           MR. CHAN:  Well, that situation would occur notas frequently as the situation in which we face anamendment after we have notice, Your Honor.           JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Chan, there is really noway for the State entirely to protect itself by -- even byfiling an answer immediately.  That would protect itagainst the automatic acceptance of an amendment, but itwouldn't protect it against the District Judge's abilityto grant an amendment after the response.           MR. CHAN:  That's right, Your Honor.           JUSTICE SCALIA:  There's no way to get anyprotection against that, no matter how promptly yourespond.           MR. CHAN:  That's absolutely correct.  AndCongress could not have intended its statute-of-limitations rule to be -- to have its effectivenessdependent upon the Court exercise of discretion under Rule15(a).           JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The discretion --           JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why --           MR. CHAN: Which has liberally granted amendments.81111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The discretion under 15(a),2 at least in the general run of civil proceedings, that is3 to be liberally exercised in favor of the pleaders that are4 so -- so it's a different -- the 15(c) relation-back test5 is quite different from the general attitude to pleading6 amendments, "Well, we'll let the Plaintiff," or, here, the7 Petitioner, "make the pleading alteration, and then it8 will be there, and the Court will make a determination of9 whether the pleading is good or not." But, at the 15(a)10 threshold, it's not much -- it's not much of a screening11 device, is it?12 MR. CHAN: No, Your Honor. The better screening13 device is in Rule 15(c)(2). As mentioned, Rule 15(c)(2)14 is the provision that determines whether or not a claim is15 time-barred. And 15(a), then, can determine whether or16 not the claim can be amended if it is not time-barred.17 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Chan, do you think18 the Rules of Civil Procedure should be applied in habeas19 cases after AEDPA the same way they are in civil -- other20 civil litigation?21 MR. CHAN: If the Court is referring to Rule22 15(c)(2), our argument is that Rule 15(c)(2) is not a rule23 of automatic relation back, in civil terms, in civil24 cases; and, therefore, should not be applied as a rule of25 automatic relation back in habeas cases.91111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But what if we were to2 determine that in regular civil litigation it is3 relatively automatic? What would your position be with4 respect to habeas cases after AEDPA?5 MR. CHAN: Well, my argument would be that the6 habeas Rule 11 provides that, to the -- to the extent that7 the civil rules are not inconsistent with the federal8 habeas provisions and rules, that they may be applied. And9 I think that Rule 11 compels a reading that if you have10 one application that is inconsistent with AEDPA's provisions11 and the framework of habeas corpus, and another12 interpretation that is not inconsistent, then you must go13 with the interpretation that is consistent with AEDPA.14 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you have more than Rule 11;15 you have Section 2244, which says that an application for16 habeas corpus, quote, "may be amended as provided in the17 rules of procedure applicable to civil actions."18 MR. CHAN: And that --19 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, I don't think it's even a20 close question whether the rules of procedure for21 amendment in civil actions apply.22 MR. CHAN: There's no question that -- we are23 not questioning that Rule 15(c)(2) applied to habeas24 corpus, but Section 2242 does not give any guidance as to25 how 15(c)(2) should be interpreted. And I believe that101111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 guidance comes from Rule 11.2 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Chan, can I ask you a3 question, based on your experience? I'm sure you've had a4 lot of experience in this area. This particular claim was5 about six months beyond the statute of limitations when he6 asked to relate back. It would seem to me that that would7 normally be the case, something about that amount of time8 would be an issue, because it takes time to process these,9 and they had to get counsel appointed. And counsel comes10 in and wants to amend the petition, usually, I suppose, in11 a pro se petition. Is it -- would I be correct in12 assuming that normally in cases of this kind we're talking13 about a delay of only a few months?14 MR. CHAN: For pro se petitions who have been15 assigned counsel, Your Honor?16 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, no, normally -- the17 issue of whether or not there should be -- the petition18 may have the benefit of the relation back normally is --19 involves a delay of not more than, say, five or six20 months, in a normal case.21 MR. CHAN: I don't have any statistics on that,22 Your Honor. But even if it were only five or six months,23 that would --24 JUSTICE STEVENS: You still lose the benefit of25 the statute. You lose an important right. But I'm just111111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 wondering about how serious a problem it is.2 MR. CHAN: It can be a more serious problem in3 capital litigation, where you're dealing with many more4 claims, which could be more complex, which could require5 exhaustion for the -- before the federal review. It just6 depends on the nature of the claim and the nature of the7 issues involved. I think that the statistics that were8 cited in the Justice Department study have different dates9 for how long cases pend, depending on the nature of the10 claim, whether it be for prosecutorial misconduct,11 ineffective assistance, and so forth.12 JUSTICE SOUTER: But in the capital case, you've13 got a specific provision in there. I mean, for the14 capital case, which is the one, I agree, you worry about15 most, because there's reason to delay there, Congress16 provided specifically for states to opt in; and when they17 opt in, they get the benefit of pretty rigorous time bars.18 MR. CHAN: That's true, Your Honor.19 JUSTICE SOUTER: And so, why -- I mean, isn't20 the answer to the capital-case problem exactly the answer21 that Congress gave, and, if a state does not want to opt22 in, then the normal amendment rules apply?23 MR. CHAN: The Chapter 154 provisions do set24 forth a fast track for capital cases if the State can25 establish certain appointment procedures for counsel.121111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 However, it did not speak to the interpretation of Rule2 15(c)(2), and Congress could not have intended that the3 statute of limitations not apply to Chapter 153 simply4 because of Chapter 154.5 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is your definition of6 the test under 15(c)(2)? I mean, on the one side, the7 argument is -- Felix's argument is, it's the entire trial8 episode, right?9 MR. CHAN: That's correct, Your Honor.10 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And is yours that every11 single objection that might be made in this entire trial12 record, every one, is a separate transaction or13 occurrence, for purposes of 15(c)?14 MR. CHAN: For purpose of 15(c)(2), our15 interpretation is that the kind of transaction occurrence16 is that core of operative facts that support the17 constitutional claims. That means that the objections --18 it is not necessarily true that one objection claim would19 not relate back to a second objection claim. It just20 depends upon whether they're closely related.21 In this case, the claims are not closely22 related. You have a claim made of confrontation -- excuse23 me -- confrontation clause, by the admission of Williams'24 videotaped evidence; and then you have the admission of25 evidence of a coerced confession statement. However, it131111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425takes an entirely different set of facts to establish thatnew claim.JUSTICE KENNEDY: The successive petition rules, or the rules prohibiting successive petition, seem to treat the entire attack as one -- as one legal theory, as one case. And it seems to me to be in -- somewhat intentioned for that, for you to break it down the way you want to under Rule 15(c).MR. CHAN: I think that the Respondent made a similar argument, based on a res judicata claim, and it was noted in the treatises that were cited that you have different intents behind res judicata and the relation- back doctrine, and they just do not apply that way.I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time. CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr. Chan. Ms. Blatt, we'll hear from you.              ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT         FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERMS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court:           The relevant conduct, transaction or occurrencein the habeas context is the set of facts that areasserted in support of the particular grounds for reliefunder habeas Rule 2.  That reference point best preserves141111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 Congress' intent under AEDPA to accelerate the filing and2 disposition of habeas proceedings.3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you, Ms. Blatt, taking4 the position that that is a tighter test than would apply5 ordinarily to the mine run of civil cases under 15(c)?6 MS. BLATT: I think, Justice Ginsburg, our7 fundamental point is, there is no counterpart to tort or8 contract action, with habeas. There is just no analog.9 And that is because there's not only Rule 2, which imposes10 this heightened across-the-board fact pleading11 requirement, but it's also because those pleading rules12 work in tandem with all the other unique habeas rules that13 apply only to habeas that serve to narrow the timing and14 scope of habeas review.15 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a -- it's a little odd16 for the statute to say that the rules apply; and then we17 look to the rules, but we interpret it differently. I18 certainly see the common sense of your position, but I'm19 just having a problem with 15(c)(2).2021 different,22 and figure23 occurrence24 view of viewing it as the entire trial or conviction, or25 there's another view as -- look at it as what the habeas151111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-MS. BLATT:  Yes, I just don't think it'sboth -- regardless, you've got to come the caseout what is the relevant-conduct transaction orin a habeas petition.  And there's the extreme￼1 rules require, and that is the prisoner to identify a2 particular unconstitutional conduct or occurrence that3 gives rise to a basis for relief.4 Now, under the Ninth Circuit's view, a prisoner5 can timely file one claim and then add any number of6 completely different claims after the one-year period.7 For instance, a timely Batson challenge could then --8 after the one year, the claim could add claims of9 ineffective assistance of counsel, Brady violations, or10 coerced confession. And to have to resolve those claims11 would significantly extend the limitations period beyond12 the one-year period.13 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, this case isn't as14 extreme as that, is it? It has to do with evidence15 admitted at trial.16 MS. BLATT: It's -- well, that's true, it takes17 in trial errors, but that's a lot. Ineffective assistance18 of counsel is a trial error. Coerced confession,19 confrontation clause, discriminatory selection in the jury20 -- I mean, I don't know if that's a trial, or maybe21 pretrial -- but it does take in a lot, and I don't think22 there's a close call that they relate to different actors,23 different time periods --24 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, certainly in the civil-25 case context, generally, the interpretation has been161111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 pretty broad. And I suspect if we try to narrow it a lot,2 we're going to have a lot of litigation about this point.3 MS. BLATT: I'm not sure about that. This has4 been the rule in the majority of Circuits for five or six5 years now, since 1999 or 2000, and it hasn't generated a6 lot of problems. And that's because, Justice O'Connor --7 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Can you articulate the rule8 that you want? Be as precise as you can, if you would.9 MS. BLATT: It would be the set of facts that10 are asserted in support of the grounds for relief in the11 original habeas petition. And the reason why this hasn't12 generated a problem, Justice O'Connor, is that -- in the13 way the Courts of Appeals haven't really had to identify a14 test -- is because they're so disparate in time and type.15 You have an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim that's16 timely raised, and then there's discriminatory selection17 of the jury.18 JUSTICE SOUTER: How about a case --19 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If I sue for negligence or, in20 any civil action we might -- we might imagine, there might21 be three or four ways in which the Defendant has injured22 me, and the Tiller case, the railroad case, tells us that23 it's a single action. And do you concede this, that24 you're asking us to interpret this differently and more25 narrowly than in the civil context?171111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 MS. BLATT: I --2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or do you concede that?3 MS. BLATT: I concede that -- it's hard to4 answer that, Justice Kennedy, because a habeas proceeding5 is not a train accident. And there is --6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's hard for me to7 figure it out, too, but it seems to me that what you're8 saying is that we have a different rule, because this is9 habeas.10 MS. BLATT: In the civil context, you always11 have a question of, Do we let in other loan transactions12 in a breach of contract, or, Do we let in another pattern13 or practice or -- of similar products? I mean, there's14 line-drawing, when it comes up in the civil context, all15 the time, every day in District Courts. But, Justice16 Kennedy, in habeas there are more than ordinary principles17 of finality at stake that aren't -- that just aren't true18 in any tort or contract action. And this Court said that19 in the Calderon decision. And the reason is because of20 the interest in not just the prosecutor in having adequate21 notice --22 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So to complete Justice23 O'Connor's -- the answer to Justice O'Connor's24 you say, "And we interpret this differently in25 in other cases, because of finality concerns."181111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  1-question,habeas thanWashington, DC 20005￼1 MS. BLATT: I would be --2 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You want us to interpret it3 differently.4 MS. BLATT: That would be totally acceptable,5 because of the distinct interest in not only the finality6 in the interest of society, and repose --7 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm sure it would be8 acceptable, but what's the authority for interpreting the9 rule two different ways, depending on the case?10 MS. BLATT: Well, it's not like there's a habeas11 civil proceeding that we're asking for a habeas -- habeas12 proceeding to be different. There is no counterpart to a13 tort action or a contract action where it's liberal14 pleading requirements under Rule 8, and every single15 grounds for relief in a habeas proceeding there is a16 requirement that the prisoner actually identify all the17 grounds and the particular facts in support of that, and18 those heightened pleading requirements focus the19 proceeding on that particular transaction.20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let me -- let me ask you21 how that would work in this case. The original claim is22 that there was a Fourth Amendment violation in admitting,23 you know, unlawfully seized evidence. Later, the24 Petitioner wants to amend to claim ineffective assistance25 of counsel, because counsel totally overlooked the leading191111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 case, directly on point, on this particular evidence. Is2 that arising out of the same operative set of facts, or is3 -- or is that something different? Clearly, the facts are4 not exactly the same. Close enough?5 MS. BLATT: Well, we'd look to the common core.6 And I think we would argue that one is focusing on7 counsel's performance, and the other is on police8 misconduct. But, Justice Souter --9 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but if that's -- if10 that's the line you're going to draw, then it seems to me11 that, in effect, what you are saying is, you can't amend.12 Because I can't imagine an operative set of facts that are13 going to be much close than -- in the real world, than the14 -- than the two sets that I gave you; and if they're not15 close enough, you're really arguing for a no-amendment16 rule.17 MS. BLATT: There's amendment all the time in18 the majority of Circuits that have applied the19 Government's test, and it comes up in two scenarios --20 JUSTICE SOUTER: Not if you were the judge.21 MS. BLATT: No, that's not true, Justice Souter.22 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but, I mean, why --23 MS. BLATT: Because --24 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- why --25 MS. BLATT: Let me just say, on the attorney-201111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 ineffectiveness one, it's completely besides the point2 what the Government's view is, because the claims are3 completely derivative, and the prisoner gets no benefit4 whether he gets the amendment or not, because, in order to5 show procedural default, he's going to have to show6 attorney effectiveness, and he just doesn't get anything7 additional, one way or the other, and it really doesn't8 matter which claim he asserts first.9 But the reason why amendment occurs all the time10 is because our rule allows the prisoner to amplify facts11 such that if he raises a Miranda claim or a Strickland12 claim, and doesn't allege custody or doesn't allege13 prejudice under Strickland, he can amend, after the one-14 year period. And also --15 JUSTICE SOUTER: So you can amend -- you can16 amend your factual basis, as it were, but you can't amend17 your claims.18 MS. BLATT: No, the way you get claims, which is19 really the -- the direct text on the rule says you can add20 a claim if it arises out of the same -- is if the21 transaction relates to the -- to give you an example, to22 an involuntary confession, you could have an amendment of23 a Miranda claim that arises out of that police -- alleged24 police misconduct that culminated in the admission of the25 confession. You could also have a Massiah violation that211111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 related back to a Fifth Amendment claim. And you could2 have other types, too.3 JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that the reason4 for the -- for defining the relation back the way the rule5 does is interest in fairness to the Defendant you don't6 want to let him be surprised; whereas, your claim, as I7 understand, is really based entirely on the interest in8 finality and repose.9 MS. BLATT: Well, I think the interest of notice10 is part of it. I mean, it doesn't always trigger when the11 State hasn't -- or the Federal Government hasn't answered.12 But statute of limitations are not only about fairness, in13 terms of preserving evidence, but the interest in repose14 --15 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but the definition --16 MS. BLATT: -- and closure.17 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- in the rule is really to18 protect the interest in fairness, because interest in19 repose is always the same.20 MS. BLATT: Well, that -- it's to preserve the21 statute of limitations, but if the relevant transaction is22 something narrower than the conviction, then the interest23 of repose sets in. And, I mean, the other side has, you24 know, the same point -- it's if you draw it out broad25 enough --221111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, the interest in repose2 is always there. You'd always like to preserve the3 defense, whenever you can. That's really what's at stake4 here.5 MS. BLATT: Well, I think what's at stake is6 Congress' intent in passing the one year. And it's7 fundamentally inconsistent with that to have a prisoner8 timely file one claim and then potentially add an9 unlimited number of claims, no matter how different and --10 in time and type --11 JUSTICE STEVENS: Even if they all come in just12 two or three months after the statute's run.13 MS. BLATT: Well --14 JUSTICE STEVENS: It's really not a big deal.15 MS. BLATT: -- a six-month difference is a 50-16 percent extension of the limitations period, which is a17 big deal. And Congress wanted a --18 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And here, it was five months.19 MS. BLATT: I think it was five months.20 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Here.21 MS. BLATT: It was five months. And --22 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you relying, Ms. Blatt,23 at all on the difference between the pleading rules for24 civil cases, generally, and habeas, where you do have a25 whole set of pleading rules, separate the habeas231111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425rules?MS. BLATT: May I answer? I think we're relying on both habeas Rule 2 and the principles under AEDPA on finality.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms. Blatt. Mr. Porter, we'll hear from you.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID M. PORTER                  ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTMR. PORTER: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:           I'd like to respond to the finality concern,because I think that really goes to the heart of thiscase.           Three weeks ago, this Court, in Rhines versusWeber, unanimously approved of the stay-and-abeyanceprocedure, because the Petitioner's interest in obtainingreview of his federal claims outweighed the competinginterests of finality and speedy resolution of the federalpetition.           Now, Mr. Felix's case is even more compellingthan Rhines, because, unlike the stay-and-abeyanceprocedure, which is just the power -- the inherent powerof the Court to control its docket, here we're talkingabout the command of Congress.In Section 2242, of the judicial code, Congress 241111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 provided, specifically, that the rules governing2 amendments of habeas petitions be controlled by the rules3 governing civil procedure. The only rule regarding --4 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, that's true. I mean,5 we can accept that, but we still have to interpret what's6 a transaction or occurrence, I assume. And is it open to7 us, in the habeas context, to take a narrow view of that?8 MR. PORTER: Your Honor, I believe that under9 this Court's decisions about how you determine what10 Congress did, Congress operated against a backdrop of how11 Rule 15(c) was applied by this Court and the lower courts.12 And in 1948, when 2242 was adopted, Tiller was very13 recent; it was a 1945 case. It must have been -- and we14 assume that Congress, like normal citizens, know what the15 law is, and they developed the rule against that backdrop.16 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that was -- that was a17 rule for tort cases; it wasn't a rule for habeas cases.18 And, as pointed out by the Government, habeas cases are19 fundamentally different, in that the notice that you give20 to the opposing party in tort cases, ordinary civil cases,21 is very vague. It's just, you know, what the event was,22 "I got hit by a train." You don't have to say, "Wherein,23 the train was negligent -- or the railroad was negligent,"24 or anything else; just, "I got hit by a train." Whereas,25 with respect to habeas corpus, there are rules that251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 require specifying all the grounds for relief available to2 the Petitioner, state the facts supporting each ground.3 It seems to me that those different pleading requirements4 suggest that what is the relevant transaction or5 occurrence for the one is not the same as what is the6 relevant transaction or occurrence for the other.7 MR. PORTER: That's a very good point I'd like8 to address, because I don't think we hit that -- upon that9 in our briefs.10 Habeas 2 -- habeas Rule 2 does require fact11 pleading, but the purpose of that is not to give notice to12 the other party, as the Solicitor General and the Warden13 suggest. The petition is not served on the Warden in14 habeas cases, so they don't even get a copy of the15 petition; it is filed with the court.16 The purpose of the fact-pleading requirement of17 Rule 2 is so that the District Court, under Rule 4 of18 habeas rules, can perform its screening function to19 determine whether the petition is facially valid or not.20 That requires some sort of facts to be plead. And that's21 in the Advisory Committee notes. It's also the22 requirement of 2243 of the Judicial Code, that the23 District Court review the petition so that wardens are not24 disturbed with every pro se litigant's Petitioner and have25 to respond.261111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Whatever the reason2 for it is, certainly you can interpret the rules to say3 that the pleading requirement being different and much4 more specific, the amendment process should be different.5 MR. PORTER: I think that that's -- Congress6 reasonably could have said that, and reasonably could have7 said that -- amended 2242, for example, when it passed the8 Antiterrorism Act, and said, "Generally, yes, the rules of9 civil procedure apply for amendments," but we're -- there10 should be a narrower rule.11 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But you don't need an12 amendment, I don't think. If you're talking about a13 transaction, the question is, What is the transaction?14 And in habeas it may be quite different than in other15 civil things.16 MR. PORTER: I think that the only basis for17 determining what "transaction" is, you have to look at the18 -- if you -- if you're right, that we should have some19 kind of different rule for habeas than all other civil20 proceedings, well, then it has to be grounded in the21 habeas statutes. And if -- when you look at the habeas22 statutes, it says, "Confinement must be in violation of23 the constitutional" --24 JUSTICE BREYER: But then --25 MR. PORTER: -- "laws which" --271111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, what's bothering me2 about this case is, I don't know that the Government needs3 to argue that there is a different rule. As I read the4 lower-court decisions, what they've done is used the words5 "core operative fact." Core operative facts in a tort6 case, where the engine of Train A runs into the caboose of7 Train B, is that collision. And the decision that the8 front -- the locomotive should have been lit, as well as9 the back of the caboose, seems, arguably at least, the10 same operative fact. Core operative facts. But to say11 that a witness, in the middle of the trial, was treated12 unconstitutionally seems, at least arguably, quite a13 different set of core operative facts from the fact that14 the Defendant was questioned before the trial.15 Now, that seems to me related to the nature of16 habeas, but it still seems to me that those words, "core17 operative fact," the same words, work differently in the18 two situations. And to adopt your approach also strikes19 me as running around the one-year statute of limitations.20 Now, those are my concerns, and I would21 appreciate your addressing them.22 MR. PORTER: Well, I hope I can put those to23 rest.24 On the first concern, I think that there are25 differences between a train wreck and habeas. Most of my281111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 habeas cases are train wrecks, so I hope that's not -- but2 I think there is a logical difference between them. But I3 think when you look carefully at the case of Tiller, those4 really were very different facts about the head car not5 being lit and the rear of the locomotive not being lit.6 After all, those were two separate legal claims, as well.7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Porter --8 MR. PORTER: The first one --9 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- all that would be required10 to allege, to take the four-line complaint -- all that the11 Plaintiff would have to say in that tort case is, "The12 train was negligently operated," with nothing more13 specific than that. And then the particulars could come14 out later. Under habeas, you can't do that. You must set15 out your grounds, and the -- Rule 2 is very specific about16 that. So, it's a very different approach to what you have17 to allege, going in.18 MR. PORTER: I agree, Your Honor, but you -- I19 think you need to step back and look at the purpose for20 the difference in the pleading rules. The purpose is, if21 the -- if the reason was that you have to give specific22 facts to put the other side on notice, I would say that23 there is a compelling argument that that should be -- that24 should inform this Court's decision about how Rule 15(c)25 should be read. But it's very clear, from 2243 and from291111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 habeas Rule 4, that the purpose for requiring the facts2 underlying the claims is not to give notice to the other3 side, but to allow the District Court to perform its4 screening function to determine whether the -- whether the5 petition is facially valid or not. If it's not valid,6 then the Warden is not even served with the petition. It7 just -- the petition is simply dismissed.8 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can you file -- can you file a9 request for a more specific statement in habeas, as you10 can in a civil case?11 MR. PORTER: Yes, under Rule 81 of the Federal12 Rules of Civil Procedure, and Rule 11, unless application13 of that rule is contrary to, or inconsistent with, the14 habeas statutes or rules, then it is applied.15 JUSTICE BREYER: Could we go back? Because I'm16 still concerned with the fact that Claim 1, which is a17 claim on January 2 that police arrested the Defendant and18 didn't read him Miranda warnings properly; Claim 2 is a19 claim that, two and a half years later, the prosecutor,20 during the trial, made some prejudicial arguments. Now, I21 think, just common sense, Do those arise out of the same22 core operative facts? Absolutely not. The facts are23 totally different. The only thing that brings them24 together is that there was a single legal proceeding.25 And, at the same time, if I adopt this approach301111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that doesn't seem to comport with the common sense, I'mrunning around Congress' effort with the one-year statute.           So what is your response?MR. PORTER: First of all, the response is that the statute -- the rule does not use the term "core operative facts."JUSTICE BREYER: No, but every lower court that has -- not every one; you know better than I -- but it seems like a commonly found expression when lower courts have interpreted the Rule 15 and have looked to Tiller. Is that true, or not true?MR. PORTER: Not in the habeas context. None ofthose --JUSTICE BREYER: No, of course not in the habeas context. I'm saying that if we're trying to apply, in the habeas context, the same test that's used elsewhere in the civil law, wouldn't we use the word "core operative fact"? Or would we? I'm not as familiar with this as you. What is the answer?--MR. PORTER: I don't believe so. I think thatJUSTICE BREYER: No?MR. PORTER: -- and Wright and Miller confirmed this, that actually courts have tried to develop different tests: Is it the same evidence that they're going to use?311111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425Is it a core of operative facts?  And, in the end, theysay there's no better test than the one set forth in therule, and that is conduct, transaction, or occurrence.JUSTICE BREYER: But, of course, we're trying to decide what is the transaction.MR. PORTER: Right, but the reason why is that there is a body of case law that determines -- that's told us what that means.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's --MR. PORTER: And Tiller tells us it means that it's the events leading up to the injury. And so, that's how, I think, that that phrase has been interpreted, and that's what Congress adopted --JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's take --CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: What about -- what about the case law in the lower courts that Justice Breyer referred to, dealing with the core operative facts and adopting --MR. PORTER: Mr. Chief Justice, I think -- they don't -- I'm not aware of those cases using --CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: -- you say let's look at all the cases that have followed Tiller, and -- but apparently a lot of the courts adopting the core operative fact have developed that without full regard to Tiller.MR. PORTER: No, the lower courts -- the most 321111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 usual interpretation of Tiller that we've cited in our2 brief that the lower courts perform is this idea of any3 events leading up to the ultimate injury --4 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But in the habeas context,5 haven't the majority of the Circuits had a more6 restrictive rule than the Seventh Circuit and the Ninth7 have espoused?8 MR. PORTER: Yes, they have.9 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes. And so, I think the10 question is, Should we follow the majority of the11 Circuits?12 MR. PORTER: And you should not, because what13 those courts fail to do is, they fail to appreciate14 that Congress has already spoken, in two different ways.15 First, Congress adopted 2242; and when it adopted AEDPA,16 it did not amend 2242, and it did not amend Rule 15(c).17 And, second, in death-penalty cases, which, after all, is18 really the only set of cases where there is an incentive19 to delay, Congress specifically spoke. And in20 2266(b)(3)(B) Congress said, "Amendments to petitions21 shall not be permitted after answers are filed unless the22 Petitioner can make a showing for a second or successive23 petition."24 Now, this is Lindh versus Murphy all over again.25 This is a case where Congress has spoken as to Chapter331111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 154. In Lindh versus Murphy, it said, "That chapter will2 be -- the amendment will be applied retroactively to cases3 then pending." They did not do anything with Chapter 1534 cases. The negative implication, when Congress so5 specifically addresses this issue for one limited, narrow6 set of cases -- and that really make sense in death-7 penalty cases, does it not? When the State gives the8 death-penalty Petitioner lawyers for State post-conviction9 review, then all of those claims are done in state habeas,10 they are brought together, it fulfills the claim-gathering11 function of the Antiterrorism Act; and then, very12 logically, Congress determined, "We should have a very,13 very strict restriction of amendments."14 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me -- let me ask you.15 Take the two events in this case, and as explained by16 Justice Breyer, a Miranda violation in the questioning and17 then a problem with the confrontation clause in the trial,18 two years later. Let's assume that there was a 1983 civil19 action for those violations, and let's assume that both20 are actionable. Different cause of action. Is that --21 how would -- how would an amendment be treated in a civil22 action? Based on most of the lower-court precedents23 you've been-- would the amendment related back?24 MR. PORTER: I don't believe so. In25 rights actions, there are -- the constitutional341111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  1-civil-rights atWashington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425issue are the injury.  So one -- if a person started outwith saying their injury in the civil-rights action wasthe admission of the evidence --JUSTICE KENNEDY: You would think no relation back, in the case I put --MR. PORTER: Because there -- it does not relate to the same injury. In habeas, by contrast, the injury is the custody that's in violation of the Constitution laws and treaties --JUSTICE STEVENS: The injury --MR. PORTER: -- of the United States.JUSTICE STEVENS: -- I suppose, in the -- in theMiranda violation, is introducing the evidence at the timeof trial.MR. PORTER: That's correct.JUSTICE STEVENS: That's the point. You don't look two and a half years back just to -- you decide what happened at the trial.MR. PORTER: That's correct. And in this --JUSTICE BREYER: Right. So what about the injury? What about that? That the injury -- the trial's over, say, six weeks -- the injury takes place at the time of introduction? Or is the injury the whole time the -- the guilty verdict?MR. PORTER: Well, that the that's the problem 351111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425with the -- with the Warden's proposed test.  Are these,quote, "closely related claims"?  That is not, I suggest,a -- nearly a bright-line rule that would help theDistrict Courts in determining what is, and what is not,part of the same transaction.  So, I don't think thatthat's a real viable alternative.           I -- again, I think it's important for the Courtto go back -- if it's going to create a different rule inhabeas, it has to have some grounding --JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why doesn't the 1981 -- given -- maybe I don't -- haven't followed it correctly, but why doesn't the 1981 claim, then, relate back? I think the injury that took place from both violations took place at the time of trial.MR. PORTER: Well, maybe I wasn't following the hypothetical closely enough.JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, I --MR. PORTER: If --JUSTICE BREYER: Forget it.MR. PORTER: Okay. Well, let -- if we canreturn to the facts of this case, I think these -- we fitcomfortably within the definition of "transaction,"because both of the rights that Mr. Felix is asserting inthis habeas petition are trial rights.  Under this Court'sdecision in Chavez versus Martinez, in this Court's361111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425decision in Pennsylvania versus Ritchie, both the FifthAmendment and the Sixth Amendment rights are trial rights.Those statements, independently, when they were taken bythe same police officer, did not violate any rights.  Theyonly violated Mr. Felix's rights when they were introducedin the -- in the prosecution's case in chief.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But the argument as to whether it was properly done, whether the ruling was proper, is going to go back to the time of the Miranda interrogation.MR. PORTER: I agree that those facts are relevant, but it's the operative facts that are --CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, why isn't that an operative fact?MR. PORTER: Well, it is -- the operative fact -- what makes it actionable is that the statements were introduced at trial.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Yes, but --MR. PORTER: If those statements weren't introduced at trial --CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, you've switched. We were talking about "operative fact," and now you said "actionable fact."MR. PORTER: I believe those are the same principles, Your Honor.371111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Porter, if I understand2 you right, you are saying that, in the habeas context, the3 counterpart to an injury in a tort case is the unlawful4 detention, 56789 injury, could the habeas Petitioner come in with a10 complaint that says, "I am being detained in violation of11 the Constitution," period, "and I need a lawyer to spell12 out the details"?13 MR. PORTER: The Petitioner could file such a14 petition. They have been called "placeholder petitions."15 But, clearly, under Rule 4 of the habeas rules, such a16 petition would be subject to immediate dismissal by the17 District Court, because it doesn't conform with habeas18 Rule 2, which requires that all of the claims be alleged19 and all of the facts be alleged.20 JUSTICE BREYER: What21 what's been bothering me? To be22 sounds like a very good system.23 Petitioner, you file, within a year, your petition with24 one claim, and we'll look it over," says the judge, "and25 if it sounds like you need a lawyer, we'll give you a381111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-itself.  Am --MR. PORTER:  That's correct.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- I right?MR. PORTER:  Yes.JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Okay.  So if that's theabout the other part ofspecific about it, itThe system is, "Habeas￼1 lawyer, and then he'll come in with a whole lot more."2 And that's quite protective.3 But suppose you said that to Congress. They4 passed this thing. And you say, "You know, your year5 here, it doesn't really mean a year. It means a year for6 this initial filing, and then what's going to happen is,7 they'll give him a lawyer, and he'll come back and say the8 interest of justice, but, really, it always, almost9 always, favors the Petitioner, and the State isn't that10 fooled, and, really, it's not a problem for them, and" --11 what would that Congress have said? That's -- that is12 very much disturbing me.13 MR. PORTER: I think the answer to that is that14 statutes of limitations are ubiquitous in civil15 proceedings. But just as ubiquitous is Rule 15(c)16 relation back. They go hand in glove. And Congress, in17 1948, just three years after the Tiller case, when it18 enacts 2242, must have had on its mind that relation back19 goes along hand in glove with the statutes of limitation;20 and, not only that, but how relation back has been21 construed by the courts.22 So I don't think it's any surprise to Congress23 now all of you -- now all of a sudden that we say, "Oh,24 you know, by the way, there's this relation back that's25 going to give us maybe four or five months longer than the391111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 year." I don't think Congress is at all surprised by2 that. And Congress just adopted new rules of habeas3 proceedings, in 2004; didn't amend Rule 15(c), didn't4 provide another rule in habeas, didn't amend 2242.5 And, as far as the potentials for abuse here,6 the Seventh Circuit's -- Judge Easterbrook's decision for7 the Seventh Circuit in the Ellzey case has been on the --8 on the books for more than two years now. And I would9 suggest that if the parade of horribles that the Warden10 has suggested, about year-long delays and all of these11 potential abuses, in fact, are allowed by the rule that we12 seek here, that the Warden or the United States would have13 come to this Court and said, "Look, here are the abuses.14 They are happening right now." Well, in fact, Ellzey's15 been cited twice in all -- in these years, by the District16 Court, to allow relation back. Mr. Felix's case has not17 been cited18 the parade1920 15(a) as a21 really cuts off any right to file an amendment as a matter22 of right. Then --23 JUSTICE24 all, the amendment25 plea. As Mr. Chan1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400GINSBURG:  But I think that, first ofmay be made before there is a defensivepointed out, that the Warden doesn't even40 Washington, DC 20005 1-at all in a published case.  So, I think thatof horribles is theoretical and not practical.As Justice Kennedy pointed out, you have Rulebackstop.  And once the answer is filed, that￼1 get the petition until it's been screened by the Court.2 The other is the understanding, on the civil side, of Rule3 15(a). It's a very liberal pleading rule. The threshold4 for granting permission to amend a pleading under 15(a) is5 very easy to pass.6 MR. PORTER: In Foman versus Davis, this Court7 responded to that concern and said that District Courts8 have ample authority under 15(a) to deny amendments to9 petitions -- or amendments to initial pleadings. It said,10 for bad-faith or dilatory tactics, but then said even11 undue delay -- so you don't even require a showing of bad12 faith -- for prejudice to the other side.13 So all of the concerns that the Warden has14 raised are specifically identified by this Court to give15 the District Court the right to deny an amendment to the16 petition. And so, I believe that those powers in the17 District Court are very ample, indeed.18 Plus, we have -- the states19 ability to protect themselves. As one20 mentioned, we have 2266. If the -- if21 they get the protections of 2266. States have their own22 mechanisms. All but six states in the Union have statutes23 of limitations, or very firm laches doctrines, that will24 prevent the elongated delays that the Warden is worried25 about in this case.411111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-have their ownof Your Honorsthe states opt in,￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425           And as far as the notice provision, JusticeBreyer announced the unanimous opinion for the Court thismorning, in Durachem, and said, "It doesn't take much togive the defendant fair notice."           Now, I'd like to leave the Court with thejudicial aphorism that wisdom often never comes at all; itshould not be rejected merely for coming late.

Mr. Chan, you have four minutes remaining.          REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATHEW K.M. CHAN                  ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERMR. CHAN: Mr. Felix assumes that Congress knew about the Tiller case, and assumed that Congress would know that Tiller would be interpreted in a way as to allow relation back in a situation such as this. However, as pointed out, Tiller is not a habeas case. Rule 15(c)(2) did not even have any application to habeas cases at the time, until it was decided.           Also, I wanted to respond to Justice Souter'searlier question about examples of relation back in habeascorpus cases.  And I've cited two examples on page 27 ofthe Warden's brief.Unless there's any other questions, I have no 421111 14th Street, NW Suite 400  Washington, DC 20005 1-￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112131415161718192021222324251111 14th Street, NW Suite 400more rebuttal.           CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Chan.The case is submitted.           [Whereupon, at 11:57 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.]43 1-Washington, DC 20005
