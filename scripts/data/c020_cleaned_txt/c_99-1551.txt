Lockheed Martin Corporation.          Mr. Gottesman.            ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL GOTTESMAN                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER          MR. GOTTESMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it101112131415161718192021    merits.22              Now, that earlier California case had been filed23    by the plaintiffs in State court and, of course, we now24    know it was untimely.  If the case had remained in State25    court and had been dismissed as untimely by the Stateplease the Court:          This is a business tort action based entirely onState law, filed in the Maryland State court.  The suitwas filed within Maryland's time limits, but the Marylandcourts believed that they could not entertain the suitbecause it was barred by operation of Rule 41(b) of theFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  It was barred, theybelieved, because a Federal district court in Californiahad dismissed an earlier assertion of the claim on theground that it was untimely under the California statuteof limitations and it declared that dismissal to be on the3                                       1    court, it is absolutely clear that under California law it 2    would not have precluded the suit in Maryland, and that's 3    because the California supreme court has stated repeatedly 4    that dismissals based on the statute of limitations do not 5    extinguish the substantive right.  So far as California is 6    concerned -- 7              QUESTION:  Would it have been -- would the 8    California judgment have been binding on Maryland if the 9    same issues were involved, i.e., the statute of10    limitations are about the same, and the question was when11    the tolling period -- whether there was a tolling period12    or something like that, and the California court had ruled13    on the merits in the sense of -- on the issue, on the14    issue of whether or not there was tolling?15              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Well --16              QUESTION:  Then I take it Maryland, a) would17    have and b) perhaps must give credit to the earlier18    judgment?19202122232425          MR. GOTTESMAN:  Well, certainly if it -- ifMaryland was borrowing the California statute oflimitations it would certainly have to give credit, buteven if it was relying --          QUESTION:  No, suppose the statutes were exactlyparallel, and the issues were exactly parallel, but adisputed issue of fact as to whether or not there had been4                                      1 tolling? 2              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Well, I think if it was a 3    disputed issue of fact it would probably be collaterally 4    estopped.  There would be issue preclusion.  But of course 5    Maryland might have a different definition of what 6    constitutes fraud, in which case the finding of fact in 7    California would not necessarily dispose of the comparable 8    question under the Maryland statute of limitations.  There 9    was a close question here about exactly how much knowledge10    do you have to have to be compelled to file.11              QUESTION:  So there is some instance in which12    California's judgment has extraterritorial effect.  That's13    all I was trying to say.14              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Yes.  It might have15    issue-preclusive effect, but what the California supreme16    court has been very clear about is that so far as your17    right to assert the underlying -- you still possess your18    underlying tort rights, this being a tort suit, even19    though we have dismissed this suit on the basis of the20    statute of limitations.21              QUESTION:  If it's an ordinary statute of22    limitations; but suppose it was what was once called a23    built-in statute of limitations, a proscription period24    that bars not merely the remedy, but the very right.25              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Well, surely, if California had5                                                                                                                                 1    a statute and it was construed to mean that it bars the 2    right, then yes, that would preclude you going to another 3    State.  We would agree with that, Your Honor.  But here, 4    California is clear that its general statutes of 5    limitations do not have that effect. 6              Now, as a result, when the defendant removed the 7    California case to the Federal court and immediately moved 8    to dismiss, so it's clear that it understood at the time 9    it was removing, we're going to move to dismiss this case10    based on the statute of limitations, but by moving it from11    the State court to the Federal court and getting the exact12    same ruling, a ruling on California law, because, of13    course, the Federal court was obliged to apply the State's14    statute of limitations, by getting that ruling in a15    Federal court, it is now claimed, and the Maryland courts16    accepted the claim, that the rights which California's17    statute of limitations preserve had been extinguished18    because the statute of limitations was applied by the19    Federal court.20              QUESTION:  Well, isn't the position of your21    opponents here, Mr. Gottesman, that there is a Federal22    rule as to res judicata issue preclusion?  Do you disagree23    with the idea that there is a Federal rule, or just24    disagree with their version of the Federal rule?25              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Well, that's -- as this Court6                                                                                                                                1    has said in the O'Melveny & Myers case, it's -- you know,2    it -- there's a little riddle attached to that.  We -- I3    mean, if Erie, for example, is a Federal rule, if4    Dupasseur is a Federal rule, then yes, we would agree that5    it is a Federal rule, but the Federal rule is that the6    State's determination controls, so in some sense, clearly7    it is a Federal rule, because this Court decides what law8 applies. 9          QUESTION:  Your opponents also argue, I thinkwith some merit, that Dupasseur has been superseded by theRules of Civil Procedure.  What's your position on that?10111213141516171819202122    difference?23 24 25          MR. GOTTESMAN:  Well, it doesn't --          QUESTION:  I mean, can we say that it is a ruleof issue preclusion and you still prevail?7                                                                                                      MR. GOTTESMAN:  Well, absolutely, that we regardas the critical -- for us, the critical threshold questionis, we must persuade you that Rule 41(b) is not a rule ofpreclusion, or that if it is, it violates the RulesEnabling Act, because it is substantive, and so let meturn to that.  Rule 41(b) we submit for five reasonsshould be not understood to be a rule of preclusion.          QUESTION:  May I ask you, before you --          QUESTION:  Before you say that, do you meanissue preclusion or claims preclusion, or does that make a 1              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Well, I mean yes, we would 2    prevail if you said that in this case, but I don't think 3    that that's -- analytically it's not our position that it 4    is a rule of preclusion, but only issue preclusion.  We -- 5              QUESTION:  It isn't termed as a rule of issue 6    preclusion, because Rule 41(b) says that unless it's a 7    jurisdictional thing it counts as a dismissal on the 8    merits, even though nothing may have been adjudicated, so 9    it may be that 41(b) would be applicable despite the10    absence of any specific issue of adjudication.11              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Well, that's correct, Your12    Honor, surely, but I understand the question to be, what13    if an issue was adjudicated, would the party be barred14    from relitigating that issue.  I think the answer is, they15    may well be barred, but it's not 41(b) that causes the16    bar.  They'll be barred because whether you apply Federal17    or State law, issue preclusion rules generally are --18              QUESTION:  Well, you had five reasons and I19    sidetracked you.  I'm sorry.20              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Yes, five reasons.  The first is21    the text, and I'll come to that.  Let me just rattle off22    the five, and then I'll go back and talk about each of23    them if time permits.  The first is the text.  It is not24    by its terms a rule-preclusion provision.25              Secondly, that's not inadvertent. As the8                                                                                                                                 1    advisory committee notes, and states repeatedly, the 2    Federal rules do not state rules of preclusion and it 3    would be improper if they attempted to do so, because such 4    rules are substantive. 5              The third is this Court's decisions since the 6    Federal rules were enacted.  Now, this Court has not had a 7    preclusion case involving a State law diversity action 8    since the rules were enacted, but it's had a number of 9    Federal question cases, and so it's had an opportunity to10    discuss what are the sources of the preclusion rule that11    the Court applies in Federal question cases and it has12    never suggested that the source is Rule 41(b).13              Quite the contrary, the Court has repeatedly14    said these rules of preclusion are judge-made and the15    decisions of this Court that we have the power to16    determine when exceptions to the general rule are17    appropriate, et cetera, so that it's clear that this court18    does not understand Rule 41(b) to be directing the answer19    to rule preclusion questions.20              The fourth, and I hope I have time to explain21    this, is that the rule would be incongruous and in some22    respects implausible in operation if it were a rule23    preclusion law, and the fifth is that it would violate the24    Rules Enabling Act and would undermine important questions25    of sensitivity to State interests, these being things that9                                                                                                                                 1    would cause the Court, when in doubt, to interpret it as 2    not being a rule of preclusion. 3              Let me start with the text, because the argument 4    on the other side is principally that the words of 41(b) 5    are a rule of preclusion.  The words of 41(b) are that a 6    dismissal, unless it's in one of the exceptions, quote, 7    operates as a judgment on the merits, end quote. 8              Now, it doesn't say how a judgment on the merits 9    operates.  Often, judgments on the merits do operate to be10    rule -- to be claim-preclusive.11              QUESTION:  So what happens if we have a12    litigated case, a litigated diversity case in the Federal13    court and a judgment is entered, and then a question14    arises as to the preclusive effect of that judgment, any15    of the many different issues surrounding res judicata?  Is16    it established, or is -- are those matters adjudicated --17    are they determined as a matter of State law or Federal18 law?19              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Well, if they were State matters20    that were adjudicated we would suggest it would be State21    law.  There is --22              QUESTION:  I'm asking -- it must arise fairly23    often.  A judgment's entered.  It's a diversity case and24    plaintiff wins, and now, later on, there is a question in25    any -- in another Federal court to make it simple, as to10                                                                                                                                 1    what the meaning of that litigated judgment is in terms of 2    res judicata.  Does that second Federal judge look to the 3    State law, or is there some kind of Federal law on this? 4              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Well, we believe that the judge 5    looks to State law.  It may be a Federal rule that is 6    using the State law, but we believe that the question of7 its -- 8              QUESTION:  Federal law renvoi, so to speak. 9              MR. GOTTESMAN:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.10              QUESTION:  Federal law renvoi, so to speak.11    Federal law looks to the sea --12              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Yes, Your Honor, good phrase for13    it.  Federal law renvoi is what Justice Scalia said, and I14 think --15              QUESTION:  Yes, and if there is a precedent, I16    mean, the obvious thing is they should be treated17    similarly.  That's your argument.18              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Right.19              QUESTION:  So I was just looking for a precedent20    on that and I didn't find it.21              MR. GOTTESMAN:  I don't know of a case like22    that, and part of -- one of the reasons is that in all 5023    States if you had a case litigated on the true merits to a24    judgment, everybody would regard that as claim-preclusive,25    so the issue would never arise.11                                                                                                                                 1              QUESTION:  No, no, no, there are all kinds of -- 2    you know, peripheral matters -- 3              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Right. 4              QUESTION:   -- and my law clerk told me that 5    it's split on that, that there's a split in the circuits. 6              MR. GOTTESMAN:  In the circuits, just as there 7    is a split on this. 8              QUESTION:  Well, then we're really deciding that 9    when we decide this, I guess.10              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Well, the first step is to11    decide whether Rule 41(b) is the controlling answer.  If12    it's not, you then have to decide, well, if it's not, what13    is, and I -- that's the second part of our argument, and14    our argument for what is, is that Dupasseur or Erie, we15    think they are both actually grounded in exactly the same16    principles.17              QUESTION:  Mr. Gottesman, at least 41(b) would18    govern if you tried to bring the very same case back in19    the district court in California, would you agree that20    far, that this would operate as an adjudication on the21    merits, it would be preclusive of any further claim?  If22    the very same tort claim were reinstituted it would at23    least be preclusive of bringing it back to the very same24 court. 25                                                                                                                                MR. GOTTESMAN:  We would agree that it would be                  12 1    preclusive, but not because 41(b) says so.  41(b) says 2    it's on the merits, and California would regard that as -- 3              QUESTION:  All right.  Then let's switch to the 4    district court in Maryland now, the Federal district court 5    in Maryland, not, as we have here, the State court.  Two 6    Federal courts.  Would the district court in Maryland be 7    in the same situation as the State court in Maryland, or 8    would it look to the district court in California and copy 9    what that court would do?10              MR. GOTTESMAN:  We think it doesn't matter11    whether the second suit is filed in the State court or a12    Federal court, that either way preclusion is determined by13    the law of the place where the original judgment was14    rendered, because it's there that a ruling or judgment15    gets its preclusive effect, and whatever court is16    receiving that, or is considering that in a second case,17    must refer back to the first case to determine that.18              So as we understand what the right answer should19    be, it would not matter whether the second case is in a20    State court or a Federal court.  The question is, is what21    happened in that first court preclusive of the suit that's22    being filed in the second court, and we have to answer23    that by looking to the law that appropriately applies to24    the first ruling.25              QUESTION:  Can this question be answered en13                                                                                                                                 1    masse, or doesn't it depend upon what the dismissal was 2    for?  Suppose, for example, the Federal case was dismissed 3    not on statute of limitations grounds, this removed case, 4    this diversity case, but because the plaintiff was 5    recalcitrant and wouldn't comply with discovery requests, 6    and the district judge gives lots of warnings and he said 7    finally, plaintiff, I'm dismissing your case as a sanction 8    under Rule 37 for your recalcitrance. 9              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Well, we think in that case the10    dismissal is not for a reason of State law.  In the case11    that Your Honor is describing, the dismissal is for12    behavior in front of a Federal court, a matter which the13    Federal court polices as a matter of Federal law.  If14    that's what causes the dismissal, then we would agree that15    there is certainly at least a strong argument and maybe a16    compelling argument that a Federal rule of preclusion17    would apply to that, but the Federal rule of preclusion18    still would not be 41(b).  The Federal rule of preclusion19    would be something independent of that.20              But -- in other words, to us it's not just that21    it's a diversity case that's important here.  It's a22    diversity case that was dismissed for a reason of State23    law.  That being so, we need to know whether that reason24    of State law precludes, and California says no, it does25 not.14                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Well, what if a case is dismissed onthe grounds of frivolousness, and that's an application ofState law.  It's a diversity case, but the Federal rulesprovide for dismissal of something on the grounds it'sfrivolous.  Which one is that?          MR. GOTTESMAN:  If the frivolous -- if it is apenalty sanction, if adjudication is simply, you haveobviously not stated a claim --          QUESTION:  Yes.          MR. GOTTESMAN:  -- under State law, then becauseit is under State law it is the State preclusion rule thatwould apply.  If what the court is saying is, you arebeing vexatious and we want to punish you by the dismissalof your lawsuit, that might be Federal, because then theanimus for the ruling is not state law but something aboutthe Federal court and the Federal court's --          QUESTION:  No, where that's likely to come up, Ithink would be, you could imagine a Federal courtdismissing on the ground that this is no legal issue, thatthe State has a rule that if it was a pro se litigant youget two or three chances.  Then what happens?          MR. GOTTESMAN:  It gets harder, Your Honor.          (Laughter.)          MR. GOTTESMAN:  I grant that it's harder, but Ican identify what the principle is.  It's just the                            15                                                                                             1    application of it to all these cases.  Each one of them is 2    an interesting question.  The principle is that if this is 3    a decision that -- if the dismissal by the Federal court 4    is rooted in State law, then State law controls the 5    preclusive effect of that dismissal. 6              QUESTION:  But it wouldn't be -- 7              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Once you move -- and that's our 8    case.  Once you move me away from that and start 9    introducing Federal elements that induce the dismissal,10    the case becomes more complicated.11              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Well, isn't that example that12    Justice Breyer just gave, it's a Federal procedural policy13    that isn't going to go very -- won't be very effective if14    the recalcitrant litigant or the frivolous litigant can15    bring the very same case somewhere else, Federal or State,16    so don't you have to look at the particular reason for the17    dismissal, and you can't say it's always State law, it's18    always Federal law, but at least -- well, let me give you19    another concrete example.20              Suppose there's a whole claim, and it gets21    adjudicated, there is a counterclaim that defendant failed22    to bring.  Federal courts have a compulsory counterclaim23    rule.  Defendant then goes in as plaintiff to a State24    court, brings what would have been a compulsory25    counterclaim in the Federal court, in the State court16                                                                                                                                 1    where it's not a compulsory counterclaim.  Would the State 2    court then be obliged to defer to the Federal dismissal, 3    what a Federal court would have done, that's -- 4              MR. GOTTESMAN:  That is, I think, a difficult 5    middle ground case, and it was actually addressed by the 6    advisory committee to the rules, not in the case of Rule 7    13, which is what Your Honor is referring to.  The same 8    issue arises under Rule 23(b)(3), the class action 9    provision. What if people don't opt out of a (b)(3) class?10    Are they then precluded -- if they lose, if the class11    loses, are they precluded from bringing their own lawsuit12    in another court?13              When Rule 23(b)(3) and (c) were drafted the14    advisory committee said, we cannot state in the rules that15    your failure to opt out means you are bound because we are16    not allowed, by the Rules Enabling Act, to declare what17    the res judicata effect of that is, so all we say in the18    rules is, if you don't opt out of the class you will be,19    quote, included in the judgment, and it will be then for20    those who determine what the preclusion rules are to21    determine what that means, and we think they're likely to22    say that that means that they are preclusive, but that's23    not for us to say.24              QUESTION:  Mr. Gottesman, I hope you can spend25    some time on what happens if we agree with you that Rule17                                                                                                                                 1    41(b) does not answer the question.  What does answer the 2    question, then? 3              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Yes.  We think, Your Honor, that 4    the question is then answered by either Dupasseur and that 5    line of cases which, if Rule 41(b) did not overturn that, 6    which is what our first position is, then that is still 7    the law of this Court. 8              Now, of course, one more thing has intervened 9    since Dupasseur, and that is this Court's decision in10    Erie, and this Court's decision in Erie would11    independently suggest that if this is, quote, substantive12    in the sense that Erie makes the distinction, that State13    law would control, and it would be difficult to find14    anything that was more substantive than this in the two15    senses, the twin aims of Erie.16              First of all, California law says that the fact17    that you filed untimely here does not extinguish your18    substantive right.  You still have it, if you can find19    somebody who will hear it.  The right is still alive, but20    the Federal court is -- if it invokes a rule that would21    say, ah, but your right is not alive if it was issued by a22    Federal court you're getting exactly the opposite outcome23    on whether there exists a tort right, depending on --24              QUESTION:  Has the California court ever given25    any explanation of this doctrine, that it's a State law18                                                                                                                                 1    question, you're barred under State law by the statute of 2    limitations, but the right isn't extinguished?  I mean, 3    have they ever applied that to allow a plaintiff to4 prevail? 5              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Yes, they have, Your Honor. 6    There are three different ways that rule plays out in 7    California.  Two of them are within California.  You can 8    -- if you -- for example, if you are dismissed because 9    your complaint did not state a claim, because you failed,10    for example, to allege one of the elements, even on that11    very claim you can file it again in a California court if12    you can, you know, write a complaint that does state a13 claim.14              Secondly, even if you are foreclosed from15    pursuing that claim in California, you can take the same16    set of facts and say, well, we first alleged it as a tort.17    That was untimely, but those same facts actually add up to18    a breach of contract, and California will allow you to19    refile and pursue the claim as a contract claim.20              But thirdly, the California court has expressly21    said, and this is the Western Coal case, which is cited in22    our brief at page 48, that even if you are precluded from23    coming back to the courts in California you are free to go24    to a sister State if they are willing to hear the claim.25              Now, Your Honor's question is why?  Why does19                                                                                                                                1    California do that?23    that.456789QUESTION:  No, I wouldn't ask any question like(Laughter.)MR. GOTTESMAN:  Okay.  Well, then I will --QUESTION:  Mr. Gottesman, I would have thoughtthat the rule, Rule 41, does appear expressly to coverthis situation.  You say no, it doesn't.  If it doesn't,then it seems that we would have to look to Erie and to10    Hannah.111213141516171819202122232425          MR. GOTTESMAN:  Right.          QUESTION:  And Hannah seems to say that aFederal diversity court should apply a Federal rule ofcivil procedure to the case before it whenever the rulecovers the point in dispute and isn't unlawful under theRules Enabling Act or the Constitution.          So you would then have to persuade us that theRules Enabling Act makes this rule unlawful, as applied inthis situation.          MR. GOTTESMAN:  If this rule is a rule ofpreclusion, then --          QUESTION:  So you have to persuade us, 1) therule doesn't cover it, if it does, it's unlawful.          MR. GOTTESMAN:  Correct, or that, 3) that we arein fact covered under the exception in the rule, but that20                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425argument I'd prefer to leave to the briefs.          Yes, that is why Rule 41(b) has to be thethreshold point.  Now, the reason -- in explaining why itdoes -- it is not itself a rule of preclusion, even therespondent's brief at page 5 recognizes that it's not.What their brief says there is that Rule 41(b) addressesone of the elements of claim preclusion, and when --          QUESTION:  What about Justice --          MR. GOTTESMAN:  I'm sorry.          QUESTION:  I just don't want you to lose, beforeyou sit down, Justice O'Connor's argument that she justasked about, why would it be a violation of Erie?  Thatis, another way of looking at this is, what you've alldescribed, you've described what California does thatisn't a judgment on the merits, so the district court hereused the wrong word.  It made a mistake.  It wasn'tdismissing it on the merits, or it shouldn't have, but itdid, so your remedy was to appeal from that.          MR. GOTTESMAN:  Well --          QUESTION:  If it says on the merits, it means onthe merits, and what you all want is something that wasn'ton the merits.          MR. GOTTESMAN:  Well, but that's not the --again, the -- California has law in this, too.  It is notwhat the judgment says that --21                                                                                            1              QUESTION:  Yes, but if -- I'm just trying to get2    you to respond to the question of, assuming you lost on3    the point about what it means, then would this in fact4    violate Erie, et cetera?5              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Well, it would -- I mean, I6    think on the merits in Rule 41(b) it has a fixed meaning.7    I don't think it's a meaning that is variable with the8    nature of the case.  It would make Rule 41(b) quite9    unusual, because the consistent rulings of this Court have10    been that the Federal rules --11              QUESTION:  Mr. Gottesman, let me pursue one more12    thing that I think bears on what I'm interested in and13    perhaps what Justice Breyer's asking about.14              After the Federal district court in California15    proposed to enter the order it did, did your client then16    ask for an amendment of that judgment or explain the17    problem, or ask the court, look, here's the problem, we18    want to go to Maryland, would you clarify this and make19    sure that we're not bound or prevented from going to20    Maryland?212223242522                                                                                                                                          It seemed to me that your client had the firstopportunity to do that and perhaps just bypassed it, andso there's no inequity here if you're bound.          MR. GOTTESMAN:  Well, surely they had theopportunity.  We don't know whether they would have1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9prevailed or not on that, and if they -- if Rule 41(b) isa rule of preclusion their failure to avail themselves ofthat opportunity obviously will be fatal, but if we'reright that it is not a rule of preclusion, then theirfailure is irrelevant.  The --          QUESTION:  Didn't you go back to the districtcourt at some point --          MR. GOTTESMAN:  Yes.          QUESTION:  -- after the litigation in Marylandand the district court refused to say --          MR. GOTTESMAN:  Yes.  It was too late.  TheFederal district court said, sorry, you're too late.  Itsaid a lot of things that suggested that she certainly hadnot intended to --          QUESTION:  I don't want to use up your rebuttaltime, but Mr. Dellinger's brief says, and he's going toget up here and say they're running away from Rule 41.They're running away.  Why don't you just say, Rule 41 isclaim preclusion and this claim is different, end of1011121314151617181920    story?2122 23 24 25          MR. GOTTESMAN:  Well, that actually turns on thequestion --          QUESTION:  I missed it.  It is issue preclusion.It is issue preclusion, and this issue is different.          MR. GOTTESMAN:  Well, certainly this -- if all                            23                                                                                             1    41(b) is is issue preclusion, then yes, this issue is 2    different, because the issue here is, is it timely under 3    Maryland's statute of limitations. 4              QUESTION:  Yes, but that -- isn't that a pretty 5    tough argument, because the text of the rule says, 6    operates as an adjudication on the merits -- 7              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Right. 8              QUESTION:  -- which sounds like issue-preclusion 9    language, and I guess that -- which leads to my question.10              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Claim preclusion.11              QUESTION:  Is -- yeah.  Assuming that we accept12    your position, what function does the phrase, operates as13    adjudication on the merits, perform in a case like this?14              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Well, first of all it is there15    because it informs whatever the rule preclusion rule is.16    When 41(b) was adopted there were two preclusion rules17    announced by this Court, one for Federal question cases,18    one for State cases.  The Federal question rule was that19    if it was, quote, on the merits it is precluded unless we20    find an exception.21              The State rule was, we look to the State law to22    determine what the rule preclusion is, so obviously 41(b)23    plays an important role.  Wherever the operative24    preclusion rule says that on the merits dictates claim25    preclusion, then it will have that effect, but it's having24                                                                                                                                1234 time. 56 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425that effect not because of Rule 41(b) but because ofwhatever the operative preclusion rule is.          I would like to reserve the remainder of my          QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Gottesman.          Mr. Dellinger, we'll hear from you.         ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER E. DELLINGER, III                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MR. DELLINGER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and may it please the Court:          Mr. Gottesman has described what seems to be anutterly unworkable system in which we have a State courtthat is in the process of recognizing an earlier Federaljudgment begin the process of deciding what the Federaldistrict court should have done.          Rule 41 serves an extremely important functionin the structure of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.It reflects an understanding by the Advisory Committee onthe Federal Rules that it is very important to determineat the time a Federal civil action is dismissed whetherthat judgment of dismissal brings an end to litigationarising between those parties and their privities on thesame set of facts.  It gives you that answer so thateveryone knows whether this is an adjudication on themerits.  It is not, as Mr. Gottesman suggests at some25                                                                                             1    point, a complete rule of preclusion. 2              QUESTION:  But the question is, on the merits of 3    what?  You want to say, on the merits of the suit, and the 4    rule doesn't say that.  It's on the merits of what was 5    presented to the court, and this sounds to me like issue 6    preclusion. 7              Now, it may be that if you're dismissed on the 8    merits for failing to comply with the rules of the court 9    there's a strong Federal policy there, but here there's no10    Federal policy.11              MR. DELLINGER:  With all due respect, Justice12    Kennedy, two responses.  One, I do not think that Rule 4113    can be read to be merely issue-preclusive rather than14    precluding the claim and, secondly, even if it were so15    read, it would lead to very unpalatable consequences on16    the first question.17              This Court, I think, has passed this point in18    Plout, where you specifically held that Congress violated19    Article III of the Constitution when it tried to reopen20    and revive Federal cases that had been adjudicated and21    determined to be found outside the statute of limitations22    and Congress tried to retroactively extend the statute of23    limitations, and the parties seeking to defend the act of24    Congress said, well, that's just statute of limitations,25    and this Court says in Plout that --26                                                                                                                                 1              QUESTION:  But that was because they were trying 2    to reopen the judgment on the same grounds that the 3    judgment was granted. 4              MR. DELLINGER:  I understand that, and I will 5    come to that point.  I just wanted to make it clear that 6    there is -- there's clear -- that what the Court does in 7    Plout is to analogize a statute-of-limitations dismissal 8    to a failure to prove substantive liability and a failure 9    to prosecute.  That is a judgment on the merits.10              The Court said, to be precise, the rules of11    finality treat a dismissal on statute-of-limitation12    grounds the same way they treat a dismissal for failure to13    state a claim, for failure to prove substantive liability,14    or for failure to prosecute, as a judgment on the merits,15    citing for that proposition Federal Rule of Civil16    Procedure 41(b).  That wasn't dicta.  That was part and17    parcel of why it violated Article III.  41(b) stands --18              QUESTION:  Mr. Dellinger, I don't think your19    colleague contests that.  I think he agrees that 41(b),20    when it says, on the merits, does preclude another Federal21    court, and any State court, where the question is a22    Federal question and, therefore, where it is up to the23    Federal Government to say what an on-the merits -- what24    effect an on-the-merits decision has.25              But I think what he says is, it's up to the27                                                                                                                                 1    State courts to decide what an effect an on-the-merits 2    decision has with regard to State causes of action.  Now, 3    is there some reason why that can't be true? 4              MR. DELLINGER:  Yes, and since there are two 5    issues on the table, 1) that they should win because this 6    should be only claim-preclusive, which is what Justice 7    Kennedy asked, and your question, they should win because 8    this is a diversity case. 9              QUESTION:  I'm talking the whole hog, right.10              MR. DELLINGER:  On the whole -- and if I could11    just make the most critical point to Justice Kennedy, and12    then I'll return, which is that the structure of Rule13    41(b) says that all dismissals, involuntary dismissals are14    on the merits except those for lack of jurisdiction, lack15    of venue, and failure to join an indispensable party.16    Those three are claim-preclusive.  I'm sorry.  Those three17    are issue-preclusive, and because we know that the three18    exceptions are issue-preclusive, we therefore know that19    the basic part of the rule, not the exception,20    extinguishes the claims, and I think Plout makes no sense21    otherwise.22 23 24 25          With respect to the fact that -- the notion thatRule 41(b) should only operate where the first case is aFederal question case and not a diversity case --          QUESTION:  No, I'm not saying it should not only                            28                                                                                            1    operate.  It operates all the time.  But what is the2    effect of being an adjudication on the merits is only3    determined by 41(b) in Federal cases, because that is a4    Federal determination of what the effect of an on-the-5    merits decision is in a Federal case, and what Mr.6    Gottesman is saying is that it's up to the States what the7    effect of an on-the-merits decision is in a non-Federal8 case. 9          MR. DELLINGER:  Well, let's be precise aboutthis.  This is a Federal case in the sense it is inFederal court.  The dismissal is a judgment of the UnitedStates district court.  It is --10111213141516    action.171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Federal cause of action is what Imean by Federal --          MR. DELLINGER:  In only Federal causes of          There has never been a holding that a Federalrule whose text applies to all civil actions applies onlyin cases in which there is a Federal question rather thana diversity basis for --          QUESTION:  It would be quite contrary to Hannahto say so, wouldn't it?          MR. DELLINGER:  It would be contrary to Hannahto say so, because Hannah, the plain text of the rulecovers both of these.29                                                                                             1              Also, it's important to note how difficult it 2    would be to follow the notion that Rule 41 provides the 3    preclusive effect only in Federal question matters because 4    often, increasingly these days, a lawsuit will encompass 5    both Federal and pendant or supplemental State claims, so 6    that there's simply no indication in the rule that when a 7    Federal court reaches a judgment of dismissal in a case 8    involving Federal questions, in a case involving State law 9    claims, or in a case involving mixed claims, that you10    don't judge the preclusive effect by looking at Rule 4111    and how it operates as a judgment of dismissal in the12    Federal courts.13              Whether it is a Federal question case or a14    diversity case, the Federal courts have a strong interest15    in establishing at the time of dismissal, whether this16    does extinguish the claim or not, and their suggestion17    that, you know, why would the Federal courts have an18    interest -- you may be asking whether the Federal courts19    have an interest when it's a State law cause of action.20    I'm just saying that that's the -- let me explain why the21    Federal courts do have an interest.22              They would say, look, this is a State law cause23    of action, and the next lawsuit is going to be filed24    outside the Federal court system in State courts, but it's25    important to recognize that the Federal courts do have a30                                                                                                                                 1    very vital interest in not allowing people casual access 2    to try their cases in Federal court and not be bound by 3    the results. 4              QUESTION:  But access to what?  This is my 5    problem, Mr. Dellinger, with your position.  This is a 6    case that was begun in California State court -- you're 7    relying on Erie and no forum-shopping -- begun in a 8    California State court, removed by the defendant to a 9    California Federal court, and then the case is begun again10    in Maryland, which has a longer statute of limitations.11              But for the removal of that diversity case to12    the Federal court, this case, when it's reinstated in13    Maryland, would have been heard under the 3-year statute14    of limitations and one thing we know for sure, there is no15    substantive policy that either California or the Federal16    court there is putting forward.17              They're saying, we don't want to clog our courts18    with a stale claim, a claim we regard as stale.  If19    Maryland wants to have its courts occupied by old claims,20    it's none of our business.  We don't care what they --21    this is a procedural policy in that sense, what cases do22    we want our courts to be dealing with.  That kind of23    statute of limitations, as opposed to one that bars the24    right, is one that's directed to how long we want to open25    our court door.  Why should the Federal court or31                                                                                                                                1    California court care if another State wants to make it2    longer?3              MR. DELLINGER:  I agree with the question that4    California doesn't have much of an interest here, and if5    you think of this, if we get to it in Erie terms, and I6    think because this is a Hannah case with a Federal rule7    squarely on point we never get to Erie, but if you think8    of it as an Erie case, you're exactly right that 9    California doesn't have an interest.10              California has determined that the substantive11    policy should be that there will be a cause of action for12    business torts.  California has balanced the interest13    between keeping that alive and the interest of repose in14    favor of settling at 2 years for how long that should be15    tried in California.16              Mr. Gottesman infers from California decisions17    that California would not preclude a suit brought in18    Maryland.1920212223242532                                                                                                                                          QUESTION:  But that's nothing, I mean, at allunusual conjecture.  It is normally the rule that astatute of limitations that's merely a procedural one youdon't -- when you rule out the door you're ruling for yourforum and not for some other State.          MR. DELLINGER:  My point is this.  Californiahas no coherent interest.  It may be indifferent to1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9whether the suit is brought in Maryland, but we're notfrustrating any interest of California's in deciding thatwe're going to consider the dismissal conclusive, whereasthe Federal courts have a real interest in having Federallawsuits that are tried there absolutely conclude an issueso that parties don't think --          QUESTION:  Well, why?  Why?          MR. DELLINGER:  Because --          QUESTION:  Yes.          QUESTION:  No, I mean, I'm just going to say I'msurprised, I thought your answer was going to be, and tell-- perhaps it isn't -- that California has no interest inpreventing them from suing in Maryland, Maryland has nointerest, and the Federal courts have no interest, andwhat they should have done is just say, don't dismiss iton the merits.          MR. DELLINGER:  Yes, right.          QUESTION:  That's all, and they didn't say it. Ithought that -- now you didn't say that, so I'm sort of1011121314151617181920    interested.21 22 23 24 25          MR. DELLINGER:  Yes.          QUESTION:  I mean, I thought your point was, youknow, a dismissal on the merits is a dismissal on themerits --          MR. DELLINGER:  It could well --                            33                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  -- and maybe they're right, thereforethe thing to do is say, judge -- you see, that's --          MR. DELLINGER:  No, no, that's exactly where I'mgoing, after noting --          QUESTION:  Can I throw a question in, just onehere?  Does the form of the judgment make a difference toyou?  In other words, if -- supposing that if the judgehad said, if I dismiss this, this won't hurt you becauseyou can sue in Maryland, but then he entered a judgmentwhich did not get outside the rule, would the rule trumphis -- would the rule require that they could not proceedin Maryland even though he thought they could?          MR. DELLINGER:  Not if you have an indicationthat the judge is otherwise specified --          QUESTION:  He enters the same judgment he entersin this case.          MR. DELLINGER:  I would think that that is abar.  The only issue would be if the judge has expresslystated, outside the four corners of the page of thejudgment, that he intends it not to be a dismissal, youknow, on the merits --          QUESTION:  So it's a matter of subjective intentof the judgment, of the judge who enters the judgment?          MR. DELLINGER:  Well, I think that's apossibility, but I would go with --34                                                                                             1              QUESTION:  How could you, if you're relying on 2    41(b) and 41(b) says, unless the court in its order for 3    dismissal otherwise specifies -- 4              MR. DELLINGER:  Otherwise specifies would 5    suggest that you -- 6              QUESTION:  It would have to be within the four 7    corners of the order. 8              MR. DELLINGER:  But  you ought to stay within 9    the four corners of the order, and if the judge doesn't10    specify otherwise, it is claim-preclusive, and there is an11    opportunity at that moment --12              QUESTION:  Oh, excuse me.  Why does it have to13    be claim -- I would like to come back to your assertion14    that the dismissal on the merits cannot mean one thing for15    purposes of a Federal claim and something else for16    purposes of a State claim.  We've heard that California17    allows you to rebring the same claim that has been18    dismissed on the merits because you've left out one of the19    elements of the claim.  You can bring back the same claim20    involving the same transaction.  You put in the missing21    elements, and you're allowed to proceed, even though there22    has been a dismissal on the merits.23              Now, that's not what a dismissal on the merits24    means in the Federal system.  It means something quite25    different.  Now, what if you have a dismissal in a Federal35                                                                                                                                 1    court in California on the merits?  Does that mean that 2    that suit cannot be rebrought even in a California State 3    court, when you put in an additional element that should 4    have been put in in the original complaint? 5              MR. DELLINGER:  Yes. 6              QUESTION:  It does? 7              MR. DELLINGER:  It does.  It does mean that, and8 that's -- 9              QUESTION:  So you're dictating the --10    California's own res judicata effect as to what should be11    the effect of a judgment?12              MR. DELLINGER:  That is right, because the13    Federal court system sets its own rule for when a14    dismissal is on the merits and precludes further15    litigation of that claim.  The Federal interest in that --16              QUESTION:  But isn't -- again, isn't your answer17    the same as before?  You say, of course the Federal court18    here should have allowed another suit to be brought in19    California.  That's why it says, unless the court20    otherwise specifies.  The lawyer's supposed to say, judge,21    California doesn't dismiss this on the merits.  What22    California does is just bar you under the statute of23    limitation.  That's why those words are in the rule.24              MR. DELLINGER:  Let me go --25              QUESTION:  Now, is that right, or --36                                                                                                                                 1              MR. DELLINGER:  Yes. 2              QUESTION:  Don't say I'm right if I'm not,3 please. 4 5    point.  Almost all of their arguments are in fact 6    arguments that Judge Collins, the Federal district judge, 7    got it wrong.  To the extent that they believe that she 8    got it wrong -- and there are a number of different 9    arguments you could make.10              You could make the argument that Justice Scalia11    is making that Judge Collins should have thought, and12    counsel for Semtek should have argued to her, don't make13    this dismissal a dismissal on the merits.  Specify14    otherwise, for any one of a number of reasons, either15    because we think that it -- since this is a State law16    matter, State law doesn't make it preclusive.  They didn't17    do that.  They did not, after the dismissal comes down,18    and not only under Rule 41 -- they didn't file under Rule19 59(e) --20              QUESTION:  And you're saying because they21    didn't, what would not have been preclusive under State22    law has now been made preclusive by this Federal judgment,23    and that brings you right up against the proposition that24    Rule 41(b) cannot make any substantive change.25              I think that's a massive substantive change, to37                                                                                                                                MR. DELLINGER:  Let me go directly to that 1    say that a -- an adjudication that under State law would 2    not prevent further State litigation, now, because a 3    Federal judge has said this is on the merits will preclude 4    further State litigation.  Why isn't that a substantive 5    alteration, which the Federal rules should not be able to6 produce? 7              MR. DELLINGER:  That's because what is at issue 8    here is not a determination of what the law of business 9    torts ought to be in California.  What is at issue here is10    not even how long one has to sue.11              What is at issue here is the effect of a12    judgment of a case that has been adjudicated in a Federal13    court, where the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure set up a14    clear system, a signalling system for saying, all15    voluntary dismissals are not on the merits, are not claim-16    preclusive, all involuntary dismissals are, that's a17    default rule unless you otherwise specify.18              Now, there may be many reasons why you would19    think, Justice Scalia, that a Federal judge sitting in20    diversity ought to make a decision dismissing the case on21    statute of limitation grounds or any other grounds not22    claim-preclusive, that the judge ought to specify23    otherwise, and Rule 41(b) provides for that, so that24    whatever the reasons are, a Federal court sitting in25    diversity and a party before that court can say, you38                                                                                                                                 1    should not make this claim-preclusive.  One of the factors 2    you ought to take into account is the existence of a 3    contrary California law on claim preclusion. 4              And if the judge insists on not otherwise 5    specifying, or in this case making it absolutely clear, by 6    saying this dismissal is in its entirety with prejudice 7    and on the merits, you can seek relief under Rule 59 from 8    the form of that judgment and you can go to the Ninth 9    Circuit Court of Appeals, where they went to contest the10    merits of the statute of limitations claim.  They didn't11    do that.  They didn't take it to the Ninth Circuit.  They12    didn't seek certiorari.13              If that judgment was wrong, it is wrong in a way14    that is still clearly preclusive under res judicata.  As15    this Court said --16              QUESTION:  What is the Federal interest that in17    effect supports your entire argument?  Why are we going18    through this?  You've gotten right up to the line a couple19    of times to explain what the Federal interest is which20    differs from the State interest, but you've never gotten21    across the line.  What is it?22              MR. DELLINGER:  It seems to me, Justice Souter,23    that there are two Federal interests.  One is in having a24    clear determination at the time a suit is dismissed in25    Federal court whether that is an adjudication on the39                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425merits or not.          QUESTION:  You would have a clear determinationif you simply followed the California rule.  You don'tneed this for a clear determination.          MR. DELLINGER:  No, it is not --          QUESTION:  The only time you need it is if theState doesn't have a rule.          MR. DELLINGER:  Well, it is not clear to me thatthe State of California has a clear rule, but let me putthat to one side.          QUESTION:  All right, but we're assuming itdoes.  I mean, that's the premise on which we're takingthis case.          MR. DELLINGER:  If you assume for a moment thatit does, there's also a Federal interest in not providingmoot court opportunities for litigants.  This is --          QUESTION:  In other words, you say, we don'twant the Federal court used twice.  There is a Federalsystem, and if you've gone into a Federal court once, youshouldn't be going into a Federal court twice, but whydoes that preclude you from going into a State court?          MR. DELLINGER:  Because it would certainly leadto a too-casual resort to Federal court if the judgmentwas not going to be preclusive.  Let me give you a --          QUESTION:  The point --                            40                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  But the plaintiff didn't resort --          QUESTION:  Exactly.          QUESTION:  This was removed by the defendant,and that's why this is -- the position you're taking,frankly, is so troublesome, because it's the defendantwho's forum-shopping, and there is a reason for -- youhesitated, why does California say, we don't care ifMaryland wants to entertain it longer.          It's kind of a sisterly or brotherly attitudetoward your fellow State courts.  One says, we have ashort time.  You have to come into our court, say, in 1year.  Another one is more laid back and says, you cancome any time within 3 years, so the first State says,we're not going to clog our courts with this business.  Ifsomeone else want to entertain it longer, it doesn't -- noskin off our teeth.          MR. DELLINGER:  You raise a State interest.Justice Souter raises the Federal interest.  Let mepreface my responses by saying that I believe the RulesAdvisory Committee has settled this debate by the way ithas written the clear language of --          QUESTION:  Well --          MR. DELLINGER:  -- Rule 41, but I'm happy toengage in it, if I --          QUESTION:  Mr. Dellinger, to what extent should                            41                                                                                             1    we be guided by an opinion of this Court called Walker v. 2    Armco Steel? 3              Now, that case dealt with Rule 3 of the Federal 4    rules, and Rule 3 says an action is commenced by filing a 5    complaint, and this Court said, it does not determine when 6    an action is commenced for the purpose of triggering a 7    State statute of limitations in a diversity case, and the 8    Court in Walker said that the rule did not displace the 9    State's policy determinations underlying its statute of10    limitations.11              It seemed as clear a rule in its language as12    Rule 41, and in -- was a diversity case, and invokes the13    same concerns, I think, and yet we said, okay, there we're14    not relying on Rule 3's text.  Does that have a bearing on15 this?16              MR. DELLINGER:  It does, but we still win.  It17    does in the following sense.  I think that the best18    argument that you can make for saying that a Federal court19    ought to apply nonpreclusive, ought to reach a20    nonpreclusive judgment when the State rule so provides.21    The best rule, the best argument for that would be an22    argument that follows from Walker and Justice Ginsburg's23    opinion in Gasperini, where those cases take the position24    that the Federal rules are to be construed, although under25    Hannah they clearly prevail, they're to be construed with42                                                                                                                                 1    sensitivity to State interest.  So that you could imagine 2    that the proper thing for a Federal court to do sitting in 3    diversity is to say, well, look, it first looks like 4    there's a direct conflict between 41(b) and State law, 5    because 41(b) says these are all dismissals on the merits, 6    but State law is to the contrary, and I have this 7    otherwise-specifies clause, so I can make an exception, so 8    I could in the sense of Gasperini make an exception where 9    there's a contrary State law.10              QUESTION:  No, I don't think so, not -- because11    Gasperini was talking about the way Federal judges12    uniformly will operate.  Rule 41(b) is set up, unless that13    district judge otherwise so directs.  That's the problem14    with -- your out is, this district judge should have15    otherwise specified, go up to the Ninth Circuit.16              MR. DELLINGER:  Yes.17              QUESTION:  There's a big difference between18    leaving it in the hands of each individual district judge19    and saying, as in the case of Rule 3, when this Court20    interpreted that rule, not for one district judge but for21    all them it says, your clock doesn't start ticking until22    you actually serve the summons and complaint because we23    want to honor State policies.24              MR. DELLINGER:  I appreciate the distinction,25    but it's important to remember that any argument you have43                                                                                                                                 1    with what Judge Collins should have done in the Federal 2    district court is an argument that should have been made 3    before her and taken up on the court of appeals, so that 4    if in the future you wanted to tell district judges that 5    they always had to defer to State statute of limitations 6    the way to do that is on direct review of a diversity7 case. 8              There's a certain oddness here, if you think 9    about it, that we're talking about Erie and Hannah and10    Federal diversity cases on review of a State court11    judgment dealing with a matter of State law, because the12    -- it's just as if Judge -- suppose Judge Collins had said13    that she was going to decide this case, clearly14    erroneously, as a matter of Federal common law business15    torts, and they didn't appeal it to the Ninth Circuit,16    they didn't seek cert from that.  Even though that would17    be clearly erroneous under Erie, they're bound by that and18    can't second-guess it.19              Now, I never got the question of the Federal20    interest here.  You could have a litigant that's got a21    troublesome statute of limitations claim, because it22    involves possible concealment, possible latent defects,23    nondisclosure.  They could say, look, we could bring this24    in Federal court in California.  We can try it for 325    years, and if we lose on the statute of limitations44                                                                                                                                 1    grounds we'll have a very good practice opportunity, 2    because it won't preclude us at all from bringing the very 3    same case in some other State. 4              QUESTION:  That's -- can you answer my other 5    question that I had before?  I was not just trying to be 6    helpful to you.  I was trying to build up to a question7 that I have. 8              (Laughter.) 9              QUESTION:  That the -- imagine we have a piece10    of paper, which is called a judgment, after litigation in11    Federal court on a diversity case and it says, defendant12    wins.  Now, a lot of questions can arise as to the res13    judicata effect of that, peripheral questions, privity,14    parties, et cetera.15              Don't we normally use State law to determine the16    meaning of that piece of paper called the judgment, which17    came out of diversity after litigation, or do we?  I'm not18    positive.  And then, of course, I'm thinking if we do,19    shouldn't we get to the same result here?20              MR. DELLINGER:  That's a very good question, and21    it clarifies a point that they make.  Their best point22    under the Rules Enabling Act, which has troubled Justice23    Scalia in his questions, is that this is a -- all of a24    sudden we're making Rule 41(b) into a whole Federal law of25    preclusion.  No, we're not.  We're only saying it resolves45                                                                                                                                 1    one of the issues of preclusion.  It doesn't reach all 2    those other issues. 3              For example, you have to establish a final 4    judgment on the merits between the same parties involving 5    the same claims.  The only issue that 41(b) addresses is 6    whether that first judgment was, in fact, on the merits. 7    It's not a rule of mutuality.  It's not a rule of all of 8    these other things.  There are a lot of preclusion issues 9    where you would look to State law, and that's a possible10    outcome, some of which this Court hasn't resolved, but11    those are not issues with respect to which there is a12    Federal Rule of Civil Procedure squarely on point.13              QUESTION:  Well, you're just saying that, then,14    it's only changing a very tiny bit of substantive law.  I15    mean, it's still changing substantive law, even if it's a16 tiny bit.17              The fact is that if a dismissal on the basis of18    the statute of limitations under State law would not19    prevent the plaintiff from bringing the suit again, and if20    a Federal court, whether by mistake or not -- whether by21    mistake or not -- makes a dismissal on the basis of the22    statute of limitations and says it shall preclude further23    actions under State law, you're going to allow that to24    govern.  I think that is an alteration of substantive law.25    Now, it maybe just a tiny bit of substantive law,  but I46                                                                                                                                 1    don't see how you can -- 2              MR. DELLINGER:  Justice Scalia, if that is 3    considered an alteration of substantive law it would raise 4    havoc with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  There 5    are counterclaim rules, there are interpleader rules, 6    there are all kinds of rules that relate to and have some 7    effect on whether a judgment winds up being a judgment of 8    dismissal on the merits, and it's not the kind of issue 9    about which Justice Harlan was concerned in his concurring10    opinion in Hannah v. Plumer when he said, we have to be11    careful, I realize that the Federal rules, if they're12    arguably procedural, take precedence over State law --13              QUESTION:  It seems to me your --14              MR. DELLINGER:  -- but we have to worry about15    ordering people's private lives.  This is not a rule that16    orders -- that tells people how to order their private17    lives.  It makes political choices that a State ought to18    make for itself.19              QUESTION:  Was your answer to me, then, that the20    words, on the merits, are not peripheral because if they21    mean anything they mean claim preclusion --22              MR. DELLINGER:  If they mean any --23              QUESTION:  -- and therefore, if you apply it,24    you can't just look to State law because that would make25    the words meaningless in that Heartland issue, and if you47                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425put that -- you applied it where it's not applied, that'sjust a mistake like any other court, any other Federalcourt.  That's -- is that what your answer is?          MR. DELLINGER:  That's exactly right.          QUESTION:  But that's not a good answer, becausethey wouldn't --          (Laughter.)          QUESTION:  I didn't say it was a good answer.          QUESTION:  They would not make the wordsmeaningless, you acknowledge, in those cases where you'redealing with a Federal cause of action and where it iswithin the power of the Federal courts to say what theeffect of a judgment on the merits is.  That's enough togive the words meaning.          QUESTION:  It would also finally resolve themerits of the question whether the statute -- whether theclaim is barred by the California statute of limitations.That issue is resolved on the merits.          MR. DELLINGER:  Well, this Court has never heldthat a Federal rule simply doesn't apply in diversitycases when the plain text of the rule says it applies to,you know, all suits of a civil nature under Rule 1, andthere's just no way to tease that out of the rule.          I think that the uncertainty that would occur --for many reasons, California has never passed judgment on48                                                                                             1    the question of whether the dismissal of a claim in 2    California for the running of statute of limitations 3    should preclude the same claim from being brought in 4    another State. 5              QUESTION:  Mr. Dellinger, it is the normal rule, 6    and I think you're well aware that in the -- the Ryder 7    Miller Treatise puts this very issue.  The longer period 8    of limitation in the second forum, the traditional rule 9    has been that it's free to proceed with the second action10    if the State has a longer limitation.11              MR. DELLINGER:  Justice Ginsburg, if I may12    interrupt, as a matter of full faith and credit, but13    increasingly -- as a matter of full faith and credit if14    there's not been a first lawsuit, a State -- the second --15    the second State in a case like Sun Oil, the second case16    can apply its own longer statute of limitations, period,17    even though the first State has a shorter limitations18    period and is providing the cause of action.19              QUESTION:  Well, I wish that you hadn't20    interrupted --21              MR. DELLINGER:  I'm sorry.22              QUESTION:  -- only for this reason, because the23    next sentence goes on to say, Civil Rule 41(b) is even24    more clearly inapposite to these problems than to the many25    other difficult preclusion questions it may seem to touch.49                                                                                                                                 1              QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Dellinger. 2              MR. DELLINGER:  Thank you. 3              QUESTION:  Mr. Gottesman, you have 3 minutes4 left. 567 8    short points.  First, I think it must be evident that if 9    respondent is right, every defendant in the 25 to 3010    States which still adhere to the traditional preclusion11    rules is going to remove every possible case it can to12    Federal court if it thinks there's a time bar question13    because, by removing it, it will get preclusion unless,14    and this is now my second point, unless Justice Breyer's15    solution becomes the solution.16              Now, I want to make clear we do not believe17    41(b) is a preclusion rule, but still I will address the18    question of whether these problems can get solved that19    way.  For three reasons, I think they can.  First, the20    advisory committee has said it is not the function of the21    rendering court, the first court, to worry about the res22    judicata effect of its decisions.  That's in the advisory23    committee notes to Rule 23(c) in 1966, and that is a24    traditional Hornbook rule.  The rendering court doesn't25    sit around and say, now, let's see what the preclusive50                                                                                                                                REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL GOTTESMAN      ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. GOTTESMAN:  Thank you, Your Honor.  Three 1    effect of my decision will be. 2              Secondly, it would be -- 3              QUESTION:  But the recognition court must look 4    to the rendition court to find out what the preclusive5 effect -- 6              MR. GOTTESMAN:  Right.  Well, to the law of the 7    rendition court.  Not to the court itself, but to the law 8    of the state of the rendition court, that's correct, Your 9    Honor, but you rarely see an opinion in which the opinion10    ends by saying, and I think this decision ought to have11    res judicata effect.  I mean, it just isn't done, and the12    rules committee said it's not being done in the Federal13 rules.14              Secondly, it would be too complicated.15    Preclusive of what, as Justice Kennedy asked.  Every16    decision precludes some things.  The Court's going to have17    to write a Hornbook.18              If it's -- if the argument is, State law isn't19    preclusive of certain things, Your Honor, you should20    tailor your order appropriately, the parties are going to21    sit there and analyze the entire jurisprudence of that22    State in order to write in what it does preclude and what23    it does not preclude.  It would be an impossible task.24              And thirdly, it would mean that you would have25    constant appeals, because districts -- we now have created51                                                                                                                                 1    a whole nother issue to litigate in the rendering court. 2    Parties might not ultimately decide to bring a second 3    lawsuit, but they're got to worry that in case I might I'd 4    sure better get this thing right, and we are going to have 5    endless litigation in that first court, and it will be a 6    Federal court, because we're talking about Rule 41 here. 7              Now, the third point I want to make is this. 8    There's something very asymmetric about this.  41(b) -- 9              CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.10    Gottesman.111213141516171819202122232425          The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)52
