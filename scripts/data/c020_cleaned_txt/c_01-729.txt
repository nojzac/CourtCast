ROBERTS, JR.ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, andmay it please the Court:Alaska's Megan's Law makes available to membersof the public who seek it certain truthful information about convicted sex offenders. The State makes this information available to help protect against the risk that the convicted sex offender will offend again. It says that in the law. Sex offenses are crimes of opportunity, and the purpose of making the information available is to allow the members of the public to take steps to reduce those opportunities.QUESTION: One -- one line that I -- I think there is respondents seek to establish in this case is that this information has to be generated by acts that occur after the conviction. You have to fill out the form some -- four times a year, et cetera.I -- I've read in the brief -- I'm sure my￼31 colleagues have too the -- the problem about going to the2 police station. Just assume hypothetically that you had3 to go to the police station four times a year. Would that4 change the case?5 MR. ROBERTS: No, it wouldn't, Your Honor.6 That's the case in -- in about 14 States that -- that a7 quarterly verification has to be in person. It is not the8 case in Alaska. And simply going to the police station9 four times a year, which is reserved only for the most10 serious sex offenses, the aggravated offenses -- in all11 other cases it's just annually -- doesn't rise to the12 level of a burden that is at all tantamount to what we13 think of as punishment under the Ex Post Facto Clause.14 QUESTION: I have forms I have to fill out four15 times a year for the Government. I'm always afraid I'm16 going to miss the deadline. If I had to present myself to17 a -- a policeman, which is itself I think demeaning, I --18 I just don't know any analogue for -- is there any19 analogue for that in -- in regulation of --20 MR. ROBERTS: In-person registration?21 QUESTION: -- the regulation of regulated22 industries or things like that?23 MR. ROBERTS: I'm not sure of one where you24 actually have to show up in person, but the question is25 whether that in-person requirement is rationally related￼41 to a legitimate regulatory purpose. That's the standard2 under cases like Flemming.3 QUESTION: Well, Mr. Roberts, do they in Alaska4 have to go personally or not?5 MR. ROBERTS: They do not. It clearly --6 QUESTION: Even for aggravated offenses?7 MR. ROBERTS: Even for aggravated offenses.8 QUESTION: And it can be filed by mail or how?9 MR. ROBERTS: Expressly can be filed by mail.10 The instructions make that clear.11 QUESTION: Could -- could the administrative12 authorities interpret the statute so that you would have13 to go to the station without amending the statute?14 MR. ROBERTS: I don't think so, because the15 statute says the initial registration has to be in person.16 Typically it's in -- in prison. And then it says the17 later verification has to be in writing. So I think it18 would be an unreasonable reading of the statute to say19 that the later verification had to be in writing.20 QUESTION: Do we have an issue here because this21 law was passed after a number of the people affected by it22 had already been convicted, and so there are allegations23 of retroactivity concerns?24 MR. ROBERTS: The question is whether the25 burdens that the law imposes constitute punishment. If￼51 it's not punishment, then it's perfectly valid to apply it2 to people who were convicted prior to the effective date.3 And this is not --QUESTION: Mr. Roberts, the only challenge in is to the retroactivity. Is that correct? MR. ROBERTS: Only the ex post facto challenge the Court in this case.45 this case67 is before89 tried, convicted, served their time before the passage ofQUESTION: And that's because these people were10 the act.11 MR. ROBERTS: That's correct, and --12 QUESTION: And their principal complaint, as I13 understand it, is that this is punishment because we can't14 get out. There's no escape from it. We can prove with15 expert testimony that we are cured. Nothing will get us16 out from under this demeaning regime, that much more than17 the burden of going to a police station, that that's what18 it's about, that we're locked into this for life and it19 has a devastating effect on our lives.20 MR. ROBERTS: Well, for life, again only for21 aggravated; for 15 years for other sex offenses. And yes,22 that is one of their arguments, that they can't get out of23 it.24 But this Court's cases haven't drawn that line.25 The question is whether the burdens are pursuant to a￼61 legitimate regulatory objective, or whether they're2 punitive. For example, in cases like Kansas against3 Hendricks, couldn't get out of that, and yet that didn't4 make it a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. Flemming5 against Nestor. You couldn't avoid the sanction there,6 and yet it did not rise to the level of punishment.7 QUESTION: But there was a -- there was a8 determination, at least in Hendricks, that you fit --9 currently1011 It was an12 the depravation there, actual confinement, was far more13 severe than the depravation at issue here. But neither an14 individual determination, nor a chance to get out of it is15 required to avoid the categorization as punishment. Cases16 like Hawker and De Veau make clear that a -- a reasonable17 legislature can treat a category -- a category of sex18 offenders. They don't --19 QUESTION: But in Hawker, you didn't have to do20 anything. Here --21 MR. ROBERTS: Hawker was --22 QUESTION: -- I don't like to use the word23 "affirmative action," because that has a connotation in24 some other -- but you have to take an -- affirmative steps25 for the rest of your life in -- in some cases. Andfit into a certain category.MR. ROBERTS: A -- a particular subclass, yes. individualized determination required because￼71 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425this -- and this seems to me very, very burdensome and to differentiate this class.MR. ROBERTS: Not true, of course, in Hendricks or Flemming or Salerno, no opportunity to avoid it there. You didn't have to do anything to get the sanction applied to you. Now --QUESTION: No, no, no. I was -- I was saying but the requirement of the statute is that for the rest of your life you have to take affirmative steps to -- to re-register --MR. ROBERTS: You have to register.QUESTION: -- and to list all your automobiles and -- and to show that you've --MR. ROBERTS: You -- you have to fill out -- QUESTION: -- shaved your beard or something. MR. ROBERTS: -- one -- one side of one page.That's the form that's involved here. That in itself cannot be punishment. We -- as Your Honor mentioned -- we do that all the time in -- in today's society. So it must be something else that makes this punishment.Now, what the Ninth Circuit's -- Ninth Circuit thought was that it was publishing it on the Internet, that that made it punishment. But that's simply the most -- most efficient and most economical way of making information available.￼81 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425It also is passive. It's not displayed to people who have no interest in the information, and in that sense is far less invasive.The publication on the Internet will -- yes, it may cause adverse consequences when members of the community learn this public fact about someone's past. But the State is certainly free to weigh the convicted sex offender's interest in keeping that public fact from being widely known against the interest of those in the position of, say, Megan Kanka's parents.QUESTION: Well, "waive" -- "waive" isn't quite the word, Mr. Roberts. I mean, "waive" is something a person does --MR. ROBERTS: "Weigh." I'm sorry. "Weigh." QUESTION: Oh, I thought you said "waive." MR. ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Weigh the convictedsex offender's interest in keeping a public fact about his past secret against Megan Kanka's parents' interest in knowing that their new neighbor across the street had twice been convicted of sexually abusing young girls. That's a determination for the legislature to make.There are costs --QUESTION: But you could get that from the record of conviction.MR. ROBERTS: Yes, and all the State is doing --￼91 QUESTION: But under the statute we have here,2 you have affirmative steps that have to be taken for the3 rest of the person's life if he's a violent offender, to4 report four times a year. I just don't know any analogue5 for that.6 MR. ROBERTS: Well, there are countless7 analogues in the regulatory regime where people have to8 file quarterly reports. If -- and -- and the question is9 whether that requirement serves a valid regulatory10 purpose. It can't rise to the level of punishment just11 because the legislature has determined that the triggering12 event --13 QUESTION: Well, but I suppose that's because14 you choose to be in a regulated industry, or you choose to15 have this withholding regime. And it's -- it's not16 imposed on a class of citizens by reason of their criminal17 past.18 MR. ROBERTS: There are -- there are many19 disabilities that are imposed as a result of a prior20 conviction that the Court has found don't constitute21 punishment.22 QUESTION: None which require affirmative steps.23 MR. ROBERTS: Well, the affirmative steps --24 it -- that has never been the test. The test has been25 whether it rises to the level of punishment. Yes, the￼101 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425affirmative step of filling out one side of one page with the sort of information that you'd -- would put on your application to join the Price Club requires. There's nothing burdensome about that. It must be in their argument the use that that information is put to.QUESTION: What is our test for whether it rises to the level of punishment?MR. ROBERTS: Well, when the --QUESTION: Didn't the Ninth Circuit found -- find there was no intent to make it punitive, but looked to the effects?MR. ROBERTS: That's right.QUESTION: Is it an effects test and how do we apply it --MR. ROBERTS: Well, it's called the intent effects test. You'd first see what the intent is, and that is so critical, and nearly controlling because the same sanction can be punitive or civil depending on the purpose. Even confinement can be civil if the purpose is protective. So that's why purpose is so controlling.Now, once you determined that there's a regulatory purpose, as every court has -- not just every Federal court -- every court to look at these laws has determined they have a valid civil regulatory purpose -- then the one challenging that determination carries the￼111 heavy burden of establishing, by the clearest proof, with2 unmistakable evidence, that the effect is so punitive that3 the purported purpose must, in fact, be a charade. And --4 QUESTION: But why isn't the evidence that this5 is -- is a face plastered on the Internet, that in modern6 times that is the equivalent of the town square where7 you're shaming the bad actor? And here, you have a8 person's face, and you have only the bad information. You9 don't get the information that this person has10 successfully completed a rehabilitation course. You don't11 get the information that this was on the scale of sexual12 offenses on the lighter side. The -- am I wrong about13 that?14 MR. ROBERTS: Yes. That information is15 available. The circumstances, the crime for which the16 person is convicted, is available. So --17 QUESTION: Is it -- that's on the page -- the18 page with the photograph says what the crime was?19 MR. ROBERTS: That's my understanding, Your20 Honor, yes, that -- that -- I'm not sure what it is in21 every State, but the -- the circumstances of conviction22 is -- it's one of the things that has to be registered,23 and is available to the public. So if it -- you can find24 out what the conviction was for.25 Now, I don't -- I'm sorry.￼121 QUESTION: In addition, on that page, what the2 viewer will see -- you don't see on the page with the face3 any disclaimer, any statement that the State is not4 branding this person as dangerous. The State is simply5 making a statement that there was a conviction in the6 past.7 MR. ROBERTS: It conveys simply the truthful,8 objective information that this individual was convicted9 of this crime, and the public is free to take appropriate10 action if they think that's -- that's appropriate under11 the circumstances. It is different from the historic12 shaming penalties because of the purpose. And again,13 purpose is the nearly controlling factor. The purpose of14 the shaming penalties was not to inform. Everybody in the15 colonial village knew the circumstances of the offense.16 The purpose was to shame. Here, the purpose is to inform.17 QUESTION: Mr. Roberts, on that point you said18 this is truthful information, and it is. My question is,19 isn't -- it's not the whole truth because the successful20 rehabilitation in one case is not known. It's not known21 in the other case that a judge determined this -- this22 person had been cured to the extent that he could have the23 custody of a -- a minor child. That information is not24 known. So the -- the public is getting only the bad, and25 not the good. Its judgment is being skewed. And that's￼131 why it has a punitive flavor.2 MR. ROBERTS: Well, it conveys the information3 that the legislature thought was pertinent for people to4 take action to protect themselves if they think it's5 warranted. Nothing prevents them from finding out more if6 they want to -- if they think that's pertinent --7 QUESTION: But nothing would prevent anybody8 from going to the court, or the police station and getting9 a record of a particular person. It's made easy for them10 by the State -- access is made easy -- but only access to11 the bad information.12 MR. ROBERTS: Well, access to the information13 that the legislature thought was pertinent and that people14 wanted to learn. There is no requirement --15 QUESTION: Mr. Roberts, would it be possible for16 a defendant to include additional information on the form,17 and if so, would it appear on the Internet?18 MR. ROBERTS: There's no provision for that19 under Alaska's laws. I am aware of situations where --20 where they have a more active notification, where the21 offenders have taken steps to say, well, here's my side of22 the story, but there's no provision for that on the23 Internet.24 QUESTION: Suppose they had the same statute,25 but instead of it -- applying it to people who were￼141 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425convicted, they applied it to people who had been arrested, or alternatively, they applied it to people whom a policeman said he had gotten suspicious information about that he believed was accurate, no arrest -- now, suppose it's exactly the same, but they just do -- they apply it not in that way. What part of the Constitution, if any, would that violate?MR. ROBERTS: Well, it might violate the Due Process Clause if there's not a rational connection between --QUESTION: Well, it's rational in the sense that a -- a reasonable person would think that these -- it's a way of stopping these, you know, criminals. They're suspicious. They're -- they're -- suspicious people against whom there are suspicions are more likely to commit crimes than people who are not suspected.MR. ROBERTS: The legislature would have to show a rational basis for its categorization. That's the standard --QUESTION: All right. Your answer is it violates substantive due process or nothing.MR. ROBERTS: Or -- it may or may not, depending on what it shows.QUESTION: All right. I've got that. I -- MR. ROBERTS: Here the legislature had a solid￼151 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425basis, a basis that this -- QUESTION: Yes.MR. ROBERTS: -- Court has recognized, as recently as last June in the McKune case, for the conclusion that those convicted have a high rate of recidivism.QUESTION: Well, are you assuming from Justice Breyer's hypothesis, Mr. Roberts, that the policeman who has spotted some suspicious -- that these people have previously been convicted, or that this is just the -- the beginning of the whole story is that a policeman spots someone?MR. ROBERTS: Well, I understood the question to be it's just the beginning of the whole story, and in that case, I'd question whether --QUESTION: Well, there's certainly no ex post facto problem there, is there?MR. ROBERTS: No, there wouldn't be --QUESTION: No, what I was driving at is suppose that this statute too is -- I -- suppose I were to believe it was excessive in light of its purpose in respect to some -- some people, but not to others. What part of the Constitution would it violate, if any?MR. ROBERTS: Certainly not the Ex Post Facto Clause because in Seling against Young, the Court said you￼161 look at the law on its face, not as applied. Halper had2 started looking at laws as applied to determine whether3 they're punishment, and in Hudson and in Seling, the Court4 said we're not going to do that.5 I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time,6 Your Honor.7 8 910111213 may it 14ASQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Roberts. General Olson, we'll hear from you.ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERSMR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and please the Court:17 convicted sex offenders.18 QUESTION: Well, I suppose that the public in19 theory has access to it anyway because convictions are aCongress and the legislatures of 50 States have that citizens should have access to truthful16 information concerning the identity and location of15 agreed￼20 matter of21 wanted to22 convicted23public record, and presumably any citizen who dig deep enough could find out who had been of what.What this scheme involves is getting a big24 megaphone, in effect, making it more readily available.25 Is that what we're talking about here?171 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. OLSON: I don't agree with the characterization of this as a megaphone. What I -- what I would characterize it instead of saying it is the least intrusive, most passive way to provide information that is already available to citizens, and can be obtained by citizens, but to make it more accessible to them because the people have decided that they want this information.QUESTION: But it isn't passive because you have a lifetime obligation to update it.MR. OLSON: Yes, but it's --QUESTION: It is not passive.MR. OLSON: But it's -- but it's minimallypassive and -- and minimally --QUESTION: Now we're up to minimally passive. MR. OLSON: Well, Justice Kennedy, we have toregister to vote. We have to register to marry. We have to register to get a driver's license. We have to disclose our homes when we buy a car, when we get a divorce, when we fill out a census form.QUESTION: And most -- most of those do not involve -- involve shame or ridicule. This does.MR. OLSON: Well, the -- that is a separate question. I'm -- what I'm saying is that the burden of registration or of keeping information current is a minimally intrusive burden.￼181 Now with respect to the question of shame, that2 arises, to the extent that it exists at all, from the3 conviction of violating a sex offense. There is due4 process in connection with that -- that -- to the extent5 that process is due -- and we'll get to that I know in the6 subsequent case, but --7 QUESTION: Well, but precisely, but that -- that8 shows that there's an added burden here that was added by9 the State after the conviction.10 MR. OLSON: Yes, but that -- that is true of11 many regulatory measures. You can lose your right to12 practice in the securities field -- and that's been13 held -- because of a conviction or to practice banking or14 the right15 Court has1617 convicted18 after the19 retroactively -- retroactively require that he or she file20 their -- their earnings statements for the rest of theirto vote. There are other consequences. This repeatedly said --QUESTION: If a banker or securities dealer were of -- of -- of a crime, could the Government fact -- prospective -- pardon me --￼21 life with 2223 Court has24 held that25 can prevent those persons from practicing that profession,some regulatory agency?MR. OLSON: Well, I don't -- I -- I don't -- the never addressed that question, but the Court has after the fact, it can -- the -- the legislature191 including the practice of medicine, being a fund raiser2 for a union, losing the right to vote. The fact that3 this -- what the -- this --4 QUESTION: But, General Olson, there's a -- a5 difference in those -- those restrictions that affect one6 part of one's life. I can't practice a particular7 profession, but I can go out and get a job. I -- I'm not8 affected in where I live. My neighbors know that I've9 committed a crime, but they don't -- the same reaction --10 the notion that I am being labeled not a convicted11 offender -- which I am -- but a sex offender, a current12 status -- a current status with no opportunity to get out.13 MR. OLSON: Well, the -- well, the fact of14 registration and disclosure relates to the conviction of a15 sex offense. The public in 50 States and the legislature16 and Congress have determined in response to the requests17 of the people -- as Mr. Roberts said, the test, according18 to this Court's jurisprudence, is the intent. The intent19 here is not to punish. The intent is to respond to20 citizens who have --21 QUESTION: Well, I think it's -- it's easy for a22 legislature to say that, and in part, it's right. But in23 part, it seems to me that there are many indicia of24 punishment here as well. That's why you just don't rest25 when the legislature says it's regulatory. You must go￼201 beyond that.2 MR. OLSON: Yes. This Court has said that3 only -- you would go beyond that only if the evidence was4 the clearest proof, unmistakable evidence that the intent5 or effect was punitive as opposed to regulatory. In this6 case, there is no affirmative restraint on motion. There7 is no confinement. There is no restriction on travel or8 employment or recreation, no obligation to submit to9 searches, intrusive supervision or questioning.10 QUESTION: Well, there's no formal restriction11 on employment, but it -- in many of these cases, these12 people have terrible times renting a place to live,13 getting a job.14 MR. OLSON: Well, the empirical evidence is not15 great that that is indeed a significant statistical16 problem, but the problem, to the extent that it may exist,17 results from the conviction of a -- of an -- of an18 offense --19 QUESTION: No. With -- with --20 MR. OLSON: -- about which an employer may want21 to know.22 QUESTION: With respect, Mr. Olson, I mean, I23 think that's what's bothering us. The -- the offense has24 resulted in a conviction and a penalty. Each is a25 one-time event, as it were, or a one-time status and each￼211 is over. What this is doing is, in effect, imposing a2 status of public shame for a period of 10 years, or3 whatever it is, or a period of life in -- in the case of4 certain offenses. And that is not merely the consequence5 of the conviction for the crime which was defined, is6 over, and done with. This is something new.7 MR. OLSON: Well, to apply the seven -- to the8 extent that the Court would apply the Kennedy Mendoza-9 Martinez factors, there is no affirmative disability or10 restraint. Registration or publication has never been11 considered historically as punishment. The -- the --12 there is a regulatory purpose. The -- even the Ninth13 Circuit --14 QUESTION: May I ask you a question about that?15 I -- I understand that the -- the percentage of sex16 offenses in Alaska with children is extremely high, and17 what is -- has been the effect of this scheme if it's been￼18 employed? Has it had some19 MR. OLSON: I --20 QUESTION: -- in21 offenses?effect there --reducing the number of sex22 MR. OLSON: I do24 But what this is -- and I think this is a proper25 way to think of this statute -- in connection with a classnot know the answer to that, 23 and perhaps Mr. Roberts does.221 of offenses, where the -- where the rate of recidivism is2 significantly higher -- as this Court has held very3 recently -- than any other crime, people are asking their4 government please allow us to know when we have someone in5 our neighborhood. When we -- when we're hiring a new --6 QUESTION: Could -- could the State require a7 special mark on your license plate?8 MR. OLSON: No, I -- well, I don't know, Justice9 Kennedy, but I would say that would be considerably10 different 111213than what's here because that would -- QUESTION: I don't think it's very different. MR. OLSON: Pardon me?QUESTION: I don't think it's very different. MR. OLSON: I -- I respectfully submit that it's1415 a great deal different. That mark on your license plate,16 or mark on your forehead would go wherever you would go.17 It would require you to carry the government's message18 rather than the government supplying the message.19 QUESTION: Well, this statute requires you to20 make the government's message four times a year.21 MR. OLSON: It only -- it doesn't require you to22 make the government's message four times a year. The23 government's message, I respectfully submit, is made when24 a citizen submits an inquiry to the State through the25 Internet listing. All -- it is required four times a year￼231 is to advise the government of a current location or2 current information so that the information on the3 registry is accurate and -- and up-to-date.4 This is information that citizens have requested5 from their government. Their government has the6 information7 crimes, who8 dangerous.9 only the --of people who have committed certain types of society has perceived as particularlyIt's a self-protective mechanism. The -- not10 QUESTION: But they -- the Megan's Laws are not11 all one size and shape. I mean, some of them have the12 disclaimer right on the page saying we're not labeling13 this person dangerous and -- and have a chance for a14 person to get off it. Here, because there's no give, it15 does have a punitive feel.16 I mean, as far as the Federal legislation is17 concerned, a State that tells the whole truth -- is18 that -- that kind of law is totally acceptable within the19 Federal requirement, isn't it?20 MR. OLSON: It -- it would seem to -- well, I21 think the answer is that yes, it would because the Federal22 statute simply prescribes a floor.23 It's going to be virtually impossible and quite24 burdensome for the State to supply what you suggest would25 be complete information about any individual. What the￼241 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425parents and the --QUESTION: It doesn't -- at least to say what --whether the crime was a misdemeanor or a felony, the disclaimer certainly to -- to say, now we are not labeling this person a forever sex offender. We are labeling this person a convicted --MR. OLSON: Well, and that is all that the registry does, and I submit that to the extent that your question goes to any of the seven Kennedy Mendoza-Martinez factors, it's excessiveness is -- on -- on the scale.QUESTION: Yes.MR. OLSON: And I would submit that this registry and this information, providing truthful, public record, readily accessible information is -- is minimal.QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Olson. Mr. Thompson, we'll hear from you.ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARRYL L. THOMPSON ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTSMR. THOMPSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:We believe that the Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act imposes punishment because it possesses three features which are classically considered to be punishment, and not like any other civil or regulatory measure this Court has seen before.￼251 First of all, the sanction attaches2 automatically and inescapably solely on a basis of a prior3 conviction, without any determination of present4 dangerousness at all.5 Secondly, the sanction is a pervasive regulation6 of the person themselves. There is no attempt to try to7 regulate an activity or a profession here. It's a8 regulation of the person himself.9 QUESTION: Well, to what extent10 mean, Mr. Thompson? You said to regulate11 himself. I mean, he is not circumscribed12 activities, is he?13 MR. THOMPSON: He has to report14 year.doyou--doyou the personin hisfour times a15 QUESTION: But not in Alaska --16 MR. THOMPSON: Just like they do on probation.17 QUESTION: In Alaska, not in person, I take it.18 MR. THOMPSON: Well, we respectfully disagree19 with Mr. Roberts' characterization of the statute. The20 statute gives unfettered discretion to the Department of21 Public Safety -- the police -- to administer it in a way22 that it deems appropriate.23 QUESTION: How -- how has it been administered?24 MR. THOMPSON: Regulatorily they have done it by25 mail. But I can cite you instances, with affidavits in a￼261 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425parallel case, of people that were mandated to report to the police. They can do it and --QUESTION: Well, but that's not part of -MR. THOMPSON: -- have the discretion to do it. QUESTION: That's not -- that's not part of therecord here, is it?MR. THOMPSON: That is not part of the recordhere. But they have --QUESTION: At least -- at least --MR. THOMPSON: -- the unfettered discretion by the pure statutory language.QUESTION: When the -- they have to replace the photographs periodically.MR. THOMPSON: They do, and -- and they're required to -- on their quarterly report to report any changes in their physical characteristics, they gain weight, they grow gray hair, they get lasik surgery, don't have glasses, grow a beard, get fat. Whatever it is, they've got to report that information. And you know that's going to be a triggering event. I mean, if they look different, the police are going to have them come back in and get a new photograph --QUESTION: Well, but I mean, how is that different? Everybody -- you're sort of turning this on whether you have to walk to the police station or not.￼271 I mean, a lot of people have to go in and report different2 things, send in forms, give their pictures, even give3 their fingerprints.4 I would think that the problem is what happens5 to that information later, that everybody in the6 neighborhood knows it, that they're likely to shun the7 people, that -- that it may be too broad. I mean, is8 that -- is it really the police -- having to walk9 somewhere and write something as opposed to sending in a10 report that makes all the difference?11 MR. THOMPSON: No. I mean, whatI--whatI--12 the third characteristic is -- is the stigmatizing13 characteristic, which I want to -- want to talk about14 here. But it's not just --15 QUESTION: Well, what about someone who is truly16 a dangerous sex offender, who poses a real risk to17 children in that area? Now, what about that? Are -- is18 this a -- a scheme that is applied to such a person that19 poses constitutional problems, do you think, or does20 public safety rise to the level where it can be responded21 to in this fashion?22 MR. THOMPSON: Well, unlike the -- the Kansas23 situation, Kansas v. Hendricks, there's no effort to weed24 out those who are dangerous from those who are not.25 QUESTION: Yes. That's not the question I asked￼281 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425you.MR. THOMPSON: I apologize.QUESTION: I asked you whether, as applied to someone who is exceedingly dangerous, in your view does the scheme survive?MR. THOMPSON: Well, no. It's still an evasive regulation of the individual just like probation and it's still a stigmatizing system that labels them as dangerous.QUESTION: Maybe he deserves stigmatizationif -- with the high recidivist rate under the facts that Justice O'Connor gave you. The person is still dangerous.MR. THOMPSON: But not all of them are. And that's the problem with this statute. It applies to those people that are demonstrably not dangerous.QUESTION: If that's the problem --QUESTION: But your --QUESTION: -- how -- how -- this is -- what isyour response to Justice -- to the argument that was made on the other side? It said simply this, that you're -- you're raising an ex post facto claim. Now, we don't want to be nitpicking about this, but an ex post facto claim is a question of whether this is punishment, and they're saying it's not seen as punishment. It wasn't their intent to punish. It was their intent to inform so that the thing won't happen again. That's not a punitive￼291 intent.2 And therefore, your claims about how bad this is3 may be right. And suppose I accept them. Suppose I think4 they're right. Should I not, nonetheless, wait until5 somebody raises a substantive due process claim? That way6 you can decide if the problem with the statute is overly7 broad, if the problem is that some people should have it8 applied to them and others shouldn't. All the things that9 you mentioned would come into play. But as far as10 punitive intent is concerned, that's not the11 legislature's --12 MR. THOMPSON: Well, we -- I'm sorry. We13 disagree --QUESTION: I mean, that's the argument.MR. THOMPSON: Yes.QUESTION: And I'd like to -- but tell me what relation of the substantive Due Process14 15 1617 about the18 Clause --19 your argument? Now, that's what I'd just like to hear you20 discuss.￼about why isn't that the better vehicle to makeMR. THOMPSON: I mean, it certainly is a you know, to talk about whether or not it's tailored to -- to a specific regulatory goal.2122 vehicle,23 narrowly24 I think that is a proper challenge, and it was challenged25 at the lower court level.301 But we're here today on an ex post facto2 question before the Court, and the question is, is it3 punishment, or is it not? And we -- we respectfully4 disagree that this is intended to be purely a regulatory5 measure. And we disagree because the State's sole6 reliance is on the language found in the preamble of the7 statute, that it's designed to protect the public. That's8 one of the penal goals under the constitution in the State9 of Alaska for criminal justice system.10 QUESTION: Of course, that's true, but in my11 mind rings a case, in which I was in dissent, but the12 majority has the law, and that's Hendricks. If, after13 all, it's not punishment to put a person in a cell -- and14 I thought it was, but the majority thought it wasn't --15 why is it punishment, following the law, to simply require16 the person to make reports four times a year?17 MR. THOMPSON: Well, it is -- it is -- probation18 requires the exact same thing, and that's our point.19 QUESTION: And it -- it required less than20 putting the person in what was, in effect, a jail cell.21 I'm -- I'm looking at the precedent on ex post facto.22 MR. THOMPSON: Certainly. And -- and -- and you23 know, Hendricks and Salerno present the types of cases24 that are steeped in the pedigree of this Court looking to25 the need to protect the public from those people that are￼311 actively dangerous now, and that's why it was important in2 Hendricks that there was, in fact, those protections3 afforded to the individual. I mean, it doesn't happen4 automatically that Hendricks was going to be put in jail.5 There had to have been a jury trial, or trial by a judge6 with a preponderance beyond a reasonable doubt, and he's7 allowed an annual review. He can petition at any time.8 The secretary, at his own discretion, can remove that9 restriction. So the duration of that is solely limited10 and -- and looks to the purpose to protect the people from11 those -- the public from those people that are dangerous.12 None of those protections are here. In fact,13 this is a wide-sweeping statute that takes everybody in.14 And -- and we have to look --15 QUESTION: I -- I guess that one of the problems16 I have with -- with your side of the case is that this is17 public information insofar as a conviction is concerned.18 Insofar as addresses, credit card companies, and driver's19 license bureaus have this stuff all the time. It would20 seem to me that if the Court were to strike down these21 laws, some private business could have a web -- a web22 page, just like credit card companies do. There may be23 some Privacy Act concerns, but still, this is truthful24 information.25 MR. THOMPSON: It's not truthful information,￼321 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425and respectfully, I -- I agree with what Justice Ginsburg was saying earlier. I mean, it's -- it's false --QUESTION: It's -- it's truth as far as it goes. There's nothing false in the information reported.I questioned whether it was the whole truth because it has the bad side, but none of the good.MR. THOMPSON: It's sort of the sin of omission, particularly when we look -- we look to --QUESTION: Well, I -- I suppose a lot of credit --MR. THOMPSON: Well, and -- and it goes further than that.QUESTION: -- the credit reports are misleading too. Maybe the person is now very successful, and is paying all their bills. You don't know.MR. THOMPSON: But the legislatures made it clear that they are telling the public that these people weren't just someone who once had a conviction. They're telling the public that these people are actively dangerous now, presently dangerous to be actively avoided.And how do they do that? If you know someone is on the registry -- and the idea being make my own informed choice. Now that I know this information, get some more information. And if you know they're on the registry and you get the rest of that information, you know they're￼331 cured, you know they've been great --2 QUESTION: Well, does -- does any entity in a3 society, a -- a nursery school have an interest in -- in4 knowing the background of their employees?5 MR. THOMPSON: Readily available, and it has6 always been available and it was available before the7 statute.8 QUESTION: Well, they have an -- they have an9 interest in knowing that. That isn't -- that isn't10 somehow punitive or -- or half the truth. They make11 the -- they make the inference that there's -- that12 there's a 1314 was -- is15 felony child endangerment, if you leave your kid alone16 with someone who's on the registry. And it doesn't matter17 that that person is safe. It doesn't matter that thathazard here, a risk they don't want to take. MR. THOMPSON: What I was getting at earlier that the State of Alaska makes it a crime,￼18 person is not dangerous. So the State is telling you that19 they are to be avoided.20 QUESTION: Well, but that -- that issue is21 not -- not before the Court, and if that's so, this --22 this just shows that it's a regulatory scheme which has23 another valid purpose.24 MR. THOMPSON: We disagree. What we think that25 demonstrates is that it's a clear proclamation because it341 came at the same time as the amendments in '97, a clear2 proclamation of a legislative intent to tell the public3 that everyone on that registry is currently, presently4 dangerous.5 QUESTION: Well, you disagree with -- you6 disagree with the court of appeals then when they said it7 was not a punitive intent on the part of --8 MR. THOMPSON: Yes, we do disagree with that and9 we -- we briefed that in our brief.10 QUESTION: Well, you would -- you would concede11 that it is least ambiguous because the legislature said12 our purpose is regulatory. So you're not going to say13 that's -- that's incredible.14 MR. THOMPSON: Well, the legislature never said15 it was a civil regulatory measure. What the legislators16 said and what their sole reliance on intent is, is in the17 preamble where it says it serves to protect the public.18 And -- and it's clear that protection of the public in --19 in Salerno was -- was viewed as a proper regulatory goal,20 but in -- in Brown it's also viewed as a proper criminal21 goal. And in Alaska, it's the goal -- one of the stated22 goals under article I, section 12 of the penal23 administration -- it is a criminal goal to protect the24 public. So I don't think that -- that's -- that's --25 QUESTION: But it's a civil goal too, I --￼351 MR. THOMPSON: It is a civil goal too.2 QUESTION: You rely to some extent on the3 placement in the criminal code both that the information4 about this registry system has to be part of every5 criminal judgment and part of every rule 11 colloquy.6 MR. THOMPSON: That's -- that's true. The7 legislature, you know, in our view considered it such an8 important component and consequence of any criminal9 conviction, that in fact, that's the only information that10 a judge has to give to someone convicted of a sex offense11 in writing.12 QUESTION: So I thought it might be fair for you13 to say, well, it's -- it's mixed. It's ambiguous. In14 some respects, it's -- looks regulatory. In other15 respects it looks punitive. I thought that's what would16 you say instead of -- so we have to look further. But are17 you saying right from the very reading of this law, it is18 necessarily punitive?19 MR. THOMPSON: We do believe that. I mean, it20 was intended, again, to protect the public, but when you21 look to a law that's -- that's geared directly at22 individuals or groups of individuals and not set out to23 regulate any kind of activities, you know, that is an24 intent in our view to -- to punish --25 QUESTION: Would it affect --￼361 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. THOMPSON: -- solely based upon a prior conviction.QUESTION: Your claim is an ex post facto claim, a retroactivity claim. Suppose this scheme, the Alaska scheme, did allow people -- like the parties here -- to say, I'm no longer dangerous. Here's the documentation of that. Take me off the list. Would you say, nonetheless, it's still punitive? Are you saying that even if someone made no showing at all of lack of dangerousness,this is -- it would be ex post facto and therefore must fall?MR. THOMPSON: If I -- Justice Ginsburg --QUESTION: You -- you are asserting that Doe I and II are people who are no longer dangerous.MR. THOMPSON: Yes.QUESTION: But I'm asking you about the people￼in this large category wholeast have made no showingYou would have the same exrespect to those people?extent, on the ability to show that you're not dangerous?are still dangerous, or at that they're not dangerous. post facto argument with Or does it depend, to someMR. THOMPSON: First of all, I think we would -- we would take the position that in the absence of any criteria of actual present dangerousness demonstrates that -- that the legislature is aimed at the prior371 conviction and tacking on certain responsibilities to the2 prior conviction as opposed to really trying to fit the3 goal here 45 want this6 who was a7 that they're no longer dangerous, and then there will be a8 determination made, yes, you are, no, you're not, wouldof protecting the public from dangerous people. QUESTION: But if the legislature says we don't to be punitive, therefore we will give everyone convicted sex offender an opportunity to show9 you still be making the ex post facto argument for the10 people who have not shown they're no longer dangerous?11 MR. THOMPSON: I think it would certainly be a12 closer call, and --13 QUESTION: Why would it be a --14 MR. THOMPSON: -- and my clients would certainly15 invite that hearing.16 QUESTION: Why would it be a closer call? Why17 would it be a closer call? Is everything that is bad18 regulation punishment? I mean, all that would show -- all19 you're claiming is that some people who are not dangerous20 are -- are wrongly covered by this regulatory measure.21 That still doesn't prove that the regulatory measure is22 punitive. It just shows that it's stupid.23 (Laughter.)24 QUESTION: That doesn't make it violate the Ex25 Post Facto Clause. Every regulatory measure that goes too￼381 far is -- 23 probation4 because probation is historically --5 QUESTION: That's -- that's -- the question6 Justice Ginsburg started with is every time -- you just7 replied to Justice Scalia -- and what I hear are words8 that seem to apply with equal force to a perfectly-9 tailored statute that would catch only the most dangerous10 sex offenders who everyone agrees are virtually11 uncontrollable and might repeat their offense many, many12 times.13 See, if it applies -- if the argument -- the14 question people are asking you -- I'm simply repeating15 it -- is, on your argument why isn't that just as much an16 ex post facto law? What has it got to do with the matter17 that it's overly broad, et cetera, which sounds to me like18 a substantive due process argument, not an ex post facto19 argument? That's the same question. But I would like you20 to focus right on it.21 MR. THOMPSON: Well, I apparently have not been22 doing a very good job of it, but I'll try.23 When we look to whether or not the statute24 imposes a punishment, I think it's important that we look25 to whether or not it -- it's -- fits with the umbrella ofis not criminal punishment.MR. THOMPSON: It is if it looks just like and has the same consequences as probation￼391 things which have historically considered to be2 punishment. And that's one of our starting points, and3 that's why I keep going back to the concept of probation4 and parole because historically there's no dispute that5 probation is a depravation of liberty. Not -- it's not6 like going to jail, but it's a depravation of liberty.7 And -- and it's been considered as punishment, and that's8 what this thing does to people.9 Now, if it was a perfectly-tailored -- such that10 it could weed out the dangerous from the non-dangerous --11 well, we would invite that because my clients wouldn't be12 here today. My client has been determined, you know, to13 be not dangerous by a superior court family judge.14 But would it still be punishment? I think we'd15 have to look at the -- a little bit closer at it. But,16 you know, if there's a closer nexus between the public17 purpose and there -- there is a weeding out, maybe it18 wouldn't be punishment because maybe it's -- it's19 escapable, it -- it's --20 QUESTION: But then -- then you might --21 MR. THOMPSON: -- at that point, it's not22 regulating him for life.23 QUESTION: Well, at that point at least there24 would be -- I -- I assume your -- your point would be that25 there -- there is at least a -- a credible basis to say￼401 that if it covers only those who are affirmatively shown2 to be dangerous, the object is simply to apprise the3 public to4 punitive.5 dangerous6 object is7 is not so89 1012 tough to do? We don't know enough about it. It -- it13 would invite endless hearings. It would be impossible to14 administer this statute. I'm not making the argument.15 I'm repeating it --16 MR. THOMPSON: Right.17 QUESTION: -- for you to respond to.18 MR. THOMPSON: I guess that would make the --19 the due process hearing or the -- the hearing that is20 established in -- in Hendricks, and the hearing that's21 established in Salerno futile as well. I mean, judges are22 called upon every day to make determinations as to whether23 or not people are presently dangerous. They do it every24 day in the context of evaluating the sentencing criteria25 in the State of Alaska. It's called the Chaney Criteria.who is dangerous, and that doesn't sound very But if there is no attempt to weed out thefrom the non-dangerous, then the claim that the simply to apprise the public of who is dangerous credible. I mean, isn't -- isn't --MR. THOMPSON: That is my point.QUESTION: -- that one of your points?QUESTION: If that's your point, then how do you 11 respond to their argument which is that that's just too￼411 They have to look to whether or not someone poses a risk2 to the community. That's what they have to do in --3 QUESTION: How many Megan's Laws have that4 regime? I -- I understand that some of them do. Some of5 them are like Alaska. They say this is based solely on6 your past conviction. Others say you have an opportunity7 to show that you're no longer dangerous. What -- in -- in8 the range of Megan's Laws that all the States have, how9 many treat this as something you can get out of by showing10 you're not dangerous?11 MR. THOMPSON: You know, I don't have a -- a12 number for you. I can't tell you if it's 23 States or13 not. I don't -- I'm sorry. I don't --QUESTION: What's wrong about --MR. THOMPSON: I don't know that.QUESTION: What's wrong about warning the public may be dangerous? You -- you seem to say that -- it's only okay if the State warns the public is dangerous. What's wrong about warning the14 15 1617 about who18 it's only19 about who20 public about who may be dangerous? Let the public make --21 you know, the later -- later determination.￼22 MR. THOMPSON: I guess we get down to this who23 determines who they're -- who may be dangerous or not.24 I mean, what -- what's the criteria for that?25 QUESTION: What is irrational or421 unconstitutional about warning the public about a category2 of people who may be dangerous as to whom -- as the entire3 category of whom, there's more likely to be danger than --4 than with respect to other people? Where is it written5 that you can only warn the public about those whom you6 have -- are sure are dangerous?7 MR. THOMPSON: Part of the problem with the8 statute, it's not just a warning of the public. I mean,9 it -- it's -- there are really various components. It's10 not just a notification statute. I mean, you know, the11 public right now has access to -- through another statute12 that we have -- to offender information. All they've got13 to do is request. And this is an unnecessary statute14 in -- in one sense. Does it broadcast it on the Internet?15 No. But the same information is available, and it's16 information that's available not just going to a17 courthouse, but you can actually request the State for18 that information. And -- and for some people, the19 information may be limited. There are some restrictions.20 QUESTION: I'm -- I'm not sure if it helps you21 or hurts you. It -- it indicates that -- that the most22 distressing and damaging fact that you have -- that you23 have the conviction is available to the public anyway.24 And this is just a regulatory scheme to -- to make that25 information more clear as to how many people are in the￼431 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425community have suffered that conviction.MR. THOMPSON: What I was going to say is thatthe information as to serious offenses that are beyond 10 years is limited. There's some sense of limitation, some sense of it's been a long time. So that information is limited to those people that have a need to know, like for example, the day care providers and the teachersand -- and schools who want to know --QUESTION: Well, but I take it under the registration form we're talking about, that the date of the conviction is there, and the -- the citizen can make up his or her own mind as to whether the conviction was so long ago that they're no longer worried about it.MR. THOMPSON: They really don't have the right kind of information to make that decision. I mean, what they have is only the conviction --QUESTION: You want -- you want more informationon this form?MR. THOMPSON: Absolutely not.(Laughter.)MR. THOMPSON: The -- you know, I don't. I don't want more information.And the -- the tribunal that should be making the determination of dangerousness really ought to be in a thoughtful, rational process in front of a -- of a judge.￼441 QUESTION: What -- what if the State simply2 decided we're going to put on the Internet, the same way3 that Alaska does here, the names of all the people who had4 criminal convictions of any sort without any more5 information in -- in the last 5 years? Now, if they6 applied that to people who were convicted after they7 passed it, would that be ex post facto?8 MR. THOMPSON: I don't know that it would. It9 would probably have the same stigmatizing effect. I mean,10 I just -- I want to share with you the State has already11 done that in the State of Alaska. You can get information12 as to anyone in the State of Alaska by a click of a mouse13 by going on the Internet, if their convictions were in the14 State of Alaska. That information is already available.15 QUESTION: If it had the same stigmatizing16 effect, why would your answer be different? Why -- why17 would it not be ex post facto in that case, whereas it is18 in this? I'm not sure what line you're drawing.19 MR. THOMPSON: Well, the stigmatizing effect20 here is that these people are being currently labeled21 as -- as sex offenders.22 QUESTION: No. I -- I realize that, but you23 said in answer to the Chief Justice's question that there24 would be the same -- in your judgment, there would be the25 same stigmatizing effect if they put every criminal￼451 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425conviction on -- on the Internet. And if -- if the stigmatizing effect would be the same and the information would be just as readily available, why would your answer be different, that that would not be ex post facto whereas this is? That would not be punitive. This is punitive.MR. THOMPSON: Well, perhaps it would, but you know, our analysis of this ex post facto argument is really a composite of a variety of components of the statute and not simply the public notification provision.QUESTION: Well, what --MR. THOMPSON: It's certainly an important part. QUESTION: You're tapping everything, theregister and --MR. THOMPSON: Yes.QUESTION: So you would say even just the requirement that they register, even if it's just circulated to law enforcement people, that's impermissibly retroactive as well.So there can be -- is there any scheme for keeping track of ex-offenders that would pass the ex post facto test in your judgment, or is it just they've served their time, they've done whatever, parole is given to them, and that's it?MR. THOMPSON: You know, if -- if the requirements of the individual subject to the registration￼461 requirements alone were not as onerous as here where they2 have to report on every 90 days all kinds of personal3 information, and if they don't, then they're going to4 be--go--gotojail,itmaybeaclosercall. Imean,5 there was the -- the history of the felony registrations,6 but they've never really been approved by this Court as7 somehow being a proper regulatory measure.8 QUESTION: On the other hand, I don't know of9 any precedent -- perhaps you can tell us if there is --10 from this Court saying that a measure with a declared11 regulatory purpose is, nonetheless, impermissibly12 retroactive. I don't know of any case that so holds.MR. THOMPSON: Nothing is jumping out at me1314 either.151617 one thing --(Laughter.)QUESTION: Let me ask you to comment on -- on￼MR. THOMPSON: But these are unique statutes.18 1920 makes it more difficult perhaps than it might be to see21 your side of the argument -- go back to the Chief22 Justice's question. What if they put every criminal23 conviction on the Internet?24 Well, there's one difference between the25 situation that would obtain then and the situation that --QUESTION: I'm sorry. One -- one thing that471 that you're objecting to here. That is, that there is not2 the same high recidivism rate for crimes generally that3 there is, apparently undisputedly, for sex crimes in the4 State of Alaska. And therefore, when you earlier made the5 argument that there is something very -- something less6 than credible in the State's claim that it's merely trying7 to inform the public when, in fact, it makes no8 differentiation between current dangerousness and un­9 current dangerousness, the answer is there is -- or an10 answer is -- there is a very high recidivism rate, and11 that high recidivism rate does support the claim that12 there is something that -- that it is credible to say that13 by publishing this information, we are simply trying to14 inform people of a probability of dangerousness, leaving15 them to do what they want.16 What is -- is there any -- do you have any17 response to this claim that the high recidivism rate18 itself supports the argument that, in fact, this is19 nothing but a safety information kind of measure, whereas20 broadcasting all criminal convictions would not be21 justified22 the State2324 an expert25 that is --￼as having a good fit between the object and what was doing? Do you have any response to that? MR. THOMPSON: I certainly don't profess to be on the statistical recidivist rates. I think481 QUESTION: You don't dispute the State's2 recidivism figure, do you?3 MR. THOMPSON: Well, actually vis-a-vis the4 brief that was submitted by Massachusetts as an amici in5 this, sets forth a very different pattern of recidivist6 rates. I mean, when we say recidivist rates, are we7 talking about repeat sex offenses? Are we talking about8 repeated crimes? I mean, there are all different ways in9 which --10 QUESTION: They're making specific -- they're11 making specific claims. They -- they set out specific12 percentages with respect to Alaska. Are you disputing13 those figures or not?14 MR. THOMPSON: We do.15 QUESTION: You do. All right.16 MR. THOMPSON: We do, but I don't think we did17 it directly in our brief, but I think other -- other18 briefs --19 20 21 2223 degree of24 somebody is a pickpocket and you have a list and say,25 pickpockets have to register, the same thing as here. So￼QUESTION: That's -- that's the trouble. Yes. MR. THOMPSON: -- do.You know, even if we accept --QUESTION: Do you take into account that the harm, if you make a mistake? That is, suppose491 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425if you make a mistake about a pickpocket, somebody is out of some change. If you make a mistake here about a person's dangerousness, the consequences could be very grave.MR. THOMPSON: And there's a solution to that, and the solution is have -- is to look to the individualized determination of the person's present dangerousness. And, you know, in the McKune case, the --QUESTION: Would it be all right to have the person report every 90 days to have a determination of present dangerousness?MR. THOMPSON: It certainly wouldn't be necessary for John Doe I. He's already had a determination that he's not dangerous by a court. I don't know why you'd have to continue to redo that. I mean, the idea is you get progressively --QUESTION: I'm interested in the Chief Justice's hypothetical.MR. THOMPSON: No, it wouldn't be all right. QUESTION: It wouldn't be all right?MR. THOMPSON: No, not every 90 days. That's --that's awfully burdensome to require someone not just to come into the police station or fill out a written form, but to require someone -- as a direct consequence of a prior conviction, to require someone to come and -- and be￼501 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425subject every 90 days to a judicial scrutiny as to whether or not you're still dangerous, that seems to be a pretty big disability.QUESTION: It is a way out.MR. THOMPSON: It is a way out.QUESTION: And one of your complaints is thissystem provides no way out.MR. THOMPSON: That's absolutely correct. It isa way out.The Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act reallyis nothing other than tacking on -- for my clients -- a lifetime of probation, a lifetime of community supervision, having to report to the police -- my time is up.QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Thompson.Mr. Roberts, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERSMR. ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I think it is very important to place thevarious points that have been touched on this morning in the proper legal framework.The question, Justice Kennedy, is not whether it's burdensome to require someone to fill out a form and verify it. The question is, is that so punitive that you￼511 don't believe the legislature when it says that we're2 doing this to prevent future harm?3 The question, Justice Ginsburg, is not whether4 it might be a better system if it included other5 information, or whether that would be too burdensome for6 the State. The question is, does the failure to put on7 ameliorative information convince you that the legislature8 was simply not telling the truth when it said we're doing9 this to prevent future harm?10 And the question is not whether you should have11 an individualized determination or a group determination.12 It is, is the group determination so irrational that you13 think the legislature was not really interested in14 preventing future harm, it was just doing this to punish?15 In fact, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, this Court has16 never found a law with a civil regulatory purpose to17 violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.18 QUESTION: Is the effects test used to impeach19 the finding that the legislature had a regulatory intent?20 MR. ROBERTS: I think that is --21 QUESTION: I -- I thought that it was an22 additional step that you had to take if you -- even if you23 find the legislature had the -- the permitted intent.24 MR. ROBERTS: I think it only makes sense if you25 view it as impeaching the intent because, as Chief Justice￼521 Warren pointed out in Trop v. Dulles, the evident purpose2 is controlling because the same sanction can be civil or3 criminal. $10,000 civil penalty is not criminal.4 A $10,000 fine is. You don't look at the perspective of5 the individual because --6 QUESTION: So long as the legislature has a pure7 intent, it can have as burdensome a regulation as it wants8 based on previous criminal convictions?9 MR. ROBERTS: I think if the regulation is so10 burdensome that it causes you to doubt the intent, then11 you do have a problem, but that is the purpose.12 QUESTION: You're not saying -- you're saying if13 it's -- it wouldn't violate the Ex Post Facto Clause in14 your view. It might violate some other clause like the15 substantive due process.16 MR. ROBERTS: But again, with respect to both17 the Ex Post Facto Clause and the Due Process Clause, the18 question is whether there's a rational connection between19 the sanction and the legislative purpose.20 Now, if it is too extreme, it may cause you to21 doubt that connection. For example, it may be -- the22 legislature may say we think safe crackers present a risk23 of recidivism, so we're going to cut off their hands.24 There may be a rational connection there, but it's too25 excessive given the purpose.￼531 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425There's no way in which this law can be regarded as too excessive. It simply makes available information that is already a matter of public record, and publicly available because criminal trials under our system have to be public.Thank you, Your Honor.CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Roberts.The case is submitted.(Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in the above-entitled matter was submitted.)￼54
