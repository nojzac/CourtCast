Edward R. Coss, Jr..          Mr. O'Malley.           ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM P. O'MALLEY               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS          MR. O'MALLEY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          Essentially involved in this case is the failureof the Third Circuit Court to apply the rationale espousedby this Court in Custis v. United States, to conclude thatconstitutional deprivations other than deprivation of theright to counsel can be addressed in habeas corpusproceedings as constituting a collateral effect enhancingthe sentence of someone in custody under a conviction thatthey are seeking to attack in the Federal habeas corpus10111213141516171819    proceedings.202122232425          In this case, Edward Coss had been convicted inthe mid-eighties of simple assault and institutionalvandalism and had been sentenced to incarceration, and hehad completely served his sentence.          QUESTION:  Had he filed an appeal from thatconviction, ever?3                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. O'MALLEY:  Yes, he did, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  A direct appeal?          MR. O'MALLEY:  Yes.  He filed a direct appealfrom that conviction.          QUESTION:  And what happened?  Does the recordsay what happened to the direct appeal?          MR. O'MALLEY:  The conviction was affirmed.          QUESTION:  And then he filed for State post-conviction relief?          MR. O'MALLEY:  He did, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  On the inadequate assistance ofcounsel claim?          MR. O'MALLEY:  Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.          QUESTION:  And does the record tell us why theState courts never dealt with that?          MR. O'MALLEY:  No, the record does not tell uswhy the State courts did not deal with that.  It justwasn't dealt with.          QUESTION:  So we can assume that it may havebeen because the State court just neglected to get aroundto it?          MR. O'MALLEY:  All assumptions are possible, andthat certainly is one of them.  It slipped through thecracks somehow, and I've not been able to determine how,Ypur Honor.4                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  But you agree that the respondent wasnot at fault in failing to have the State court reviewthat claim?          MR. O'MALLEY:  Well, I wouldn't go quite thatfar, Your Honor, because the respondent could haverequested that the matter be brought up for a hearing.  Hejust filed his post-conviction collateral petition andthen --                QUESTION:  And there was an answer, I10    understood.1112131415    sat.16171819202122232425          MR. O'MALLEY:  I don't think it was answered,Your Honor.  An answer is not required under thePennsylvania post-conviction --          QUESTION:  Right, and it just sat.  Then it just          MR. O'MALLEY:  It sat.  He could have called itup, but in the meantime his conviction -- his sentenceexpired, and that's an equally reasonable inference as towhy no action was taken, because he got out of jail, andthe purpose of --          QUESTION:  Well, but the conviction hassubsequent consequences, as we see from this case, so itstill could be a matter of significance to the respondent.          MR. O'MALLEY:  Yes, it could be a matter ofsignificance to that extent, Your Honor.5                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  Was he entitled, under Pennsylvanialaw, after release from custody, to continue thecollateral attack on his conviction?          MR. O'MALLEY:  No.  I believe, Your Honor, underthe Pennsylvania law he would have to be in custody tocontinue his attack on that conviction.          QUESTION:  All right.  So then, at that point,there's nothing he can do to attack his conviction?          MR. O'MALLEY:  That would be correct, Your10 Honor. 1112    you've cited, that there is nothing that the Pennsylvania13    courts could have done at that juncture, when he was out14    of custody?15              MR. O'MALLEY:  Your Honor, I think that's to be16    found in the Pennsylvania Post-Conviction Relief Act.  I17    think the requirement of custody is implicit in the Act,18 or is --19              QUESTION:  Not just for filing, but for --20              MR. O'MALLEY:  -- is expressed in the Act.21              QUESTION:  -- resolving it?22              MR. O'MALLEY:  For obtaining the relief.  I23    think it's in the Act, but I do know, Your Honor, that24    Pennsylvania cases have construed that if you're not in25    custody you don't get-post conviction relief, Act relief.6                                                                                                                                QUESTION:  Do you have authority for that, that 1              Following the completion and full service of his 2    sentence for that conviction in the eighties, Mr. Coss got 3    in trouble with the law again and was found guilty of 4    assault and was sentenced to a separate term.  The record 5    indicates that the sentence for his earlier 1980's 6    conviction and sentence was considered by the court.  It 7    doesn't quantify the extent to which it was considered. 8    It was just noted by the court.  That was found both by 9    the district court and by the Third Circuit Court.10              Coss filed his petition pro se.  His Federal11    habeas corpus petition was filed pro se, and the district12    court, according due deference to his 19 -- or, to his13    Federal habeas corpus petition, construed it as an attack14    on his later conviction in the 1990's, as well as an15    attack on his 1980's conviction, and denied Mr. Coss16    relief based upon the fact that, although ineffective17    assistance of counsel was made to appear from the evidence18    that Mr. Coss suffered no prejudice.19              Mr. Coss then appealed to the Third Circuit and20    the Third Circuit reversed the district court, finding21    that prejudice was shown by Mr. Coss and finding also, or22    ruling also that because Coss' claim of ineffective23    assistance of counsel in his 1980's conviction was -- had24    an effect upon the sentence he received for his 1990's25    conviction, that he was entitled to Federal habeas relief.7                                                                                                                                1              And the means by which the Third Circuit reached2    that conclusion is the principal matter that I believe3    needs to be addressed here this morning, because what the4    Third Circuit did was relied principally upon5    jurisprudence developed in the Third Circuit which, for6    all intents and purposes, reverses district court judges7    that don't treat attacks on subsequent convictions that8    were enhanced, sentences of which were enhanced by prior9    convictions.10111213141516171819202122232425          The Third Circuit reverses those judges andsays, you should have found that this collateralenhancement on grounds other than Gideon violations issomething that we will not tolerate in this Circuit.          QUESTION:  Mr. O'Malley --          MR. O'MALLEY:  Yes.          QUESTION:  You say in your brief that yourargument is decided, divided into two parts.          MR. O'MALLEY:  Yes, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  One is a question left over, leftopen in Maleng v. Cook as to whether the custodyrequirement of the Federal statute is satisfied here.          MR. O'MALLEY:  Yes, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  And then the second is I guess whatyou've been talking about during most of your argument,what kinds of claims may you make if the Maleng question8                                                                                             1    is decided against you.  Are you going to say anything 2    about the question left open in Maleng v. Cook, or are you 3    going to leave that to your briefs? 4              MR. O'MALLEY:  Well, no, I am going to say 5    something about the question left open by Maleng v. Cook. 6    It is our position that the holding of Maleng v. Cook has 7    been misunderstood by the Third Circuit. 8              The holding of Maleng v. Cook clearly seems to 9    say that a person may not attack, or a person is not in10    custody under a prior conviction once he has fully served11    that conviction, but the Third Circuit reaches a different12    conclusion by looking at the result that was reached in13    Maleng, because in Maleng the Court will recall that the14    petitioner was granted relief, but in that case the basis,15    as I read Maleng, for the petitioner being granted relief16    was principally that there was a custodial nexus between17    the earlier conviction and sentence and that which he was18    attacking in his Federal habeas corpus petition, that19    custodial nexus being the hold that was placed upon him20    for the State conviction that he would be obliged to21 serve.22              In this case, however, there is no custodial23    nexus to connect the fully expired sentence to the24    sentence that the Court construed he was attacking in his25    Federal habeas corpus petition.9                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  Well, how can you say there's noconnection when the second sentence, the length of thesecond sentence is determined by the fact that there wasan earlier conviction?          MR. O'MALLEY:  Your Honor, yes, but I wastalking about a custodial nexus, and I believe that thedeterminative factor in Maleng v. Cook was the custodialnexus.  I think the question of the simple enhancement --          QUESTION:  Well, but this --          QUESTION:  He was in custody on the priorconviction, not just because of the prior conviction.  Hewas serving the sentence that had been imposed for theprior conviction, that's what the hold produced; whereasin this case he may well be serving additional timebecause of the prior conviction, but he is not serving thetime of the prior conviction.          MR. O'MALLEY:  If I understand your questioncorrectly, Your Honor, that is our position.          QUESTION:  Isn't it also in the case in Malengthat if the hold had not been placed, he would have beenreleased under the prior conviction?          MR. O'MALLEY:  That is correct, Your Honor, andthat is the factor that I think the Third Circuitoverlooked, and overlooks in its holdings on cases of this10                                                                                            10111213141516171819202122232425    type. 9101112131415161718          QUESTION:  Right, so the custody requirement ofsection 2244 is satisfied?          MR. O'MALLEY:  Well, he wasn't attacking his1990 conviction.  He was attacking his 1984 conviction.There's nothing wrong with his 1990 conviction.  The onlything wrong --          QUESTION:  Well, if you're right on the merits,that's true, but if he's right, the thing that's wrongwith it is that the length of the sentence was based on aprior unconstitutional -- a violation of the Federal          QUESTION:  But even if this case is differentfrom Maleng, how can you say he was not in custody in thiscase?  He's in prison.          MR. O'MALLEY:  He definitely is in custody inthis case, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Right.          MR. O'MALLEY:  He's in custody under a 199012345678    conviction.19    Constitution.202122232425          MR. O'MALLEY:  That is --          QUESTION:  If he's right.  I don't know whetherhe is or not.          MR. O'MALLEY:  That would be correct.  Thatwould be a correct statement.          But the Court in Custis v. The United States                            11                                                                                             1    adopted a line of reasoning which, while it may not 2    directly apply to Federal habeas cases, Custis having been 3    a case under the sentence -- the Federal Sentencing Act, 4    the rationale of those cases clearly seems to announce a 5    constitutional declaration that, in considering prior 6    convictions and sentences, the only constitutional 7    violation that the court will consider, the courts should 8    consider, are Gideon violations, where counsel was totally 9    absent, and that ineffective assistance of counsel cases10    do not fall under that umbrella and, therefore, are not to11    be considered as supplying a basis for Federal habeas12    attacks on subsequent convictions and sentence, enhanced13    by a sentence in which there may have been ineffective14    assistance of counsel.15              QUESTION:  Would you say that that rationale16    would have -- also would apply even if the Pennsylvania17    court had acted within the time period and set aside the18    earlier conviction?19              MR. O'MALLEY:  If the Pennsylvania court had20    acted within the time period and set aside the earlier21    conviction, we wouldn't have the problem, Your Honor, as I22 see it.23              QUESTION:  Why not?  I think your rationale24    would be, we shouldn't look at that, regardless of whether25    there's merit to the earlier case or not.12                                                                                                                                 1              Would you agree, then, that the Third Circuit 2    would have been correct in this case if, after Mr. Coss 3    had served his sentence, the Pennsylvania court, contrary 4    to what you say the Pennsylvania law is, had decided, 5    well, we will take a look at the earlier conviction, and 6    we now conclude that he was not given effective assistance7 of counsel? 8              Supposing they entered such an order, would that 9    mean that this -- that the result in this case would be10    different?111213141516171819202122232425          MR. O'MALLEY:  I think that would mean theresult in this case would be different, because the onlybasis for complaint that Coss had in this case dealt onlywith the earlier conviction and sentence, not with his19 --          QUESTION:  So then you're not saying that it'sonly a Gideon violation that gives rise to a claim.You're saying it's only an unresolved non-Gideon violationthat gives rise --          QUESTION:  I think you --          MR. O'MALLEY:  I don't know that I'm sayingthat, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  I hope you're not.  In -- I assume inthat hypothetical just posited there would have been nobasis for increasing the sentence.  You could attack the13                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425second sentence on its face as being improper becausethere was no prior conviction.          QUESTION:  No, no.  I'm assuming the secondsentence is entered before the Pennsylvania court rules.          QUESTION:  Oh, before the Pennsylvania court --          QUESTION:  The second sentence is entered, thenthe Pennsylvania court rules that, oh, the first case isinvalid.  Would that mean the second case falls, orwouldn't it?          MR. O'MALLEY:  I think it would certainly take agreat deal of the weight out of the second case, becauseit would --          QUESTION:  But your basic position is, onlyGideon violations count.  That's what I understood yourargument to be, and I'm suggesting we have a non-Gideonviolation that set aside the second -- set aside the firstconviction after the second sentence was imposed.  Wouldyou count it or not?  It's not a Gideon violation.          MR. O'MALLEY:  I think we would count it, but Ithink that count would come only on the basis of comity,on the basis of the Federal court giving due recognitionto what Pennsylvania had done with its own --          QUESTION:  Well, these are all Pennsylvaniasentences, are they not, that we're talking about here?          MR. O'MALLEY:  Yes.  Yes, they are, Your Honor.                            14                                                                                                      QUESTION:  If the Pennsylvania Supreme Court hadset aside the first sentence, surely the Pennsylvaniacourts would recognize the fact that it was no longer          MR. O'MALLEY:  That is correct, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  You don't have to get to any Federalhabeas there.          MR. O'MALLEY:  That's my -- that's why I'mhaving trouble with the question, because you really don'thave to get to Federal habeas there.  I think the basisfor Federal habeas would evaporate in that situation.          QUESTION:  Well, what if the --          QUESTION:  Well, I don't know why you -- myhypothetical is just the opposite.  I -- my hypotheticalis that they set aside the first sentence, but they didn'tset aside the second one.  We had a case like that notlong ago.          MR. O'MALLEY:  Well, I think the answer to thathypothetical, then, Your Honor, would depend upon theextent to which the second sentence was actually enhancedby the first sentence.          QUESTION:  Well, I'm assuming it was.  It wasenhanced an extra year because of the prior conviction.The court now knows the first conviction was invalid, butit decides, well, we think he really did it anyway, so15                                                                                            1234 valid. 56 7 8 9101112131415161718192021222324251 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9we're going to leave the second sentence in place.          MR. O'MALLEY:  Well, we do not --          QUESTION:  Would there be grounds for Federalhabeas relief?          MR. O'MALLEY:  We do not have that basis in thiscase because the courts have recognized that in the secondsentencing the first conviction and sentence wereconsidered, but there's no way to quantify the extent towhich, if any, enhancement actually took place.          QUESTION:  But you have to deal with hishypothetical, and don't you have to acknowledge at least asecond exception besides utter absence of counsel, and thesecond sentence being that, in fact, the prior convictionhas, by the jurisdiction that imposed it, been held to be101112131415    invalid?16              MR. O'MALLEY:  Yes.  If the second sentence was17    held invalid by the jurisdiction which imposed it, we have18    the question of comity, which I think would oblige the19    Federal courts to give the appropriate deference to that20    one situation.21              QUESTION:  Well, let's go one step further and22    ask, what happens if the defendant has done everything he23    can to get a resolution on the validity of the first24    conviction and, through no fault of the defendant's, the25    State refuses to deal with the question, and nonetheless,16                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425in the second proceeding, reliance is placed on the firstconviction that the defendant has tried to challenge butcouldn't?  That comes closer to this case, doesn't it?          MR. O'MALLEY:  It comes closer to this case,Your Honor, and I would say that in that situation theonly basis for Federal relief that the defendant wouldhave would be a Gideon violation, utilizing the rationalethat was expressed by this Court in Custis v. The UnitedStates, and that Gideon violations, the court has drawnthe line --          QUESTION:  Well, Custis acknowledged that aGideon violation still was open, but did it necessarilyconclude that there is no other exception?          MR. O'MALLEY:  I think it did.  It says, Custisasks us to extend the rule to cases other than Gideonviolations, and this the Court refuses to do.          QUESTION:  But if you assume there was someconstitutional violation in the first conviction, you saythe defendant can be deprived by the State of any chanceto correct that --          MR. O'MALLEY:  No, I --          QUESTION:  -- and the subsequent court can usethe unconstitutionally-obtained prior conviction toenhance the later sentence?          MR. O'MALLEY:  What I'm saying is, the vehicle                            17                                                                                             1    for Federal habeas corpus is not available to examine into 2    the collateral effect of any deprivations other than 3    Gideon violations. 4              QUESTION:  But you know, in Custis, one of the 5    things, one of the values that the Court was basing its 6    decision on was the value of finality, and it said comity 7    requires us to respect that finality. 8              MR. O'MALLEY:  Yes, sir. 9              QUESTION:  And you are now saying that that same10    value, and hence the same comity concern, would be11    implicated when a State in effect says, we are going to12    stonewall a constitutional claim, even though that claim13    is brought within a time period that our law specifies for14    it, and you're saying the result should be the same.  Do15    you really think the values involved are the same values16    that Custis respected?17              MR. O'MALLEY:  If we had a situation where the18    State actually did say, we are going to stonewall, I think19    we would have an entirely different --20              QUESTION:  So that the only distinction between21    that case and this case is that the State was simply22    silent and did nothing, as opposed to announcing in23    advance that it would do nothing.  That's the only24    distinction?25 MR. O'MALLEY:  That's the principal distinction,                   18                                      1    coupled with the passage of time and the expiration of the2    sentence.3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          Thank you.          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. O'Malley.          Mr. Russel, we'll hear from you.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT M. RUSSEL      ON BEHALF OF COLORADO, ET AL., AS AMICI CURIAE,                SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS          MR. RUSSEL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may itplease the Court:          We believe that this case is controlled by theconstitutional principle announced by this Court inCustis.  Custis found that it is permissible to enhance adefendant's sentence with prior convictions that werethemselves infected with constitutional error and, becausethat's so, a prisoner may not bring a habeas corpus attackunder 2254 on his current sentence and hope to reopen thevalidity of his prior convictions except when the priorconvictions are obtained in violation of Gideon.          QUESTION:  Mr. Russel, there was a factor inCustis itself that the forum that rendered judgment thatwas considered defective was still open, and it seemed tome an example of the ordinary rule that you go back wherethe judgment was rendered if that door is still open.          MR. RUSSEL:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  I believe                            19                                                                                             1    that Custis does express the preference for the forum, 2    which is to say that all these constitutional attacks need 3    to be made in the rendering State or in the habeas corpus 4    petition that follows, while the defendant is in custody, 5    so while Custis, in that particular case the Court 6    recognized that a habeas corpus avenue was available, that 7    observation was premised on the underlying observation 8    that he was still in custody and could go back to his home 9    State and attack his convictions there.10              Otherwise, once the convictions are final and11    the defendant is not in custody, then the only violation12    that the defendant can raise in a complaint about his13    prior conviction is that the prior conviction was obtained14    in violation of Gideon.15              QUESTION:  Well --16              QUESTION:  But in this case, the person in17    custody is in the position where he simply can't get State18    collateral review.  There could have been another case, in19    all respects similar to this petitioner, with the one20    difference that a week before his custody in the State for21    the first sentence, a week before the custody expired, the22    State Supreme Court said, oh, you're right, there's a23    constitutional violation.24              It seems rather quixotic to deprive the25    petitioner of that opportunity here, simply because his20                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425sentence was served before the court got around to rulingon the issue.          MR. RUSSEL:  I have two observations for you,Justice Kennedy.  First, we believe that the petitioner inthis case could actually have obtained relief, review ofhis earlier case while he was in custody.          Now, admittedly the State courts do not -- underthe Alhorn case we -- the cite -- the question, the answerto Justice O'Connor's question was, the -- in our brief,the green brief, at page 3 on footnote 3 there's the caseof Pennsylvania v. Alhorn, and that's the authority forthe proposition that once the petitioner is released fromcustody in Pennsylvania, he cannot bring a PCR attack onhis sentence.          The -- I think what it amounts to is thatPennsylvania --          QUESTION:  Well, he couldn't file it, but couldit be resolved if he had previously filed it while incustody?  That's the question.          MR. RUSSEL:  I believe not, Your Honor.  Ibelieve that essentially Pennsylvania --          QUESTION:  Well then, my question stands.          MR. RUSSEL:  Yes.  Yes, it does, and theultimate thing is that, irrespective of what Pennsylvanialaw would do, the imminent release of the prisoner from21                                                                                             1    custody would have allowed him to file a habeas corpus 2    petition under 2254 while he was still in custody, and he 3    would have had an excellent argument, under futility, that 4    he wouldn't be able to exhaust his State remedies and 5    could have achieved a Federal review of his Strickland 6    claim back in the rendering State. 7              Now, at this -- 8              QUESTION:  Oh, you mean you could file a Federal 9    habeas corpus action saying, you know, my custody is about10    to expire, the State court is a little slow, it's just11    time for you to get into this?  I've never heard -- I12    think we would immediately say that it's been unexhausted.13              MR. RUSSEL:  Well, Your Honor, I mean, the14    question for that --15              QUESTION:  That's a strange proposition.16              MR. RUSSEL:  The question -- I think the17    question would be whether the State remedies were going to18    be availing at that point and if, in fact, the State19    remedies were going to be concluded a week later because20    of State law, then I thought the petitioner would have an21    avenue for relief under the Federal habeas corpus while he22    was in custody.23              Even if that's wrong, even -- assuming for the24    sake of argument that I'm wrong about that, and I think25    there will be --22                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  Well, excuse me, would that Federalrelief still be available when he was out of custody?  Canyou get 2254 when the custody is over?          MR. RUSSEL:  No, Your --          QUESTION:  Wouldn't you face the same problem inthe Federal habeas court that you faced in the Statehabeas court?          MR. RUSSEL:  If he had filed, Your Honor, hispetition while he was in custody in Federal court, thenunder this Court's mootness analysis of Karafas v.LaVallee and Cibron v. New York, the case would not bemoot, and the Court would have jurisdiction to considerthe merits of the petition, even though he had beenreleased from custody, precisely because this Court isconcerned about the future possibility of collateral10111213141516    consequences.17              QUESTION:  What is the Pennsylvania law?  Leave18    all this Federal law out of it.  Pennsylvania has some19    kind of a guideline system, and so if you come into a20    Federal court, the defendant's convicted, he's now going21    be sentenced, he has a prior conviction obtained 30 years22    ago when he was robbing some chicken coops.  He would like23    to say that that confession was beaten out of me.  It's24    totally wrong.  Can he do it, or does the judge, like the25    Federal system after Custis, just say we won't even23                                                                                                                                1 listen? 2              MR. RUSSEL:  I believe, Your Honor, that under 3    Pennsylvania law the judge says, we won't even listen.  I 4    think that's the way it works in Pennsylvania, and so our 5    rule definitely, while calling for application of the 6    Custis principle, we certainly think that this may exclude 7    some defendants from achieving relief in State court 8    first, but we think that the line drawn in Custis is a 9    fair and equitable balancing of the competing concerns10    between fairness and finality, and it's certainly a rule11    that can be applied uniformly throughout the States.12              I would like to point out that in substance our13    position tracks very closely to the argument advanced by14    the United States last month in the Daniels case and,15    while we think the Government's right there, we believe16    that this case presents even stronger reasons for17    application of the Custis principle.18              One chief difference is that, whereas in Daniels19    this case came to us through an application of a mandatory20    sentence enhancement scheme, this involved the21    discretionary use of a prior conviction by a sentencing22    court, and that's something that happens much more often.23    It happens in every sentencing court in the country every24    single day, and so to the extent the Custis majority was25    motivated by concerns about finality, and of the burden of24                                                                                                                                 1    conducting endless derivative collateral attacks, that 2    concern, those concerns are implicated to a far greater 3    degree here. 4              It would simply be unworkable if we had to go 5    investigate Strickland claims about trials that took place 6    in a different State many years ago every time a prior 7    conviction was used in a discretionary proceeding.  We8 couldn't -- 9              QUESTION:  Why wouldn't that be taken care of if10    you had a requirement you have to show cause in prejudice11    for not knocking it out earlier?  You're talking about12    stale evidence, and if you had a requirement that the13    petitioner had to present it at the earliest opportunity,14    then you wouldn't have the problem of people coming in 2015    years later when they could have come in 2 years later, so16    why doesn't your horribles -- why isn't the answer to that17    simply, we put a timeliness requirement on?18              MR. RUSSEL:  Well, because -- certainly the19    cause in prejudice, I think that without -- even with the20    cause in prejudice rule there will be defendants who are21    trying to raise the validity of their prior convictions22    many years after the fact.  Perhaps they were precluded23    because the law didn't allow the attack.  Perhaps they24    only learned of the violation late, as in the case of a25    Brady or a newly discovered evidence rule, and in all of25                                                                                                                                 1    those cases we'll be opening up a collateral review, often 2    in a different State, and trying to discuss the relevance, 3    or the reliability of a prior conviction that was obtained 4    many years earlier. 5              QUESTION:  You'll have cause in prejudice 6    proceedings -- 7              MR. RUSSEL:  Yes. 8              QUESTION:  -- as a regular matter. 9              MR. RUSSEL:  Yes.10              QUESTION:  Evidence claimed to have been found11 later --12              MR. RUSSEL:  Yes.13              QUESTION:  -- when it was too late to do it, and14 so forth.15              MR. RUSSEL:  And the burden of that litigation16    would just add to the same litigation problems we're going17 to have.18              A second difference between our case and the19    Daniels case is that there's a federalism component here20    that was not present in Daniels.  We think it is one thing21    for the Federal system to say to the States, we will not22    use your convictions for our sentencing purposes, but it's23    quite a different thing for the Federal system to say, you24    may not use your convictions for your sentencing purposes.25              And finally, we note that from the transcript of26                                                                                                                                 1    the Daniels argument, some members of the Court at least 2    entertained the possibility that the text of 2255 -- 2255 3    may allow for collateral attacks on grounds that are 4    themselves not mandated by the Constitution, and to the 5    extent that's a possibility, we think that's a difference 6    in our case as well, because this Court repeatedly has 7    stated that 2254 exists solely to remedy the errors of 8    constitutional dimension. 9              In short, we believe that this application of10    the Custis rule would be totally proper here because it is11    a workable rule, and that the respondent's position, in12    contrast, is totally unworkable.  It would subject us to13    endless collateral reviews, and we would ask that the14    Third Circuit be reversed on that ground.15              While I have a few moments, I do want to16    approach my first issue and explain why this Court can and17    should address the main issue, even though we've raised18    what appears to be a jurisdictional defect.  When we19    looked at this case, following this Court's decision in20    Maleng, we expected to see the habeas corpus litigation21    follow a particular pattern, which was that the defendant22    would exhaust his state remedies and then he would bring a23    habeas petition, styled as an attack on the new24    conviction, complaining about the use of the old25    conviction.27                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          Well, what we saw instead was something that wasquite different.  The defendant here never raised thisissue in State court.  He brought his petition whilehis -- excuse me.          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Russel.          MR. RUSSEL:  Thank you.          QUESTION:  Mr. Wade, we'll hear from you.              ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES V. WADE                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT          MR. WADE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleasethe Court:          There are three reasons why this Court shouldpermit Federal habeas review of Mr. Coss' sentence.First, there's a constitutional interest in reliability atsentencing.  Second, Federal habeas corpus review isnecessary to protect that interest.  And third, the Stateinterests are adequately protected by the habeas corpusdoctrines of procedural default, exhaustion, and burden of10111213141516171819    proof.2021 22 23 24 25          QUESTION:  Would you give us some backgroundinformation?  Did your client file a direct appeal fromthe '86 conviction and sentence?          MR. WADE:  I did not see that in the record,Your Honor.  It appears that there's some evidence that heasked his counsel to --28                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  We assume, then, that no directappeal was filed?          MR. WADE:  That's correct, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  And the only relief from that '86sentence that was requested was the State post-convictionrelief petition that was filed?          MR. WADE:  That's correct, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  And that was filed while he was incustody under the '86 proceeding?          MR. WADE:  Yes, it was, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  And was an answer filed to that?          MR. WADE:  Yes, there was.          QUESTION:  And nothing else happened, is thatit?  He was released from custody?          MR. WADE:  That's correct, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  And no further action was taken?          MR. WADE:  No further action.          QUESTION:  And why is that, do we know?          MR. WADE:  We do not know from this record.  Wedon't know why.          QUESTION:  Is that typical in Pennsylvania, thatthese things languish for years at a time?          MR. WADE:  I wouldn't call it typical.  It doeshappen that various post-trial motions, motions to modifysentences do not --29                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Did the Pennsylvania courts losejurisdiction to consider the post-conviction reliefpetition once he was discharged from custody?          MR. WADE:  Yes, they did, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  That is the Pennsylvania law?          MR. WADE:  That is Pennsylvania law clearlyforecloses this.          QUESTION:  So this man had no -- it was final --          MR. WADE:  It was final.          QUESTION:  -- as a matter of Pennsylvania law atthe time of the 1990 charges?          MR. WADE:  Yes, it was.          Turning to my first point about theconstitutional interest and reliability of sentencing, Mr.Coss had the burden of proving that his prior convictionwas unreliable.  He did --          QUESTION:  Why -- does the Constitution of theUnited States stop a State from saying, for example, forthe future, not for the past, new law, if you commit anassault, and if you have a bad, violence-pronedisciplinary record in high school you're going to get alonger sentence?State -- MR. WADE:  There's nothing that would prevent a QUESTION:  All right.  Well, is there anything                   30                                       1    preventing a State from saying, if you are convicted of an 2    assault, and you have an arrest record, you're going to 3    get a longer sentence? 4              MR. WADE:  You can make such a law.  I think you 5    always have to have the availability to show that the 6    later sentence was not -- 7              QUESTION:  Well, there's -- the later -- sorry.8 I'm sorry. 9              MR. WADE:  Well, I didn't expect that the later10    sentence wasn't improperly enhanced by the --11              QUESTION:  No, I'm saying the lawyers, if you12    commit an assault in the future, and you are a person13    who's been arrested several times, you're going to get a14    higher sentence.15              MR. WADE:  They do that by State recidivist16    statutes, and those are constitutional.17              QUESTION:  Is that all right?18              MR. WADE:  That's okay.19              QUESTION:  Okay.  If that's all right, then20    what's wrong about saying, if you are going to commit an21    assault, and you are a person who has on his record some22    convictions, we no more care about whether those23    convictions were right or wrong, than we do about whether24    the arrest was right or wrong, than we do about whether25    the discipline in high school was right or wrong.31                                                                                                                                 1              We're just saying, if you are a person like 2    that, and you commit a crime in the future, you will get a 3    higher sentence.  Then, why could that be 4    unconstitutional, if the first are not? 5              MR. WADE:  Well, the reason it's 6    unconstitutional, where the first, I guess, would depart 7    from the statutory scheme, is that there has to be a place 8    to litigate the constitutional issue, and the -- 9              QUESTION:  Why does there have to be?  Are you10 saying --11              MR. WADE:  Well --12              QUESTION:  The constitutionality of that earlier13    offense is for purposes of your present crime totally14    irrelevant, says the state.15              MR. WADE:  Well --16              QUESTION:  All we're interested in is whether17    you are a person who has written down on a piece of paper18    somewhere three words, conviction, conviction, conviction,19    and if you're that kind of a person and you go out and20    commit another crime, you will get a higher sentence.  We21    don't care whether it was constitutional or not, any more22    than we care about whether the arrest was right or wrong,23    or the disciplinary --24              MR. WADE:  Well, the -- then I would say that25    statute's unconstitutional.32                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9          QUESTION:  Well then, is the other -- are theothers unconstitutional too?          MR. WADE:  Yes, if that's --          QUESTION:  Because?          MR. WADE:  Because there has to be a forum tolitigate the reliability principle.          QUESTION:  In other words, the Constitution ofthe United States requires a State to litigate theaccuracy of any fact upon which it bases a sentence?          MR. WADE:  The Constitution of the United Statesdoesn't want people sentenced on their subsequent cases onmisinformation of a constitutional magnitude, the Tucker10111213    principles.141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  Well, what if, following up JusticeBreyer's hypothetical, what if the State says that thisconviction has been set aside, but one of our guidelinessays, we can take into consideration prior acts, priorsimilar acts, and we now say that this convictionrepresented prior acts whether or not you were convicted?Is there anything wrong with that?          MR. WADE:  Well, I would say if it'smisinformation of a constitutional magnitude --          QUESTION:  Well, I'm not talking -- we're nottalking about constitutional magnitude.          MR. WADE:  Okay.33                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          QUESTION:  The State says, here, we have awitness, and the same witness who came forth at the trialsays, yes, he did slug this guy and slugged him fivetimes, and the defendant is allowed to contest that in thesentencing proceeding, but the judge says, well, I find asa fact that you did slug the guy, and so I'm taking thatinto consideration in sentencing.  Is there anything wrongwith that?          MR. WADE:  I don't think there's anything wrongwith that, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Now, here, as I understand it, thedefendant had an opportunity to appeal from the 1986conviction and sentence, and did not do so, as far as thisrecord discloses.          MR. WADE:  That's correct, Your Honor.          QUESTION:  Well, why isn't that the end of thematter, then?          MR. WADE:  Well, normally, ineffectivenessclaims, normally you'd have the same attorney on appeal,and you would normally bring ineffectiveness claims inpost-conviction proceedings.          We're basing our --          QUESTION:  You see what I was worried -- I'mworried about a new Jackson-Denno line of cases nowapplying to sentences.34                                                                                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          MR. WADE:  The -- we are suggesting that youcannot use invalid -- misinformation of a constitutionalmagnitude, inaccurate information, based on the cases ofTucker, Burke, Townsend v. Burke, Burgitt, in sentencingproceedings, because you don't want to sentence someonethat's not -- may not be really guilty of a prior --          QUESTION:  Those were all failure to appointcounsel cases, were they not?          MR. WADE:  They were, Your Honor, that'scorrect, but they also have been read to include a broaderprinciple of --          QUESTION:  Read by this Court?          MR. WADE:  Disputed, I think, by this Court.  Imean, there's some of this Court that would hold itstrictly to the Sixth Amendment.          QUESTION:  Well, I mean, majority opinions ofthe Court?          MR. WADE:  The majority opinions seem to holdit to the Sixth Amendment, I think.          But if we're going to have a due processprinciple, a fairness principle at sentencing, thatinterest has to come down to reliability throughfundamental fairness.  Mr. Coss proved that his attorneydid not interview witnesses at his 1986 case, did notsubpoena them to trial, and the Third Circuit found that35                                                                                             1    the result would have been different had he not -- had 2    those things been done, had he received effective 3    assistance of counsel. 4              The State's interest -- there's a lot of, you 5    know, worry about protecting the State's interest, and 6    that's a legitimate worry, but all this Court would have 7    to be doing would be balancing the State's interests and 8    the defendant's interest in reliability -- 9              QUESTION:  Coss has had a string of convictions,10 hasn't he?11              MR. WADE:  He has had a string of convictions,12    Your Honor, I mean, if you refer to his juvenile record13 forward.14              This is a limited right.  We're not asking for a15    broad principle.  It applies to constitutional claims and16    constitutional claims that go to reliability.  It may not17    necessary -- all constitutional claims will not fall18    within this rubric, and the issue of which claims do or19    which claims don't are not at issue here.  We're here on a20    Strickland claim, which is as close as you can get to a21    Gideon claim.22              Mr. Coss has tried to do everything he could23    possibly do to remedy the situation by filing a State24    post-conviction, and then he finds himself in the25    Pennsylvania legal system as being foreclosed from raising36                                                                                                                                 1    it at the next sentencing and on post-conviction.  He's 2    done everything he can do, and if he doesn't get the 3    Federal -- if he doesn't get to raise this issue in 4    Federal habeas corpus he gets to litigate it nowhere, and 5    I submit that his sentence for the 1990 conviction would 6    be improper.  It's on the basis of an improper valid 7    conviction. 8              QUESTION:  Well, if that's what's driving this, 9    I mean, you think the best remedy is to simply open up all10    of these convictions to subsequent Federal habeas corpus?11    Why not just -- if this is the horrible event that we're12    trying to avoid, why not just adopt a constitutional rule13    that it is not proper for a State to foreclose habeas14    corpus relief.15              You say that's the only practical way to16    challenge ineffective assistance.  It's just not17    constitutional for a State that forecloses habeas corpus18    relief to use it in subsequent sentence enhancement.  That19    would be a lot easier than --20              MR. WADE:  It may be easier, but I don't believe21    the Constitution requires the States to have a22    post-conviction process at all, so from that standpoint I23    don't see how we could --24              QUESTION:  Well, but you're saying that there's25    something unconstitutional about sentencing on the basis37                                                                                                                                 1    of a prior sentence that could not be challenged in State 2    habeas. 3              MR. WADE:  I'm -- yes, under the -- 4              QUESTION:  Okay.  So just say, the State 5    sentence is simply unconstitutional, you cannot use that 6    prior conviction when there's been no ability to challenge 7    it in habeas?  I'd much rather do that than muck up 8    Federal habeas corpus. 9              MR. WADE:  I see that we're not mucking up10    Federal habeas corpus, that the way that we're applying11    the same rules in Federal habeas corpus to sentence12    enhancement-type cases, and we're used to applying those13    rules, it is -- and those rules protect State interests,14    such as exhaustion, procedural default, and burden of15 proof.16              Much of the digging up of the record is going to17    be on the petitioner.18              QUESTION:  Yes, but it requires Federal courts19    to look into the matter.  The rule that I propose would20    require the States to do the job themselves.21              MR. WADE:  And --22              QUESTION:  It would be a much more efficient way23    to handle it, it seems to me.24              MR. WADE:  I think, Your Honor, that what will25    happen is that we are going to see a California claim in a38                                                                                                                                 1    Pennsylvania Federal court.  You're going to have the 2    problems of, that the State that's involved with the 3    process is not there, but I think that's -- the problem 4    with that is solved by limiting the remedy to the 5    sentence, so that for the purposes -- if we -- the 6    Pennsylvania Federal court declared a California 7    conviction unconstitutional because of a sentencing in 8    Pennsylvania, then it applies just to that sentencing.  It 9    cannot really --10              QUESTION:  The inquiry still is a very difficult11    inquiry for a Federal court in California to make.  It12    would be much more easy for a Pennsylvania court to make.13              MR. WADE:  The -- it may be difficult, but that14    difficulty will be on the petitioner.  He'll have to15    respond to that initially, when he files his habeas corpus16 petition.17              QUESTION:  What is the -- I'm asking because I'm18    interested in your view.  That is, a State prisoner goes19    into Federal habeas court and he says, one of the reasons20    I got a longer sentence was because somebody thought that21    I hit one of the bystanders, but I want to tell you,22    there's no evidence of that at all in the record, none,23    zero.  Can he get Federal habeas relief from that extra24    sentence?25MR. WADE:  Yes, I think he can get Federal                  39                                       1    habeas relief from that extra sentence, and I think2 Tucker -- 3              QUESTION:  Same principle as a conviction?  I've 4    never seen one.  I've never seen a case -- 5              MR. WADE:  Well, I don't know that if the Court 6    would have to make some kind of finding, like a -- in 7    Grayson, where they said, I heard you testify on the 8    witness stand and you testified falsely, I'm going to 9    enhance your sentence by 5 years because of that10    testimony.  I mean, in that type of situation then we11    would -- if we knew that it affected the sentence I think12    I could answer that, you know, the question the way I did,13 yes.14              In summary, we seek a limited and narrow rule.15    We seek a rule that will require the petitioner, or Mr.16    Coss, to exhaust his State claims, to meet his burden of17    proof, and when you have a case where he's met his burden18    of proof, has shown that his counsel was ineffective, and19    has shown that the subsequent sentence was enhanced or at20    least influenced by the prior improper conviction, that21    this Court should not base the sentence on that, they22    should not let a sentence be founded on an unreliable23    foundation, and that the judgment of the court of appeals24    should be affirmed.2540                                                                                                                                1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Wade.The case is submitted.          (Whereupon, at 12:00 noon, the case in theabove-entitled matter was submitted.)41
