Elaine Chao. Mr. Campbell.ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACK W. CAMPBELL, IV ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. CAMPBELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:In this case, it is undisputed that petitioner Buck Doe suffered an adverse effect, the emotional distress typical of a privacy invasion caused by the Department of Labor's intentional and willful violation of the Privacy Act. The only question is whether under these circumstances, petitioner is entitled to recover the Privacy Act's modest $1,000 statutory damages remedy.QUESTION: Before we go further, could you help me out on one thing? You spoke of the modest $1,000 recovery. The argument is made on the other side that, in fact, it would be $1,000 for every publication in this case, for example, for every caption of a - of - of an order that went out, to everyone to whom that order was sent, so that it would not be $1,000, it would be many, many thousands. Is that the proper construction of the statute?3, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425MR. CAMPBELL: The answer to that is no, Justice Souter, and let me answer that in at least two ways. First of all, the District of Columbia Circuit has already held that the number of - that the $1,000 is key to each individual and not to the number of disclosures. For example, in the Tomasello case in the D.C. Circuit, there was a simultaneous disclosure of information about a single individual to some 4,000 recipients. That court held-QUESTION: Okay.MR. CAMPBELL: - and I think correctly, that that would be considered one disclosure under the act and, thus, the individual would be entitled to only a single $1,000 recovery.QUESTION: What if - what if there had been an initial disclosure and he had protested it? He said, you're violating the statute when you do this and they did it again. Would that be a separate offense?MR. CAMPBELL: That's a closer question - it - because then you - you've got the - the temporal separation that did not exist in the Tomasello case.QUESTION: Yeah, but you'd have temporal separation if there were 10 pleadings over a period of 10 months.MR. CAMPBELL: But -4, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: And I take it in that case you're2 saying, no, there would still just be a - a - a one3 violation and - and the maximum recovery, at least under4 this provision, would be 1,000.5 MR. CAMPBELL: I - I - I think that's right,6 Justice Souter, and I want to make clear too that for each7 of those disclosures you're describing, there would have8 to be an adverse effect described and - and a causation9 element met in each of those in any case before you even10 got to the question.11 QUESTION: But suppose the IRS -12 QUESTION: But that's so easy to establish, as13 shown here. I mean, it bothers me that somebody else14 knows my Social Security number. You don't think that's a15 realistic reason for not assuming application of the16 statute, do you?17 MR. CAMPBELL: I - if I understand your question,18 Justice O'Connor, the answer is, yes, there is a real harm19 suffered here, and adverse effect is not a meaningless20 standard. And in this case, you don't just have a21 situation in which Buck Doe - it's obviously a pseudonym -22 just alleges, I was harmed. This is a case in which he23 submitted an affidavit, and more importantly, testified in24 open court as to the severity and veracity of his25 emotional -5, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: Well, but wouldn't -2 MR. CAMPBELL: - and was cross-examined.3 QUESTION: - wouldn't every person who wanted to4 make such a claim make similar allegations? Is a class5 action a reasonable possibility in a case like this?6 MR. CAMPBELL: Let me answer both parts of your7 question. As to the first part, I - I don't think we can8 presume that plaintiffs are going to make up an adverse9 effect. They are certainly under the obligations to10 testify truthfully, and in this case, the Government had11 every opportunity that - to - and did cross-examine Mr.12 Doe as to the veracity of his adverse effect. The13 magistrate found as a matter of fact he did suffer an14 adverse effect, the district court adopted it and the15 Government never appealed that finding, so whatever16 arguments they have at this point are gone.17 Second part of your question, class actions.18 That's certainly the parade of horribles that the19 Government is trotting out here, and I think perhaps,20 Justice Souter, may go more - more directly to your21 question as well. The answer is no. Even if an22 individual who has suffered an adverse effect caused by an23 intentional or willful violation of the act is entitled to24 a statutory damages award without being required to25 quantify actual damages.6, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 There are still at least two individualized2 issues that will exist in every case. One is the pleading3 and proof of the adverse effect, which necessarily may4 vary among different plaintiffs. Second is the causation,5 and particularly in the causation question, Justice6 O'Connor, this is not a - a standard that - that7 plaintiffs lightly leap over.8 In fact, there are a number of cases, one of9 which is the Oroquoia decision of the First Circuit, which10 was handed down while this petition was pending, noted11 that in cases where the - the adverse effect alleged is a12 - an emotional distress-type problem, you may well run13 into causation problems. There could be any number of14 other stressors in this person's life.15 QUESTION: Let's assume that somebody wrongfully16 and intentionally releases Social Security numbers, you17 know, just - just a whole bunch of Social Security numbers18 of their - their entire list. They sell their - their19 list to somebody. Why wouldn't that be a perfectly valid20 class action? Every one of them has had the adverse21 effect of having his Social Security number out there, and22 every one of them has this same adverse effect, which is23 the, I don't know, the trauma of knowing that - that your24 - your Social Security number is floating out there where25 anybody can use it. Why wouldn't that be a perfectly good7, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 class action?2 MR. CAMPBELL: Well, I - I think that the example3 you give, the problem remains, particularly one of4 causation. Some folks may not have an adverse effect,5 they may not be concerned, I think, particularly if you're6 describing a case in which it's only the number that's7 released but the number's not linked to a name. I think8 in those cases you might have difficulty.9 QUESTION: Those numbers are - are linked to10 names.11 MR. CAMPBELL: I'd still go back to the - there's12 a causation problem. If - if you're going to talk - that13 is an individualized issue. Now, I -14 QUESTION: May I ask, with respect to that, you15 brought this case. I mean, you tried to get it certified16 as a class action and you were unsuccessful. So I - I17 hear you telling this Court, we were way off-base in18 attempting to bring this as a class action because the19 adverse effect is different for each person. So you're20 giving up on your first loss. I mean, there are other21 circuits that might say, yeah, why not class action?22 MR. CAMPBELL: I don't - I don't - I don't23 contend that there aren't arguments to be made. What I am24 stating here is that there are some very strong -25 QUESTION: But you say you lost fair and square,8, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 and now you've seen the error of your ways?2 MR. CAMPBELL: Well, we lost fair and square and3 I - and I want to point out too, I want to give another4 example of a case, and it's one of the cases that the5 Government cites in its brief as the example of - of this6 - this problem, and that's the Schmidt case that is7 pending in the Western District of Wisconsin, which8 involves a putative class action against the Veterans9 Administration. In that case, the Western District of10 Wisconsin held, and this has been since cert was granted11 in this case, held that, if you prove an adverse effect12 caused by an intentional, willful violation of the act,13 you are entitled to statutory damages of $1,000.14 Nonetheless, that district court refused to certify a15 class on precisely the grounds that I am describing to you16 today.1718 action in 1920 I have, I21 In Massachusetts, we put our Social Security number on our22 driver's license. I have it right in my pocket. I show23 it 10 million times a day, or however many. So suppose24 that, you know, the IRS releases - California wants to do25 the same thing. They have 35 million drivers, and the IRS9, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼So is it conceivable there could be a classa case? Yes, it's conceivable, and I do - QUESTION: But even if they're not class actions, think, the same problem people have expressed.1 sends them a list so they can check it out, or the Social2 Security Administration does that and, my God, there's 353 million lawsuits, $1,000 each, that's only 35 billion.4 Suppose they do it nationwide. There's 200 billion, and5 that's only Social Security numbers. All you have to do6 is read through these 14 pages of fine print of the7 requirements of the Privacy Act, certain days have to be8 met, certain deadlines, and it's very easy to imagine9 bankruptcy in the Federal Treasury.10 All right. So, I mean, you know, trillions,11 it's easy to see that. I can make up hypotheticals, which12 I'll spare you, but you see where I'm going, because what13 I want is that is the horrible. And when I read the14 horrible, I think, my God, they're right. All right.15 Now, you tell me why they're not.16 MR. CAMPBELL: In the hypothetical that you're17 proposing, Justice Breyer, I think there are several18 answers.19 QUESTION: And just make up, you know, it's easy20 forbothofustomakeupalot.21 MR. CAMPBELL: Sure.22 QUESTION: I want to know what are the23 protections if you win against generating millions and24 millions of lawsuits with billions of dollars.25 MR. CAMPBELL: In - in the hypotheticals that10, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 you've described, if I could take those on their terms2 first. It's very likely that one of the exceptions to the3 Privacy Act disclosure is going to apply usual - if it's4 the case that - that this is a working relationship5 between the Federal Government and various state6 governments and the like, that may well fall within the7 usual use.8 There are a number of these exceptions listed,9 so certainly you have to look to those first. Have to go10 - go back to - this would have to be intentionally11 wrongful conduct by the Government -12 QUESTION: Well, yeah, I can't imagine any13 government agency that takes place that isn't intentional.14 You always have people intending to do what they do in the15 Government.16 MR. CAMPBELL: Well -17 QUESTION: Nobody released these - nobody -18 nobody puts anything on a piece of paper, releases it,19 isn't intentional.￼2021 release22 not the23 Privacy2425 recoverMR. CAMPBELL: Certainly the - the intent tothe - the information would be correct, but that's same as to say there was an intent to violate the Act.QUESTION: Ah, in other words, in order to- now, that's an important point to me - in order11, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 to recover, the plaintiff has to show that the government2 individuals or the agency not only intended to do what did3 violate the act, but they intended that what they did4 would violate the Act. They knew about the - that's5 willful,6 and they7 89 one? 1011 strong - 121314 of the law is - is no defense, and there are all sorts of15 statutes that use the word willful, which simply means16 that you intended to do the act that you did, not that you17 knew it violated the law.18 MR. CAMPBELL: Well, in - in this case - I - the19 consistent constructions of - of the Privacy Act is it's -20 it's greater than gross negligence. It - it necessarily21 encompasses more than just I intended to do something.22 It's that I - I willfully blind to my obligations in the -2324 QUESTION: Well, how about this case? How - how25 was that shown in this case?12, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005it's like they knew about the legal obligation intentionally violated it.MR. CAMPBELL: That's correct, Justice - QUESTION: Well, then, how did you ever win thisQUESTION: That's - that's - that's a veryQUESTION: Yeah, very strong.QUESTION: - instruction. Ordinary - ignorance￼1 MR. CAMPBELL: In pages - if I could point the2 Court to pages - bear with me for one moment - pages 90 -3 96-4 QUESTION: This was a - this was a distribution5 by administrative law judges -6789 answer isMR. CAMPBELL: That's correct.QUESTION: - of hearing notices and decisions? MR. CAMPBELL: That - among other things. The yes, Justice O'Connor. On pages 96A to 97A of10 the petitioner's appendix, there is the description of the11 magistrate judge's finding that there was a willful12 violation13 there was14 the act's15of the Privacy Act here and that there was a - no attempt even - no even attempt to comply with requirements, and I - I would point -QUESTION: But to say there's no intent to comply same thing as saying that you knew you werethe act when you acted.MR. CAMPBELL: Well, let me amend my answer in Mr. Chief Justice. A willful ignorance - a￼16 isn't the17 violating1819 this way,20 willful ignoring of the act's requirements would qualify21 asawillful-andI-Iwantto-22 QUESTION: Well, how can you - how can you23 willfully ignore an act's requirements?24 MR. CAMPBELL: Well, the Department of Labor was25 well aware of what the Privacy Act's requirements were and13, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 made no attempt to get the administrative law judges to2 comply,and-andIwanttogobackherethis-tooneof3 the answers I gave with respect to your adverse effect4 questions. This issue was decided by the magistrate5 judge, adopted by the district court, and this was never6 appealed by the Federal Government.7 QUESTION: Well, but our concern -8 QUESTION: We're concerned here, Justice Breyer9 and I guess - what is going to happen if we rule in your10 favor? That will probably not result in any benefit for11 the Government on this ground, but are we just opening a12 can of worms or is - by ruling in your favor?13 MR. CAMPBELL: The answer is no, and - and14 certainly I acknowledge, Mr. Chief Justice, and Justice15 Souter and Justice Breyer, that in future cases there16 might well be a lot more time spent litigating the issues17 of whether there was an adverse - truly an adverse effect18 and whether - and - and whether the - the violation was19 truly intentional and willful. But I want to -20 QUESTION: Okay, but can - can we just go back to21 that for a second?22 MR. CAMPBELL: Sure.23 QUESTION: Because we've been concentrating on24 willful, and you say, well, willful requires a very high25 standard. As - as you just indicated in your answers, the14, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 statute doesn't require willful. It requires intentional2 or willful.3 MR. CAMPBELL: Or willful.4 QUESTION: And it would be even more remarkable5 to construe the - the term intentional as requiring6 conscious 78 response,9 For 22 years, the interpretation of the Privacy Act thatdisregard of - of a known statutory obligation. MR. CAMPBELL: Let - let me answer this way in and maybe it will - will help ease the concerns.10 petitioner offers today has been the law of the land, and11 in that -12 QUESTION: Do you have a case that says13 intentional standing alone must be construed to include14 this conscious disregard of a - of a known legal15 provision?16 MR. CAMPBELL: I can't cite a specific case for17 that proposition, Justice Souter, but I again go back to18 we were talking about intentional or willful, it's a high19 burden under any concept of what intentional or willful20 will be, and for years, for 22 years, from 1975 to, at the21 earliest 1997, when the Sixth Circuit decided the Reno22 case, the interpretation that I am offering this Court is23 the one that the courts of appeals had unanimously24 adopted, and never in those 22 years had the kind of25 parade of horribles that the Government posits in this15, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425case materialize.Indeed, if anything, if you look - there is a -a reporter that lists every single case decided under the Privacy Act since 1975.QUESTION: But have any of those cases involved disclosure of Social Security numbers?MR. CAMPBELL: None that I recall. That seems to be a relatively new -QUESTION: See, this seems to me a particular kind of disclosure that might happen over and over again in a very casual way.MR. CAMPBELL: I - I submit, Justice Stevens, if it happens in a casual way, that's not going to provide anyone with a cause of action.QUESTION: Well, pursuant to a policy such as they had here of that's the way they use to identify - driver's license they use it on, the Holiday Inn uses it for their social - all sorts of people use Social Security number for another purpose.MR. CAMPBELL: That's true. It's certainly true that Social Security numbers are used for other purposes. But what is clear from this statute is that Congress was specifically focused on concerns about Social Security numbers being disclosed and the adverse effects that can result from that.16, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 QUESTION: That - that may be true. What's2 bothering me, which may be the same thing, as Justice3 Stevens says, is that I might have thought that a Labor4 Department official could reasonably think, I have a list5 of 50,000 people here, several are named John Smith, I6 want to be sure we get the right ones so I'll put the7 Social Security number as identifier. That doesn't on its8 - on its face seem like such an unreasonable thing to9 think, even if it's wrong.10 And-andyetwe have here a finding that not11 only is it wrong, but that it's intentional and willful,12 and that's what brings up the problem you come to argue,13 and I don't know how to deal with it, because I think,14 well, if this statute, intentional, willful really means15 the tough thing that you say, well, then it'll work, then16 you're right, there won't be a horrible. But then I see17 this case, which seems to me to stand for the proposition18 that that tough standard isn't being applied. And then I19 think, my goodness, you're opening the door to the20 horribles and - and I don't know how to do it because the21 other part isn't being argued. That's my honest dilemma.22 Iputittoyou.23 MR. CAMPBELL: I - I - I under - I well24 understand your dilemma, Justice Breyer, and I again go25 back to, I don't doubt if this - if the statute is given17, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 its natural reading, that the $1,000 statutory damages is2 available to those to whom the United States shall be3 liable, there will be an awful lot more traction, a lot4 more fighting over the adverse effect and the particular5 circumstances that would rise to the level of an6 intentional or willful violation in the future.7 QUESTION: Mr. Campbell -8 MR. CAMPBELL: That's simply not an issue here.9 QUESTION: Really what - what Justice Breyer is10 saying is - is that this issue of willfulness or not is11 not in the case and we wish it were, because the answer to12 that is important. Could we talk a little bit about what13 is in the case?14 MR. CAMPBELL: Yes, yes, Justice Scalia, thank15 you.16 QUESTION: Can - can you tell me what - I - I17 really have trouble understanding how there can be an18 adverse effect without actual damage. That's a very19 strange line. I mean, in - in the Administrative20 Procedure Act, you talk about any person adversely21 affected or aggrieved, and that's a person who suffered22 damage. It seems very strange for Congress to use23 language that - that sets up two different categories,24 adverse effect on the one hand, and actual damage on the25 other. When - when is there an adverse effect without18, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425actual damage?MR. CAMPBELL: I think there frequently can be an- an emotional harm that is not quantifiable in dollar terms -QUESTION: Well -MR. CAMPBELL: - and that's very common in thelaw.QUESTION: That doesn't mean that it's not actual. It just means that it's hard to quantify, but you've had the emotional harm. Why isn't that an - why isn't that actual - actual harm?MR. CAMPBELL: I - I want - I - I agree with you that that is an actual harm, and I think that's one of the things that the Government is - is trying to cloud the issue a bit in this case, and that is to equate actual damages and actual harm. I submit they are different, that the - in - in interpreting the statute, the deliberate use of a term adverse effect and the deliberate use of a term actual damages, those must be given different meanings.QUESTION: Well, do you agree that, or do you contend that adverse effect include - includes emotional distress and that you have to show something like emotional distress before there is an adverse effect?MR. CAMPBELL: Yes, yes indeed, Justice Kennedy,19, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 and that is indeed the unanimous position of the Federal2 courts on that question.3 QUESTION: What - what do you say about the4 position of the - which I understood the circuit to be5 taking that, on the assumption that there - there was some6 emotional damage, at least in the sense that the - the man7 said, I was very upset when I heard that the number was8 out. Assuming that, I thought the Fourth Circuit was9 saying, there is a category of harm that is generally non­10 compensable in the law, and we assume it ought to be non­11 compensable here, and that category is emotional damage,12 which has no physical manifestation. And the general13 policy behind that is, we don't allow generally, tort law14 doesn't allow recovery there because it's too easy to15 fake.16 And the Fourth Circuit, I thought, was saying,17 you know, whether you're talking about damage or whether18 you're talking about effect, this is an effect that the19 law simply doesn't generally recognize and it shouldn't be20 recognized here. That's a different issue from whether it21 can be quantified or not. What the circuit was saying is,22 you don't even get to the point of proving quantification.23 What - what is your response to that?24 MR. CAMPBELL: If that is indeed what the Fourth25 Circuit's position is, it's squarely wrong. At common law20, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 and intentional torts generally, and in privacy torts2 specifically, this type of harm is compensable in some at3 least minimal way, even if it cannot be quantified, and I4 think that's why -5 QUESTION: What about - even if there is no6 physical manifestation?7 MR. CAMPBELL: Even if there is no physical8 manifestation. Indeed, I submit, Justice Souter, it's -9 there's nothing surprising about the overall remedial10 scheme here, because it does track what happened at common11 law and intentional torts and with respect to intentional12 privacy torts. In fact, the Privacy Act is more strict13 even than what was required at common law. At common law,14 evennodamageatall,no-I'msorry-Idon't-Idon't15 want to get back into the confusion over the terms. Even16 if there was no harm at all, there would be still be some17 at least minimal award, recognizing the invasion.18 QUESTION: Sure, because privacy -19 MR. CAMPBELL: Here you have to put -20 QUESTION: - I mean, in your - I understand your21 privacy argument, but that's because the invasion of22 privacy or the infringement of privacy is regarded simply23 as - as injury per se, and - and I thought the circuit was24 saying, that's not what we're dealing with here. But25 you're saying, what, privacy is privacy and - and -21, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. CAMPBELL: Well, I - I want to -2 QUESTION: But it's - but if that is so, then let3 me just get to my question. If that is so, why did the4 statute go into speaking of actual damage at all? Why5 didn't the statute simply say, if they invade the privacy6 by publishing something they shouldn't publish, you get at7 least $1,000 regardless. But that's not what it said.8 It's keyed it to actual damage, and it said, if there's9 actual damage, the person entitled to recovery for actual10 damage gets at least 1,000, which is something quite11 different. It does not take the position that it's a per12 se compensable harm.1314 with your15 says, but16 are talking about an adverse effect, so we are talking17 about having to prove a harm. We're not just talking18 about the ability to vindicate a privacy interest in the19 abstract. You can certainly do that at common law, and20 Congress could have written a statute that allowed you to21 do that under the Privacy Act. It didn't. It did at22 least require that you demonstrate an adverse effect and23 real harm.24 QUESTION: And what - can - can you - and this25 goes back to Justice Scalia's initial question, what is22, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005MR. CAMPBELL: Well, I - I, of course, disagree characterization of what subsection (A) in fact let me go back to first part of the answer. We￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425the difference in adverse effect and actual damage?MR. CAMPBELL: The difference is the ability toquantify the harm in some dollar amount.QUESTION: Yes, but if that's - if that's thecase, I don't see why the risk of being subjected to identity theft would be increased by the disclosure of your Social Security number, and if that's true, and I think some people could prove the risk is increased, that would be true of every release of every Social Security number.MR. CAMPBELL: I - I - I would certainly agree that there is a real risk of identity theft any time there's a disclosure of a Social Security number, particularly as here when it's linked directly with the name.QUESTION: So does it not necessarily follow that every one of those releases causes an adverse effect?MR. CAMPBELL: I don't think it is. There could be - there could be people who aren't bothered by that or who don't share that fear.QUESTION: Whether they're bothered about it or not, they're - they have an increased risk, just if you increase your risk of death, maybe they're not aware of it, but it's still an adverse effect.MR. CAMPBELL: Well, I do not contend that the23, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 Privacy Act is a statute that - that compensates in some2 way for merely increased risk. I think that does go back3 to the adverse effect here. You do have to have some sort4 of harm that actualizes, and here it did actualize in his5 real emotional distress about the disclosure.6 QUESTION: Well, I mean, that doesn't answer it.7 The harm does actualize, as you say it, once the Social8 Security number is released, the harm actualizes. You're9 at greater risk than you were before. That's - that's10 actual as can be.11 MR. CAMPBELL: I can't support that12 interpretation of the act, although candidly, it - it13 probably would be a better one for plaintiffs in the - in14 the run-of-the-mine case. And the reason is this: If the15 - if the disclosure itself is the adverse effect, what16 happens is that the causation language in subsection17 (g)(1)(D) becomes superfluous, and I am being careful to18 the - the text here -19 QUESTION: Well, it's superfluous with respect to20 Social Security numbers, but the statute covers a whole21 range of activities other than this particular case.22 MR. CAMPBELL: Absolutely, Justice Stevens, and I23 -I-butI'mnotsure-I-Idon'tthinktheansweris24 that it would be just superfluous with respect to Social25 Security numbers. In every case, if the release of any24, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425information, let's say it's a medical record, not a Social Security number. If the release itself is the adverse effect, the problem is that does not - that does not hew to the - the causation language contained in subsection (g)(1)(D).QUESTION: Well, the release of medical information doesn't necessarily increase the risk of any particular harm. But this particular information does increase the risk of an identity theft for everybody.MR. CAMPBELL: It does increase that - it does increase the risk -QUESTION: It is not true if you say, well, you're taking aspirin three times a day or something like that. So what? But this is not a so-what situation.MR. CAMPBELL: No, it's a - I agree, Justice Stevens. It does increase the risk, but - but for some people, that increased risk may not cause them an adverse effect, the personal adverse effect.I would like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal, if I may.QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Campbell.Mr. Stewart, we'll hear from you. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWARTON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTMR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it25, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 please the Court:23 as we see4 damages.5 indicate,6 originated in the Privacy Act. It's - it's a term of art.7 The general judicial review provision of the8 Administrative Procedure Act grants a right of action to9 persons adversely affected or aggrieved, and I don't thinkI'd like to begin by discussing the distinction it between the terms adverse effect and actual And as one of Justice Scalia's questionsthe term adverse effect is not one that10 it's the case that a plaintiff under the APA needs to show11 that he has suffered the type of harm that would12 ordinarily be compensable in damages.13 Because the APA excludes money damages as an14 available item of relief, the typical inquiry in - under15 the APA in determining whether a plaintiff has standing is16 whether he is likely to suffer harm in the future, not17 whether he has been harmed in the past. And if we had a18 hypothetical APA suit, for instance, challenging an19 ongoing or imminent program by which the Government20 intended to release Social Security numbers, and a21 particular plaintiff could show there is a likelihood that22 my own Social Security number will be released in the near23 future, I think that would be sufficient in and of itself24 to establish that that person was adversely affected or25 aggrieved within the meaning of the act.26, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 He would be suffering a - a violation of his2 legal right to have information about him maintained3 within the Government's files and he would also suffer at4 least an increased risk of identity theft. That would be5 enough to get him into the - into court to seek6 prospective, injunctive, or declaratory relief. But those7 certainly wouldn't be the types of harms that would8 ordinarily be compensable in damages.9 QUESTION: Well, but that - but that's not the10 question. It - it - the point is it's - it's not only11 enough to get him into court, which is what it is said12 adverse effect does here, it is enough under the APA to13 give him judgment. He wins.141516 his claim 171819 damages has nothing to do with the magic words, adversely20 affected. It has to do with simply the fact that money21 damages are not available under the APA.MR. STEWART: He wins -￼22232425 win underMR. STEWART: But -QUESTION: But he wins under the APA.MR. STEWART: But the fact that a plaintiff can the APA and, in our view, can't win under the27QUESTION: It - it is enough to give - to make a valid - a valid claim.MR. STEWART: He - he wins but -QUESTION: And the reason he can't get money, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 damages provision of the Privacy Act simply reflects what2 is implicit in the APA's exclusion of money damages as an3 available item of relief, namely the view that agency4 action should ordinarily be reviewable in court, and5 plaintiffs who can show that they would be injured by6 unlawful government conduct in the future should7 ordinarily be able to get a judicial order decreeing that8 that not take place. But plaintiffs are not ordinarily9 entitled to receive money damages from the Government for10 wrongs committed against them.11 QUESTION: And I take it you're - you're saying12 here - and they're not here because there's a further13 requirement of actual damage before they get money.14 MR. STEWART: That - that's right.15 QUESTION: Yeah.16 MR. STEWART: That the damages provisions17 restricts the availability of monetary relief to a person18 entitled to recovery, and the phrase, person entitled to19 recovery, is most naturally construed to mean someone who20 has not only established a violation of law, but who has21 established the prerequisites to an award of compensatory22 relief.23 QUESTION: Why - why did24 entitled to recovery, in there in25 damages? I'll be candid with you28, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼they put that phrase, addition to actual that I - I was thinking1 that maybe they put it in there because they anticipated2 this - this category of cases like emotional damage3 without physical manifestations is non-compensable, and4 that - and that they were trying to leave open that kind5 of a condition.6 MR. STEWART: One - one hypothesis as to why the7 phrase may appear as it does. The phrase originated in8 the Senate version of the legislation, and the Senate9 version said that a plaintiff who establishes a will - an10 intentional or willful violation can collect actual or11 general damages, but a person entitled to recovery shall12 receive no less than $1,000. And so, in the context of13 that provision, the phrase, person entitled to recovery,14 could be a shorthand for person entitled to recover either15 actual or general damages.16 QUESTION: Well, he is entitled to recover actual17 damages if he has any.18 QUESTION: Yeah.19 MR. STEWART: But that -20 QUESTION: And he's entitled to recover it if he21 doesn't have any. He's entitled to recover it, whether he22 has some or whether he doesn't have some. So I will - I23 don't understand, you say the most natural meaning of a24 person entitled to recovery is a person entitled to25 recovery who actually has actual damages. That isn't how29, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 I'd normally read it. I'd - I'd read it somebody who's -2 who's entitled to get it if he has it.3 QUESTION: Well, I guess that's the issue.4 QUESTION: Yeah, that is the issue. So I just5 want you to explain a little bit more -6 (Laughter.)7 MR. STEWART: I mean, I think - I think -8 QUESTION: - about why that's the most natural9 reading.10 MR. STEWART: I mean, the more - I think the more11 natural reading is that a person entitled to recovery is12 someone who not only has established some of the13 prerequisites to an actual recovery, namely a compensatory14 award, but who has established all of them. And if the15 only compensatory relief available is actual damages, then16 a person who hasn't established actual damages is not17 entitled to recovery.18 But even if a plausible argument could be made19 the other way, then the canon of construction that waivers20 of sovereign immunity are to be construed narrowly would21 compel the Court to read it in - in the narrow way.22 QUESTION: Well, plus - plus the canon that -23 that you don't give words a meaning that renders them24 totally superfluous.25 MR. STEWART: That - that's -30, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: And if it means what Justice Breyer suggests, you can just leave out the words, a person entitled to recovery.MR. STEWART: Or - or -QUESTION: Just read it, but in no case shall he receive less than the sum of 10,000, of $1,000.MR. STEWART: That's correct. If - if Congress had intended that any plaintiff who established an adverse effect from a willful or intentional violation would automatically receive at least $1,000, it could have used the word person or individual or complainant, which was -which were the words that Congress used elsewhere in the Privacy Act to describe the individual whose rights had arguably been violated.QUESTION: Or just - just drop entitled to recovery.MR. STEWART: Exactly.QUESTION: Shall a person receive less than thesumof-MR. STEWART: And the other point I would - we would make in following up on one of Justice -QUESTION: Mr. Stewart, if - and before going to the words of the statute, this - there are any number of statutes that have actual damages and it can say, or the statutory damages, and some of them have this formula,31, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 actual damages and person entitled to recover, and then2 there's shades in between. Do you - do you really think3 that Congress, by using those different formulas, meant a4 different5 - are not67 to infer that Congress or presume that Congress meant8 something by the choice of words that it used. And the9 phrase entitled to recovery is -result in what would seem to be cases that don't sensibly distinguished?MR. STEWART: I mean, I think - I think we have10 QUESTION: A benign fiction, right?11 MR. STEWART: A benign fiction, that's right.12 And I think it is also the case that the phrase, person13 entitled to recovery, is used very rarely in the United14 States Code. There are a number of provisions along the15 lines of actual damages or $1,000, whichever is greater,16 references to statutory damages or liquidated damages.17 But the phrase, person entitled to recovery, is very rare18 and we would presume that Congress intended something19 specific -20 QUESTION: All right. I - I would - rather than21 do the presumption of what they intended deduced from22 canons, et cetera. You assume that it is ambiguous. You23 certainly got me there. I'm - I see it's ambiguous. And24 I also believe that Congress did not want to bankrupt the25 Treasury, destroying Medicare, Social Security, and every32, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 other programs we give $1 trillion in damages to people2 who have the social - I - I - you've got me there.3 Now, how do - what they - what your opponents4 say is that is a made-up problem. It doesn't - it isn't5 going to happen, and the reason it isn't going to happen6 is because these words, intentional or willful, are not7 used, the word intentional, as it normally is. It's used8 in a very special way so that they have to almost - well,9 you've - now, you've - I'm cross-referencing our earlier10 argument and I'm at a dilemma here because it's not11 argued, I don't know how to deal with it, but it seems12 relevant to the underlying question that is moving me13 about what Congress intended.14 MR. STEWART: The petitioner is correct that the15 phrase intentional or willful has been construed by the16 lower courts essentially as a term of art, and the17 prevailing test in the lower courts is whether the agency18 exhibited flagrant disregard for -19 QUESTION: Oh, I'm sorry. The lower court thing20 that we've looked up uses an or about that, and one of the21 parts of the or is without grounds for believing the22 action to be lawful, which means that part of the test,23 that if we have an ALJ, or we have people in the agency,24 just never think about it, as they might not in this case,25 that that cover - is covered by intentional or lawful.33, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425And that's one of the problems I'm having, because it makes me think that that word intentional is a pretty complicated issue, which isn't argued. It seems to be very important, and I don't know what to do.MR. STEWART: I - I think, with respect to the - the language from the court of appeals' opinion that youquoted, the without grounds to believe that -QUESTION: I have three of them like that.MR. STEWART: Right. I - I think what the courtsare getting at is something at least akin to the standard that would prevail in a Bivens action, where an individual Federal officer was sued, where the question would be, could a reasonable officer in this person's position have believed that what he was doing was legal? Probably the courts have applied it in a - in a manner that's slightly more deferential to the Government.In - in - it doesn't mean, however, that the Government has to have been shown either to have intentionally violated the law or to have intentionally sought to bring about harm to the plaintiff.QUESTION: Do we have to decide that in thiscase?MR. STEWART: No, no, I don't think you need to decide that.QUESTION: I'd like a lot more argument on it34, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425before I decide that question.MR. STEWART: That - that's correct.QUESTION: Why -QUESTION: And some briefing on it.MR. STEWART: As the case comes to this Court,both parties are in agreement, or neither party contests the proposition that an intentional or willful violation was established.QUESTION: Mr. Stewart, what has happened in the 28-some years that this has been in effect concerning the amount of recoveries against the Government?MR. STEWART: I - I would candidly acknowledge we have not had a problem with enormous recoveries against the Government up to this point.QUESTION: What happened in the 1990 lawsuit you refer to on mailing of IRS farm - form 1040s, that had a Social Security number and the name.MR. STEWART: That - that was -QUESTION: What happened to that case?MR. STEWART: That was ultimately dismissed onthe ground that the Social Security numbers were not records, which is contrary to the general course of the law, which is that Social Security numbers would be - be records. I - I want to be careful about this because we are not arguing that exorbitant liability would inevitably35, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 follow from a loss in this case. What we are saying is,2 if we lose this issue and if the word adverse effect is3 given the same meaning in the Privacy Act that it has in4 the APA, the Government would be subject to enormous5 potential liability.6 To take an example, following up on one of7 Justice Breyer's questions, as - as you pointed out, the8 Privacy Act is not limited to a prohibition on unlawful9 disclosures. It contains a range of other provisions that10 could be best be described as technical or even11 bureaucratic. One, for instance, is that when the12 Government collects information from private individuals,13 it has to identify, among other things, the source of14 authority, either a U.S. Code provision or an executive15 order that authorizes the information to be collected.16 And if an agency circulated 100,000 forms and17 left off the U.S. Code cite, I think, under ordinary APA18 standards, any person who returned information on that19 form would be - would suffer an adverse effect, because he20 would have been deprived of -21 QUESTION: Yeah, but that won't hurt you if - if,22 in fact, to show liability here, you have to show that the23 agency officials who made up that form knew - let's make24 it really tough - knew that leaving it off was command -25 putting it on was commanded by the act and they say, ha ha36, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 ha, I know it's commanded by the act, but I'm not going to2 doit.3 MR. STEWART: I mean -4 QUESTION: Now, that'll be pretty rare and the -5 MR. STEWART: It would be rare.6 QUESTION: So the -7 MR. STEWART: Well, you could - you could imagine8 a situation, and we wouldn't condone this - this conduct,9 but you can imagine a situation in which an agency10 official gets back the 100,000 forms from the printer and11 says, oh my gosh, the U.S. Code cite was left off, but12 then decides, I know we're supposed to do this, but I'm13 not going to reprint 100,000 forms for something like14 that, let's circulate them. We don't condone that15 behavior. It would be a violation of law, but it's hard16 to imagine that Congress would have intended that17 everybody who fills out information on those forms would18 then be entitled to $1,000.19 QUESTION: Just to try to get this issue out of20 the case, are you content to have us decide this case on -21 on the assumption, just for the sake of argument but22 without ruling, that - that the act requires willfulness23 in the - in the most extreme sense that Justice Breyer24 describes? Are you willing to have us decide the case on25 that assumption?37, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 MR. STEWART: Yes.2 QUESTION: You're willing to have us decide what3 was not - what it was over, that there is an adverse4 effect? In fact, the - the Government didn't dispute5 that, didn't dispute adverse effect, did it?6 MR. STEWART: Not - not as to Buck Doe. The -7 the magistrate judge held that each of the plaintiffs had8 established an adverse effect simply by release of the9 Social Security numbers, and the district court didn't10 expressly endorse that view, but didn't reject it either.11 QUESTION: Is it your - is it your argument - and12 I'm glad we're back to the statute - that in order to13 determine in this case, in this case, whether there was a14 cause of action, you had to read beyond the adverse effect15 clause and go down to for - or before - and decide also16 whether there was actual damages, before there was a cause17 of action?18 MR. STEWART: You - you wouldn't have to decide19 whether there was proof of actual damages, but yes, I20 think if it was apparent on the complaint that there was21 an adverse effect but no possibility of proving actual22 damages, then the suit shouldn't be - shouldn't go23 forward, but -24 QUESTION: That - that's an - that's an unusual25 way to write the statute. It's unusual to - to write the38, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 statute in a way where I don't know if I have a cause of2 action until I get down to where the damages are defined.3 MR. STEWART: I - I agree, but I think it would4 be-5 QUESTION: Usually I would say that any person6 injured is the way we would expect this statute to have7 been written.8 MR. STEWART: I agree, and it may be that to -9 Congress anticipated that questions concerning damages10 would be resolved at the end of the day, and there would11 obviously be a lot of cases in which a plaintiff would12 allege damages at the outset, and therefore, would have a13 cause of action, but if he failed to prove damages in the14 - the course of the trial, he wouldn't be entitled to the15 $1,000, even if he proved that he suffered an adverse16 effect from a willful or intentional violation.17 QUESTION: But Mr. Stewart, I - I take it that18 even - even if there was no indication of actual damage,19 the - by - by pleading the violation of the statute, he20 would at least have pleaded enough to entitle him to - to21 ask for a - to ask for equitable relief.22 MR. STEWART: We would say that equitable relief23 is not, in this context, is not specifically authorized by24 the Privacy Act. But we would say that equitable relief25 would be available under the APA, and the allegation would39, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

STEWART: - agency's action was not in accordance with law -Act.QUESTION: I - I see.MR. STEWART: - because it violated the PrivacyQUESTION: May -MR. STEWART: So - so - and indeed, this suit at the outset included a request for injunctive relief against further disclosures, and the Government settled that part of the case with lightning speed. There was - the - the plaintiff did obtain a judicial order directing the Government not to continue with its practice.QUESTION: So indeed there's - there - there's nothing bizarre about letting him get into court just on the basis of - of an adverse effect, because he can win in court on the basis of an adverse effect, not by reason of this act alone, but by reason of the obligations under this Act plus the APA.￼mean, one that seemMR. STEWART: That's correct.QUESTION: Right.QUESTION: May I - may I go to another issue? I of things that's bothering us is several issues crucial, which we're just having to make40, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425assumptions about here, and depending on the assumptions, the scope of liability may - may be enormous.Here's the one that is bothering me. The - the Government is not contesting here that in fact there - there was some kind of actual damage, even though it was not quantified.MR. STEWART: No, I think we are contesting that.QUESTION: Well, I - but - but you're not contestingthefact-letmeputit-I-Imisspoke- you're not contesting the fact that if he showed emotional damage and emotional damage alone, no physical effects, that that would be enough for recovery if - if a fact- finder said, well, I think the emotional damage is worth $250 -MR. STEWART: No, no. We - we are contesting that and -QUESTION: You are contesting that?MR. STEWART: It hasn't really been - QUESTION: Are - may - may I ask you just afurther question, then you can tell me which - whatever you want. Are you contesting as a matter of law the sufficiency of this plaintiff's testimony to at least get to the fact-finder on whether there was actual damage? He testified - I forget his exact words - but he testified, you know, I was so upset when I heard that they had41, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425released my Social Security number, I just didn't know what to do or what to say, something like that. Are you contesting the sufficiency of that evidence to put an issue of actual damage to the fact-finder?MR. STEWART: Yes, and let me backtrack for a second to say that the Fourth Circuit decided that Mr. Doe had not proved actual damages, and the petitioner did not seek this Court's review of that holding, so -QUESTION: But they said he didn't prove actual damages because there was no physical effect.MR. STEWART: That - that's right. There was -QUESTION: They didn't say that, as a matter of law, if you don't have the emotional physical effect rule, he wouldn't have had enough to - to get to the fact-finder an actual damage.MR. STEWART: That - that's correct. My - my only point was, the reason we haven't briefed the question of whether there were in fact actual damages is that our understanding is that, because petitioner didn't seek this Court's review of that aspect of the - the court of appeals' holding, as the case comes to the Court, we're assuming that there were no actual damages.QUESTION: And you didn't - you didn't cross?MR. STEWART: But - but to answer your - your question about what the Government's position on the law42, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 is, our - our first argument is that in the context of2 this specific statute, the phrase actual damages refers3 only to pecuniary harm, and we've cited in a footnote a4 conflict among the circuits with respect to that question,5 and that - that isn't presented by this case.6 QUESTION: Okay.7 MR. STEWART: But we would -8 QUESTION: Mr. Stewart, may I ask you a question9 with respect to that? Suppose this Doe said, I'm very10 concerned about the impact of this on my credit rating, so11 I'm going to spend $10 to a12 company to find out whether13 identity, $10. Would there14 statute for actual damages?15 MR. STEWART: I mean, there - there would be a16 question of whether that was - whether there was17 causation, whether that was a reasonable response to the18 threat, but in theory, an expense like that could qualify19 as pecuniary harm and, thus, is actual damages.20 QUESTION: But it made - it made me think that if21 there's ambiguity in this statute, that wouldn't have made22 much sense for Congress to write a statute like this23 where, to meet the actual damage requirement, all you have24 to do is make a $10 expense.25 MR. STEWART: I mean, I agree that it's a43, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005credit - credit reporting there's been any theft of my then be a claim under this￼1 somewhat anomalous result that the availability of the2 thousand can turn on a relatively small pecuniary loss.3 It's - it's somewhat analogous at least to the common law4 rule that punitive damages are available only to a5 plaintiff who's shown some level of compensatory damages,6 and there also a plaintiff might be able to contrive a7 small loss that is compensable, and thereby make himself8 eligible for punitive damages that far exceed the amount9 of-10 QUESTION: But it's not just not contrived,11 because now it's a formula for - for all the people who12 have this kind of complaint, so I think if that's what -13 what the line is, then Mr. Doe, is it, all the future Mr.14 Does will ask to have their credit checked.15 MR. STEWART: I mean, we would still want to - we16 would still have to know whether that was in fact a17 reasonable response to what the Government had did - done18 - and what the - the threat that it posed to the - the19 plaintiff. And even if that kind of machination might be20 possible in in one category of cases, it would still not21 be possible in a lot of other categories of potential - of22 Privacy Act violations.￼2324 question,25 emotionalTo continue with my answer to Justice Souter's the - the second thing we would say about the injury is that, even if some emotional harms44, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 200051 were compensable as actual damages under the statute, we2 don't think that the particular emotional harm alleged3 here would be, because a Social Security number, unlike,4 for instance, intimate details about a person's family5 life, is not inherently private or secret or confidential.6 It's not the sort of information that would cause a person7 to say, I would be horrified to think that somebody else8 knew that even if I could be sure that that person wasn't9 going to misuse it against me.10 The - the reason that people are worried about11 release of Social Security numbers is that that release12 may lead to some further, more tangible harm, identify13 theft or -14 QUESTION: So you're saying as a matter of law,15 this is just what he testified to is simply too de minimis16 to be considered evidence -17 MR. STEWART: That -18 QUESTION: - sufficient evidence.19 MR. STEWART: That's correct. And we've cited20 the Metro-North case in our brief, and I think that the21 harm - the emotional harm that he's alleged is really -22 really very similar to the fear of cancer as a result of23 asbestos exposure that was held not to be compensable in24 the absence of some current physical impairment.25 So to - to - follow up on this and make our45, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 position absolutely clear, we are saying that if the term2 adverse effect is given its usual meaning, and every3 plaintiff who establishes an adverse effect from a willful4 or intentional violation is entitled to $1,000, that the5 potential financial consequences would be enormous. Now,6 I would say in all candor that if we lose this case, it's7 quite possible that the Government would argue in the8 lower courts that to protect the public fisc, the - the9 phrase adverse effect should be given a narrower10 construction under this statute than under the APA. But11 our basic point is -12 QUESTION: May I ask, with respect to the parade13 of horribles that we're confronted with, is I - it's my14 understanding that there are several other statutes under15 entirely different statutes, they have the similar16 provision but they're clearly worded in a way that says,17 if you get anything, you'll get the minimum, and - but18 it's the position that your opponent contends is the19 proper reading of that statute. There are several such20 statutes, am I -21 MR. STEWART: There are a lot of statutes with22 wording, for instance, to the effect of a plaintiff who23 establishes a violation will receive actual damages or24 $1,000, whichever is greater. Most of those don't apply25 to suits against the United States -46, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425QUESTION: And - and -MR. STEWART: - but there are many such laws. QUESTION: And most of those would not requireproof of actual damages?MR. STEWART: That's correct. Under the plainterms of the statute, the plaintiff would get the 1,000 - QUESTION: Why in your view did Congress come up with a different formula in this case than it has in that- in the pattern of statutes that those represent?MR. STEWART: I'm - part of it may be that most of those statutes are not dealing with suits against theUnited States, and Congress may be more protective of the public fisc, and part of it is the - the legislative debates reveal that Congress considered a variety of potential damages provisions, some of which were more generous than the one that was ultimately enacted, some of them less generous. For instance, the more generous provisions -QUESTION: But this statute is unique, is it not?MR. STEWART: It's not quite unique. I believe there are a couple of other provisions that use the phrase, person entitled to recovery, and that phrase has not been authoritatively construed by this Court, so those - interpretation of those statutes would raise the same question this one does.47, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼12 start out 34 words are5 whichever6 $1,000 is7 recovery,8 statutes compels the conclusion that $1,000 will be9 awardable regardless of actual damages.QUESTION: But there's a number of them that with actual damages.MR. STEWART: And - and sometimes, again, theto the effect of actual damages or $1,000,is greater. And because the availability of the not limited to a, quote, person entitled to unquote, the plain language of many of those10 QUESTION: Now, there was an interpretation -11 Congress told OMB to do interpretive guides, and it did,12 and it - and it gave it the meaning that this plaintiff13 gives it. It's - it read the statute - didn't - wasn't14 that what OMB said? Wasn't that their contemporaneous -15 MR. STEWART: I mean, I think the more - I think16 you're right that the more natural reading - the OMB17 guideline didn't address in terms the situation where a18 plaintiff shows no actual damages but nevertheless claims19 the thousand, but the OMB guideline did say, a person who20 suffers an adverse effect from a willful or an intention21 violation shall receive a 1,000 - actual damages or22 $1,000, whichever is greater.23 QUESTION: It said actual damages or 1,000. As I24 understood the - that original interpretation, it was the25 reading that the plaintiff is putting forward here and48, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 your response to it in your brief seemed to be that was a2 wrong interpretation because it didn't take account of3 sovereign immunity or saving the sovereign fisc and an4 official at OMB said it was wrong and it's not - no longer5 effective.6 MR. STEWART: I mean, I think if - if plaintiffs7 are using the OMB interpretation to establish the point8 that intelligent people can read the statute the way that9 they did, I - I think it's validly used for that purpose.10 But the OMB guideline is not entitled to deference, as the11 Court held in Adams Fruit, a statutory provision that is12 to administered solely by the courts is not one as to13 which the Court will defer to administrative14 interpretations. The - the OMB -15 QUESTION: But didn't - didn't Congress designate16 OMB to - to these guides?17 MR. STEWART: Congress designated OMB, but it's -18 the particular provision that is at - specifically at19 issue is reprinted at page 13a to the appendix to the20 Government's brief. And it says, the director of the21 Office of Management and Budget shall develop and, after22 notice and opportunity for public comment, prescribe23 guidelines and regulations for the use of agencies in24 implementing the provisions of this section.25 So the only specific directive that OMB had was49, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910111213141516171819202122232425to instruct or direct agencies as to their substantive obligations under the act. Now, in the course of doing that, it was entirely appropriate for OMB to go further and offer its view to the agencies as to what consequences would follow if they breached their substantive obligations, but that wasn't a task that was specifically entrusted to OMB by statute, so I don't think there's any basis for inferring that Congress -QUESTION: I see. You're - you're saying that - that it - it was meant just to tell the agencies what youhave to do to comply with the act. MR. STEWART: Exactly.QUESTION: Yeah, that - that's probably the best reading of it.MR. STEWART: Exactly.QUESTION: Yeah.MR. STEWART: So the - the last - the last point I wanted to make is, it might be possible, if - if we lost this case, it might be possible to mitigate the financial consequences to the Government by giving the term adverse effect a narrow construction, but our - our view is, if the consequence of adopting plaintiff's reading of the phrase person entitled to recovery is that an established term of art like adverse effect has to be construed in other than its normal manner in order to make the statute50, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 make sense, there's something wrong with plaintiff's2 reading.3 QUESTION: But why - why do you say that?4 Because, see, the adverse effect part governs people who5 don't even want damages. I mean, it - it's to get into6 court, it's just to get into court, bring the suit, isn't7 it?8 MR. STEWART: Right.9 QUESTION: So - so I would have thought that your10 - your reaction - I just want you to clarify this - would11 be, if they win this case, then the reaction would be to12 go back and say, all right, if we're going to give $1,00013 to people who really are just feeling bad about what14 happened, we've got to give them all $1,000, well, it's15 only in circumstances where the agency really did16 something quite wrong. And so you'll read that17 intentional or willful requirement toughly, not - not the18 adverse effect part tough. I mean, why - why wouldn't19 that be the reaction?20 MR. STEWART: I mean, I guess if - if this - if21 this Court held that the phrase intentional or willful was22 limited to situations -23 QUESTION: I don't see - yeah?24 MR. STEWART: If it - if it was limited to25 situations in which the Government set out to violate an51, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 individual's rights under the Privacy Act, that - that2 would be another way at least of -34 we should5 certainly6 78 suppose I9 right on the basis of that assumption, and then in theQUESTION: Yeah, yeah, and then you'd say, well, assume that's what happened here, though. It didn't -MR. STEWART: I - I mean -QUESTION: - but we should assume that. Now, assume that, and then I decide that they're10 next case it turns out my assumption happened to be quite11 wrong because Congress had a broad intent there. Now what12 happens?13 MR. STEWART: I mean, even under the narrowest14 possible interpretation of what intentional or willful￼15 means, you could have hypotheticals16 form that left off the U.S.C. cite,17 hope those things would happen very18 highly unlikely that Congress would19 the hundred thousand people who put20 the form to get $1,000. Thank you.21 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Stewart.22 Mr. Campbell, you have five minutes remaining.23 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MR. JACK W. CAMPBELL, IV24 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER25 MR. CAMPBELL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.52, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005like the one with the and again, we - we rarely, but it seems have wanted each of on - information on1 Justice Kennedy, I'd like to address my first2 point to you, because I - I think you put your finger on3 one of the number of - of absurd results, or difficult-4 to-swallow results that flow from accepting the5 Government's interpretation. The Government's essential6 contention here is that quantification of actual damages7 is an essential element of a Privacy Act claim, but boy,8 what a strange way to write the statute if that's what9 Congress intended.10 The - the relative language is reproduced at11 pages 3 and 4 of petitioner's brief, and it says that12 whenever an agency fails to comply with any other13 provision of this section, and I'm going to ellipsis, in14 such a way as to have an adverse effect on an individual,15 the individual may bring a civil action against the16 agency, and I'm putting another ellipsis there. You then17 go to subsection (g)(4), which states that if that adverse18 effect was the result of an intentional or willful19 violation, then the Government, the United States shall be20 liable, in the sum - in an amount equal to the sum of.21 Liability is established once those three22 prerequisites are met. All that is left at that point is23 an exercise of arithmetic. It would be a very strange24 statute that says the United States shall be liable in the25 sum of the following amounts you are to add up, and that53, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 amount would be zero. And, in fact, that would never be2 the case. Costs are always available to a Privacy Act3 plaintiff who establishes an adverse effect caused by an4 intentional or willful violation of the act.5 So there are certainly going to be at least some6 recovery. There's no qualification of the costs award7 with reasonableness of precondition of actual damages. So8 some - there is going to be a recovery in those cases.9 Now, if that's the only recovery that's available, it's a10 very - it's, one, a very strange statute, and number two,11 a statute that arguably is unconstitutional. But you12 don't need to read it that way, because the natural13 reading is, as was pointed out in the argument, that, yes,14 Congress did anticipate precisely this issue, that privacy15 invasions very typically result in emotional harms that16 inherently are not quantifiable, and Congress didn't17 intend, I can't imagine, to - to make the line of recovery18 turn on whether you can prove that you put 37 - a 37-cent19 stamp on an - on an envelope to get your credit report or20 pay the $10 fee. That's a very arbitrary line. Why would21 Congress be solicitous of people who suffer the same harm22 - be solicitous of the one who put a stamp on an envelope?23 That's a nonsensical.24 Moreover, it reduces any efficiency savings that25 are realized under the act as Congress intended by saying,54, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1- Washington, DC 20005￼1 look, we're not going to get into those sorts of proof2 issues. If you have an emotional distress and it's3 typical, it's caused by the intentional violation, we4 don't go through that. You get your damages of $1,000 and5 let's not go through the proof. That's a very natural6 reading of the act.7 But the Government - the Government is asking8 you to adopt a - an interpretation that has a number of9 additional problems. It renders the adverse effect10 requirement superfluous. Proof of actual damages will11 necessarily in every case require proof of an actual harm12 and causation. So even the attempt by the Government to13 place a - a meaning on the adverse effect requirement must14 fail. Again, it turns the shall language into may, or at15 best, renders shall illusory, because the sum would be16 zero in much cases.17 QUESTION: As to your point about the - the18 costs. You don't get costs unless, it says the court may19 assess reasonable attorneys' fees and other litigation20 costs reasonably incurred in any case in which the21 complainant has substantially prevailed. And I assume22 that when later on they - they say the costs of the action23 together with reasonable attorneys' fees as determined by24 the court, they're referring back to the court has allowed25 those - those costs and fees, because he has substantially55, Inc.1111 14th Street, N.W.

I - areyou referring to the language that's in (g)(2) and (g)(3) of the statute?QUESTION: Yes, I am.MR. STEWART: (g)(2) and (g)(3) are entirely different causes of actions. Those deal with requests for injunctive relief, and this is the only type of injunctive relief under the Privacy Act, injunctive relief for access to files or correction of files. Those are separatecauses of action. In fact, I submit, Justice QUESTION: I see. I see what you're MR. STEWART: - that the contrast inbetween (g)(2) and (g)(3) -QUESTION: I see what you're saying.MR.
